Luxurious beaches, developed tourist infrastructure, fun nightlife attract guests from different parts of our planet.  An incredible number of historical monuments and stunning landscapes do not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Exotic Puerto Rico, the sights of which fully reflect its diversity, is located in the heart of the Caribbean.  The state with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã13.7 thousand km <sup>2</sup> consists of one huge island and a large number of tiny islets.  In the north they are washed by the Atlantic Ocean, and in the south by the Caribbean Sea. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.220833" data-lng="-66.590149" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/4/3/4643.png"></div><h2>  Interesting facts about a paradise </h2><p>  Puerto Rico was originally owned by the Taino Indians.  Before the arrival of Christopher Columbus on the island in 1493, there was a developed civilization, about which modern scientists know too little.  After the start of Spanish colonization, the indigenous people became extinct in several decades.  The Netherlands, France, and Great Britain fought for a tidbit in the Caribbean.  Now the country, whose name in Spanish sounds like ‚Äúrich port‚Äù, is under the control of the United States, but is not their administrative unit.  The island has a legislative and executive branch of government, as well as its own constitution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About four million people live here, and every year about two million tourists rush to rest here.  More than 70% of the population are creoles - descendants of immigrants from Spain.  What language is spoken in Puerto Rico?  Locals speak Spanish and are fluent in English, which is required to be studied at school.  True, only not more than one hundred thousand inhabitants consider him to be his own. </p><h2>  Miraculous masterpieces </h2><p>  The nature of Puerto Rico is simply amazing!  The picturesque coasts, fantastic looking canyons, emerald lagoons, mysterious caves and majestic mountains are a delight for vacationers.  And dense tropical forests are the pride of an <span>exotic country.</span>  The natural features of the island, where coastal greenery merges into a single whole with the heavenly blue, are also motley, as well as its national composition. </p><h2>  Amazing cave world </h2><p>  In the northwest of the country, in the natural park The Parque de las Cavernas del Rio Camuy, there is an extensive network of caves.  Rio Kamui is a mysterious underworld, formed 45 million years ago.  Of the 800 halls, no more than 200 have been investigated so far, but a small part of them is available for tourists.  The miraculous miracle, which has not yet revealed to mankind all its secrets, impresses with its beauty and size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interesant3.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amazing cave world" class="if uuid-2559300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559300.jpg"></div><p>  Sunlight hardly penetrates the mysterious grottoes 200 meters high and about 130 meters deep, and a completely different world opens up in the underworld.  Specialists have discovered rare species of blind fish that live in underground lakes, and bizarre karst formations resemble alien landscapes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As recognized by tourists who descended underground after the bright tropics, they felt the magic of a unique corner with a mystical aura.  This is a real immersion in another dimension. </p><h2>  Bioluminescent Bays </h2><p>  The natural attractions of Puerto Rico surprise not only tourists, but also scientists.  Three bays (Mosquito, La Parguera and Laguna Grande) glorified the country throughout the world.  Bioluminescent reservoirs, in which the concentration of microorganisms is high, surprised Spaniards on the island.  The missionaries, who for the first time in their lives saw how the water glows in the dark, considered it to be the machinations of the devil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="furthermore.equinox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colorful Puerto Rico" class="if uuid-2559289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559289.jpg"></div><p>  Dinoflagellates are unicellular algae that possess a special enzyme that "turns on" in water at night.  Colored illumination fascinates tourists who unwittingly contribute to the destruction of microorganisms that are very sensitive to chemicals, including sunblock and deodorants. </p><h2>  Turtle Island </h2><p>  The tiny uninhabited island of Culebrita, famous for its peaceful atmosphere, immerses in natural comfort.  But not only the white sand beach delights vacationers with exotic beauty.  Tropical paradise was chosen by sea turtles, ashore, to soak up the rays of the gentle sun and lay eggs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turtle Island" class="if uuid-2559315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559315.jpg"></div><p>  Nicknamed the "Turtle Island", Culebrita offers to admire the underwater scenery and watch the other inhabitants - exotic birds, whose singing relaxes. </p><h2>  State capital </h2><p>  The picturesque Puerto Rico, the sights of which allow not only to have fun, but also to spend time to good use, are loved by lovers of relaxed relaxation and lovers of architectural masterpieces.  Numerous monuments, combining many different cultures from different continents, transmit the energy of the colonial time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minitime.com" data-author=": Michelle Rae Uy, "><img itemprop="image" alt="San Juan Old Town" class="if uuid-2559321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559321.jpg"></div><p>  Of great interest to tourists is the capital of a freely associated state, named after St. John the Baptist, San Juan.  It is the largest cultural, historical and political center of Puerto Rico.  This open-air museum is famous throughout the world for its architectural works.  The old part of the city, where colorful houses are built in a colonial style, and the narrow streets paved with paving stones more closely resemble Spain, delight tourists. </p><h2>  Ancient fortress </h2><p>  Fans of historical monuments must go to the old city of San Juan, where the castle of Castillo de San Felipe del Morro rises.  The defensive fortress appeared in those days when the Spaniards captured the island and wanted to defend themselves against invaders from other countries trying to take it away.  The powerful building, named after the king of Spain, has undergone numerous reconstructions for a long time.  Protected by UNESCO, it is perfectly preserved and attracts with amazing landscapes of the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="langkasa-norul.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle of Castillo de San Felipe del Morro." class="if uuid-2559372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559372.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The magnificent beaches of Puerto Rico, which can be called its main attractions, amaze with its beauty: slender palm trees grow directly from the sand, which looks very unusual.  The water here is clear, and the bottom is shallow, with a slight slope, and you can safely let the kids go swimming. </p><p>  Tourists love the beaches on the island of Vieques, and the most popular is the well-equipped Sun Bay, while Secret Beach is ideal for those who seek privacy.  Flamenco on the island of Culebra is a favorite vacation spot for families with small children, because during high tide the water does not rise much.  I must say that everywhere guests will find excellent service, and there are always <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and shops near the beaches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.puertoricogetaways.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of puerto rico" class="if uuid-2559329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559329.jpg"></div><p>  But it is not recommended to go into the open sea, since brave swimmers are waiting for strong currents and dangerous predators. </p><h2>  Arecibo Astronomical Observatory </h2><p>  What to see in Puerto Rico yet?  When it comes to modern sights of the island, one cannot but mention the Arecibo Astronomical Observatory, located 15 kilometers from the town of the same name.  The spherical radio telescope used to study the solar system is considered the largest in the world: its antenna diameter is 305 meters.  Reminiscent of a huge bowl, which is dug to the top of the mountain, it consists of 39 thousand aluminum panels that reflect radio waves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="phenomena.nationalgeographic.com" data-author=": Nadia Drake, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arecibo Astronomical Observatory" class="if uuid-2559336" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2559336.jpg"></div><p>  With it, scientists learned a lot about the upper atmosphere and space, and some discoveries were even awarded the Nobel Prize. </p><h2>  Gallery of the famous artist </h2><p>  Lovers of modern art should visit another attraction of Puerto Rico - Alicia Sotomayor's private gallery, located in the capital of the country.  A unique artist, who has mastered the technique of watercolor painting, teaches in the walls of her studio.  Her realistic works are distinguished by bright colors and make a lasting impression on visitors.  Touching the beautiful is very simple - just pre-arrange a visit to the gallery. </p><p>  Puerto Rico is a small island that can be reached by car in 1 day.  Rest in a paradise is a fascinating adventure that allows you to replenish your luggage with an unforgettable experience. </p>
