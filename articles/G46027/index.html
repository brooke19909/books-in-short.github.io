    <p>  Locking a card (Sberbank) over the phone is a good method, but some do not trust him.  Therefore, they come personally to the office of a financial organization (the nearest one is suitable) and write a statement. </p><p>  The algorithm of actions will be approximately as follows: </p><ol><li>  The client collects a list of documents.  An identity card (namely a civil passport) is sufficient.  But it is better to have with you an agreement that was concluded when issuing plastic. </li><li>  The cardholder finds the nearest Sberbank branch and comes with an identification card there.  It is not at all necessary to visit the very branch in which the plastic was originally ordered. </li><li>  An application for blocking a card is written.  An employee of the department should be informed of his desire.  He will issue a form of the established sample, which the client fills out and gives for processing. </li><li>  Wait for an SMS message (not always) about a successful card blocking.  It is worth noting that no confirmation of the operation is required.  That is, if the SMS contains instructions such as "send a reply SMS" and so on, you must ignore the instructions. </li></ol><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to block a Sberbank card in case of loss.  But this is only one way.  There are several more options.  What information is worth knowing before, for example, blocking plastic using a telephone?  For example, be aware of how a similar operation takes place in Sberbank Online. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the said bank does everything for the convenience of serving its customers.  Not everyone likes to come to the office personally and write a blocking application.  That is why the population is thinking about self-care.  Card lock (Sberbank) by phone or the Internet - these are the most common ways. </p><p>  First, you should consider working with the Sberbank Online service.  A modern and relatively simple way for those who find it easier to work with the Internet, rather than with the phone.  How does blocking happen? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to block a sberbank card in case of loss" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460155.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In order to use the Sberbank Online service, you will have to follow this algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the Sberbank Online service.  The user must have a username and password. </li><li>  Confirm Login.  A secret verification code will be sent to the mobile device attached to the card. </li><li>  In the window that appears, go to the "Maps" section.  Near the desired plastic, select "Operations". </li><li>  Among the proposed functions, select "Lock".  Next, the action is confirmed by mobile phone - SMS will come to it, as with authorization in the system. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how the card is blocked (Sberbank).  By phone or through the Mobile Bank, this operation takes even less time.  Therefore, it is worth considering these methods.  They are most often in demand in practice. </p><h2>  Information to block </h2><p>  But first, you have to figure out a few important nuances.  Especially if you plan to use the "Mobile Bank" to implement the idea.  What data can be useful to the user? </p><p>  The first thing is the phone of Sberbank.  To block a bank card, it is recommended to contact the organization‚Äôs hotline.  The number 8 800 555-55-50 will help here.  You can call specific departments, but, as practice shows, usually the population is redirected to the "hot line". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank phone to block a bank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460153.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the Sberbank card is to be blocked via a mobile phone ("Mobile Bank"), several commands will have to be taken into account.  The user will have to explain why the operation occurs.  There are several numbers for this.  They indicate actions.  So, 1 is theft, 0 is the loss, 2 is the plastic remained in the ATM, 3 is the other. </p><p>  Perhaps this is all.  Now you can take a closer look at the 2 most simple and common methods of locking plastic.  There is nothing difficult or special in the procedures. </p><h2>  By phone </h2><p>  Card blocking (Sberbank) by phone is a very common process.  Especially if the plastic has been lost or stolen.  As practice shows, it is this scenario that is most in demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card blocking via mobile phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460156.jpg"></div>

The necessary combination has already been given earlier.  As soon as the beeps go, wait for an answer. </li><li>  Tell the operator about your idea.  You will also have to name your passport details.  They can request the last 4 digits of the card or a special secret word. </li><li>  Wait for request processing.  A message should be received on the phone, in which it will be written about the successful blocking of bank plastic. </li></ol><p>  This completes the whole process.  In some cases, the operator may ask why a lock is required.  The requested information must be reported. </p><h2>  "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  The latest scenario is working with Sberbank's Mobile Bank.  This is another way of self-service.  How to block a Sberbank card by phone?  You can dial a certain combination that will help to realize the idea. </p><p>  The algorithm of actions is approximately the following: </p><ol><li>  The user forms a message in which he writes: "LOCK", and then the last 4 digits of the card.  After a space from the inscription, you will have to put a code indicating the reason for the operation. </li><li>  The generated letter is sent to number 900. </li><li>  After processing the operation, a response from the system will come.  The message will contain a code of 6 characters.  It needs to be dialed for confirmation. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to block a Sberbank card by phone.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  From now on, all methods of blocking a Sberbank card are clear.  Not so hard as it seems.
