Geographically from Astrakhan, the settlement is removed 35 kilometers to the south.  As of the current year, 16,077 people live here. </p><p>  The city has two unique attractions: the Russian Watermelon Museum and the church. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  It is believed that the name came from the Turkic language and is translated into Russian as “reed terrain”.  The area where the city of Kamyzyak is located has a convenient location for fishing, therefore, people engaged in this fishing mainly live here.  Initially, as early as 1560, a settlement was formed around a fishing school.  Already in the XVII century, Alexei Mikhailovich granted these lands to Prince Kurakin.  Then they were settled by exiles, who, in fact, were engaged in fishing. </p><p>  The Kurakin family was engaged in fishing on an industrial scale, and these places were called the “Golden Bottom”.  In 1568, the Trinity Monastery was erected in the settlement, which in 1646 was granted these lands.  In 1860, the uchug on the Kamyzyak River was dismantled so that ships could pass freely to the sea here, but the settlement remained in its former place. </p><p>  In the XIX century, social infrastructure facilities (schools, a parish school) were rebuilt here, and fishermen are still engaged in their fishing.  There is already a brick factory and manufactory shops.  Only in 1973 did the town receive city status. </p><h2>  Climatic and geographical features </h2><p>  <span>The Caspian lowland</span> is the area where the city of Kamyzyak is located.  The territorial settlement is located in the southern part of the Astrakhan region.  The average annual temperature here is 11 degrees.  The area itself is located on the main part of the Volga delta.  Almost the entire territory is "cut" by the ducts and arms of the reservoir.  The largest artery of the Volga is the Kamyzyak River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Museum </h2><p>  The newest attraction in Kamyzyak is the Russian Watermelon Museum, opened only in 2006.  The idea of ​​creating such an exhibition appeared in 2005, when the Astrakhan region was recognized as the center of the Russian watermelon.  Employees of the local research institute of irrigated vegetable growing and melon growing came to the local authorities with a proposal.  Governor A. Zhilkin supported the initiative.  However, there was not enough money to open the whole museum in the assembly hall of the institute, so it works in the exhibition version.  A visit involves not only examining the exposition, but also tasting several varieties of watermelon.  The address where there is: the city of Kamyzyak, Lyubich street, 16. </p>

    <h2>  Church </h2><p>  The Smolensk Icon of the Mother of God is the third in the list of the most revered icons in Russia after Vladimir and Kazan. </p><p>  In the city of Kamyzyak, the parish was opened only in 1992, initially in the evening school building.  The Soviet authorities destroyed the old temple in the 30s of the last century.  Only the foundation remained of him.  Only in 1997, the rector managed to “knock out” financing for the construction, but the 1998 default did not allow him to finish it.  Everything was “frozen” for several years. Work resumed in 2000, and the new church opened its doors to parishioners in 2006. Many rare icons were collected inside, some were even donated from Western Ukraine. The church is one of the main attractions Where is it located? City Kamyzyak, Krasnaya Embankment, 24a. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Cheerful and resourceful locals </h2><p>  Only thanks to the KVN team, the city of Kamyzyak became known throughout Russia.  Members of the group managed to reach the final and become champions of the season in 2015. </p><p>  For the first time, the team performed in 2009 at the Sochi festival.  Some participants previously played in the Astrakhan team, these are Renat Mukhambaev, Azamat Musagaliev. </p><p>  The team became famous primarily for its socially oriented numbers, and recognition came after a performance dedicated to the mayor of Kamyzyak.  At that time, Oleg Nikulik held the post, who already managed to become famous in the region with his creative ideas and appeals.  For example, he invited local residents to participate in the repair of roads and social housing.  By the way, in September 2013, an official resigns, which is accepted on the council of deputies, with the wording “of his own free will”.  It is impossible to say unequivocally what was the reason: it was the number of the KVN team, fatigue or recognition of one's own impotence. </p><p>  By the way, before taking office as mayor of Kamyzyak, Oleg quite successfully bred ostriches on the farm. </p>

    <h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  Not far from the city, in the village of Ivanchug, there is a zoo or, more precisely, the center of family leisure “Baba Frosya”.  Today it is 2 hectares of land with more than 100 species of exotic animals.  The center has an aquazone, which operates in the summer season. </p><p>  Naturally, the focus is on cells with ostriches.  This is due to the fact that until 2011 they were breeding black African ostriches.  It was in that year that the decision was made to create a zoo, and it all started with exotic birds and several artiodactyls.  Over the years, many new aviaries have been built, exotic fauna representatives from around the world have been acquired.  Some animals came here by chance, including discarded wild animals, wounded birds and ordinary pets, which were no longer needed by their owners. </p><p>  There is a large exotarium on the territory where snakes, spiders and lizards live, even a Siamese crocodile.  The zoo got its name only because everything is at home here, like the "woman Frosi". </p>
