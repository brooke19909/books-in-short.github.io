    <p>  The provision by civil law of their subjects the opportunity to participate in a variety of relationships is due only to the establishment of special boundaries.  At the same time, one of the determining factors for designating such a framework <span>is the objects of civil rights.</span>  But what are they? </p><p>  The concept and types of objects of civil rights cause not only scientific interest.  Their practical significance is great, due to the fact that in the modern world <span>economic interests</span> play one of the leading roles.  And, therefore, it is worthwhile to understand how the regulation of the regime of objects of civil rights is carried out. </p><p>  <strong>The concept and types of civil rights</strong> </p><p>  If we talk about what an object of civil law is, it should be said first that this is a blessing, regardless of whether it is tangible or intangible.  Therefore, the remark is true that the diversity of species is built on the basis of the main features that are endowed with civil rights.  And they are: </p><p>  - the result of activity, regardless of a person or other forms; </p><p>  - they are always subject to the legal regulation established by the legislation of the country. </p><p>  Therefore, two object classifications are provided: </p><p>  1. By involvement in civil circulation - fully involved (for example, household goods), partially involved (narcotic substances or weapons) and completely excluded <span>(nuclear weapons).</span> </p><p>  2. By their nature - things, works and services, property rights and intangible benefits. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in relation to each species, its own special <span>legal regime is established,</span> which will be discussed below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Types of civil rights</strong> </p><p>  The main classification of the above today is recognized as the second.  This is explained by the fact that it is precisely these types of objects of civil rights that are most often used in practice, both business and legal.  And the biggest subgroup here is things. </p><p>  According to legal science, under them should be understood only material phenomena.  At the same time, things can appear both in their pristine condition, and processed by a person for their own needs.  It is worth noting that the first classification presented in this article refers to things according to the degree of involvement in civil circulation.  Like the objects themselves, things also have other subspecies, which include the division into: </p><p>  - immovable (land, buildings, ponds) and movable; </p><p>  - indivisible (the separation of which may lead to a deterioration in quality or rendering it unusable) and divisible; </p><p>  - defined by generic characteristics (vegetables, cars) and individually defined (painting by Aivazovsky); </p><p>  - simple and complex (the latter lose their purpose when any part is disabled).  A striking example is the enterprise as a property complex; </p><p>  - non-consumable (vehicles) and consumed (food, raw materials for heating); </p><p>  - affiliation and the main thing - for example, a car and a tire; </p><p>  - separation by qualitative characteristics - products, natural resources, animals and money (as well as securities) </p><p>  But the objects of civil rights contain two more groups, one of which is work and services.  Unlike things, distinguishing them is not always possible.  The division is carried out only on one basis: in what form is the final result presented - tangible (work) or intangible (service). </p><p>  The last basic type of objects of civil rights are <span>intangible goods.</span>  Hypothetically, they are divided into 2 large subgroups - the benefits associated with the individual, and the benefits arising from <span>intellectual activity.</span>  The first subgroup includes basic natural human rights, and the second - objects of the rights of authors, industrial property and other institutions related to <span>intellectual property</span> law <span>.</span>  Here a fair remark will be made that this category of objects has increased protection that goes beyond the scope of civil law. </p><p>  Thus, knowledge of the theory of what constitute specific objects of civil rights contributes to their effective legitimate involvement in economic and social circulation. </p>
