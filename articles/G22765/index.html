This does not mean that they do not provide other services - it‚Äôs just that in some areas these structures are more active due to their wide client base, groundwork, and practical work experience. </p><p>  Just about one of these institutions we will talk in this article. </p><p>  It is about Plus Bank (Moscow).  This is an office that provides various banking services, while specializing in car loans.  This is clearly confirmed by the statistics expressed in the ratings and ratings of the bank.  About all this, as well as about the quality of service, tariffs and options that Plus Bank offers its customers;  addresses and phone numbers of the main offices - all this you will find in our article. </p><p>  In the process of preparing the material, we used customer reviews, as well as general information about what this structure is. </p><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  We will traditionally begin with a historical background about what this bank is and what its origin is.  This is important if only because the historical retrospective, the past of the bank and its reputation, on which all future relations are based, play a large role in this business segment.  After all, no one will trust their funds to an institution with a dubious history.  Therefore, we find out how Plus Bank was formed.  We will verify its reliability a little further, using data on assets and reviews about it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the bank begins back in 1990, when a commercial bank under the name ‚ÄúOmsky‚Äù was launched on the basis of the Soviet Zhilsotsbank (more precisely, only in its central branch).  The name of the institution was changed twice more.  As practice shows, this is a normal occurrence in the banking market.  In 2004, it was called Omsk Bank.  At the same time, changes were also made in the structure of the owners of the organization (these processes are ongoing now).  Since 2010, the government decided to disown the name of the city in the name of the bank and called it ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù. </p><p>  It is easy to guess that initially for Plus <span>Bank St. Petersburg</span> or the capital was not a ‚Äúnative‚Äù city: the first branch was founded in Omsk.  After the structure became more significant and expanded geographically, it was decided to create a central office in the capital (therefore, Plus Bank now has this address: Moscow, 7 Izvestkovy pereulok).  The branch located here is considered the main since 2014. </p><h2>  Ratings </h2>

    <p>  Today, the institution is a member of various ratings, which is proudly announced on the pages of its website.  There is even a special section listing all the titles and awards that Plus Bank has been awarded.  The rating, as you know, can also be different: we will start with the online rating service from Banks.  It is indicated here that the bank gained only about a quarter of the positive votes, which is why it can be found in the ‚Äúnational‚Äù rating only in the first league. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about indicators such as the total number of assets, then by this criterion the institution is in 158th place across Russia (and 104th in Omsk) with an indicator of 26 billion.  As for the net profit collected for 2015, Plus Bank (its branches are located in 7 regions of the Russian Federation) was able to earn about 111 million rubles.  According to some other parameters, the institution has taken more advantageous places in the ratings. </p><p>  For example, take at least deposits made by individuals at Plus Bank.  According to official information, they amount to about 19 billion rubles.  This is the 92nd place in Russia and 62nd in Omsk, which increases the bank's reputation in the services market.  The loan portfolio here is also significant - about 116th place in Russia with a figure of 20 billion. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the institution is close to the first ‚Äúhundred‚Äù banks of the Russian Federation, which is an excellent feature for the regional center, from which it all began. </p><h2>  Services </h2>

    <p>  According to the description from the official page, the option ‚ÄúCar loan‚Äù prevails in the institution‚Äôs banking portfolio.  Without a contribution and with an initial payment, the maximum amount of up to 4.5 million rubles, for a period of up to 7 years (these are general indicators, they vary depending on the tariff at which the client is served).  In addition, Plus Bank (St. Petersburg) also provides other services.  In particular, this includes classic home loans for banks and consumer loans, deposits, and business services.  We will talk more about them later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Let us clarify that the service is provided by the bank on the basis of separation according to the legal status of the client.  Thus, there are services for individuals and legal entities. </p><h2>  Private clients </h2><p>  So, let's start with the more massive (albeit less profitable for the bank) sector of options available for ordinary individuals.  This traditionally includes lending and deposit taking.  Most often, of course, we met reviews describing Plus Bank on car loans.  This is due to the fact that, as we have already noted, this is one of the most developed services in the bank's portfolio. </p>

    <p>  In addition to these, the site also has information about other services, for example, storage of valuables using <span>bank safes,</span> servicing and accepting payments, carrying out currency transactions and money transfers.  This also includes the issuance of bank cards intended for settlements in stores, receiving bonuses and the like. </p><p>  Now we describe the categories described above in more detail. </p><h2>  Car loan </h2><p>  The main stake the institution makes on loans for the purchase of cars.  This is shown by the auto loan reviews posted on the Plus Bank page.  No wonder the parameters that the client must match are described here.  In short, there are two lending programs in total - these are ‚ÄúAutoPole CASCO‚Äù and ‚ÄúDealer +‚Äù.  They differ among themselves in that the second option is designed to purchase a vehicle at a dealership.  There are also differences in terms of granting a loan.  In particular, the term for the first program is from 1 to 7 years, and for the second - up to 5. In addition, the allowable amount also varies (up to 3.5 million in the first case and up to 4.5 in the second).  It was noted on the bank‚Äôs website that a down payment is not required when applying for a loan.  In addition, CASCO can be issued at will, and a decision as to whether a loan will be issued is made one hour after submitting an application to the Plus Bank branch.  Car loan reviews from customers we will present to your attention a little later. </p>

    <h2>  Mortgage </h2><p>  The second type of lending that Bank Plus deals with is home loans.  Here, according to the information on the site, a long period of money return is provided (up to 30 years), and a large amount is also expected (from 300 thousand rubles).  The specific cost of such money can be calculated using the calculator presented on the site - here you should take into account a lot of details regarding the amount, term, interest rate and so on.  Based on this, the system issues the most optimal rate for each specific situation. </p><p>  You can apply and find out if you can get a mortgage through the online form on the bank‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2>

    <p>  Like others, Plus Bank accepts deposits for interest payments and accumulation of funds by individuals and legal entities.  The maximum rate when working with private clients reaches 11.5%.  In total, the <span>tariff grid</span> provides for 6 plans that make it possible to make investments in different currencies (ruble or dollars / euros). </p><p>  For companies, deposits in this bank provide the opportunity to receive up to 14% per annum, depending on the amount invested.  You can learn more about this only through communication with consultants, since all data is individual. </p><h2>  Companies </h2><p>  If the main products for ‚Äúprivate traders‚Äù are loans and deposits, then legal entities also use other options.  For example, this is the implementation of settlement and cash services for enterprises, trade financing, and collection of funds.  All this is often used in business processes, therefore, Plus Bank's corporate clients are primarily small and medium-sized businesses.  Here, in the "Companies" section, you can see information on cooperation with other banking institutions. </p><h2>  Offices </h2>

    <p>  As already noted, Plus Bank has offices in 7 regional centers (Moscow, Omsk, St. Petersburg, <span>Yekaterinburg, Tyumen</span> and Ryazan).  The general information telephone number, which is available for all regions: 8 (800) 200-23-72.  You can call here at any time, calls are free.  In addition, you can contact the bank branch.  In Moscow, the main one is the branch on 7 Izvestkovy Lane, telephone number 8 (495) 989-42-99.  Opening hours for individuals - from 9 to 21 daily, for legal entities - from Monday to Friday from 9 to 18. </p><p>  You can clarify information regarding the office in your area on the official website in the ‚ÄúBranches‚Äù section. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúPlus Bank‚Äù: car loan reviews </h2><p>  In order to know how the service for customers who have ordered this service goes, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the comments of bank customers.  We have gathered information to present in our article.  Therefore, for simplicity, you will only need to read this section. </p><p>  So, let's start with the fact that there are really different comments that are both positive and negative.  It all depends on how the visitor was received, whether they provided him with full informational support on the issue of interest to him, whether he really received the same conditions that were provided for initially. </p><p>  In the case of car loans, most customers are really satisfied.  They were granted a loan to purchase a car, which fully satisfied their requests and, consequently, led to a positive comment on the institution.  However, all reviews cannot be laudatory. </p><p>  There are a number of negative characteristics of service on the part of customers who want to get a car loan.  In particular, people say that they were called the wrong interest rate (which actually turned out to be higher than according to the manager);  or that the loan amount was automatically increased at the initiative of a bank employee.  Of course, these things sound very strange and are obvious violations of the rules of corporate etiquette and, in general, indicate an excess of official authority by a bank employee.  However, if these facts were true, the perpetrators would probably be punished.  After all, the bank has all the records, including video and audio recordings of conversations between employees and customers.  It is not difficult to prove such violations. </p><p>  Therefore, obviously, these allegations simply were not confirmed or proved to be pure slander.  In general, for most of the comments and complaints of customers, the main office instantly gives its comments and answers. </p><h2>  Bank reviews </h2><p>  As for the reputation of the Plus Bank institution as a whole, it is diverse, depending on the product being marketed.  For example, car loans show a product‚Äôs popularity, its attractiveness in the eyes of the client.  Feedback on loan terms is also good.  Another point is, for example, deposits.  Everything is not so rosy here, as Bank Plus often holds short-term actions.  Attracting people by one percent, they quickly change rates, which causes resentment of customers.  In working with legal entities, the bank‚Äôs reputation is also on top. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, I want to finally note that the institution employs professionals who have successfully promoted it in the services market for more than 25 years.  This is the best ‚Äúreview‚Äù about the work of the whole structure.  Therefore, find out the terms of cooperation in the matter that interests you, and feel free to go to Plus Bank. </p>
