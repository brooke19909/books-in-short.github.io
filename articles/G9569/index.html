  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The system of pedagogical sciences: a brief classification</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The system of pedagogical sciences is an interesting and wide range of questions for study, which are involved in both domestic and foreign researchers.  They have different views, but all of them can be brought to a common denominator and talk about the most used classifications of pedagogical sciences today. </p><p>  So, the structure and pedagogical sciences include the history and theory of pedagogy.  The first discipline studies the history of the development of the basic ideas of pedagogy, and also reveals the ways of developing <span>educational systems</span> in different countries and among diverse peoples.  And the <span>theory of pedagogy</span> consists of the following subsections: general pedagogy, didactics, theory of education, the theory of organization and management of the educational process and the methodology of <span>educational work.</span> </p><p>  The modern system of pedagogical sciences includes classification by age and subject attribute.  This is the difference between preschool and school <span>pedagogy, pedagogy of</span> vocational education, pedagogy of higher education, industrial, military, space, social, comparative, ethnopedagogy and gerontopedagogy.  We also include family pedagogy and communication pedagogy.  And there is also a separate pedagogy, which is in charge of vocational training for people who have chosen the path of a teacher. </p><p>  By value and semantic attribute, the system of pedagogical sciences includes authoritarian, humanistic, legal, Orthodox, and <span>pedagogy of cooperation.</span> </p><p>  According to the correctional and developing characteristic, the structure of pedagogical sciences includes defectology, deaf-pedagogy, typhlopedagogy, oligophrenopedagogy, speech-pedagogy, corrective, corrective and labor pedagogy, conductive pedagogy, medical, preventive, rehabilitation and for people with special giftedness. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The listed system of pedagogical sciences confirms the idea that pedagogy is an independent, rather complex science, which plays an important role in human life.  So, general pedagogy is studying the basic laws that govern the processes of education and training and all the other sections listed above are its constituent elements.  The age sector is in second place in terms of the breadth of the issues covered.  She studies all the moments of a person‚Äôs upbringing from birth to adulthood.  And today there is even gerontopedagogy dealing with issues of proper aging. </p><p>  The system of pedagogical sciences devotes considerable space to private methods or methods of teaching various subjects in schools and other educational institutions.  These include issues of physical, moral, artistic, environmental and other aspects of education.  This is due to the fact that each subject, discipline and direction of training and education has not only general, but also specific requirements that are used in the implementation of their tasks. </p><p>  And another branch that the modern system of pedagogical sciences has begun to single out relatively recently is comparative or comparative pedagogy.  By its name, it is clear that this science studies the development trends of pedagogical thought in different countries in a comparative, international sense.  Its goal is to enrich science with advanced techniques and methods used in different parts of the world in relation to domestic issues of education and upbringing. </p><p>  And finally, today it is impossible to imagine pedagogical science without the use of modern technology.  The information industry is becoming more and more popular today and is actively used in managing the processes of upbringing and education. </p>
