For thousands of years, bathing is a symbol of purification.  The main sacred actions of the Christian faith are inextricably linked with this action. </p><h2>  Holy baptism </h2><p>  The most important sacrament, after which the past, he accepts the Christian faith and becomes worthy of the kingdom of heaven.  In Russia, after the adoption of Christianity, bathing in consecrated springs became a favorite folk tradition.  By immersing themselves in healing waters, believers received spiritual cleansing, and with this, boundless inexplicable joy.  Some cases of ablutions led to healing from bodily or mental illnesses. </p>

    <p>  Ablution sources are available throughout the calendar year.  They give special power to the church holiday of Epiphany.  On this day, for reasons that are still inexplicable to humans, water on the entire planet changes its qualitative composition.  Even tap water drawn at Baptism can be stored for a very long time without changing its normal color and smell. </p><p>  Scientists even conducted a comparative analysis of drinking water from the tap and collected in a holy spring.  Analysis of water from holy places showed the absence of any bacteria, as well as high biological activity.  Faith and prayer have such a powerful effect on the structure of water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Proper visit </h2><p>  It is better to visit the saints sources, having previously purified themselves by fasting and prayer.  Also, do not forget about modesty in clothes - this is still not an ordinary bath.  Where possible, a font is necessarily organized.  It happens that many do not have the courage to plunge completely.  Then it‚Äôs enough to wash your face, hands or feet, just drink water from the source.  Washings must be accompanied by prayer, in which a believing person calls out to God for help.  God's Grace, if a believer is worthy of it, will not become less of it. </p><p>  All Orthodox sources are holy and healing.  They may not have a rich history, but, once sanctified, they are filled with grace.  As the <span>source is inexhaustible,</span> there is no limit to the miracles that are awarded to the soul and body of a truly believing Orthodox person. </p><p>  On the territory of our country there are countless such keys, especially in the middle of Russia.  You can always find out about the nearest consecrated spring from Orthodox believers or from local church staff.  Local residents, in the vicinity of which there are sources of saints, consider it preferable to use water from them than from the water supply. </p><h2>  The main holy sources of the Moscow region </h2><p>  The history of our state is closely connected with the Orthodox Christian faith.  Today it seems that Russia has become the last bastion of Orthodoxy to defend its Faith.  The population of our vast country, the bulk of the people are deeply religious.  This is evidenced by numerous temples, historical architectural monuments, monasteries and holy sources of Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A fairly large number of Orthodox centers are located in the suburbs.  Where the holy spring is located, giving healing from ailments and strengthening faith, it is always crowded.  We will consider the most visited in the capital region. </p><h2>  Rattle key </h2><p>  Near the village of Vzglyadovo, 14 km from Sergiev Posad, a spring has been beating for over 600 years.  The holy spring appeared here from the <span>prayer of St. Sergius of Radonezh,</span> when the monk stopped at this place to rest when traveling to Kerzhach.  The elder prayed to God for the unity of the Russian people and overcoming the yoke of the Mongol khans.  During a kneeling prayer, a stream of water erupted from the rock, which was later popularly called the Gremyachiy Klyuch waterfall. </p>

    <p>  In mineral composition, water is similar to Kislovodsk sources, but with a lower degree of mineralization.  All year round, the water temperature is 4 degrees.  The rock divided the stream into three waterfalls.  The right one helps to heal heart diseases, the left one heals female ones, and the stream flowing between them relieves the headache.  People gave the flows the names: Faith, Hope, Love.  Even in bad weather, you can always meet believers who have come to the source for help. </p><h2>  Source of Sergius of Radonezh </h2><p>  On the outskirts of the village of Radonezh, near the Church of the Transfiguration, there is another source.  In this Slavic settlement, which appeared in the 9th century, the parents of the <span>Russian saint</span> lived <span>.</span>  From here Sergius in 1337, the young man went to the monks.  The people gave his name to the spring.  All these centuries, without ceasing, the source hits.  The holy key gives clean, cool and tasty water.  Old-timers talk about the numerous help in healing various ailments.  The spring daily gives its Grace to many believers who come here not only from the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Barsky well </h2><p>  The source, located in the village of Muranovo, Pushkin district, was consecrated in the name of the <span>Kazan Icon of the Mother of God</span> in the century before last.  The spring became known in the middle of the year before last, when the Tyutchev family built the Church of the Savior Not Made by Hands on the site of the acquired estate.  Prayers and the sacrament of baptism were held here. </p>

    <p>  When at the end of the 90s they cleaned the source, it turned out that instead of one spring exactly 12 keys were beaten.  After that, the flow of believers to the Barsky well significantly increased.  Many helped this holy source.  The feedback that the pilgrims and locals pass on by word of mouth speak of healing from skin diseases and the quick healing of open wounds. </p><h2>  Source of Ascension David Desert </h2><p>  It is located in the small village of Talezh, Moscow Region.  The place where the spring strikes is under the control of a man‚Äôs monastery, which is located 30 km from here.  There is a temple on the territory - a chapel, a belfry, a male and female font.  The holy spring was consecrated in the name of the founder of the monastery, which was from the family of the Vyazemsky princes. </p>

    <p>  Since 1515, when the monastery was founded, there have been many cases where the source helped get rid of various eye diseases and liver diseases.  In addition to pilgrims seeking healing, this source is very famous for the performance of church rites of baptism and wedding.  In the temple, the strict rules of the <span>male monastery</span> operate <span>,</span> so inside the photo and video are strictly prohibited. </p><h2>  Holy sources of the Samara region </h2><p>  Samara land is also rich in life-giving springs - in the region there are 1536 known keys.  A little more than 40 are considered gracious and holy. Among them there are nameless, but the main number was consecrated at different times as the site of the appearance of the miraculous icons of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the saints of God. </p><p>  After the era of Soviet atheism, when Orthodoxy was subjected to unthinkable destruction, the holy sources of Russia are restored again.  Both local authorities and the diocese with believers take a large part in the restoration of infrastructure and the improvement of the territory adjacent to the sources.  People come to these places not only from all over the region.  Many visitors from different parts of the country, who, having learned about the many cases of getting rid of various ailments, come here in the hope of finding help. </p><h2>  Deliverer from troubles </h2><p>  The small village of Tashla, in the Stavropol district of the Samara region, is always full of people who come to the source every day in honor of the miraculous image of the Virgin. </p><p>  To a local resident Kate Chugunova on October 21, 1917, in a dream, the Virgin showed where the icon with its face lies.  In the morning, going to the place, Katya spotted two angels carrying an icon illuminated by bright light.  In a small ravine a small icon of the Mother of God was found.  Taking her in her hands, the believer saw a spring clogged from the ground. </p><p>  The abbot of the Trinity Church, despite the numerous cases of healing that occurred at the icon, showed doubt and disbelief, but decided to leave the find in the church.  Two months later, the icon disappeared from the church.  The night watchman spoke of lightning striking from the church building towards the newly constructed chapel at the source.  Surrounded by many people, the abbot Dmitry opened the chapel and opened the lid of the well above the source.  There he saw in the depths of the very icon from which the glow was coming, and frozen water was melting along the edges of the well.  He immediately repented of his unbelief, and the icon immediately surfaced, thereby allowing people to find it again. </p>

    <p>  Since then, the icon has been kept in the Tashly temple, and tens of thousands of believers were able to touch the gift of the Virgin.  At the time of the great drought, which began in 1920 and lasted 2 years, the spring was the only one that provided water to the inhabitants of the village.  Already at that time, many believers from all over the Volga rushed to the healing spring.  And the icon, which also gave the grace of healing, became a real support to all believers in the dashing revolutionary time. </p><h2>  Holy lake </h2><p>  The narrow and winding lake located behind the village of Syezhee is a special holy place on the Samara land.  In 1958, there was a manifestation of God.  From the ice hole, a resident of the village saw a glow.  In the radiance it was possible to distinguish the church, the altar and the Mother of God, Nicholas the Wonderworker, and the archangels standing nearby. </p><p>  People came running - many received healing.  The authorities just didn‚Äôt do it: they covered the lake with manure and filled it with diesel fuel.  But miracles continued.  Believers and curious onlookers even drove water from a fire hydrant.  But people still went to the lake to look at the heavenly faces. </p><p>  After that, the lake began to possess inexplicable properties.  Mosquitoes and midges disappeared, which are inconceivable on neighboring lakes.  Water has buoyancy.  There is fish in the lake, and large, but no one can boast that he managed to catch at least one. </p><p>  And once at dawn from the sky to the lake and the adjacent shore, balls of all colors of the rainbow began to fall.  They moved along the water surface and shore in different directions.  There was a commotion in the village.  Most residents tried to catch them, but no one succeeded either. </p><p>  After these events, scientists studying <span>abnormal phenomena,</span> as well as biologists, became interested in the lake.  The fact is that plants grow on the shoreline of the lake that are not found anywhere else in the Samara region.  Water collected from the lake can be stored for more than 10 years, while maintaining a pleasant taste and smell.  Sludge and algae trapped in a water storage tank completely dissolve in a short time.  Such properties cannot be explained scientifically until now. </p><p>  Those who recently visited the wonderful lake said that it was noticeably shallow, and the banks are increasingly clogged with tall reeds.  What causes such changes, no one knows.  But water still has its wonderful properties. </p><h2>  Inexpressible bowl </h2><p>  In the village of Volzhsky there is a holy source of the Mother of God, named after the icon of the same name, which helps those suffering from drunkenness.  His age exceeds 300 years.  Interestingly, the source gives a bucket of water every second for such a long time.  People come here from all over Samara land in the hope of getting rid of a serious illness and strengthening the power of faith. </p>

    <p>  Numerous stories telling of a miraculous deliverance from a disease that destroys not only the body, but also the soul, daily lead here the obsessed with illness.  Many wives are brought to the source by suffering wives in the hope that their faith will help the second half to come to their senses and stop the godly work. </p><h2>  Znamensky source </h2><p>  The spring hits the slope directly from under the roots of the trees, forming a small stream.  In the second half of the year before last, the icon of Nicholas of Myra was in the waters of the spring.  An old cowgirl found her and brought her home.  However, in the morning the icon disappeared.  Soon other shepherds there again found this icon and carried it to the merchant from Znamenka.  His icon also disappeared the next day. </p>

Skeptics consider such cases as a favorable combination of circumstances.
