The first is to reissue bank cards.  This is especially true for debit plastic.  So, how to close the card of Sberbank? </p><h2>  Blocking Options </h2><p>  Each client of the company has every right to choose the method of rejection of plastic.  There is no significant difference in the proposed options.  You can choose what seems more convenient and simple.  Allocate the following ways to close the card: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  By phone (usually without an account). </li><li>  Through Internet banking (Sberbank Online service). </li><li>  Personally in the office of a banking company. </li></ol><p>  After the choice, it is worth preparing correctly for the upcoming process.  But before that you need to find out some of the features that conceal the closure of a <span>Sberbank</span> bank <span>card.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to close the card of the Savings Bank" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1366289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is it possible? </h2><p>  Clients very often ask questions of closing / opening plastic.  The first process is especially worrying.  Can I close my Sberbank card via the Internet?  Yes, but there is one feature of this procedure that not everyone knows about.  The thing is that through Internet banking in the same way as through telephone communication, you can only lock the card.  At the same time, a citizen will still have an account with Sberbank.  So the complete closure of Sberbank's bank card comes down only to a personal visit to the company‚Äôs office.  No other is given.  Although quite often, at first, citizens block plastic.  And only then they refuse the account.  But how to close the card of Sberbank? </p><h2>  Office selection </h2><p>  So, the first step towards the implementation of the task is to choose a department in which the entire procedure of refusing bank plastic will take place.  Many people think: where should they go?  There is an answer to this question! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a sberbank card account" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1366288.jpg" width="511"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can close the card of Sberbank in any branch.  A citizen has every right to turn to where he is comfortable.  The main thing is that Sberbank is the place of circulation.  Therefore, it is recommended to choose the nearest branch of this financial institution.  There is no difference where exactly to apply.  Sberbank takes care of the convenience of using the services and seamlessly rejecting them. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  How to close a debit card of Sberbank?  It should be a little prepared.  This is not as difficult as it seems.  Only a few documents are required from the client, which are presented in the original: </p><ul><li>  ID card (passport). </li><li>  Bank plastic, which finally closes. </li><li>  Application for the operation. </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  As practice shows, the last document is filled out directly at the Sberbank branch.  Therefore, a citizen should take with him only plastic and a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  If the contract for the provision of services, which was issued upon receipt of a bank card, was preserved, it can also be brought.  But this is optional. </p><h2>  For credit cards </h2><p>  Much depends on what type of banking plastic is taking place.  For example, there are fewer problems with debit.  Although they are also enough.  But with credit cards you have to tinker a bit.  How to close a Sberbank card account?  If we are talking about credit cards, it is necessary to take the first step towards the implementation of the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a debit card of sberbank" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1366292.jpg" width="567"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that before the client contacts the bank with a statement about closing the account and blocking the card, it is necessary to pay off all debts.  Without this, contacting Sberbank does not make sense.  The client will simply be denied blocking until the full payment of debts on the account.  For this reason, there are fewer problems with debit plastic. </p><h2>  Filling out an application </h2><p>  I wonder how to close a <span>bank card of</span> Sberbank?  After all the necessary documents have been collected, the nearest branch of the financial organization has also been selected by the citizen, you can proceed with the main actions.  We are talking about contacting the bank.  In the branch of Sberbank, he is obliged to inform about his intentions to close the account and block the card.  Employees fill out an application based on the plastic and <span>ID</span> provided.  Then it is given to the client for signature.  The second important stage is completed. </p><p>  You should pay attention to the following nuance: if a citizen has a <span>debit card,</span> then with the account completely blocked, it is necessary to somehow return the available funds.  When a statement is made about refusing to use bank plastic, it states that Sberbank is obligated to return the money either as a money transfer to any account, or in cash.  Now it remains only to wait. </p><h2>  Receiving statements </h2><p>  But before rejoicing, it is recommended to request a few more references from Sberbank.  The thing is that often when blocking and closing any plastic, problems may arise in relation to the repayment of debts (both from the financial institution and the client).  Therefore, you should ask for information about blocking the card, as well as about the absence of debt to Sberbank.  If we are talking about the company's debt to a citizen, it is recommended to take any payment documents that confirm the transfer of funds from the account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="close a Sberbank card in any branch" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1366293.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <p>  Only under such circumstances can you fully protect yourself from the negative consequences.  This is especially true for credit card holders.  But immediately after <span>receiving statements</span> from Sberbank, you can wait for the account to be completely closed and plastic blocked.  By the way, this does not happen right away.  Closing a debit card requires an expectation of one and a half months (45 days).  But credit cards stop their work faster.  You will have to wait only 30 days from the date of signing the application.  Do not forget that when you contact Sberbank you will have to give bank plastic.  It is disposed of in front of the client - cut.  You can destroy a closed card yourself, but you are not advised to do so. </p><h2>  Card lock </h2><p>  But what if I want to leave an account with Sberbank and refuse plastic?  In this case, it is recommended to lock the card.  It is best to do this over the Internet or over the phone.  In the first case, authorization is made on the Sberbank Online website.  In the "My Account" client selects a specific bank card, then marks the item "Block".  Next, the operation is confirmed using a secret code that will come in an SMS message to a mobile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to close a sberbank bank card" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1366291.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The second case is a telephone conversation.  A call is made to the number 8 800 555 55 50. The operator is informed of the client's intention to abandon bank plastic.  Next, a citizen is asked for passport data for an identity card and a bank card number.  It remains only to name the code word, which is used for some operations.  It should initially be known only to the cardholder.  A few minutes of waiting - and it's done!  Now it‚Äôs clear how to close a Sberbank card and an account tied to plastic. </p>
