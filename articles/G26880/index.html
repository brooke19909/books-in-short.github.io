It is located on the southern Anatolian coast, near a mountainous cape, protruding into the Mediterranean Sea.  The resort is located between two longest sandy beaches.  This picturesque tourist center with modern hotels and affordable pensions is one hundred and twenty kilometers distant from the famous Antalya.  In size, Alanya is second only to it.  Groves with lemon and orange trees, wide fertile plains, endless beaches, well-preserved sights just perfectly contribute to a vacation on this Turkish "Riviera". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arabella world hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/709044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Avsallar </h2><p>  To the north of Alanya is one of the most beautiful beaches in the area.  It is located near the lively resort village of Avsallar, the distinguishing feature of which is primarily its nature: the rich, playing with all tones of green, rich vegetation gives tourists even pleasant heat on a sultry day.  On this part of the Mediterranean coast there are surprisingly clean sandy beaches, many high-quality hotels, including inexpensive ones, restaurants and bars. </p><p>  The active nightlife of Avsallar attracts young people who long for cheerful sleepless nights.  And for those who come not only to relax, but also to improve their health, the resort offers a wide range of spa services, thalasso therapy and excellent massage rooms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Avsallar is one of the warmest areas on the <span>Antalya coast,</span> since the bay in which it is located protects the village from strong winds.  Small but very sweet bananas grow here - ‚Äúroyal‚Äù, delicious oranges and lemons. <br>  In addition, this place seems to be intended for shopping lovers.  Numerous boutiques and shops, a noisy oriental bazaar in the center of the village - all this seems to guarantee tourists active bidding and successful shopping.  On the main street of Avsallar there are collapses, shops where not only souvenirs are sold, but also leather and jewelry. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  There are no luxury apartments in the village.  Actually, they are useless here.  Those four- and five-star hotels that have been operating in the resort for many years have long established themselves as the highest quality on the coast, the level of service has not deteriorated since the opening, remaining stable.  There are club-type hotels here, for example, Lonicera World or Pegasos Club, Aska Just in Beach, Alara complex, etc. Many hotels, including the Arabella World Hotel, are popular among the "fours". </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  It is built on the second line from the sea, two kilometers from the center of Avsallar.  The hotel was opened in 2000.  Ten years later, another building was added to it - a six-story building.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is small - four and a half thousand meters, but it is thoroughly thought out and landscaped. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Alanya is twenty-six kilometers away.  You can get to it by the motorway passing near the hotel.  The airport in Antalya is a hundred kilometers away.  This is not particularly convenient for those young children who do not tolerate the road, although the shuttle service is provided by comfortable shuttles.  The hotel does not have its own parking.  There is free public parking at the entrance. </p><p>  The last major overhaul at the Arabella World Hotel was in 2013.  At this time, not only were the rooms renovated, but the plumbing was completely replaced.  The very beautiful design of the Art Nouveau hotel creates a feeling of lightness.  Marble, glass and snow-white walls <span>cheer you up.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arabella world 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/709040.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the resort Avsallar there are many attractions, excursions to which you can buy at the Arabella World Hotel 4. Photos of tourists in the dolphinarium, located a twenty-minute walk from the hotel, takes everyone who has stayed with him home.  The region is very interesting due to its rather ancient history.  Here is an old Seljuk fortress dating from the thirteenth century.  In addition, judging by the reviews, a boat trip that starts from <span>Cleopatra Beach is</span> very interesting <span>.</span>  It lasts until about seven in the evening.  On the yacht there is also an animator entertaining tourists.  The cost of such an excursion is about twenty-five dollars per person.  There is also a tour with a disco, often a foam, on board a yacht with drinks.  It ends at three in the morning and costs around forty-five dollars. </p><p>  An interesting excursion is rafting.  Rafting takes place along the Manavgat River, which is not very far from Arabella World Hotel 4. For the sake of being able to get a dose of adrenaline, even tourists from many remote resorts - Camyuva, Tekirova, etc. come here for many. Many take children with them, because there are several levels of complex river thresholds.  Therefore, while relaxing with your family, you should not give up rafting at all, which costs about fifteen dollars with lunch. </p><p>  Some prefer to go to Alanya or Side and there independently visit all interesting places.  Buses leave every fifteen minutes, their parking is at the entrance to the hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Arabella World Hotel was liked by many Russians.  They admit in their impressions that at first, choosing this particular hotel, they doubted the correctness of their action, as they were traveling with small children.  The long transfer, some remoteness from the big cities were alarming. </p><p>  But they were wrong.  Hotel Arabella World Hotel 4 * is really good.  Check-in is made immediately, without a long wait, although many, as they themselves admit, arrived at inopportune times.  Without any surcharges, you can get a room with a sea view, if, of course, there is available. </p><p>  Both the old and the new building are well repaired.  Plumbing in the rooms works fine, the rooms have everything for a normal stay.  And although the general cleaning is carried out only between settlements, the daily was enough for many.  The maids cleaned the rooms unnoticed, mainly when tourists went down to the restaurant.  This was appreciated by mothers, vacationing with children and watching closely so that their children‚Äôs sleep was not disturbed. </p><p>  The fact that you need to walk to the beach for a few minutes is not particularly annoying.  Many tourists perceived this as an additional promenade in the fresh air.  Despite the fact that the road in some places runs along a busy highway, <span>exhaust gases</span> are not felt at all. </p><p>  Many reviews relate to beach terraces with sun loungers and parasols.  Our compatriots liked them.  Neither on the beach, nor by the pool, no one lost anything, which is very important for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Nutrition ... Almost everyone is happy with it: a variety of fruits, a lot of meat, fish every day.  Nobody remained hungry, and some even gained weight.
