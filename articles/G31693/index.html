    <h2>  Destination </h2><p>  To begin with, the entire <span>tariff network is</span> distributed depending on the purpose for which a particular service package is connected.  In this case, if we are talking about a “yellow-black” operator, 3 target groups of packages stand out.  Thus, all Beeline tariffs are divided into three categories, depending on which device they are combined with best. </p><p>  You don’t need to think here for a long time - it’s obvious: a smartphone, a tablet computer and a USB modem. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a “default characteristic” does not oblige the subscriber, for example, to use only one or another tariff on their gadget.  No, they can be easily combined - for example, you can connect “tablet” tariffs to your phone, but whether it will be just as effective for your purposes, only you know. </p><p>  Therefore, the operator, taking as a basis the average requirements of subscribers with a particular type of device, selects their own service packages for each of them.  For example, for a Beeline modem, the tariffs are significantly different from what we see in the case of options for a smartphone.  This will be discussed in more detail in the following sections of our article. </p><p>  Now let's start the characterization of each of the categories of packages. </p>

    <h2>  The choice </h2><p>  It should be remembered that the choice of the <span>Beeline tariff (Moscow</span> or any other city - it does not matter) should be done taking into account your needs.  It is necessary to determine the extent to which these or other services you use, and then select the package that is as close as possible to the same volume.  And, of course, you need to find a middle ground between the price of the tariff and what it offers.  So, all Beeline tariffs are selected. </p>

    <h2>  For mobile </h2><p>  Let's start with the <span>tariff plans</span> for mobile devices.  So what do we do with our phone in everyday life?  Firstly, we call friends and relatives, secondly, we send SMS, thirdly, we use mobile Internet.  Therefore, we need a comprehensive solution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Obviously, Beeline thought the same way when they developed all tariffs.  Beeline, therefore, put integrated plans in the basis of smartphone packages.  In them, the user is provided with "a bit of everything."  Read more below. </p><h2>  “All for ...” </h2><p>  So, the operator has six service packages.  They are called “All for ...”, followed by a certain figure - the cost of this tariff plan for a month of use.  There is, for example, the “All for 200” tariff, followed by: 400, 600, 900, 1500, 2700. The volume of services that the subscriber receives also increases along with the increase in the cost of the package.  And the Beeline tariff “All for 300” is not provided.  The company probably abandoned the idea of ​​“breaking up” plans (or, perhaps, such a package existed earlier, but it was replaced with “Everything for 400” due to the rise in price of communication services). </p><p>  Each of the described plans offers a certain number of minutes for calls, SMS and the amount of traffic.  For example, “All for 400” provides 2 GB of mobile Internet, 400 minutes for calls within the Beeline network and 100 SMS messages.  While the most expensive tariff - for 2700 rubles per month - is 15 GB, 4000 minutes and 3000 SMS (prepayment).  And the Beeline tariff “All for 300”, even if it existed, would provide a volume of services corresponding to its cost (that is, much less). </p><p>  The advantage of such options is that the subscriber does not have to separately purchase a particular service - he can buy calls, messages and Internet access in one package.  You can find the most favorable tariff from the indicated ones.  The more actively you use mobile services, the more expensive you need a package. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Additional plans </h2><p>  Do not think that comprehensive solutions “All for ...” are all Beeline tariffs that are available to subscribers.  No, there is, for example, a special service “Everything for iPhone”.  This is an exclusive, more favorable tariff, which for 1000 rubles per month provides 1000 minutes for calls to all operators, 500 SMS, 10 GB of traffic, insurance from a broken screen for a year.  You can connect it only if you bought the device in the Beeline store. </p><p>  In addition, there are other plans.  For example, the tariff “Welcome.”  Beeline (as part of this package) makes calls to its network numbers for 1.7 rubles without a monthly fee and additional fees.  This service is beneficial for those who use their phone exclusively as a “dialer” within the network.  No Internet traffic or SMS messages included in the package is provided.  Switching to the “Welcome” tariff “Beeline” made paid.  Its cost is 150 rubles (one-time payment). </p><h2>  For tablet </h2><p>  If on a mobile phone the options imply a complex of services, then in the case of a tablet computer, the emphasis is on Internet traffic.  We are talking about “Highway” tariffs, which make it possible to use data packages for entertainment, information retrieval, watching videos and movies. </p>

    <p>  Here the operator allocates 4 tariffs.  The minimum of them costs 400 rubles per month.  As part of its subscriber receives 4 GB of traffic (plus 200 MB of bonus). </p><p>  Further, the data volumes go in this order - 6 GB, 12 GB, 20 GB.  Their cost increases accordingly: 600, 700 and 1200 rubles. </p><h2>  For USB modem </h2><p>  There is another direction of Internet packages from the Beeline operator.  They are more suitable for active Internet users working, say, through a laptop or desktop computer outside the reach of wired Internet.  Connection in this case is via the USB adapter. </p><p>  So, Beeline subscribers have 3 tariffs for a modem.  The volume of traffic here is 8 GB, 12 GB and 20 GB.  The cost is 600, 700 and 1200 rubles per month, respectively. </p>

    <h2>  Which is the most profitable? </h2><p>  So, at the beginning of the article, we promised that we would analyze the existing tariff plans and choose the most optimal, most profitable of them.  As you probably already understood, it’s impossible to unequivocally call one of the options more profitable than the others.  The reason for this is that each of the service packages has a different cost and a different amount of data that it includes.  Since, getting more, you pay a price higher than for other packages, your task is, as already noted, to find the optimal middle.  And this can be done only after analyzing your expenses. </p><p>  For example, if you often use the Internet, but call a little - why not use Internet tariffs?  The same goes for the opposite: without the need for access to the network, it is best for you to use packets with minutes for calls and SMS messages. </p><p>  If you would like to use, for example, Internet services, but do not want to refuse a profitable plan with calls, you can do even more cunning.  Having a smartphone with 2 SIM cards, you could be served on an Internet package and with options with minutes for calls at the same time, getting the most out of both services and at the same time not overpaying too much. </p>

    <h2>  How to find out your tariff? </h2><p>  When choosing a mobile services plan, the subscriber should be careful, because some of them require an additional fee for the transition.  To do this, you need to know exactly what plan you are currently servicing.  How to find out the tariff on Beeline?  Very simple - enter the command * 110 * 05 # on your smartphone - and the interactive menu will tell you the name of the option that is connected to you.  An alternative to this method is another one - you can call 067405 (and a voice robot will announce the name of your plan).  You can also find out through the online interface.  Just go to your account on the official website of the company and you will see the name of your tariff.  The same goes for mobile apps. </p><p>  Finally, if you understand how to find out the tariff on Beeline, but you cannot do it for some reason, you can turn to specialists in communication centers or to the operator on the hot line for help.  He will tell you how to do this as quickly and simply as possible. </p><h2>  How to connect to another? </h2><p>  Finally, having made your choice, as well as finding out all the conditions under which you can switch to another tariff plan, you can order it and wait for your application to be completed.  This is very simple, and in several ways.  You can, again, submit a digital request with a unique tariff identifier (you can find it on the website in the description of the plan that interested you);  You can contact the call center operator, as well as submit an online application through “My Account”.  It is very simple, but in a few minutes you will be transferred to another, more profitable option. </p>
