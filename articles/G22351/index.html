But the magical name Angra dos Reis has been persistently passed on from mouth to mouth.  Translated from Portuguese, this means "bay of kings."  What kind of kings arrived on this coast and gave a name to the city?  As indicated in the Gospels, these were kings from the East.  In Catholic countries they are considered royal monks, in our country they are magi.  Angra (Brazil) conquers any person with its beauty.  And every traveler arriving on this paradise coast brings him the gift of the love of his heart, as the magi once presented the baby Jesus with gold, myrrh, and incense.  In this article we will consider the history of the resort and its attractions.  We advise when it is best to come there and which tours to Angra dos Reis choose.  Let's give some recommendations on where to go on your own from this Brazilian town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angra Brazil" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766675.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Angra dos Reis </h2><p>  This is a small city located on the Atlantic coast.  There are three hundred and sixty-five islands in the bay.  Close to the sea approach the mountains of Serra do Mar, giving the scenery even more splendor.  The coast within the city is not in vain called Green (Costa Verde).  The narrow strip between wonderful beaches and mountains is filled with the lush greenery of tropical forests.  This place has long been favored by wealthy Latin American tourists.  The local beaches (and there are about two thousand) are considered the best in the entire state of Rio de Janeiro.  They are made attractive not only by white soft sand, but also by a quiet, gentle surf (which is rare for the open ocean) and a forest that is approaching. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city of Angra (Brazil) itself is small, with about one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants.  According to reviews, many ancient churches and beautiful colonial-style mansions have been preserved in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angra brazil photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766677.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Angra (Brazil) is located in the south of Rio de Janeiro.  More than one hundred kilometers separate it from the city of the same name, two hundred and fifty from Sao Paulo.  Those tourists who come to Brazil on holiday packages visit Angra in a complex with Iguazu Falls.  Naturally, they do not need to worry about the transfer.  For independent travelers, we say that the city can be reached from Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo airports by regular buses.  They depart every hour (carrier company Viacao Costa Verde) from the main city of the state and at 8-00, 12-15, 16-10 and 21-30 from S√£o Paulo (company Viacao Reunidas).  Travel time is two and four hours, respectively.  Tourists are not advised to book an individual transfer.  It will cost too much - $ 200 from Rio and 800 from Sao Paulo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brazil Angra" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766679.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  When to come </h2><p>  Amazing Angra (Brazil)!  Photos of this wonderful place personally show us that summer always reigns here.  The dry season in the tropical <span>climate of Brazil is</span> poorly expressed.  Rains are likely all year round.  But climatic features make holidays in the winter months especially attractive.  In the southern hemisphere then summer.  Usually the weather here is always the same, without pronounced seasons.  The maximum temperature (in January) reaches + 37 ¬∞ C, but the minimum never drops below + 20 ¬∞ C.  Tourists recommend that those who choose to relax from June to August take a sweater or a windbreaker on their trip: evenings on the coast can be pretty cool.  But, in principle, Angra (Brazil) is ready to receive guests year-round.  It usually rains here at night.  In the morning, a jungle washed by a shower, sunny weather and a light breeze await you. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  When the Portuguese discovered the coast of Latin America in 1500, they were captivated by the beauty of these places.  The kingdom immediately equipped a second expedition.  It was led by Gaspard de Lemos.  The task of the expedition was to draw up a detailed map of the coast, which would later be called Brazil.  Angra became the first landing site for the team of Gaspard de Lemos.  And since it happened on January 6, when the Catholic world celebrated the feast of the Three Kings (Magi), then this place was also called Angra dos Reis.  It is clear that there was no mention of any city here.  Nevertheless, its inhabitants themselves consider the foundation of the settlement on January 6, 1502. </p><p>  For a long time the coast remained deserted.  The pirate ships, taking advantage of the numerous islands and secluded coves, stopped here to replenish <span>fresh water</span> and food.  Only half a century later, in 1556, a small settlement of the Portuguese appeared.  Now it is the Old Town (Villa Velha) near the island of Zhiboya.  Gradually, the area developed.  Soon, the city became the center of trade in gold, coffee and sugarcane, which was exported by Brazil.  Angra fell into decay at the end of the 19th century, when a road was built that connected Rio directly with S√£o Paulo, making the Costa Verde coastline on the periphery.  But in the twentieth century, with the laying of the Rio-Santos autobahn and the popularization of sea tourism, the city revived.  Now this resort occupies not only the coast, but also <span>the largest island of the</span> bay - Ilya-Grandi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angra brazil reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766680.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Angra (Brazil) Tours </h2><p>  Usually they are designed for nine or twelve days.  Moreover, most of the time tourists spend in Rio de Janeiro.  The package includes an excursion with a flight to <span>Iguazu Falls.</span>  It is on the border with Argentina.  A bewitching spectacle that will be remembered for a long time.  The crash of falling water is heard for several kilometers.  It‚Äôs especially nice to watch millions of splashes standing in the ‚ÄúDevil's Throat‚Äù - this is a small platform in the immediate vicinity of this natural attraction.  Then, by boat, jeep and even on foot, tourists go on a tour of the Makuko Safari through the virgin jungle.  And only for three or six days from the whole tour Angra (Brazil) becomes the place of tourists' location.  Reviews mention that the package includes only a sightseeing tour with a stop on the island of Ilya-Grandi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angra brazil tours" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766681.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Tourists recommend not to dwell on the beach, but to make independent excursions.  While relaxing in Angra, you can visit the Old Town, where you can see the forts of San Sebastian and San Juan Battista, the palace of Betancourt and many churches.  Then, using a regular boat or chartering a boat, you should go to the island of Ilya-Grandi.  The main attraction here is the former leper colony and the prison, and now the museum.  Other interesting places of the island are <span>the aqueduct, the</span> lighthouse of Dus Castellanus, the F√©tiseira Falls, the underwater cave of Du Akaya, the Church of Santana with the pirate cemetery surrounding it and the <span>Bat</span> House <span>,</span> built by the filibuster <span>Juan de</span> Lorenzo. </p><p>  Of course, you will like Angra (Brazil)!  Photos of its environs, the islands of Botinas and Kataguases, clearly show what the earthly paradise looks like on the first day of its creation.  Tourists advise visiting the village of Mambucaba, where Latin American fun always reigns. </p>
