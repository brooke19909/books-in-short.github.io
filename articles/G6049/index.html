Here, not only wonderful nature, but also a lot of historical attractions.  What is only the city-castle Kamenetz-Podolsky, which annually receives tens of thousands of tourists, including from abroad.  But in Podillia you can not only make interesting excursions.  This region is known in Ukraine for its radon sources, and the glory of the town of Khmelnik as a balneological resort booms far beyond the borders of the country.  What diseases are treated there?  How much is it?  In this article we will talk about the <span>balneological resort</span> in Podillia.  Sanatorium "Khmelnik" - the largest of the health facilities of the town.  But there are other boarding houses with treatment.  We will also pay a little attention to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium Khmelnik" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1213235.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest towns in Ukraine.  It is located, as it were, on an island formed by the arms of the Southern Bug River.  High shores, green distances, ecologically clean territory, rich historical heritage - these are the prerequisites for creating a recreation zone.  But Khmilnik was doubly lucky.  In 1934, a geological expedition accidentally stumbled upon a source.  The local population did not use this key, because the water was not very pleasant to taste.  But chemical analysis showed that it contains radon and a whole bunch of healthy substances and trace elements.  When the first sanatorium was built near the spring, Khmelnik began to rapidly develop as a balneological resort.  Soon, healing mud was found nearby.  The list of diseases that can be cured by undergoing treatment in Khmelnik has expanded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium hmilnik reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1213211.jpg" width="600"></div>

First of all, to those people who suffer from all pathologies of the musculoskeletal system.  Skin diseases disappear completely after completing the course.  Also, a "specialized ailment", which doctors take in the sanatoriums of Khmelnik, are nervous disorders.  After a heart attack, they go here for rehabilitation.  <span>Radon baths have a</span> beneficial effect on the treatment of cerebrovascular pathology and acquired diabetes mellitus.  There are a lot of health resorts in the resort, and you need to immediately warn that there are two with the same name - the Khmelnik sanatorium: military and trade union.  You can book a room at a departmental institution.  Other health resorts in Khmelnik include the sanatoriums Radon, Zheleznodorozhnikov, Podillia, Birch Guy, and MRC Yuzhny Bug.  All of them are free to take for treatment.  We will talk about prices in them later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium Khmelnik military" class="if" height="159" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1213233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price comparison </h2><p>  Everyone can choose a suitable resort here.  Khmilnik as a resort provides outpatient treatment and procedures without settling in such state institutions.

For 310 hryvnias (approximately 800 rubles) per day, you are provided with not only accommodation in the economy room, but also the passage of procedures, and five meals a day.  In the military sanatorium, prices start from 355 UAH, in the preventive Khmelnik - from 420, in Podillia - from 410, in the Southern Bug MRC - 430, in Zheleznodorozhnikov and Radon - from 450 hryvnias per night per person. </p>
