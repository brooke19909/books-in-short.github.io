    <h2>  Do-it-yourself wall newspaper for Teacher‚Äôs Day - a gift to educators </h2><p>  The teacher is a respected, important, and responsible profession.  These people put knowledge in us from an early age.  Moreover, they educate us.  Every year, on the eve of October 5, children begin to create wall newspapers for Teacher‚Äôs Day with their own hands.  They can combine the most diverse trends - poetry, prose and painting.  Everything is up to you. </p><h2>  Step by step </h2><p>  So, more details.  What do you need for making wall newspapers for Teacher's Day with your own hands?  First, decide on the style of design and text content.  Secondly, prepare congratulations (handwritten, printed or cut out from magazines), photographs, postcards, pictures.  Third, create the foundation.  Typically, a Whatman sheet is used for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself wall newspaper for teacher's day photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1873337.jpg"></div>

Congratulatory texts are pasted on the base.  Do not forget about places for pictures.  Around them make beautiful frames, draw flowers.  Decorate the corners of the newspaper with appliqu√©s or painted clay hearts.  Attach it to the board and decorate with bows and balloons. </p><h2>  Together with parents </h2><p>  The do-it-yourself wall newspaper for Teacher‚Äôs Day is a kind of school printed publication with congratulations for teachers, fun and solemn poems, short humorous stories and sincere wishes.  Most often, such gifts are prepared by <span>elementary classes.</span>  Guys, of course, are still small.  Therefore, often young parents come to help them.  Students can colorize the pictures.  But adults get more difficult work. </p><h2>  Autumn notes </h2><p>  How else can I decorate a wall newspaper for Teacher's Day with my own hands?  Photo landscapes of his hometown - a great option.  Autumn notes always penetrate this holiday.  And you can draw pictures with felt-tip pens or gouache.  Imagine a forest school, whose students came to congratulate teachers.  A yellowed forest and a slightly grayish sky will look very beautiful.  Attach dried maple leaves around the perimeter.  Just do not use in any case fresh leaves.  They lose their appeal too quickly, and your work will turn out untidy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a wall newspaper for teacher‚Äôs day with your own hands" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22293/1871717.jpg" width="492"></div>

They look pretty strict and contain only quotes from great people and texts of congratulations.  Of course, typographic work will always look more stylish.  However, it is stereotyped and somehow soulless.  It is much nicer to make a wall newspaper for Teacher‚Äôs Day with your own hands.  Do not be afraid to get to work.  The result will surely please both you and those to whom this surprise is intended. </p><h2>  For the whole team or individually </h2><p>  There is not one option for making wall newspapers for Teacher's Day with your own hands.  Photos of all school teachers pasted on it must be signed.  I wish each of them happiness, health, and further creative successes.  At the bottom, add the date and class. </p><p>  And you can congratulate separately, for example, your class teacher or school principal.  Stick a photo of the recipient in the center frame.  Around - your photos.  Sign it.  Inflate balloons and write their names on each of them.  Attach them to the board each next to your photo. </p><h2>  School pearls </h2><p>  Original wall newspapers for the Teacher‚Äôs Day, made with your own hands, should be distinguished not only by warmth and gratitude, but also by your sense of humor.  You can insert quotes from school essays or ‚Äúcorona‚Äù phrases of your teachers here.  The main thing is to arrange the newspaper neatly and beautifully.  Do not doubt that among other works it will definitely stand out.  If necessary, you will take first place in the school competition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="original do-it-yourself wall newspapers for teacher's day" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1873333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In a word, Teacher‚Äôs Day is an excellent occasion to thank our beloved senior mentors, congratulate them, give cards and flowers.  Nevertheless, it will be much more pleasant for them to get something creative from you, to see how wonderful you are in using your skills, abilities, knowledge.  Such a collective present as a wall newspaper will deliver a lot of positive emotions to the heroes of the occasion.  So pick up whatman and paints - and begin to demonstrate the talent of young artists.  Markers, felt-tip pens and pencils are also useful.  Applications made from quilling look very attractive.  In general, show your imagination.  There may be many options. </p><p>  Most importantly, give this gift from the heart, from a pure heart, with love.  Your efforts will be appreciated.  Such surprises cheer up for a long time and are never forgotten.  Please people who have long been close to you.  And their happy smiles, of course, will please you too. </p>
