    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Idyros Hotel 3 * (reviews of this hotel we will analyze in one of the following sections) refers to mini-hotels with a small area.  On almost four thousand square meters everything that is necessary for guests for a good and good rest fit in. </p><p>  From the reviews of Idyros Hotel 3 * (Turkey), it becomes clear that the hotel complex was built a long time ago and cannot attract guests with a fresh design.  The hotel was commissioned in the late eighties of the last century.  However, six years ago, the hotel was undergoing renovations.  The design and concept have not changed significantly, but this was not the purpose of the administration of Idyros Hotel 3 *.  In reviews, former guests often mention that the hotel is a little lacking in new furniture and its own special style.  However, otherwise it would cease to be budgetary, which is very attractive to many of our compatriots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex has a very beautiful area.  Tourists write that it consists of a large number of green spaces that delight not only the eye, but also give coolness on a hot afternoon. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second line from the sea, so it is separated from the coast by a distance of three hundred meters. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Located Idyros Hotel 3 * in <span>Kemer.</span>  <span>Guest reviews</span> make it clear that this location is very convenient for young people and outdoor enthusiasts outside the hotel.  The hotel complex itself is located in the center of the resort area, so it‚Äôs literally close to the markets, shops and attractions of Kemer, of which there are a great many. </p><p>  Keep in mind that between the Idyros Hotel 3 *, the reviews of which we use in this article, and the sea lies along the road.  More precisely, this is a promenade, which is very convenient, because tourists do not have to cross a busy highway.  In addition, the hotel has a shuttle service to the coast. </p>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of <span>Idyros Hotel 3 * (Kemer),</span> tourists relaxing in the hotel have the opportunity to choose a beach.  Usually in tourist catalogs a small pebble municipal beach is indicated.  This is where most of the guests go.  Since the beach area is urban, sunbeds and umbrellas must be paid separately.  On average, this pleasure costs about one dollar a day.  Guests do not recommend saving on renting deck chairs, because pebbles on the beach are quite large, so lying on towels on it will not only be uncomfortable, but impossible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to sunbathe and swim on a sandy beach, then order a transfer from the hotel.  Several times a day, comfortable transport for three dollars takes tourists to the beautiful coast with fine sand.  This service also includes the cost of sunbeds, they are immediately allocated to vacationers.  Here you can also rent spacious gazebos.  However, keep in mind that transport runs on a schedule and does not make an individual transfer.  Therefore, do not miss the time of departure of the bus. </p><h2>  A bit about infrastructure </h2><p>  Photos of Idyros Hotel 3 * are always very beautiful, because almost every corner on the territory has its irresistible charm.  Many tourists say that they arranged real photo shoots without leaving the walls of the hotel.  Therefore, if you do not think of relaxing without a large number of pictures, then be sure to come to this hotel complex. </p><p>  Since the hotel territory is quite small, you should not expect a huge number of infrastructure facilities.  There are two swimming pools for guests.  The small one has a depth of no more than two meters, and the large one causes a lot of admiring reviews.  Idyros Hotel 3 * is characterized by an abundance of greenery, and the pool area is almost buried in plants, among which lemon trees stand out.  Part of the loungers is located around a rectangular bowl, and the second is in the shade of trees.  It is noteworthy that around the pools there is always a huge number of vacationers.  During the period of full settlement, some do not even have enough places in the recreation area. </p><p>  The hotel complex has one restaurant and bar, as well as a small conference room.  At the same time it accommodates up to fifty guests.  Interestingly, the hotel also has a ballroom, where you can arrange a dance party for one hundred and seventy people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The reception is open around the clock, so you can always come here with any problem.  However, not all employees speak Russian; some have to communicate only in English. </p>

    <h2>  Free services </h2><p>  If you focus on reviews about Idyros Hotel 3 * (Kemer / Turkey), then we can conclude about a small number of free services.  However, for the "three rubles" this is quite natural.  Therefore, it is necessary to be prepared for this, choosing a budget hotel for relaxation. </p><p>  We can say that from the free service you will be able to offer round-the-clock service, free use of sun loungers at the hotel and some types of entertainment. </p><h2>  Paid service </h2><p>  Reviews about Idyros Hotel 3 * (Turkey) contain information about paid services provided to guests.  For example, for a small amount of money a banquet will be organized for you.  The hotel complex employees have extensive experience in conducting such events. </p><p>  If you are worried about the safety of money and other valuables taken on vacation, then place them in any of the safes located at the reception.  However, keep in mind that they have their own work schedule, so at night you will not be able to take what you need. </p><p>  For those vacationers who rented transport for themselves, the hotel has parking.  It is able to accommodate cars of all guests of the hotel complex, so the parking can be considered quite roomy. </p><h2>  A few words about entertainment </h2><p>  If you go on vacation to Kemer to the Idyros Hotel 3 * hotel (Turkey), reviews of tourists will help you find out how you will be entertained on its territory.  I would like to say right away that lovers of traditional Turkish animation should look for another hotel complex for themselves.  There is no own animation team, so the hotel is not recommended for families. </p><p>  There is also no water slide at the hotel, which is also not suitable for families with children.  Adult guests can entertain themselves with a game of table tennis or darts.  You can also find for yourself an interesting activity on the beach.  However, please note that all water sports are paid. </p>

    <h2>  What to do with children? </h2><p>  We already mentioned that reviews about Idyros Hotel 3 * (Turkey / Kemer) do not allow us to consider this hotel complex as a family.  Most often people come here who want to see as much as possible, and spend all their free time on excursions.  Therefore, the kids at the hotel will be a little boring. </p><p>  For them, the mini club has a small playground.  However, most often it is empty.  Near the adult pool is a small children's section.  It is usually where kids spend most of the day. </p><p>  In the restaurant, parents can ask for high chairs, but a special children's menu is not provided in the food concept. </p><h2>  Useful accommodation information </h2><p>  Each hotel has a lot of its own rules that you need to know when going on vacation.  Keep in mind that this hotel has a very long check-in period.  Guests can get into the rooms from one in the afternoon until half past five in the evening.  It is unlikely that they will be able to agree on accelerated settlement even for money.  Therefore, be mentally prepared when you arrive at the hotel in the early morning, spend the whole day in the territory and only in the evening receive the treasured key from the apartment. </p><p>  Departure is from nine to eleven in the morning.  During this period, you must leave your number and pay the bills, if available. </p><p>  I would also like to say that it is not possible to accommodate children in the rooms.  The administration did not provide for the installation of additional beds.  Therefore, for the accommodation of the child, if you still decide on such a trip, you will have to pay in full. </p><p>  Do not try to stay in the room with your pets.  This is unacceptable, which is prescribed in the rules of residence in a hotel complex.  Therefore, it is better to leave your animals with relatives or friends. </p>

    <h2>  Type of food </h2><p>  If you focus on the reviews and photos of Idyros Hotel 3 * (Turkey / Kemer), then we can say with confidence that the hotel does not work on an all-inclusive basis.  He can offer his guests half board.  The concept includes breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.  Guests can also drink locally produced beverages in any quantity. </p><p>  In general, thrifty tourists rate the hotel food at four points.  Usually for breakfast, tourists choose from boiled eggs, several types of side dishes, cheeses and vegetables. </p><p>  Lunch consists of two or three types of soups (many vacationers write that they are very tasty), salads, baked grilled vegetables and sweets.  Guests can also enjoy a variety of snacks and simple meat dishes. </p><p>  An afternoon snack includes coffee and pastries.  Dinner is usually presented with the widest range of dishes for the whole day.  Therefore, none of the guests will definitely go to bed hungry. </p><p>  The only drawback of the food can be considered the fact that when the hotel is fully loaded, there is a shortage of free tables.  Because of this, queues are gathered at the entrance to the restaurant. </p>

    <h2>  Room characteristics </h2><p>  If we talk about numbers, then first of all I want to say that most of them still need updating.  However, this fact is not so fundamental and fully corresponds to the state of affairs in the budget "three rubles". </p><p>  The hotel complex provides only seventy-two rooms located in two buildings.  In general, the apartments have identical equipment and differ only in the number of beds and the view from the window.  Guests can stay in a single, double or triple room.  Often in reviews, tourists are advised to immediately ask for a room with a view of the courtyard upon check-in.  Otherwise, you may find yourself in a room overlooking the road, and it will be impossible to fall asleep in such a room.  And after checking in, you will not be able to change the apartments. </p><p>  The rooms are modestly decorated.  They have beds, a TV and air conditioning.  Also in the rooms is a mini fridge and telephone.  The bathroom is equipped with a hairdryer; of the toiletries you can find only soap. </p><p>  Most of the guests say positive about cleaning.  The maids come on request and clean very carefully.  Towels and bed linen are also changed upon request. </p><h2>  Some tips for vacationers </h2><p>  Anyone who is going on vacation to the hotel we are describing may find the advice of the Russians who have already been here useful.  What do our compatriots advise future guests of Idyros Hotel 3 *? </p><p>  Many write that when checking in it is worth asking for non-smoking rooms.  The fact is that for lack of a balcony, most of the guests smoke right in the apartment.  As a result, the walls are saturated with the smell of cigarettes, which is rather unpleasant for guests leading a healthy lifestyle. </p><p>  Since the hotel complex and Antalya International Airport are separated by more than forty kilometers, it will be advisable to order an individual transfer for yourself.  The fact is that usually the road from the airport, for example, is delayed for several hours due to the fact that transport carries tourists to different hotels.  If you want to be in the room as quickly as possible, then solve this issue at the booking stage. </p><p>  Some comments indicated that the hotel has an excellent laundry service.  Therefore, do not save and wash your clothes yourself.  Moreover, there are no clothes dryers in the apartments, and it is impossible to interrogate an iron.  For fairly modest money, your things will be put in order and perfectly ironed. </p><p>  The cost of living in a hotel complex is more than affordable.  Therefore, in this direction you can not worry about early booking.  For example, the cost of rest for ten days for two, together with the flight, ranges from sixty to seventy thousand rubles.  Many of our compatriots often acquire a similar tour as a "burning". </p>

    <h2>  Idyros Hotel 3 * in Kemer, Turkey: reviews and ratings </h2><p>  Analyzing the comments of our compatriots about their vacation in this hotel, first of all I want to dwell on its disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  lack of balconies in the rooms; </li><li>  slow Internet; </li><li>  poor air conditioning in many apartments; </li><li>  interruptions in hot water; </li><li>  rocky entrance to the sea on a pebble beach; </li><li>  almost complete lack of fruit. </li></ul><p>  After this list, you may think that you should not buy a tour to this hotel.  However, take your time until you find out about its obvious advantages: </p><ul><li>  excellent location in the center of the resort; </li><li>  clear sea; </li><li>  high-quality cleaning of rooms; </li><li>  pleasant and helpful staff; </li><li>  lack of animation; </li><li>  cozy and well-equipped pool; </li><li>  wide selection of excursions. </li></ul><p>  From all of the above, we can conclude that the hotel occupies a high place in the Kemer three-ruble rating table. </p><p>  Tourists themselves recommend this hotel complex to people without special ambitions, ready for adventure and active recreation.  We emphasize once again that it will not be very convenient here with a child of any age.  Therefore, the hotel very often positions itself as a budget complex for young people. </p>
