If you wish, you can not only make calls from it, but even work on it. </p><p>  Nokia 8310 is an ideal option for those who are looking for a real phone, without any extra options.  The device copes with its task perfectly, causes nostalgia and distinguishes the owner from the crowd.  A push-button telephone is a rarity. </p>

    <h2>  A company with a long history </h2><p>  The manufacturer of electronic devices - Nokia was previously known throughout the world.  The fame of this manufacturer penetrated almost every country.  Everyone knew that his phones were not only reliable, but also convenient.  This brand was global and produced most of the phones. </p><p>  It was hard to compete with this giant, and many lesser-known manufacturers simply left the market.  However, the long story was destined to end.  The largest manufacturer of electronic devices could not adapt to the modern market and became completely uncompetitive.  The life of this brand was bright and memorable.  There are still legends about the reliability of this company's phones, and the Nokia 8310 clearly demonstrates that the legends do not lie. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nokia was established long before the advent of mobile phones.  In the distant 1865, Frederick Idestam founded a young enterprise and built a paper product factory.  However, in just 3 years, a new plant appears.  The place for its construction was chosen successfully - near the town of Nokia.  The modern name of the company, which initially did not specialize in electronics at all, was borrowed from this city in 1871.  For the production of electronic devices is taken only in 1969.  As the first major player in this market with its own unique patents, the company is rapidly enriching itself. </p><p>  The further history of Nokia is full of ups and downs.  Decades of dominance in the mobile device market.  The production of such wonderful mobile phones as Nokia 8310, the development of a line of smartphones and touch technologies - all this brought success.  However, another young company - a little-known Apple launches an incredibly innovative product - IPhone.  Thus began the unequal competition, which Nokia finally lost by 2014. </p><p>  Today, the once great company barely keeps afloat and is unlikely to be able to regain its competitive position.  The latest line of mobile phones has been a failure in sales.  The highlight of the company was the phones similar to the Nokia 8310. These are simple and reliable devices that are almost impossible to break.  The line of touchscreen smartphones and tablet computers has brought only enormous losses. </p><h2>  Old but reliable </h2><p>  One of the most successful mobile phones of the company has the proud number 8310. This not-so-rare phone can still be found on sale, though not in every store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Typically, any telephone requires a description.  Nokia 8310 is one of those devices that are intuitive.  This is a small push-button phone that can make calls and has a very bright design.  It can not be called a boring device, because it was produced in various bright colors. </p><h2>  Not without flaws </h2><p>  There are always disadvantages.  If they are not, then they need to be found.  The weak point of this device was the photo.  Nokia 8310 has neither the main, nor the front camera. </p><p>  In 2001, the camera in a mobile phone was an innovation.  It was a rarity, and only the wealthiest people could afford it.  There was then no need to make cameras in mobile phones.  In the modern world, this element is a necessity. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, this is not the only drawback of this model.  Bulky and impractical is what makes tangible discomfort with daily use of the phone.  Carrying such a device in your pants pocket is very inconvenient. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  Battery Nokia 8310 can not boast of a record capacity, but it is more than enough for such a phone.  The power consumption of the device is minimal.  The most energy-intensive process is talking on a cellular connection.  In the continuous talk mode, the phone will last about 4 hours.  However, in standby mode, this figure will be about 350 hours.  This is quite a lot, especially if from time to time to put the device at least 10-minute charge. </p>

    <h2>  Legendary strength </h2><p>  A definite plus of the Nokia 8310 is its durability.  It's hard to break such a phone.  Dropping it accidentally on asphalt or concrete slabs, you can not worry about the integrity of the body.  The device transfers not only falls from a small height, but also from the third floor and can even withstand the weight of the car.  As a rule, all mechanical damage is only cosmetic and does not affect the functionality of the phone. </p>
