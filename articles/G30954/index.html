Just think, because today you can get from one corner of the planet to a completely different one even in a day.  Every day, millions of passengers travel by plane over such distances that 200 years ago it was hard to even dream of.  And all this became possible thanks to brave and purposeful people who once made a sea voyage around the world.  Who was the first to take such a brave step?  How did it all go?  What are the results?  Read about it and not only in our article. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Of course, people did not immediately cross the globe.  It all started with small trips on ships that were less reliable and faster than modern ones.  In the 16th century Europe, the production of goods and trade reached such a level that there was an objective need to search for new markets.  But first of all - the search for new sources of useful and accessible resources.  In addition to economic aspects, a suitable political situation has developed. </p><p>  In the XV century, trade turnover in the Mediterranean Sea fell sharply in connection with the fall of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul).  The ruling dynasties of the most developed countries set their subjects to find the shortest route to Asia, Africa and India.  The last country at that time was considered truly a country of treasures.  Travelers of those times described India as a country where gold and precious stones cost nothing, and the number of spices so expensive in Europe was unlimited. </p><p>  By the sixteenth century, the technical component was also at the required level.  New ships could carry more cargo, and the use of devices such as a compass and a barometer made it possible to move far from the coast over considerable distances.  Of course, these were not pleasure yachts, therefore the military equipment of the ships was of great importance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The leader among the countries of Western Europe at the end of the 15th century was Portugal.  Her scientists mastered knowledge of the ebb and flow, about the currents and the effects of wind.  Cartography has developed rapidly. </p><p>  You can divide the era of the great sea voyages around the world into two stages: </p><ul><li>  Stage number 1: The end of the XV - the middle of the XVI century - Spanish-Portuguese travel. </li></ul><p>  It was at this stage that such great events as the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus and the first round-the-world trip of Fernand Magellan took place. </p><ul><li>  Stage number 2: Mid XVI - mid XVII century - Russian-Dutch period </li></ul><p>  This includes the exploration of North Asia by Russians, discoveries in North America, and discovery of Australia.  Among those who traveled around the world were scientists, military, pirates and even representatives of the ruling dynasties.  All of them were outstanding and outstanding personalities. </p><h2>  Fernan Magellan and the first trip around the world </h2><p>  If we talk about who made the first trip around the world, then the story should begin with Fernand Magellan.  This voyage from the beginning did not bode well.  After all, even immediately before the departure, most of the team refused to obey.  But nevertheless, this happened and played a huge role in history. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.descopera.ro" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.descopera.ro/istorie/14902124-exploratorul-care-a-facut-pentru-prima-data-inconjurul-lumii"><img itemprop="image" alt="sailor around the world travel" class="if uuid-2397275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397275.jpg"></div><h2>  Start of travel </h2><p>  At the end of the summer of 1519, five ships left the port of Seville for a voyage without a specific purpose, as they then believed.  The idea that the earth could be round caused, to put it mildly, distrust of most people.  Therefore, Magellan's venture seemed no more than an attempt to curry favor with the crown.  Accordingly, people filled with fear periodically made attempts to disrupt the journey. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to the fact that on board one of the ships was a man who carefully entered all the events in the diary, the details of this first round-the-world trip reached the contemporaries.  The first serious skirmish occurred near the Canary Islands.  Magellan decided to change course, but did not warn and did not inform the rest of the captains about this.  There was a riot, which was quickly put out.  The instigator was thrown into the hold in shackles.  Discontent grew, and soon a new riot was organized demanding a return.  Magellan proved himself to be a very tough captain.  The instigator of the new riot was immediately executed.  On the second day, two other ships attempted to arbitrarily return.  Captains of both ships were shot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ccm.marinha.pt" data-author=": " data-source="http://ccm.marinha.pt/pt/museumarinha_web/multimedia_web/Paginas/primeira-viagem-de-circum-navegacao-do-globo-terrestre.aspx"><img itemprop="image" alt="Travel around the world" class="if uuid-2397279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397279.jpg"></div><h2>  Achievements </h2><p>  One of Magellan's goals was to prove that there is a strait in South America.  In the fall, ships reached the modern shores of Argentina, Cape Virgines, which opened the way for ships to the strait.  The fleet went through it in 22 days.  The captain of another ship took advantage of this time.  He turned his ship back home.  Having overcome the strait, Magellan‚Äôs ships fell into the ocean, which they decided to call the Pacific.  Surprisingly, in the four months the team traveled across the Pacific Ocean, the weather has never deteriorated.  It was pure luck, because in most cases it cannot be called Quiet. </p><p>  After the discovery of the Strait of Magellan, a four-month test awaited the team.  All this time they wandered around the ocean, not having met a single inhabited island or a piece of land.  Only in the spring of 1521 ships finally docked on the shores of the Philippine Islands.  So Fernand Magellan and his team first crossed the Pacific Ocean. </p><p>  Relations with the local population did not immediately go smoothly.  Magellan's team received an unexpectedly hospitable welcome on the island of Mactan (Cebu), but was involved in tribal feuds.  As a result of the clashes on April 27, 1521, Captain Fernand Magellan was killed.  The Spaniards overestimated their capabilities and opposed the enemy, surpassing them in numbers many times over.  In addition, the team was greatly exhausted by the journey.  The body of Fernand Magellan was not returned to the team.  Now on the <span>island of Cebu</span> there is a monument to the great traveler. </p><p>  Only 18 returned from a team of 260 people to Spain. Five ships left the Philippines, of which only the Victoria ship reached Spain.  This was the first vessel in history to have traveled around the world. </p><h2>  Captain Pirate Francis Drake </h2><p>  No matter how strange it may sound, one of the most notable roles in the history of navigation was played by a pirate.  In addition, this seafarer, who traveled around the world for the second time in history, was also in the official service of the Queen of England.  His fleet defeated the Invincible Armada.  The man who was the second to travel around the world, navigator <span>Francis Drake</span> went down in history as a pirate captain and fully confirmed his status. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="this seafarer has traveled around the world" class="if uuid-2397285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397285.jpg"></div><h2>  Formation history </h2><p>  In those days when the slave trade was not yet prosecuted by Britain by law, Captain Francis Drake began his activities.  He transported "black gold" from Africa to the countries of the New World.  But in 1567 the Spaniards attacked his ships.  Drake came out alive from that story, but a thirst for revenge swept him to the end of his life.  A new stage begins in his life, when he alone attacks the coastal cities and scores the ships of the Spanish crown to the bottom. </p><p>  In 1575, a pirate was introduced to the queen.  Elizabeth I offered the pirate service on the crown in exchange for financing his expedition.  The only official document that Drake represents the Queen‚Äôs interests was never issued to him.  The main reason for this was that, despite the official purpose of the trip, England pursued completely different interests.  Initially, losing Spain in the development of land overseas, the queen made insidious plans.  Its goal was to slow down as much as possible the advancement of the expansion of Spain.  Drake was going to rob. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.history.com" data-author=": The Print Collector, "><img itemprop="image" alt="round the world who is the first" class="if uuid-2397286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397286.jpg"></div><p>  The results of the Drake expedition exceeded all expectations.  In addition to the fact that the Spaniards' confidence in their superiority at sea was pretty much undermined, Drake made a series of important discoveries.  First, it became clear that Tierra del Fuego is not part of Antarctica.  Secondly, he discovered <span>the Drake Channel,</span> separating Antarctica and the Pacific Ocean.  He was the second in history to travel around the world, but was able to return from it alive.  And also very wealthy. </p><p>  Upon the return of Captain Francis Drake, knighting awaited.  So the pirate, the robber became the queen's knight.  He became the national hero of England, who was able to replace the fleet of the arrogant Spain. </p><h2>  Invincible armada </h2><p>  Anyway, but Drake only slightly besieged the ardor of the Spaniards.  In general, they still dominated the sea.  To fight the British, the Spaniards created the so-called Invincible Armada.  It was a fleet of 130 ships, the main purpose of which was the invasion of England and the elimination of pirates.  The irony is that the Invincible Armada in fact received a deafening defeat.  And largely thanks to Drake, who at that time was already an admiral.  He always had flexible thinking, used tactics and cunning, more than once putting the enemy in a difficult position with his actions.  Then, using the confusion, to strike with lightning speed. </p><p>  <span>The defeat of the Invincible Armada</span> was the last glorious fact in the biography of a pirate.  After he failed the mission of the crown to capture Lisbon, for which he fell out of favor and was 55 years old sent to the New World.  Drake did not survive this trip.  Near the coast of Panama, a pirate fell ill with dysentery, where he was buried at the bottom of the sea, dressed in battle armor, in a lead coffin. </p><h2>  James Cook </h2><p>  The man who made himself.  He went from young to captain and made a number of important geographical discoveries, having made three round-the-world sea voyages. </p><p>  Born in 1728 in Yorkshire, England.  Already at the age of 18 he became a young man.  Always very sensitive to the issues of self-education.  He was interested in cartography, mathematics and geography.  Since 1755, he served in the Royal Navy.  He took part in the Seven Years War and, as a reward for years of work, received the rank of captain on the ship "Newfoundland".  This sailor traveled around the world three times.  Their results were reflected in the further history of human development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocketmags.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first trip around the world" class="if uuid-2397289" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397289.jpg"></div><p>  Around the world in the period from 1768 to 1771: </p><ul><li>  He proved the assumption that New Zealand (NZ) is not one island, but two separate ones.  In 1770, he discovered the strait between the North and South islands.  The strait was named after him. </li><li>  The first to pay attention to the study of the natural resources of the NZ, as a result of which he came to the conclusion about the high potential of using it as a dependent territory of Great Britain. </li><li>  Carefully mapped the eastern coast of mainland Australia.  In 1770, his ship went around <span>Cape York.</span>  On the east side, a bay was discovered where Australia's largest city, Sydney, is now located. </li></ul><p>  Around the world in the period from 1772 to 1775: </p><ul><li>  The first ever crossed the Antarctic Circle in 1773. </li><li>  The first to observe and mention in reports about such a thing as aurora. </li><li>  In the years 1774-1775 discovered many islands off the coast of Australia. </li><li>  Cook was the first to demonstrate the Southern Ocean. </li><li>  He suggested the existence of Antarctica, as well as the low potential for its use. </li></ul><p>  Swimming from 1776 to 1779: </p><ul><li>  The reopening in 1778 of the Hawaiian Islands. </li><li>  Cook was the first to explore the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea. </li></ul><p>  The journey ended in Hawaii with the death of Captain Cook himself.  The attitude of the locals was unfriendly, which, in principle, given the purpose of the Cook's visit, is quite logical.  As a result of another conflict in 1779, Captain Cook was killed. </p><p>  It is interesting!  For the first time, the concepts of ‚Äúkangaroo‚Äù and ‚Äútaboo‚Äù came from residents of Cook's side notes to residents of the Old World. </p><h2>  Charles Robert Darwin </h2><p>  Charles Robert Darwin was not so much a traveler as a great scientist, who became the founder of the theory of natural selection.  For constant research, traveled around the world, including including sea voyage around the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who made the first trip around the world" class="if uuid-2397295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397295.jpg"></div><p>  In 1831, he was invited to participate in a journey around the world on a Beagle ship.  The team needed naturalists.  The circumnavigation lasted five years.  This journey in history is on a par with the discoveries of Columbus and Magellan. </p><h2>  South America </h2><p>  The first part of the world on the expedition was South America.  In January 1831, ships reached the coast of Chile, where Darwin conducted a series of studies on coastal cliffs.  According to the results of these studies, it turned out that the hypothesis of changes taking place gradually in the world, distributed over very long time periods (the theory of geological changes), is true.  At that time, this was a completely new theory. </p><p>  Having been in Brazil, near the city of Salvador, Darwin spoke of her as a "land of fulfillment of desires."  What could not be said about the Argentine Patagonia, where the researcher went, further moving south.  Although the desert landscapes did not fascinate him, it was in Patagonia that the fossilized remains of huge mammals, similar to sloths and anteaters, were discovered.  It was then that Darwin suggested that the change in the size of animals depends on a change in their living conditions. </p><p>  During the exploration of Chile, the great scientist Charles Darwin repeatedly crossed the Andean mountains.  Having studied them, he was extremely surprised that they consisted of flows of petrified lava.  In addition, the scientist focused on differences in the composition of flora and fauna in different climatic zones. </p><p>  Probably the most important event for the whole sea voyage around the world was the visit by Darwin of the Galapagos Islands in 1835.  Here Darwin first saw many unique species that do not live anywhere else on the planet.  Of course, the most powerful impression on him was made by giant turtles.  The scientist noted such a feature: related, but not the same species of plants and animals lived on neighboring islands. </p><h2>  Pacific Research </h2><p>  Having explored the fauna of New Zealand, Charles Darwin was left with an indelible impression.  The scientist was surprised by such flightless birds as a kiwi or an owl parrot.  The remains of moa, the largest birds that lived on our planet, were found right there.  Unfortunately, moas completely disappeared from the face of the earth as early as the 18th century. </p><p>  In 1836, this navigator, who traveled around the world, landed in Sydney.  In addition to the English architecture of the city, nothing attracted much attention of the researcher, since the vegetation was very uniform.  At the same time, Darwin could not help but note such unique animals as the kangaroo and the platypus. </p><p>  In 1836, swimming around the world was over.  The great scientist Charles Darwin began to systematize the collected material, and in 1839 he saw the light of the "Diary of a Naturalist's Surveys", which was later continued by the famous book on the origin of species. </p><h2>  The first Russian round-the-world trip 1803-1806 by Ivan Kruzenshtern </h2><p>  In the XIX century, the Russian Empire also entered the arena of marine research.  Round-the-world travels of Russian sailors began precisely with the travel of Ivan Ivanovich Kruzenshtern.  He was one of the founders of Russian oceanology, served as admiral.  Largely thanks to him, the formation of the Russian Geographical Society took place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian navigator who has traveled around the world" class="if uuid-2397298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397298.jpg"></div><h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  The first sea voyage around the world took place in 1803-1806.  The Russian navigator who traveled around the world with him, but did not receive the same fame, was Yuri Lisyansky, who took command of one of the two ships of the world expedition.  Krusenstern repeatedly filed requests to finance a trip to the Admiralty, but they never received approval.  And most likely, the round-the-world trip of Russian sailors would not have taken place, if not for the financial benefit of the highest ranks. </p><p> At this time, developing trade relations with Alaska.  Business is super profitable.  But the problem is the road, which takes five years.  A private Russian-American company sponsored the Kruzenshtern expedition.  Approval was received from Emperor Alexander the First himself, also a member of the shareholders.  The emperor approved the request in 1802, adding to the purpose of the trip the assignment of the embassy of the Russian Empire to Japan. </p><p>  We sailed on two ships.  Kruzenshtern and Yuri Lisyansky, his closest comrade, led the ships. </p><h2>  Travel itinerary and its results </h2><p>  From Kronstadt, the ships were heading to Copenhagen.  During the trip, the expedition visited England, Tenerife, Brazil, Chile (Easter Island), and Hawaii.  Then the ships went to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Japan, Alaska and China.  The last points were Portugal, the Azores and the United Kingdom. </p><p>  Exactly three years and twelve days later, sailors entered the port of Kronstadt. </p><p>  Results of sea voyage: </p><ul><li>  The first time the Russians crossed the equator. </li><li>  The shores of Sakhalin Island were mapped. </li><li>  Kruzenshtern published the Atlas of the South Sea. </li><li>  Refined maps of the Pacific Ocean. </li><li>  In the science of Russia, knowledge about inter-trade winds has formed. </li><li>  For the first time, water measurements were taken at a depth of up to 400 meters. </li><li>  There are data on atmospheric pressure, tides. </li></ul><p>  The great navigator traveled around the world, and subsequently became director of the Naval Cadet Corps. </p><h2>  Konstantin Konstantinovich Romanov </h2><p>  <span>Grand Duke Konstantin</span> Konstantinovich was born in 1858.  His father was Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich, who recreated the Russian fleet after the Crimean campaign.  From childhood, his mission was maritime service.  <span>The round-the-world trip of the</span> Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich took place in 1874.  At that time he was a midshipman. </p><p>  The Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich set a world tour for himself as he was one of the most educated people of that era.  He was interested to see the whole world.  The prince was fond of art in all its manifestations.  He wrote poems, many of which were put to music by the greatest classics of our time.  His beloved friend and mentor was the poet A. A. Fat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--h1aagokeh.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich travel around the world" class="if uuid-2397301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2397301.jpg"></div><p>  In total, the Grand Duke devoted fifteen years to serving the navy, while remaining a true admirer of art.  Even on a trip around the world, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich took with him the painting ‚ÄúMoonlit Night on the Dnieper‚Äù, acting on it magically, despite the threat to its safety. </p><p>  Grand Duke Constantine died in 1915, unable to stand the test of fate.  By that time, one of his sons was killed in the war, and he still could not recover from the blow. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The era of great <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyages</span> and discoveries lasted more than 300 years.  During this time, the world was changing rapidly.  New knowledge, new skills appeared that contributed to the rapid development of all branches of science.  So more perfect vessels and devices appeared.  At the same time, ‚Äúwhite spots‚Äù disappeared from the cards.  And all this thanks to the exploits of desperate seafarers, outstanding people of their time, brave and desperate.  One can easily answer the question of which seafarer made the first trip around the world, but the whole essence of the discoveries is such that each of the trips is important in its own way.  Each of the travelers has contributed to the world that surrounds us today.  The opportunity to travel today, and if desired, to repeat the interesting and fascinating path of any of them, but in more comfortable conditions, is their merit. </p>
