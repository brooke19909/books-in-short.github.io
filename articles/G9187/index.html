Today, next to the old estate are modern residential buildings.  The entire territory of the estate is one large museum.  The estate "Ivanovo" (Podolsk) has gone through difficult times.  Its first owners were representatives of the Kamensky clan.  Then the estate passed into the possession of the Golovin clan. </p><p>  The first reorganization of the estate took place at the beginning of the 19th century under Count Fedor Tolstoy, who had a weakness for antiques and flowers. </p><h2>  The appearance of the estate </h2>

    <p>  Over the entire period of its existence, the estate was passed from hand to hand to noble people an incredible number of times.  All of them rebuilt it to their liking.  Initially, the estate was a two-story building with six columns.  The facade, fortified by a stone terrace, looked at the river.  The center of the ground floor was occupied by a huge hall with several types of lighting.  On the walls there was a magnificent stucco molding. </p><p>  The estate, built in the classical style, is located at the very top of the slope to the river.  Before the main building there is a park with a huge terrace in the form of a stalls.  Its central part is competently planned and represents a harmonious composition.  Limes mainly grow here.  Their height reaches 22 meters.  Sometimes there are spruces and elms.  A separate part of the park is planted with <span>weeping birch trees.</span>  There are also young stands (balsam poplar, horse chestnut).  In order to restore the former look of the park, it is necessary to completely re-plan it and plant it with new plants.  Today it is only fragmentary plantations that do not convey the atmosphere of the past.  The only things that can be preserved from old trees are linden and larch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Estate under Fedor Tolstoy </h2><p>  At the end of the 18th century, Count Fyodor Tolstoy passed into the possession of the Ivanovo estate (Podolsk).  Photo, unfortunately, does not reflect the unique atmosphere that reigned under the graph.  Tolstoy had a weakness for Slavic manuscripts and early printed books.  During his lifetime, a unique library was collected.  The Count‚Äôs wife was S. A. Durasova, whose grandfather was a famous gold miner.  Having received a huge dowry for the bride, Tolstoy decided to erect a whole architectural complex.  Ivanovskoye (the estate, Podolsk) acquired completely different outlines. </p>

    <p>  It was under Tolstoy that a two-story house was built here with two protruding outbuildings.  On the level with the house, a greenhouse with a room in which theatrical performances were held was broken.  A picturesque park in the English style extended directly along the Pakhra River.  In the same territory, a house was built for the estate manager.  Near the main house there were buildings for household needs and a stable. </p><h2>  A. A. Zakrevsky - the new owner of the estate </h2><p>  It was Zakrevsky who decided to build a house church in the eastern wing of the estate.  Previously, there was a theater there, which had to be moved to the western wing between the main house of the estate and the outbuilding.  The manor was under construction for a long 50 years.  And only by the middle of the 19th century that architectural ensemble that can be observed today was formed.  In the center of the estate rises a house of three floors.  The decorative design of the facade, undoubtedly, deserves attention.  The portico with six columns of the <span>Corinthian order,</span> framed by balconies and arcades of the main entrance, stands out especially.  The front view is given by the wings in the form of wings, as well as the painted wings on the sides that reflect the motives of the architecture of the ancient Pallas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Ivanovo" (manor, Podolsk) is a real work of art.  A more magnificent building in the area is simply not to be found.  The special splendor of the classic Russian style is the whole splendor of this architectural ensemble. </p>

    <p>  "Ivanovo" is a manor (Podolsk), in which magnificent balls and theatrical performances were often held.  Many writers of those times noted the particular popularity of this estate with the local nobility.  In their works it was said that almost all of Moscow gathered at Ivanovskoye.  All this thanks to the mistress of the estate - Countess A.F. Zakrevskaya, who superbly managed the household, was a good-natured person and, moreover, possessed captivating beauty.  Her image inspired all poets and writers of that era. </p><h2>  Theater </h2><p>  A special role in the life of the estate was played by the theater.  At that time, he was considered one of the best in the whole territory of the Moscow Region.  The countess, with her characteristic excellent taste, designed the theater herself.  Dramatic art was the weakness of the mistress of the house.  Therefore, she often invited artists of the Maly Theater to perform on the stage of her house.  Various plays based on classical works were staged here, for example, Shakespeare's ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù, ‚ÄúWoe from Wit‚Äù by Griboedov and many others.  Theatrical productions were attended not only by professional artists, but also guests of the estate. </p><h2>  New estate life </h2><p>  In 1859, Count Zakrevsky received his resignation and decided to leave with his wife for Italy.  "Ivanovo" (estate, Podolsk) passes into the possession of Countess Keller.  The new mistress was fond of the selection of tropical plants, which safely grew in a private greenhouse.  But to save the estate the countess was not able to.  She had to transfer it for debts to the Bakhrushin family. </p><h2>  Latest Owners </h2>

    <p>  Today in the museum exposition you can see a whole section dedicated to Bakhrushin.  There are photographs of several generations of this kind. </p><p>  The famous artist V. Borisov-Musatov often liked visiting new owners of the estate.  Some of his masterpieces, such as Requiem, Sketch for Frescoes, were painted in a local park.  This is recorded in the letters of the owner of the estate addressed to N. S. Yablonev - the chief local historian of Podolsk. </p><p>  Some reproductions of the artist‚Äôs paintings are also on display at the museum.  Looking at them, one can imagine how the personal park looked in those days. </p><p>  Bakhrushins were the last owners of the estate.  Then it passed into the hands of the Moscow city government.  The latter organized a children's shelter colony here. </p><h2>  Homestead today </h2><p>  The Bolsheviks played a huge role in the life of the estate.  For a long time there was a hostel in the estate building.  Today, there are several museums here.  The <span>museum of local lore of Podolsk</span> is located in the western wing <span>,</span> and the building is occupied by the Federal Museum of Professional Education.  This place is also famous for the fact that here you can legitimize your relationship and have a great photo shoot.  Recently, the big top circus in Podolsk (Ivanovskoe estate) showed its best performances. </p>

    <p>  This place even became the beginning of a new life for one of the circus artists.  It was here that the tiger cub was born.  This is an incredible event, since children from the union of a tigress and a lion appear extremely rarely.  The circus in Podolsk in the Ivanovskoye estate can remind someone of the former splendor of this place.  After all, magnificent balls were constantly held here, theatrical performances were staged, and famous creative people visited.  And although today all these are just memories, nevertheless, such events give some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow life went on here before. </p><p>  Here is such a difficult story is the estate "Ivanovo" in Podolsk. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The estate is located on the outskirts of Podolsk.  You can get here directly from the railway station by bus number 4. You need to go to the final one. </p><p>  Today, the estate cannot boast of its former splendor.  In a special desolation are the greenhouse and the private park. </p>
