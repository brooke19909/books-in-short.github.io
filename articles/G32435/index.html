By the way, in the pool almost every day water polo competitions are organized, as well as classes in water aerobics. </p><p>  There are quite large water slides that will appeal to both you and your child.  The water park works almost every day, so you are guaranteed a vivid experience and sincere fun. </p><p>  Fans of sports activities are invited to a large gym, furnished with a sufficient amount of modern working equipment.

And the question of the availability of certain amenities in such cases becomes extremely important.  So what can <span>Club Hotel</span> Sidelya HV offer a child tourist? </p><p>  In fact, there are many ways to entertain the baby, but perhaps it‚Äôs worth starting with some technical points.  Of course, immediately after checking in, a crib will be brought to your room if necessary.  In the restaurant, polite waiters will offer a chair for feeding to the smallest guest.  Another important issue is nutrition.  There is no special children's menu in the restaurant, but this is not a problem.  Among the abundance of food and drinks, it is very easy to choose wholesome and tasty food for the child, so do not worry. </p>
