This question interests many.  And far from always directly beneficiaries.  In practice, relatives of older people deal with this issue in order to avoid paying taxes on an apartment.  But is it worth it?  Do people who have gone on a well-deserved rest really have certain privileges regarding real estate and property in general?  It‚Äôs worth talking about.  After all, the nuances of our today's question are not known to everyone.  Most often, no one is aware of them. </p>

    <h2>  Do they always pay </h2><p>  First you need to find out if there are benefits for pensioners regarding <span>property taxes (apartments)</span> or not.  If not, in what cases is it worth making the appropriate payments. </p><p>  Answering this question is sometimes not easy.  After all, much depends on the specific situation.  Property tax (apartments, houses, cottages) is a very delicate point in Russian law.  And to draw the appropriate conclusions only with all the attendant circumstances. </p><p>  In any case, one can say for sure - the apartment tax for pensioners, in principle, exists.  But it is not always paid.  And there are many points that help you get benefits or completely free you from paying.  With all of this you will get to know further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Property </h2><p>  For example, there is a so-called property tax.  Among the population, it is better known as property tax.  Most often applies to apartments and houses.  Requires annual tax payments from taxpayers. </p>

    <p>  But not in our case.  The apartment tax for pensioners (property) is completely absent.  In any case.  Only few know about it.  And the tax authorities continue to send from year to year the relevant payment documents that are paid.  To stop this phenomenon, it is necessary, as a rule, to make a statement and evidence of their benefits.  Remember, pensioners are not currently paying property tax.  Never ever.  With no exceptions. </p><h2>  Workers purchase </h2><p>  The next situation that may concern real estate is its purchase.  Very often, citizens are entitled to a deduction from the transaction.  And the tax when buying an apartment by a pensioner is not paid.  Elderly workers are entitled to a deduction for the specified time period. </p><p>  This is a very simple process.  For him, he will have to present all the declarations, as well as certificates of expenses, of the right of ownership.  And you will receive 13% of the completed transaction back. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In practice, this feature is used very often.  Nobody wants to miss her.  But it is advisable to hurry - the pensioner will have only 3 years to fulfill the request for a tax deduction from the purchase of an apartment.  After this period, such a right is burned out.  And it will not work in any way. </p><h2>  For the unemployed </h2><p>  By the way, apartment tax for pensioners who do not work, also has its own nuances.  If an elderly person suddenly buys real estate, then he can receive, as in the above case, the corresponding deduction.  In this situation, you will have to take into account many conditions. </p><p>  For example, you can apply for a deduction for any year prior to the purchase, but not more than 3 years.  In addition, you are entitled to a refund of 13% of the transaction.  And while the maximum amount of deduction cannot exceed 2 million rubles.  These are the rules that exist in modern law. </p>

    <p>  Keep in mind that if a citizen who has gone on a well-deserved rest does not buy land, he should pay all taxes in full.  In this regard, the state does not give any concessions.  Land tax is paid in full by all taxpayers.  And no matter who you are - a senior citizen or a working citizen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sale </h2><p>  Often, older people agree to sell their property.  This is a common case.  And many are wondering whether it is necessary to pay <span>tax on the sale of apartments to</span> pensioners.  After all, such citizens do not pay property contributions! </p><p>  It does not change anything.  Property tax (real estate) has nothing to do with the contract of sale.  According to modern laws, all taxpayers must pay income taxes.  That is, those that are accrued for income received by citizens. </p><p>  No one exempts pensioners from them.  It turns out that even the elderly should pay full income tax.  It appears when selling real estate or any other property.  Dodging him does not work.  In Russia, this rule applies to all taxpayers. </p>

    <h2>  How much to pay </h2><p>  How to calculate apartment tax?  Everything is very easy and simple.  We have already found out that when buying an apartment all pensioners have the right to regain a certain amount of funds spent on the transaction.  And what about the sale?  How much to pay?  What will be the apartment tax in this case?  The calculation is extremely simple. </p><p>  It is enough to turn to modern legislation.  In Russia, income tax, as you know, leaves 13%.  Just this amount from the transaction will have to be transferred to the tax authorities.  There is a slight exception to the rule when this payment does not make any sense or legal basis.  And not only in relation to pensioners.  But about him a little later. </p><p>  What amount do you need to ‚Äúbuild on‚Äù from?  There are 2 different property values ‚Äã‚Äã- cadastral and market.  In this sense, it is difficult to answer.  According to the laws, a deduction of 13% should be made at the <span>cadastral value of the</span> apartment.  But the tax authorities believe otherwise.  And they require recalculation at the market price of the apartment.  Do not settle for this, this is a direct violation of your rights.  Remember, calculations are carried out only at the cadastral value.  From these data it is necessary to ‚Äúbuild on‚Äù pensioners. </p>

    <h2>  Exception to the rule </h2><p>  What exception were we talking about?  Apartment tax for retirees may not be available upon sale.  This has already been said.  But one holy rule must be observed.  Which one? </p><p>  The property must be owned by an elderly person for at least 3 years.  It is advisable that this period be longer.  In this case, the income tax from the transaction is not paid.  So, there will be no monetary penalties from a pensioner when selling an apartment.  Very good news for those who for a long time did not dare to make such a deal.  All funds received from you will be in full.  There is nothing difficult to understand in this.  Just remember - for the sale of an apartment without paying taxes for the transaction you will have to wait at least 3 years from the date of acquisition thereof. </p><h2>  How to apply for benefits </h2><p>  The last question remains.  We figured out when there is a tax on the apartment.  Benefits are also provided to pensioners.  To get them, you must contact the <span>tax office</span> with a specific list of documents.  And claim your rights.  What is the order of treatment?  What do you need to get real estate benefits for retirees?  Take with you: </p><ul><li>  application for a discount (if there are several possible options for obtaining a tax discount, only one is selected); </li><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  bank account details (for deduction); </li><li>  documents confirming your preferential rights; </li><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  certificates of income and payment of pensions; </li><li>  certificates of ownership. </li></ul>

    <p>  It's all.  A full list of documents should be contacted by the tax authorities at your place of residence (or residence).  And you will be given the proper privileges.  If you need to apply for a deduction of funds for property tax, then attach all payment documents and declarations confirming the overpayment to all of the above papers.  For the last 3 years.  That's all.  Now we know everything about tax contributions for pensioners regarding apartments and real estate in general.  By the way, when it comes to transport tax, older people, as a rule, pay only 10% of the amount indicated in the document.  Or nothing at all if the machine is equipped with a low-power engine. </p>
