    <p>  The number of loops should be calculated based on the circumference of the leg.  Two measurements should be taken: </p><p>  The first is the circumference of the lift.  It is only necessary to measure the foot from the heel to climb on an inclined plane.  Measurement is carried out by a usual centimeter. </p><p>  The second is the circumference of the leg itself.  This measurement is determined at the foot, where the thinnest place of the leg is located, above the bone. </p><p>  Now that all the measurements have been taken, you need to determine the average circumference: add up the circumference of the lift and the circumference of the leg and divide the resulting figure into two. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, let's take the size of the lifting circumference - 31 cm, and the circumference of the legs - 21 cm. We add 31 and 21, it turns out 52, and 52 we divide by two, it turns out 26 cm. This is the number of centimeters that will be used to calculate set of loops.  It is best that the resulting number of loops be rounded to the number that could be divided into four.  This is done so that the loops can be conveniently distributed on four knitting needles. </p><h2>  Constant </h2><p>  Learn how to knit 5-spoke socks.  You need to dial the number of loops that you need to work.  Then - distribute them into four knitting needles.  And knit the rubber band with a circular viscous.  As a rule, the length of an elastic band is five to six centimeters, but it‚Äôs realistic to make a little more or a little less - which of the knitters wants to.  After that, you need to knit about seven centimeters to the heel of the front viscous.  Heel knit using two knitting needles and half loops.  But the second half should remain on the knitting needles that are not currently involved in knitting. </p>

    <p>  Using two loops, you need to knit a regular canvas with a viscous face - from five and a half to six centimeters.  This will be the height of the heel.  Depending on what kind of leg lift, it can be a little smaller.  If you look at the legs from the 35th size, the height will be a constant value.  The knitting pattern of the sock gives a detailed description of each action of the craftswoman. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now, to shape the heel, you need to make a descent.  This is done in this way: all the loops should be divided into three parts.  If you get extra loops, they can be attached to the part located in the center (this is if the number of loops cannot be divided into three).  Further actions are as follows: the loops related to the central part must be knitted further, but the loops that belong to the lateral parts (it is from them that the sides of the heel are obtained), a little later they will join little by little to the loops of the central part. </p><h2>  Turn back and forth </h2><p>  How to knit socks on 5 needles?  Just read this article carefully.  At this stage, you can start the loop down from the inside out, and it ends on the front side.  Two-thirds of the stitches must be tied with purl, then two stitches together - the last stitch from the part located in the center, and the first stitch from the third part - they must be cropped together. </p><p>  Now you need to turn your knitting over and knit along the front of the heel.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the first chain must be removed at this turn, but it is not necessary to knit it. </p>

    <p>  Now there is knitting with the front loops of the last loop of the part located in the center, and the first loop of the first part must be knitted together with a broach (the first loop must be removed, and the next - knit the front, and then the removed loop is thrown to the knitted one).  And again, you need to turn the knitting, remove the first chain, without knitting it, and so on. </p><h2>  Knitting in a circle </h2><p>  Next, you need to continue knitting until all side loops are closed.  Now you need to loop from the side of the heel.  From two rows, you need to dial three loops, that is, from each second row you need to dial one loop and one additional loop.  That's how socks fit.  The knitting description gives detailed information on what and how to do it. </p><p>  You can go to knitting in a circle.  The stitches from the knitting needles that were put off earlier enter again, the again stitched stitches from the side parts of the heel and the stitches of the part of the heel located in the center.  It is necessary to knit one row with the help of facial knitting.  Now, in every second circular row, in order for the heel to fit as best as possible, you should knit the third and second stitches from the end of the first knitting needle immediately with the front stitch and the second and third stitches of the fourth knitting needle simultaneously. </p><h2>  From decrease to completion </h2><p>  Now we need to make reductions until we can count the initial number of stitches on the knitting needles (that is, as many as were typed before starting work).  And you can begin to knit the foot, performing its facial viscous.  The work goes in a circle - either to the tip of the little finger, or to the bone of the thumb.  After you need to tie the toe of the sock. </p>

    <p>  The loops must be reduced correctly.  This is done like this: in every second row, knit the third and second stitches from the end of the first and third knitting needles together with the front stitches.  And knit the second and third loops from the second and fourth knitting needles together with a broach. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, only half of the stitches remain on the knitting needles.  These reductions must be performed in each circular row, up to the last four stitches.  They must be pulled together and secured.  And so ends the knitting of men's socks. </p>
