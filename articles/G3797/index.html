The smallest, from the age of 4, are identified on children's tracks.  An adult family member or instructor is always with them.  Usually these are very light tracks.  The nursery is half a meter above the ground, and the passage of a child through it represents a game in which there are small obstacles.  In the rope park "Walnut" there are family runs where the participants are adults and children of sports families.  Sports and extreme pass participants individually.  There is a "black track" in the park, similar to skiing, it is very difficult, and well-trained and bold climbers can pass it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="norwegian rope park walnut" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1848552.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  Do not despair if in the middle of the track it became scary or lost your nerves, there is always the opportunity to get off the stage of passing.  This will help the instructor.  In the rope park "Nut" (St. Petersburg) there are such routes, there are 38 of them, where people literally fly at an altitude of 25 meters above the ground.  These flights are carried out thanks to trolls coming from the tower.  From here begins the start of several tracks.  It‚Äôs scary to fly right away, but even those who were afraid of heights still decide on these flights.  The longest flight from one top of the tree to another has a length of 200 meters.  On this route, participants receive a jump in adrenaline.  The thrill will be on small spans of 50-150 meters <strong>.</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rope park walnut in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1848554.jpg" width="445"></div>

It should be non-slippery and with a rubberized toe. </p><p>  Without safety belts, cables and other devices no one is allowed on the track.  Human safety is the first rule.
