But even if not masterly, then there are certain skills!  Hem the curtains, sew a stitched seam on clothes, fold a sheet or the edge of a towel - all these are very important skills!  And someone earns a living by such a job, creating a wardrobe for children and adults. </p><p>  In short, almost every house has a sewing machine, and they store it very carefully, protecting it from dust, pollution or any damage. </p><p>  The needlewomen had a hand in here too and they started creating amazing covers for cars - absolutely any style - from the patchwork to the imitation of elegant children's dresses! </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewingafterseven.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="case - a work of art" class="if uuid-2946140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946140.jpg"></div><p>  It looks <span>incomparable</span> - bright volume applications, ruffles, flounces, frills, elegant lace and a lot of other decorations.  You can also make ‚Äúclothes‚Äù for your assistant in the form of a bag, a traveling bag with many pockets to accommodate the necessary sewing items.  Covers are made in the form of down jackets, quilting the canvas over the entire area - you will get not just a cute accessory, but also reliable protection for the equipment. </p><p>  The machine, dressed in such a cover, does not even need to be removed - it looks like an interior item and serves as a decor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  To work on sewing a cover, you will need to acquire materials such as: </p><ul><li>  The material from which you sew the top of the case. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="practical and gentle" class="if uuid-2946197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946197.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Filler - you can use sintepon, sherstepon, foam rubber, etc. </li><li>  Fabric for the manufacture of the inside. </li><li>  Sewing threads matching the tone of the fabric. </li><li>  Pins for chipping the edges of patterns. </li><li>  Scissors, needles. </li><li>  Slanting inlay for edging. </li><li>  Ribbon, colored patches, beads, lace, etc. - for decorating the cover. </li></ul><p>  Well, the sewing machine itself is for working on it, as well as for taking measurements. </p><h2>  Phased work </h2><p>  Before starting work on sewing covers on a typewriter, it will be necessary to create a pattern.  A lot of options have been invented for this, but there are several popular ones.  The best protection will be a soft ‚Äúcap‚Äù lined with fabric.  <span>Sewing a case</span> for a sewing machine with your own hands from a synthetic <span>winterizer</span> will not work - it is loose and will break.  You can purchase a finished lining, already with a stitch. </p><p>  The very first step is to take measurements from our equipment - side width and height.  The same parameters cannot be due to the fact that all models are different.  Therefore, we write down our own and build an individual drawing on them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the second version, the manufacture provides only three parts - the back + front and two semicircular details of the sidewalls.  We also focus only on our sizes. </p><p>  But the third method is the simplest one - a rectangle is sewn and ties are attached to the sides.  Any seamstress will cope with this sewing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adamaedesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawstring case" class="if uuid-2946154" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946154.jpg"></div><p>  The progress will be the following sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  We draw the pattern of the cover for the sewing machine with our own hands on paper, applying our measurements, cut it out. </li><li>  We transfer the pattern to the fabric and cut out from each type of material: the main, laying and lining fabric, not forgetting the allowances for each seam. </li><li>  Then, using pins, or stitching with large stitches, we connect all the parts.  And we do this individually with each layer, leaving a hole so that it is possible to turn the product. </li><li>  In conclusion, unscrew the cover, sew the hole, and decorate the surface to your taste. </li></ol><p>  "Clothing" is ready - dress up your assistant! </p><h2>  DIY cover for a sewing machine from fabric do-it-yourself </h2><p>  So, at the very beginning of the process of creating drawings, as we noted above, measure all sides of the machine.  Making a cover for a sewing machine with your own hands is an absolutely simple task! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We need the height, the width of the bottom and top (here the flywheel is taken for a landmark). </p><p>  The formula for the length of the main part is as follows: (height * 2) + width of the top.  For a loose fit, also add about 1 cm on both sides.  Consider every protruding part! </p><div class="photo" data-original="sam.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag-case pattern" class="if uuid-2945569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2945569.jpg"></div><p>  Firstly, we build a rectangular figure with sides equal to the width and height of the machine.  Divide the width in half and draw a dotted line across the entire rectangle.  On it, we postpone the distance equal to the radius of the flywheel plus the part protruding above it.  Using a compass, draw a circle through the highest point.  From the bottom, draw lines to the wide part of the circle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sam.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="side of the pattern" class="if uuid-2945572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2945572.jpg"></div><p>  Adjust the length of the main canvas by measuring the side contour, not including the bottom width, and the width is the length of the machine plus 1 cm for a loose fit. </p><p>  That's all - we built a cover pattern for a sewing machine with our own hands, it remains to transfer it to the fabric and cut it out. </p><h2>  We sew a cover for the sewing machine </h2><p>  We transfer the patterns to the fabric (each type) and cut them out.  We sew at the seams, iron them with an iron.  Then we fold the inside out to each other and sew, leaving a small gap.  We turn it on. </p><p>  On the bottom edge of the cover you can go with a decorative stitch, fixing all the layers together and giving additional rigidity. </p><p>  In the upper part, cut a hole for the handle and carefully trim it with an oblique trim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewdelicious.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork technique" class="if uuid-2946168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946168.jpg"></div><p>  Iron each seam with an iron - this will give a neat appearance to your product. </p><p>  You can sew pockets for trifles to the finished case - then everything will be stored in one place. </p><p>  The beauty of the fabric is ready!  Finish to your liking! </p><h2>  Sew a cover for a sewing machine from old jeans </h2><p>  Any of us must have very old jeans hidden on some of the farthest shelves of the closet.  Wearing them is indecent, and throwing away is a pity!  And why not sew a case for a sewing machine <span>from old jeans with your own hands?</span>  <span>Denim</span> is one of the most reliable and durable fabrics, it will last a similar product for a very long time. </p><p>  So boldly open each seam, cut out details from them according to already constructed patterns.  If possible, then position the patterns so that the pockets fall on the sides of the cover.  Thus, you get additional storage for scissors, pins, threads, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="case with a pedal pocket" class="if uuid-2946174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946174.jpg"></div><p>  At the stage of connecting parts, do not be afraid to sew and cut off once again, fitting for the best look.  Turn the lower edge inwards and sew. </p><p>  And voila - we've got a wonderful new thing for a typewriter! </p><h2>  Bags </h2><p>  Such protection does not hurt, but as a means of transportation, it is generally indispensable!  Sewing a case for a <span>Janome</span> Juno 1715 <span>sewing machine</span> , for example, is very simple. </p><p>  For work it is necessary: </p><ul><li>  Flannel fabric - with a width of 90 cm, 115 cm will be needed. </li><li>  Flizelin for gluing. </li><li>  Rigid wide braid - for pens. </li></ul><p>  Dimensions of this machine are: length (C + A) - 35 cm, height B - 26 cm and width A - 14 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="klubokidei.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cover pattern - bags" class="if uuid-2945588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2945588.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we cut out 2 sets of parts - non-woven and flannel, not forgetting the allowances for the seams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homefocus.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag for cars" class="if uuid-2946190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946190.jpg"></div><p>  From the wrong side of the flannel, lay a non-woven fabric and run in a diagonal direction.  Maintain an interval of about three to four centimeters. </p><p>  Now sew all the prepared parts together, unscrew the cover and sew the edges with a seam in a hem or hem with a ribbon.  From the same tape, make pens and sew them in the right places. </p><h2>  Cape on the typewriter </h2><p>  One of the easiest ways to save a sewing machine from dirt and damage is to sew a cloak without complicated holes for handle, valves and darts. </p><p>  Its design is such that it simply throws itself onto the car, and is tied at the sides with cords. </p><p>  Suppose the machine‚Äôs parameters are as follows: 40 cm long, 35 cm high, and 18 cm wide. </p><p>  For work, prepare: </p><ul><li>  Material for the outer layer. </li><li>  Filler - the denser and stiffer, the better. </li><li>  Lining fabric. </li></ul><p>  We make the simplest pattern - we multiply the height by 2, add the width and the allowance - 35 * 2 + 18 + 1 = 89 cm - we get the length of the base.  Its width will be equal to the length of the machine plus 1 cm, total 40 + 1 = 41 cm. That's all, it remains to add 1 cm along the edge to the hem (if you plan to process the edge using a slanting inlay, then do not make allowances). </p><div class="photo" data-original="svoimi.rukami.klubokidei.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple cover pattern" class="if uuid-2946245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2946245.jpg"></div><p>  We made a pattern for a sewing machine cover with our own hands.  It remains to sew everything, sew the hem and sew in the necessary places the strings - cords, ribbon, braid. </p>
