  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Odense, Denmark: Interesting Facts and Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital of Funen, a large commercial, industrial and tourist center - this is not all the characteristics of the city of Odense.  In Denmark, and throughout the world, he is known as the birthplace of Hans Christian Anderson.  Today in the city, everything reminds us that the famous storyteller was born in it. </p><h2>  What is remarkable for this settlement? </h2><p>  Odense in Denmark is a city with a thousand-year history.  The first mention of it dates back to 988, but various settlements on its territory existed before.  The past of the city is closely connected with the Vikings, as evidenced by the earthen ramparts left after them.  A reminder of the sailors is even the name of the city.  It comes from the name of their main deity and stands for "Odin's Sanctuary." </p><p>  Among the cities of Denmark, Odense is the third largest and accommodates about 190 thousand people.  From all sides he overgrown with suburbs, which are adjacent to it.  The city is located on the river of the same name, next to the fjord, which was also lucky enough to be called Odense.  It is located in the heart of Funen Island and is its unofficial capital, occupying a central place in the economy of the region. </p><p>  Odense has easy access to Copenhagen.  It is connected with the capital of Denmark and the island of Zealand by the longest suspension bridge in Europe crossing the Belt Strait.  The length of the bridge is approximately 18 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="framedbythomas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge in odense" class="if uuid-2558740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2558740.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions Odense in Denmark </h2><p>  Odense is a typical Danish city, modern and ancient at the same time.  Large enterprises and developed industry did not affect its beautification at all.  Low buildings with tiled roofs give it comfort and intimacy.  Green parks, well-groomed streets and bicycles at every step make it convenient and truly European. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Odense in Denmark is replete with historical monuments.  It has preserved many examples of typical Northern European red brick architecture.  The Cathedral of St. Knud, the Cathedral of St. Hans, the Church of St. Alban, the Abbey Greyfriars, the Church of the Virgin Mary are built in this style.  Among other interesting places of the city are the mint, the city hall, built in the historical Italian style, the Odesa Symphony Orchestra, the city theater, as well as the Viking defensive rampart - Nonnebakken Hill. </p><h2>  Hans Christian Andersen </h2><p>  In the city of Odense in Denmark Andersen is devoted to a huge number of attractions.  And although he lived here for only 14 years, the famous writer is a real pride of local residents.  One of the largest city parks is named after him, and on different streets and lanes there are sculptures of the heroes of his fairy tales.  In the center of Odense you can find a monument dedicated to Andersen himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to andersen" class="if uuid-2559223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2559223.jpg"></div><p>  The author of The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina and The Snow Queen was born in a poor quarter on the pretty Munkem√∏llestr√¶de Street, which today has retained its historical appearance.  And now on it you can find a modest one-story house with a tiled roof, where the writer spent his childhood.  Nearby is a modern museum dedicated to all aspects of the life and work of the writer.  Here are collected Andersen's personal belongings, his drawings, as well as unusual exhibits, allowing you to fully experience the atmosphere of his works. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="blog.radissonblu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Andersen House in Odense" class="if uuid-2558802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2558802.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Knud's Cathedral </h2><p>  Odense Cathedral in Denmark is an example of brick Gothic architecture.  Its construction began in 1300 and lasted for two hundred years.  The place where the cathedral stands has always been considered holy.  In the early Middle Ages, the Vikings prayed to their gods here, and in the XI century a wooden church was located on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelguide.michelin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Knud's Cathedral" class="if uuid-2559236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2559236.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the former temple is mystical.  It was erected in honor of the deceased King Knud, whom the rebellious people killed.  The reprisal against the objectionable ruler was carried out right on the altar of the local monastery, after which the city was seized by years of crop failure and famine.  The peasants took it as God's punishment and immediately carried the king to the face of the Saints, and built a cathedral to bury his relics.  In 1247, the temple burned down and a Gothic church appeared in its place. </p><h2>  Odin Tower </h2><p>  This attraction is not striking in its beauty or antiquity, but it could very well become Denmark's most popular tower.  In Odense, it was built in 1935 and was the second largest tower in Europe.  Only the structure of the architect Eiffel was superior in height.  In 1944, it was destroyed by the Danish Nazis, cutting down its tourist potential in the bud.  After the war, the Odin tower was decided not to be restored, and a mockup was put in its place. </p><h2>  The Funen Village </h2><p>  Not far from the city is the open-air museum "Funen Village".  There are collected real rural houses of the XIX century, furnished in the spirit of that time.  Local history buffs have taken care of a detailed reconstruction of village life, so in the skansen you can see a farmer working in the field and forging iron smiths, and also enjoy the taste of only brewed beer made using the same technology as a century ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="discoverdenmark.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fune village" class="if uuid-2558819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2558819.jpg"></div><p>  The flowering gardens, horse-drawn carts with riders in historical costumes, walking ducks, hens, goats and other domestic animals in the courtyards give this atmosphere. </p>
