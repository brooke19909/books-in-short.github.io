Another 6 km of the path, and travelers will be at Lake Lineva, which can be reached from the district center the fastest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-465928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/465928.jpg?1540368065"></div><h2>  "Tourist" lakes Sharypovo (Krasnoyarsk Territory) </h2><p>  The main thing for which tourists come to these places is rest on the Sharypovskie Lakes.

In addition, on its shores there are many recreation centers.  But the most famous among the lakes Sharypovo (Krasnoyarsk Territory) is <span>Lake Ingol,</span> whose water, according to ancient legends, has healing properties.  If you believe the stories of local residents, then at times, even in very good weather, strong excitement can suddenly begin on the lake.  This is probably due to the strongest vertical currents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sharypovo City, Krasnoyarsk Territory: Attractions </h2><p>  If you are going on a beach vacation, you should at least briefly stop in the regional center.  Indeed, in Sharypovo and its environs there are many interesting sights.  For example, in the city you can see the Holy Trinity Cathedral - one of the most beautiful and largest in the Krasnoyarsk Territory.  The temple was built in the style of Russian Orthodox architecture of the 16th century and has a height of 47 meters.  Of particular interest is the interior design of the cathedral, where murals predominate on the model of the capital's Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  Another engineering and architectural miracle is the winter fountain on the artificial reservoir lake of the <span>Berezovskaya state district power station.</span>  In addition, in the vicinity of the city, near the village of Orak, travelers will be able to see a unique scribble - images of domestic scenes carved on the plane of a sand tiler, which are more than three thousand years old.  Of particular interest is the so-called "scene of torment", in which you can see how the wolf, clinging to the neck of a deer, trying to knock him to the ground.  It was this "picture" that made the words "Sharypovo, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Russia" famous for thousands of scientists from around the world involved in decoding ancient images. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-465930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/465930.jpg?1540368065"></div><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Some tourists prefer to settle in the city and already from there go on excursions to the natural and archaeological sights of the Sharypovsky district.

They say that at the beginning of the 20th century they found the icon of the Mother of God, and since then the water of this spring has gained miraculous power and began to heal from all diseases.  It is also worth seeing a ten-meter waterfall formed by the waters of Lake Krugloye at the place where it flows into Maloe.  By the way, it is believed that those who stand under streams falling from a great height will be a couple of years younger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-465929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/465929.jpg?1540368065"></div><p>  So, everyone who wants to see the incredible beauty of the scenery and swim in the crystal clear water should come to Sharypovo (Krasnoyarsk Territory), where guests will be offered many options for spending their holidays or long weekends. </p>
