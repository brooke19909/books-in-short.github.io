    <h2>  About attractions in general </h2><p>  The Vologda Oblast, whose sights are of interest not only to historians, but also to ordinary tourists, has over 3.5 thousand <span>monuments of cultural and historical</span> heritage on its territory.  They are represented by objects of archeology, stone buildings, church and monastery complexes, wooden architecture and ancient estates. </p><p>  <span>Ferapontov Monastery</span> is the pearl of the Vologda Territory.  This Orthodox complex dates back to the XV ‚Äì XVII centuries and has an integral and special architecture.  On the territory of the cultural object is the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, decorated with frescoes that belong to the brush of Dionysius.  Thanks to this, the cathedral gained worldwide fame.  After all, the name of such a great artist is on a par with the surname of Andrei Rublev himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vologda Oblast can be proud of the true achievements of church art.  Sightseeing is a vivid confirmation of this.  In their role are Kazan Cathedral, which is located in Ustyuzhna, <span>St. Sophia Cathedral (Vologda),</span> Resurrection (Cherepovets) and Procopius the Righteous Cathedral (Great Ustyug). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirillov Vologda region attractions" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/726308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Wooden art of the Vologda region </h2><p>  The Vologda Oblast (the sights here are mostly old and have survived many sorrows in their lifetime) has a huge number of monuments of wooden architecture.  They are represented by ancient chapels, houses, farm buildings and churches.  The tree embodies all the main styles of architecture of the late XVIII century and early XX.  All directions are presented here: from classicism and empire to modernism with rationalism.  The following urban buildings made of wood have survived to this day: apartment buildings, mansions owned by merchants, noblemen and bourgeois, and <span>public buildings</span> . </p><p>  The only one of its kind in wooden architecture is the Church of the Deposition of the Robe, dating to 1485.  The temple is located in the village of Borodayevo.  It is also worth noting the Elias Church of 1692 (village of Saminsky Pogost). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kirillov </h2><p>  The city of Kirillov appeared as a settlement belonging to the Kirillo-Belozersky monastery.  It was founded in 1397 by Cyril Belozersky.  The village is located on the shores of lakes Dolgoe and Siverskoe.  Kirillov (Vologda Oblast), whose sights are very, very interesting, is 127 kilometers from Vologda itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Kirillov in the Vologda region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/726309.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The whole area is replete with all kinds of antiquities.  All this was placed against the backdrop of the fabulous nature of the Russian North National Park.  But of particular importance is the main city attraction - Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. </p><h2>  About the monastery </h2><p>  The sights of Kirillov in the Vologda Oblast will not be fully accepted by tourists unless they become acquainted in detail with the <span>visiting card of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äã- the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery.  The complex has a simply gigantic territory, which housed a couple of individual monasteries and countless old buildings surrounded by powerful walls and towers. </p><p>  The monastery has access to the lake.  Indescribable landscapes open from this place.  The most "gray-haired" building of the complex is called the Great Assumption Monastery.  Also here can be attributed Mountain Ivanovo or the Small Monastery.  These two objects make up the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe so-called Old Town. </p>

    <h2>  Belozersk </h2><p>  The city of Belozersk is first mentioned in the "Tale of Bygone Years."  Here, the name of the village sounds like <span>Beloozero.</span>  <span>Belozersk</span> (Vologda Oblast), whose sights are rare monuments of architecture and history, are not only objects created by man, but also natural monuments.  Each of the eras managed to leave its imprint in the form of special types of buildings, architectural and decorative forms. </p><p>  The oldest object is the Church of the Assumption.  It dates from 1553.  According to legend, the bell for the temple was purchased in 1545.  The parishioners of the Assumption Shrine bought it. </p><p>  There are quite a few stone houses in Belozersk, the most interesting of which is a two-story mansion built in the first half of the 19th century.  The attraction is located on Freedom Street, 14. The architecture of the building is late classicism.  And if you look closely, you can conclude that the house was erected by an incredibly gifted architect. </p>
