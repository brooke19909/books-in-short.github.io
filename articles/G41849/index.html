Why do I need a personnel number?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not every employee is faced with such a concept as an employee‚Äôs personnel number.  Often know about it those who conduct their labor activities in a large or medium-sized enterprise.  Accounting LLC small scale usually does not notify employees.  Large factories always tell employees their personnel numbers.  Workers know or not about this, but the assignment of a serial number is carried out by the personnel department or accounting.  This is regulated by applicable law, and the absence of this paragraph is a violation. </p><h2>  Personnel number - what is it? </h2><p>  In principle, from the name itself it becomes clear what a personnel number is.  This is a kind of numerical value that is assigned to a specific employee.  This is the code that designates the employee. </p><p>  The features of personnel numbers include the fact that they are individual.  That is, there are no workers whose code would be exactly the same.  At the same time, the personnel number is also retained for the dismissed employee.  If in the future he continues to work with the employer, then he will be assigned his old number. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the personnel number of the employee is assigned to him during employment, in the future he does not change.  That is, registration for work fixes a certain code, which subsequently remains the same, regardless of a change of position or increase in salary. </p>

    <h2>  The need for personnel numbers.  What are they needed for? </h2><p>  Still, it‚Äôs better to figure out why personnel numbers are needed for the employer.  The employee does not receive anything from this.  As mentioned above, the employee may not be aware of the presence of such a cipher.  However, why then was the employee number originally entered?  How is this code assigned and what does it carry? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Personnel numbers help an accounting company or company.  Thanks to them, the implementation of electronic document management becomes easier.  Although it is worth noting that personnel numbers at large plants have been used for quite some time, even before the emergence of the 1C program. </p><p>  What are the main points to use this cipher?  This is, first of all: </p><ul><li>  Facilitation of the work of specialists of the personnel department.  This is due to the fact that tracking the personnel number helps not to ‚Äúlose‚Äù an employee when he changes his position. </li><li>  Help accounting in work with payroll and payroll.  Personnel numbers in 1C are directly connected here.  It is this program that helps to choose an employee not by name or position, but by personnel number. </li><li>  Tracking the presence of an employee in the workplace.  Actual for enterprises that are equipped with an electronic pass system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Specific examples.  Why do I need a personnel number? </h2><p>  To understand by whom and how a personnel number is assigned to an employee, it is necessary to fully understand why this parameter is needed. </p><p>  First of all, it helps to avoid unnecessary gossip.  So, if, when calculating wages, an accountant or specialist on standardization and remuneration of labor sees only personnel numbers.  He cannot understand exactly what amount Ivanov received, and what - Petrov.  That is, it allows you to further enhance privacy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, the personnel number helps not to be mistaken.  This is another parameter that allows you to check the correctness of the design of the document.  Especially true when there are namesakes or full namesakes.  Of course, you can also verify the parameters of the position or date of employment.  However, personnel numbers should not be discounted. </p>

    <h2>  Who can assign? </h2><p>  Personnel numbers are assigned to employees by a specialist in the personnel department.  However, it is worth noting that the legislation does not regulate the position of an employee engaged in the assignment of ciphers.  However, when applying for a job, it is precisely the HR engineers that are directly present. </p><p>  Heads of structural divisions or even the head of an enterprise can also do this.  In the absence of a personnel employee, his place in this matter may be taken by an accountant. </p>

    <h2>  Who can be assigned the personnel number </h2><p>  Can all employees be assigned a code?  Accounting of personnel numbers is usually carried out for all employees of the enterprise.  Namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Full time employees. </li><li>  Temporary or seasonal workers. </li><li>  External part-timers. </li><li>  For those who work part-time. </li></ul><p>  In fact, each employee has his own personnel number, regardless of how long he is employed.  It is noteworthy that even students who apply for practice in any department receive their own code. </p><p>  It is worth noting that if an employee has any combination of work or profession within the same enterprise, he still gets one personnel number.  The employee, who works part-time at two firms, has in each of them his own, individual code. </p>

    <h2>  How is the personnel number assigned to the employee.  What does the law say? </h2><p>  It is immediately worth noting that the legislation speaks rather vaguely about the assignment of a personnel number at the enterprise.  In fact, there are no specific articles in the Labor Code or federal laws governing how personnel numbers are assigned to employees.  Each employer for themselves develops a system that helps him to keep a competent and convenient record of cipher data.  Here, an important role is played by internal documents of the organization.  In them, for example, you can determine the position of the employee engaged in the assignment of numbers. </p>

    <h2>  How to keep records?  Practical recommendations </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that a personnel number is assigned to each employee, and should begin with the first number.  In fact, it becomes identical to the concept of "serial number". </p><p>  Such records can be kept in two versions: </p><ul><li>  Using special programs. </li><li>  Manually by an employee. </li></ul><p>  The latter method is used less and less.  This is due to the fact that the most popular 1C program allows you to automatically assign numbers to each newly established employee of the enterprise. </p>

    <h2>  Practical tips </h2><p>  Assigning a personnel number can seem like a time-consuming process.  However, it is not.  You should follow a few simple rules, and this action will be carried out automatically. </p><p>  First of all, the internal documents of the organization should be assigned this obligation to a specific employee.  This will help to avoid bickering in the future.  It will also exclude a situation where no one is responsible for this operation. </p><p>  Secondly, the employee should be assigned the number directly on the first working day of the employee, and ideally at the time of the conclusion of the employment contract.  In this case, the numbering will be correct and without omissions. </p><p>  A specific numerical code needs to be communicated to employees, as this not only increases their importance in their own eyes, but also helps to avoid errors in payroll.  This is due to the fact that when writing any application for material assistance or for making a vacation, the employee will indicate, among other things, his personnel number. </p><p>  Also, this parameter must be specified in the order of employment.  It can be printed in the program or written by hand by a representative of the human resources department. </p><h2>  Logbook.  Fixed Personnel Numbers </h2><p>  Enterprises that are forced to use personnel numbers for their employees often use a document such as a personnel number book. </p><p>  The following parameters may be specified in this internal company document: </p><ul><li>  Passport details of the employee, including his last name, first name and patronymic, as well as the number and series of the document. </li><li>  The date the employee was hired at his main workplace. </li><li>  The number of the employment contract, as well as the date of its preparation. </li><li>  Specialist position. </li><li>  The unit in which the employee will carry out labor activities. </li><li>  Directly personnel number. </li></ul><p>  A personnel number is required for large enterprises.  However, small companies use this method to make life easier for employees of the human resources department or accounting.  In a general sense, this is the numbering of workers.  Since each number is unique, it helps to ensure that money is credited to the right person.  This is especially true when employing namesakes or namesakes.  Self-tracking of personnel numbers is not a complex or time-consuming procedure.  Basically, it is assigned to a specialist in the personnel department.  However, the law allows you to assign this mission to another employee.  This fact is prescribed in the documents directly to the organization. </p>
