It is a complex of bastions located on seven islands, designed to protect the country's capital from the sea.  Today, fortification has no military significance and has been turned into an open-air museum. </p><h2>  World Heritage </h2><p>  The Sveaborg fortress, together with the seven islands on which it was built, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991 as a unique monument of military architecture by an authoritative commission.  Another feature of fortification is that in the course of its history it served to protect three states: Sweden, Russia and Finland. </p><p>  Interestingly, an area of â€‹â€‹80 hectares is not just an open-air museum.  It is part of the city of Helsinki as one of the residential areas of the city.  Today, about 900 people live here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone wall" class="if uuid-2562557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562557.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Sveaborg (Suomenlinna) is a system of fortifications of the bastion type, located on seven islands.  At the same time, the main structures are located on the five largest: </p><ul><li>  Kustaanmiekka (Kustaanmiekka). </li><li>  Susisaari (Susisaari). </li><li>  LÃ¤nsi-Musta (Lansi-Mustasaari). </li><li>  Pikku-Musta (Pikku-Mustasaari). </li><li>  Iso Mustasaari (Iso Mustasaari). </li></ul><p>  Between themselves they are connected by bulk isthmuses and bridges.  Three more islands (Pormestarinluodot, Lonna and SÃ¤rkÃ¤) are isolated from each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main bastions are on Susisaari and Kustaanmiekka.  Their stone walls of a pentagonal and rectangular shape to reduce the likelihood of being hit by <span>shipâ€™s guns</span> have a low profile and are hardly noticeable on the background of rocky islands.  It housed the most powerful guns, the headquarters of the defense, the central garrison.  The mini-archipelago is popularly called the "Wolf Skerries", by analogy with the menacing grin of a fierce predator that can fend for itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easytravel.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sveaborg Fortress in Helsinki" class="if uuid-2562563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562563.jpg"></div><h2>  What is unique about the bastion fortress? </h2><p>  Suomenlinna is unique in that its defenses have an irregular (isolated) structure.  At the same time, they are interconnected by a system of artificial dams, streamers, bridges and protected transitions.  It was built on the foundation of rocky islands with a rugged landscape, which required a significant change and adaptation of the then-modern theory of defensive fortifications developed in Central Europe. </p><p>  Despite the historical upheavals, the Sveaborg fortress is largely historically reliable, that is, it has been preserved to this day in its original form.  On the islands, one can trace the various stages of the development of fortifications and shipyards.  For example, the dry dock at the center of the fort was innovative for the 18th century.  By the way, dozens of valuable underwater objects are located around the skerries: sunken ships, military equipment, traces of the garrison. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Title </h2><p>  Sveaborg Sea Fortress was built by Sweden in the Finnish territory under control in the 18th century.  Accordingly, she received a simple but understandable name for everyone - the Swedish fortress (Sveaborg).  Karelian-Finns called the fortifications of Vyapori (Viapori) or Viaporone (Viaporina). </p><p>  After the separation of Finland from the crumbling Russian Empire in 1918, the national government proposed renaming the fortification.  December 6, 1918, on the <span>day of the celebration of the</span> 170th anniversary of the foundation of the fort, the defensive complex received a new name - the Finnish fortress (Suomenlinna, Suomenlinna). </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the fortress Sveaborg" class="if uuid-2562534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562534.jpg"></div><h2>  Swedish period </h2><p>  By the end of the 17th century, Sweden was a powerful empire with the most powerful army on the continent.  However, unlike England, Spain, Portugal, France, the country directed resources not to capture overseas colonies, but to annex territories in Europe.  Continuous wars with the hardened armies of Poland, Prussia, Denmark, and Russia required enormous resources, which ultimately ended. </p><p>  The defeat of Peter I in the first quarter of the 1700s forced a number of territories in the Baltic states and Ladoga to cede.  In order to protect the city of Helsingfors (Helsinki) from the Russian fleet, the <span>Swedish parliament</span> in 1747 decided to build defensive fortifications on the coast.  From this began the history of the Sveaborg fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The construction of bastions began next year on the two largest islands of the Susiludot archipelago south of Helsinki, on the site of the present Suomenlinna.  In 1750, the fortress was named Sveaborg.  By the way, a unique dry dock operated here, where warships were built to protect the Archipelago Sea (water off the southern coast of Finland). </p><h2>  Rainbow plans and objective reality </h2><p>  Originally intended to build fortifications in 4 years.  However, ambitious plans due to lack of funding had to be abandoned.  The next war in Pomorie (1756-1763) took all resources.  The fort project had to be simplified, but even its implementation took 40 years. </p><p>  The naval fortress was used as a naval base in the Russian-Swedish war of 1788-1790 (the war of Gustav III), but it was not involved in real battles.  In 1808, Sveaborg was besieged by Russian troops.  After minor skirmishes, the commandant decided to surrender.  The reasons for surrender remain an unresolved mystery for historians.  Thus, the sea fortress was captured, and a new era began already for Vyapori. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bastion fortification system" class="if uuid-2562578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562578.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian period </h2><p>  After the Swedes left Sveaborg, the bastion complex, together with their ships and equipment, was transferred to the control of Russia.  The following year, Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia, but Vyapori remained a military base under the Russian administration. </p><p>  The Russians appreciated the capabilities of the fortress and improved it.  The fortification system has been expanded.  Bastions appeared on neighboring islands.  New barracks were built in the garrison to accommodate soldiers; an Orthodox church was erected according to the design of Konstantin Ten. </p><p>  In the following decades, as the naval firepower increased, the military significance of the naval fortress decreased.  In the end, Vyapori fell into decay.  During the Crimean War, the combined Anglo-French fleet bombarded the garrison for two days in August 1855.  Defensive structures received great damage.  During the First World War, the fort was part of an extensive system of fortifications (named after Peter the Great), created to protect St. Petersburg from the German fleet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easytravel.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suomenlinna Fortress" class="if uuid-2562571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562571.jpg"></div><h2>  Finnish period </h2><p>  After the revolution, the military facility served as a base for the White Guards for some time, but was soon transferred to the Finnish administration.  In May 1918, the fort was renamed Suomenlinna fortress.  It housed various units of the Defense Forces. </p><p>  During the period of the Finnish company in 1940 and during World War <span>II, the military base</span> became the seat of Finland's submarine fleet.  To protect it, artillery and anti-aircraft guns were installed. </p><p>  Since the mid-60s, given the futility of fortifications in modern warfare, self-defense forces began to leave the base.  In 1972, Suomenlinna was transferred to the administration of the civil administration, and its stone walls were turned into an open-air museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easytravel.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the fortress Sveaborg" class="if uuid-2562567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2562567.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Today the bastion complex is one of the most famous <span>sights of Helsinki.</span>  It is especially popular in spring and summer.  Recreation areas are organized for sunbathing, and for lovers of water procedures there is a small sandy beach.  By the way, entrance to the territory is free, but museums are paid. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to visit: </p><ul><li>  a small submarine Vesikko (1933), who fought in the 2nd World War; </li><li>  Suomenlinna Church (1854); </li><li>  Ehrensverd Museum; </li><li>  Customs museum; </li><li>  Suomenlinna Museum. </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.14539999999999" data-lng="24.98814010000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/9/9/4699.png"></div><p>  It is most convenient to get to the islands by ferry or by "water bus".  They depart from the Market Square and run during the tourist season from 6 am to 2 nights. </p>
