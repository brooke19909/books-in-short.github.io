  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Popular cities of the United Arab Emirates</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The United Arab Emirates</span> occupy a special position on the tourist map of the world.  Luxurious architectural ensembles, unique fountains, large-scale trading platforms where you can even buy tea with particles of fine gold.  All this draws us to the cities of the United Arab Emirates, to the world of gold and luxury. </p><h2>  Capital of the United Arab Emirates </h2><p>  When we begin to think in which cities of the <span>United Arab Emirates</span> we want to visit, many start their choice from the capital of Abu Dhabi.  The city is not only a political, economic and cultural center.  The tourist destination here is developed no worse than, for example, in Dubai. </p><p>  The main feature of Abu Dhabi is its location.  The cities of the United Arab Emirates are, in principle, located on the seashore, but the place of the capital is on the islands.  Thanks to this, you can go in any direction and in less than half an hour find yourself on the beach.  The city is connected to the mainland by two modern bridges - Mussaf and Al Maktaa. </p><p>  Until the mid-60s, Abu Dhabi was a very backward small town, where there was no electricity and no central sewage system.  With the discovery of oil fields, everything changed dramatically.  Thanks to investments, the city has grown over several years and turned into a business center with skyscrapers and business centers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.desktopbackground.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai skyscrapers" class="if uuid-3005669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005669.jpg"></div><h2>  Dubai is a city of superlatives </h2><p>  The city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates is one of the most popular, the first most visited by tourists.  This is not surprising, because the second capital of the Emirates is used to surprising its guests with unique structures that can safely be attributed to the wonders of the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few decades ago, Dubai was just a small bay where you could not meet a single living soul, except for the indigenous people.  Thanks to huge infusions of money, Dubai has blossomed and turned into one of the most successful cities in the world. </p><p>  Dubai is the most populated in the country.  Of all the cities, it was he who in a short time made a tremendous step forward.  Modern technology is embedded in every building, in every fountain of this magnificent city of the United Arab Emirates. </p><p>  Many kilometers of white sand beaches, for example, Al Mamzar, are striking in scale.  This technological beach has everything you need for a great pastime.  It is equipped with showers, changing rooms, shops and cafes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.secret-luxury.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai skyscrapers" class="if uuid-3005710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005710.jpg"></div><h2>  Sharjah Resort </h2><p>  The city of Sharjah <span>in the United Arab Emirates</span> is called the rival of Dubai in the fight for tourists.  An amazing feature of this emirate is that it has a coastline on both sides of the Arabian Peninsula.  The island is washed by the waters of the Persian and Ottoman bays. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.architecturendesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Mall" class="if uuid-3005716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005716.jpg"></div><p>  Sharjah ranks third in the country after the capital and Dubai.  The city is especially popular among tourists.  Being almost a suburb of <span>Dubai, Sharjah</span> has a wide selection of beaches equipped with the highest standards.  The authorities tried to carefully restore the historic center of the city, preserving the ancient buildings.  A large number of museums, cafes and restaurants make this city unique.  On top of that, in a short amount of time you can get to Dubai to shop or visit the zoo. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sharjahcityguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharjah photo" class="if uuid-3005695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005695.jpg"></div><h2>  Amazing views of Jumeirah </h2><p>  Everyone has heard about Jumeirah.  Many rank it among the cities of the United Arab Emirates.  This is actually just a <span>district of Dubai.</span>  Tourists are very fond of this area for the most comfortable hotels, the best cuisine, for the wonderful views and convenient infrastructure.  Artificial island “Palma” adjoins to Jumeirah in the form of a real date palm with foliage. </p><p>  Jumeirah is famous for its beaches, magnificent mosque and yacht club.  Every year, a sailing regatta is organized here, which is happy to host participants from various countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Jumeirah" class="if uuid-3005685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005685.jpg"></div><h2>  Color of the city of Ajman </h2><p>  Not all cities in the United Arab Emirates are very popular among tourists.  For example, Ajman.  This small city is located in the smallest and poorest by the standards of local residents emirate.  Until recently, it was not very popular with tourists.  The city has a long resort area, almost ten kilometers, and borders on Sharjah. </p><p>  Tourists who visited Ajman, note the amazing home atmosphere that the city has.  Unlike megacities, the quiet measured life of this emirate attracts people who want to take a break from the frenzied rhythm of a big city.  Anjman is the only city in the United Arab Emirates that does not have Prohibition.  Here you can buy any alcoholic beverage, but with one condition - it is forbidden to take it out of the city. </p><p>  Emirate Anjman is the only one of all the cities of the United Arab Emirates where there are no oil fields.  But the city has other advantages.  There are unique mineral springs.  In addition, local craftsmen manually make light Arab sailboats, which are famous all over the world. </p><h2>  Fujairah - the shore of happiness </h2><p>  One of the cities of the United Arab Emirates is Fujairah.  It is the only one with access to the Indian Ocean.  The mild climate and not so scorching sun will appeal to lovers to lie quietly on the beach. </p><p>  Fujairah is the youngest tourist city.  It is very clean, there are no industrial enterprises, there are no noisy shopping centers and giant fountains.  The inhabitants of this emirate are engaged in agriculture, and spend evenings with their families on the shores of the gentle sea. </p><p>  The tourist, whose passion is museums, will find here a lot of interesting things.  It is worth visiting the oldest mosque on the Arabian Peninsula.  According to some reports, her age is 500 years old!  And on Friday, all the inhabitants of the city go to the traditional Friday fair. </p>
