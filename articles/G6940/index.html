    <h2>  Ancient legends associated with the island </h2><p>  Judging by myths, it was here that Zeus was born.  Already his son Minos became the greatest king along with the Egyptian pharaohs.  Zeus fell in love with Europe, stole it, and they went to Crete.  Today you can visit the ruins of Ancient Gortyna, the palace of King Minos in Heraklion. </p><p>  Another popular hero of ancient myths associated with the island of Crete is Theseus.  He became the liberator of the island from a terrible tax.  When <span>King Minos</span> lost his son at the games in Athens, he ordered from there to send 12 young men and women to be eaten by the legendary Minotaur.  Theseus dared to fight the monster.  The daughter of Tsar Minos Ariadne came to his aid, giving the young man a ball of thread, thanks to which the hero defeated the Minotaur and got out of the ill-fated maze. </p>

    <h2>  The medieval history of the island </h2><p>  A man set foot on the land of Crete around 8000-7000 years BC.  This is the Neolithic period.  And by the beginning of the 2nd century BC, 4 kingdoms had formed on Crete: Knossos, Festa, Malia and Kato Zakro.  Over time, the island became dominant in the field of maritime communications and trade.  Then in all the surrounding lands they knew where the island of Crete is.  But at the peak of its heyday, a large and devastating earthquake occurred on the nearby island of Santorini, and from there came a tidal wave that destroyed Knossos and nearby settlements.  After a couple of centuries, another destructive earthquake occurred that completely destroyed the Minoan civilization, turning the Knossos palace into ruins.  There are facts that after the islanders engaged in pirate raids and participated in the Trojan War. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There, where the island of Crete is located, back in 824 AD, Arabs arrived.  A century later, this place was conquered by the Byzantines.  The island was impoverished and completely devastated.  Already at the beginning of the 13th century, he came under the rule of Venice.  The golden period in the history of Crete is considered to be the 15-17th century, when Italian culture, education and the Church reigned there.  The level of literacy of the islanders has increased.  Churches and cathedrals of different periods and reigns have survived on the island: Agios Titos, Agios Mark, Agios Minas and Pantanassa, Agios Aikaterini, St. Peter and Paul Monastery, Cathedral.  All these are monuments and vivid examples of architecture of the times of Byzantine and Venetian rule. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Even those who know well where the island of Crete is located, are unfamiliar with its features and habits of local residents.  Meanwhile, many of them are quite interesting. </p><ul><li>  The main symbol of Crete is a bee.  Once outside the city, in the ruins of the Knossos Palace, they found a magnificent decoration with its image.  To this day, the bee is the most popular element in the work of jewelers. </li><li>  It is interesting that many organizations on the island have a regime that is unusual for a European: basically, up to an hour or two days.  But the gas station closes at 10 pm. </li><li>  The most reliable and beloved both by tourists and locals way to travel between the islands are ferries.  It is also cheaper than by plane. </li><li>  Inexperienced tourists traveling in a rented car will have to deal with a strange feature.  The names of cities on signs can be written very differently: Heraklion - Iraklio, Irakleon, Heraklion. </li><li>  It is worth remembering a certain dress code when visiting temples and cathedrals.  No bikinis, shorts and sleeveless shirts! </li><li>  Locals have a special love for firearms, especially those who live in highlands. </li><li>  Oddly enough, freshly caught fish on the island is a rarity.  And in restaurants the price for it is extremely overpriced. </li><li>  Since there are three mountain ranges on the island, it is not surprising that mountain herbs are held in high esteem here.  These are sage and thyme.  They make tea, seasonings, cosmetics and medicines. </li><li>  Tourists can visit the local lovers day in July.  Saint Jakynthos is Saint Valentine, familiar to us.
