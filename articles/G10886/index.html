Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Whatever the name of this wonderful city, there have always been enough tourists in it.  Business people, lovers of cultural and historical values, scientists and many others go to Volgograd.  For everyone there is an interesting place, attraction, there will be a favorite corner.  It is not surprising that with such a large tourist demand, the hotel base in the city is developed remarkably.  Accommodation facilities are presented in various price categories from inexpensive hostels on the outskirts to fashionable hotels in the historical <span>center of Volgograd.</span>  The Ring Hotel, which will be discussed in our article, is a four-star complex with an ideal price / quality ratio. </p><h2>  Volgograd: the most interesting information </h2><p>  Over its long history, the city has changed three names.  Initially, in the XVI century it was the watchdog city of Tsaritsyn, whose main function was to defend the Volga route from endless raids by local tribes, formed and settled in the surrounding lands after the collapse of the Golden Horde.  The toponym "Tsaritsyn" is not associated with the monarchy, but comes from the Turkic words "sary-su" and "sary-chin."  This combination translates as "yellow or red water." </p><p>  From the 18th to the 19th centuries  the city grows and receives the status of industrial, and then (after the construction of the railway in 1862) and transport hub.  In the period preceding the revolution, many beautiful churches and cathedrals, palaces and monumental noble structures were built in the city, large-scale residential complexes were erected, and a significant population growth was noted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the revolution, Tsaritsyn was a long struggle between the red and white.  In the near future, the Soviet government will appreciate the merits in these battles of Joseph Stalin and rename the city in his honor.  From 1925 to 1961, the city was called Stalingrad, the Tsaritsa River was called Pionerka.  It was a time of total eradication of everything that at least remotely related to autocracy.  With the construction of the <span>Volga-Don Canal</span> , the status of the most important transport hub was finally entrenched in the city. </p>
