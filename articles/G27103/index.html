    <h2>  What is remarkable about this resort? </h2><p>  It becomes obvious that at present, rest in Borovoy has changed beyond recognition, if you recall what it was like at least ten years ago.  Over time, the resort has become more famous and affordable: anyone can buy a ticket here and enjoy the whole family with pleasure on the lake.  Pure water cools wonderfully on a hot day.  And in the morning, when there are still no scorching rays of the sun, you can take a walk along the groves and take a memory photo of the ‚Äúdancing‚Äù birches, get cold water from the spring, take a tour along the coast and, perhaps, under the guidance of a guide climb onto one of the rocks.  But perhaps the greatest miracle of Borovoy is pine forests, the air of which can be "drunk" endlessly.  In order to forget the eternal haste and traffic jams at least for a while, leave problems in the past and enjoy peace and beauty, you just need to buy a ticket, take a train and feel happy and free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Holiday Village "Fortuna" </h2><p>  Perhaps the best place to stay when you come to Borovoye is a recreation center.  Kazakhstan, whose prices are often quite high when it comes to resorts and all kinds of services, attracts even foreign travelers.  Many of them stop at Fortune.  Comfortable conditions relieve everyday troubles - base staff take care of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Borovoe Kazakhstan recreation" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/469502.jpg" width="600"></div>  By the way, their work has never been satisfactory to holidaymakers.  The base is located near the shore of the lake, next to the <span>pine forest: a</span> few minutes walk - and you can walk through the forest or swim and sunbathe.  Isn't that great?  In the evening, you can settle in the room in front of the TV, open the windows and enjoy the smell of needles.  Everyone comes to the base: athletes, youth, the elderly, families with children and grandchildren.  Here, away from the noise of the city, you can feel real peace.
