Moreover, since not very long ago the city has become very prettier, has not lost its old charm, and even acquired a touch of the fashionable Mediterranean resort.  We can say that the Soviet style of relaxation “cheap and cheerful” is not quoted here, and the sea is built up with chic complexes with pools, glass elevators and wooden floorings with launching. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the private sector, treatment in sanatoriums and accommodation in traditional boarding houses continue to be at the top of the popularity rating, but many tourists choose economy class hotels.  A hotel in Odessa is inexpensive and convenient - these are the main criteria for such vacationers.  Therefore, we will devote this review to such an interesting hotel as Victoria, as well as to several other complexes of this class. </p><h2>  Popular budget hotels </h2><p>  Since time does not stand still, you should not expect this from the tourist infrastructure.  Especially in a city like Odessa.  In recent years, many mini-hotels have appeared here that meet all modern comfort requirements, and at the same time do not tear crazy money from visitors.  This is, first of all, “Aladdin”, “Anna-Maria”, “Wave”, “Tokyo-star”, “Deribas” and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  What about a concept like a traditional <span>hotel in Odessa?</span>  <span>You</span> can also find an <span>inexpensive</span> option, you just need to know where to look.  But many prefer old fashionable buildings that still keep the secrets of this city.  Such hotels as “Black Sea”, “Victoria”, “Central” can not only offer you an economical and comfortable vacation, but also combine the charm of the resort of Odessa with knowledge in the history of the city.  It is also good to go on business trips or on business.  At least, so many tourists who stayed here think so. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  One of the first beautiful hotels in this resort was the Moskovskaya Hotel (Odessa).  This former hotel is considered an architectural monument.  It was built by the "tea kings" of the early twentieth century.  The hotel was also called the "Big Moscow".  Interestingly, back in those days it was considered a first class hotel, however, it did not belong to exclusively expensive.  Although the rest in it was considered luxurious. </p>

    <p>  The building itself is beautiful, in the Art Nouveau style, with huge windows of interesting shape and exquisite stucco molding.  In Soviet times, there was the best pastry shop and movie theater in the city, and since 2006, a hotel restoration project has been underway.  Therefore, in the future we are likely to see a chic five-star complex here.  59 rooms, a conservatory and a rooftop winter garden, stunningly beautiful apartments - all this awaits future guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel "Central" (Odessa) </h2><p>  This interesting hotel matches its name.  And in fact, much more central here!  You will make city tours, admiring its peculiar life and interesting architectural monuments, just leaving your room in a store or on the beach.  After all, the hotel is located in the heart of this "South Palmyra".  Some rooms have views of Cathedral Square.  It was this Central Hotel (Odessa) that welcomed the famous actress Vera Kholodnaya at the beginning of the last century, who came here to shoot the film “Slave of Love”. </p>

    <p>  The good location and good reputation of the hotel atone for its shortcomings, such as the lack of an elevator.  After all, all rooms are on the second floor of the building, and below, as in the good old days, shops are located.  Rooms will be offered to you in different categories - both business class (three-room suites designed for five guests), and apartments up to 50 meters in size, and “standard” and “economy”.  Suites and “superior” have excellent modern content - “plasma”, high-speed Wi-Fi, air conditioning, refrigerator ... Standards also have all the amenities, and three guests can stay there.  However, not all of these rooms have air conditioning.  And rooms "economy" offer guests to use the general or block conveniences.  However, the prices for accommodation in this category of rooms are very moderate - from two hundred and sixty hryvnias. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Near the hotel there are many cafes, one of which - "Fryu-paryu" boasts the cost of food at the level of catering, a cozy atmosphere and homemade food. </p><h2>  "Black Sea" </h2><p>  This hotel is not a historic building.  The modern eleven-story Black Sea Hotel (Odessa) is not too far from the station, on Rishelievskaya Street.  It is close to the city center from here, and equipped beaches such as Langeron or Joy are accessible by tram.  The hotel is not very expensive, the main content of its room base is standard rooms.  There are 137 of them in the hotel. The rest of the rooms are apartments, junior suites and suites.  A total of 216 accommodation offers.  But each guest room has free Wi-Fi, a TV, air conditioning, modern amenities, and all guests have the right to use the indoor pool.  There are two good restaurants - Black Sea and Astoria. </p>

    <p>  If you decide to come to Odessa with a cat or a dog, the hotel does not charge you any additional fees.  The cost of standard rooms is six hundred to seven hundred hryvnia.  The Black Sea Hotel (Odessa) is located in such a way that a walk to the most famous sights of the city is easy and not burdensome. </p><h2>  Victoria - Location and General Information </h2><p>  Have you been to Arcadia?  No, not in that mythical country of the ancient Greek epic, but in the Black Sea resort.  After all, it is here, on Genoese Street, that the Victoria Hotel (Odessa) is located, to which we want to pay special attention.  This chic complex has been restored so beautifully in recent years that it cannot be distinguished from the fashionable resorts of Barcelona or Tarragona.  The sea is visible from the windows of many hotel rooms, and the beach is only five hundred meters away.  Getting here is not a problem.  A minibus travels from the airport, and trams and trolleybuses from the train station. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  Hotel Victoria (Odessa) can offer guests several types of rooms, from not very expensive to exclusive ones.  Single and double rooms of economy class are equipped with balconies, cable TV, refrigerator, shower cabins with excellent plumbing and good mini-cosmetics, wi-fi.  Superior rooms are air-conditioned.  In suites and junior suites, guests will find two rooms, the same number of showers, as well as work areas and a place to relax.  It doesn’t matter whether you came here on business or for entertainment - you will like the Victoria Hotel. </p>

    <p>  Accommodation prices here are as follows: single rooms 370-620 hryvnia, depending on the class.  Double rooms - five hundred fifty-six hundred twenty UAH.  Junior suites - 770, and suites - eight hundred seventy hryvnias.  The hotel has two hundred thirty-five rooms.  Many of them have sea views. </p><h2>  Food, services </h2><p>  Hotel "Victoria" (Odessa) can provide vacationers a full board.  Buffet style breakfasts are usually included in room rates.  In addition, Caramel Cafe and Victoria Restaurant can offer guests both à la carte dishes and complex lunches (costing from eighty to one hundred hryvnias), as well as dinners (70-90 UAH).

Entrance here, as on the entire Odessa coast, is free, but for some sun loungers, umbrellas, tents, fresh souls and other accessories you will have to pay a certain amount of money.  In addition, Arcadia is the center of the club life of the city, and discos on the beach, foam parties and various entertainments in the summer are the norm of life here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in Odessa cheap" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/985388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Victoria (Odessa): reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, guests like breakfasts, good Internet speed, administration attention to the requirements of vacationers and tourists, as well as proximity to the beach at a reasonable price.  Many note that the repair and decoration of the hotel is quite simple, but everywhere is clean and pleasant.  Tourists admit that hotel service is often better than they expected - because it has only two stars and was built in Soviet times.  The food is tasty and varied, there is always hot water, bed linen is changed regularly.  The staff is very polite, pleasant, the atmosphere is almost homely.  Vacationers often promise to come back and recommend the hotel to friends and relatives. </p>
