In recent years, manufacturers of acoustics and portable player devices have experimented with one way or another with designs and materials, which, however, has allowed us to fill the market with quite interesting offers.  The revolutionary breakthrough was the introduction of wireless systems that saved users from inconvenient wires.  The first models of this type were based on infrared signal transmission modules, which averted a considerable part of users from the new concept.  The fact is that such devices seriously lost to the ‚Äúcables‚Äù in sound quality.  The radio-frequency stereo system, which the Sinheiser wireless headphones in several modifications received, was able to correct the situation.  This is not to say that the German manufacturer managed to bring the sound characteristics to the level of traditional wired devices, but the gap is no longer critical, and yet the ergonomics of the models allow us to partly come to terms with this flaw. </p>

    <h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  The fundamental drawback of models operating without a direct connection is the presence of interference in signal transmission.  In order to compensate for this shortcoming, the developers had to improve the characteristics that Sennheiser headphones provide: type - wireless, frequency range - on average from 22 to 22 000 Hz, impedance - 106 Ohms.  In terms of signal reception for different models, the indicators diverge greatly.  For example, version 110 according to the manufacturer‚Äôs data is capable of catching a signal at a distance of 100 m, but in practice this radius is reduced to 30 m. Moreover, you can talk about high-quality and stable reception only at home, that is, at a distance of 5-10 m. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Different and the possibility of working on batteries.  The average battery life is 6-8 hours.  This is a good result, considering that the Sinheiser wireless headphones are equipped with a high-quality elemental base, which requires an appropriate energy consumption. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on RS 110 Headphones </h2><p>  From the very first model of this type, the creators failed to complete the task of high-quality sound.  This is a representative of the entry-level family, which embodied all the common shortcomings of wireless models.  In particular, users note a strong intrusion of background noise, an inconvenient design, as well as sound permeability.  That is, <span>Sennheiser</span> RS 110 wireless <span>headphones</span> not only pass third-party noise through isolation, but the sound from them is heard in close surroundings.  However, even in an unsuccessful model, the manufacturer retains the inherent advantages of the company.  This is, first of all, high-quality assembly and ergonomics, although there are different opinions on this.  In addition, a big plus of this version is a modest price for models of this type, amounting to 3.5-4 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser rs 110 wireless headphones" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1346810.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to the owners, physically, the headphones are almost not felt thanks to the soft and comfortable ear pads.  Hours of listening does not contribute to neck fatigue, which is a significant advantage for music lovers.  But the inconvenient placement of controls is emphasized - the right cup is equipped with two wheels, which are responsible for the sound settings and volume.  The problem is that they are placed under each other, which causes discomfort when performing manipulations.  As for the sound, the Sinheiser wireless headphones in the RS 120 modification show an average result.  Comparing with wired models, users do not highly appreciate the German development, but adjusted for the general capabilities of the representatives of the radio segment, the device still copes with signal processing with dignity. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on RS 195 Headphones </h2><p>  Again, the model does not cause claims in terms of embodiment of the design.  A comfortable headband relieves your ears of pressure.  But the main advantage of this version is precisely in the sound quality, which has been improved thanks to Kleer technology.  The owners of this model compare the quality of its work with CD players, which in itself is a noticeable step towards clean playback.  In any case, expert reviews speak of the superiority of the model over devices working with the Bluetooth channel.  Sennheiser wireless headphones broadcast a signal with a bitrate of 320 kbps, almost without losing complex frequencies in processing.  Of course, a new level of quality could not but affect the price tag.  In this case, it is 15-16 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews on RS 220 Headphones </h2><p>  The model embodied almost all the advantages of its predecessors, adding to this list and user-friendly innovations.  Traditionally, fans of the brand have noted high-quality assembly, proprietary ergonomics and decent sound.  In the last feature, Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã220 <span>wireless headphones are</span> fully consistent with the RS 195 modification. This version was distinguished by its advanced control and the ability to use a wired connection.  The design provides buttons for adjusting the sound balance, switching sources, audio settings, etc. Direct connectivity is realized with the help of a coaxial cable and through optical wires.  But there are also minor flaws in the model.  According to the owners, the headphones are unstable at some Wi-Fi frequencies. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sennheiser is considered almost the reference manufacturer of audio equipment.  Until recently, the company was criticized except for the boring design, which, of course, did not belittle the main advantages of the product - acoustic.  The segment in which the Sinheiser wireless headphones are presented is not easy for German developers.  If there are no special complaints about the design, then there are problems in the sound, which users point to.  This is confirmed by the RS 110 model and, in some ways, the older version with the index 120. But the appearance of RS 195 headphones changed the situation radically.  This development has demonstrated that wireless technologies can provide good sound without interference and noise blockages during the broadcast. </p>
