Users liked the freedom they gained by getting rid of the tether of a <span>telephone cord.</span>  This opportunity was appreciated also by fans to be in the open air - in the yards, garages or gardens.  So they will not miss important calls without losing the quality of reception or sound. </p><h2>  How does a cordless telephone work? </h2><p>  The principle of operation of the radiotelephone is quite simple.  It consists of a handset that is powered by a battery and communicates with a base connected to an electrical and telephone socket.  DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication) is a technology for wireless communication at frequencies of 1880-1900 MHz with GMSK modulation. </p><p>  Today, home telephones are not as common as they used to be, due to the dominance of cellular communications, but there are still many advantages left, for which it is worth having a land line.  The voice quality of such devices far exceeds the capabilities of even the best mobile models, and they provide higher reliability when <span>calling emergency</span> services. </p><p>  <span>The wireless communication system</span> has made the use of land lines much more convenient.  Many DECT phones have several handsets that require only one power outlet to connect.  You can arrange them in different rooms, which eliminates the need to run to another part of the house to answer the call. </p>

    <h2>  Some questions to ask before buying </h2><p>  When it comes to acquiring a wireless system, there are several questions that should be answered even before the selection begins.  This will help to significantly limit your search and determine which DECT telephone will best suit the needs of a particular family. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How many tubes are needed? </h2><p>  Previously, consumers were only able to buy one cordless phone at a time.  If more was required, then it was necessary to separately purchase 2 or 3 devices and connect them to a separate connector.  Today, a DECT phone can have 2, 3, or even 6 handsets working from one base. </p>

    <h2>  Integrated or separate answering machine? </h2><p>  One of the most advanced features that DECT phones have, user reviews call the presence of an answering machine, which is part of the entire wireless system.  It is managed at the main base.  Such integration has several advantages, but it depends on individual preferences, which may differ from consumer to consumer. </p><h2>  Do you work at home? </h2><p>  Having a home office may mean that you need a higher-quality cordless phone with superior sound characteristics and reliable battery life. </p>

    <h2>  What features are important? </h2><p>  <span>Caller ID,</span> call waiting, call forwarding, integration with a cell phone - all these are the features of some wireless systems.  Before buying, make sure that the selected model supports the features that you really need. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Cordless phones have some features common to all models.  Only the most expensive devices have a wide variety of parameters.  Below are the functions that not all models support, so it will be possible to limit the search to only those that have the required characteristics. </p><h2>  LCD screen </h2><p>  Most phones have a screen that displays various information, such as the name of the caller, the number to be dialed, time, battery level, messages, the last number dialed and information about the call, including the duration of the call.  If there is a caller ID, then you can also get information about one caller during a conversation with another. </p><h2>  Dual line support </h2><p>  This is ideal for those who work at home, or for roommates.  The presence of two lines means that two different numbers can work on the same phone.  In most cases, each line has its own call, so that you can determine who the call is for: either a work call or a personal call.  These systems also provide conferencing between two different subscribers and the user. </p>

    <h2>  Speakerphone </h2><p>  This is a great way to talk with the caller without having to hold the handset in your hand.  After pressing the speakerphone button, you can talk while cooking, washing dishes or caring for children.  In addition, this makes it possible for several present to communicate with the caller.  The speakerphone function allows you to talk anywhere in the house if the handset is nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Based keyboard </h2><p>  Some wireless systems have a keyboard not only on the handset, but also on the base.  This function is very convenient if during a conversation there is a need to view information.  The keyboard is usually backlit so that it is clearly visible, regardless of the conditions of external lighting.  Some <span>base stations have</span> call controls and <span>a volume control.</span> </p><h2>  Headset jack </h2><p>  This feature is very convenient when working at home, conducting webinars, for conference calls, or even when transcribing, when you need your hands to remain free to print while listening to a call.  The headset is useful when moving around the house, if during a conversation you need to do something else, if there is a mount on the handset that allows you to place it on the belt.  The headset is usually inexpensive, just make sure that the size of the plug matches the connector on the phone. </p><h2>  Backup battery </h2><p>  This is probably one of the most popular features that only a DECT phone can provide, as well as one of the most important.  Wireless systems may stop working if the power supply stops, but with battery backup, the device will continue to function even in this case.  Regardless of the availability of such an opportunity, it would be a good idea to have an ordinary wired telephone in reserve in case of an emergency and battery shutdown. </p>

    <h2>  Caller ID </h2><p>  This is a very popular and frequently used feature that lets you know who is calling and what is his phone number.  Some models have a voice alert, but basically the information is simply displayed on the LCD screen. </p><h2>  Call waiting </h2><p>  This function is very useful if the subscriber is currently talking, but is waiting for another call.  This is useful for working at home, as you can talk with one person and receive calls at work, not disappointing with a busy line signal, which in many cases can lead to loss of customers.  A DECT telephone warns you of a call waiting on the line with a beep.  You can choose to hold the current call, answer it (which is done automatically when the correct switch occurs), or redirect the incoming call to the answering machine, continuing the current conversation. </p>
