  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forms of education at school - a variety of classifications.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>Forms of education</strong> at school reflect the external organization of interaction between the teacher and students and are carried out in a certain order and mode. </p><p>  Advanced pedagogical practice has accumulated a huge arsenal of <span>organizational forms of learning.</span>  Attempts to classify the <strong>forms of training</strong> allow researchers to distinguish more than ten classifications by various parameters. </p><p>  So, the method of obtaining education involves several forms: full-time, part-time, evening, externship. </p><p>  The most extensive is the classification, which is based on <span>the training system.</span>  Distinguish between individualized and collective learning systems.  Some of them were popular at the time, others became traditional and are considered the main ones. </p><p>  The class-lesson system, theoretically justified by Y. A. Komensky, is universally recognized throughout the world and has been a leader in the organization of school education for several centuries.  It assumes a constant composition of students of the same age and level of training, whose training takes place in accordance with the educational material distributed over the years and lessons in a particular subject.  Lessons in school subjects alternate according to the schedule.  The advantage of the class-lesson system is a clear structure, profitability, the possibility of organizing the educational process in a permanent collective of students.  The disadvantages of the system are small individualization of education, isolation in a certain organizational space. </p><p>  Forms of training have constantly become the object of experimentation and research by reformist educators who sought to increase the efficiency of the classroom system. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the heart of the bellancaster system (England) is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeer education for students. </p><p>  The Mannheim system that prevailed in Europe in the 20 years of the twentieth century, focused on differentiation according to the abilities of schoolchildren (classes were formed on the basis of exams and strong, medium, weak achievements of students). </p><p>  Batavia-plan is a system of educational organization, in which two teachers worked with the class, distributing frontal and individual work with students among themselves. </p><p>  In the future, active forms of learning gained popularity.  So, the Dalton Plan (USA) was aimed at actively independently mastering students the school curriculum according to the teacher‚Äôs tasks, using work in workshops and laboratories. </p><p>  Brigade-laboratory training in domestic pedagogy in the 20 years of the twentieth century until 1932 became a kind of modification of the Dalton plan. </p><p>  The ideas of flexible distribution of study time and the choice of an individual form of training formed the basis of Trump's plan (the 50s of the 20th century).  This system includes the organization of lectures in large groups of students (100 people, 40% of the study time), the organization of work in small groups (10-15 people, 20% of the time), individual work of students in school rooms (40% of the time). </p><p>  In <span>high</span> school and vocational schools established <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  lecture and seminar training system. </p><p>  <strong>Forms of schooling in</strong> domestic didactics are divided into school (lesson, elective, integration of <span>additional education),</span> extracurricular (home <span>independent work,</span> excursions, distance learning).  According to the number of students, frontal, group and individual forms of learning are distinguished. </p><p>  It is worth noting the modern form of training, which has been developed in recent years.  This is distance learning, which is based on computer telecommunications.  <span>The learning process</span> takes place independently under the guidance of a tutor (teacher-mentor).  High school students (distance learning courses in selected subjects) and disabled children appreciated the new opportunity.  In the future, researchers note the possibility of using this form of education for students in rural schools, for schoolchildren who have knowledge gaps in any subject.  Distance learning contributes to the full implementation of the curriculum during epidemics or <span>natural disasters.</span> </p><p>  Forms of education are constantly evolving in accordance with advanced pedagogical concepts and modern requirements for school education. </p>
