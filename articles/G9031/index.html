    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The Park Inn Nevsky Hotel boasts a fairly favorable location.  The address of this institution is St. Petersburg, ul.  Goncharnaya, 4. It is very close to the Moscow railway station (literally 5 minutes walk).  Also nearby are such famous attractions as the Alexandria Theater and the Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace.  Those who want to explore the whole city will certainly appreciate the fact that the metro station is just 100 meters away. </p><h2>  Standard rooms </h2><p>  Perhaps the most economical accommodation option at the Park Inn Nevsky Hotel are standard apartments.  These are rather small one-room rooms, which, however, fit all the essentials so that you can relax comfortably and fully after a busy day.  There is a large double bed, opposite which is a desk and a large TV.  Also a pleasant moment is the availability of air conditioning. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the huge number of positive reviews, there are also negative comments regarding the Park Inn Nevsky Hotel (St. Petersburg).  It is worth noting the following disadvantages in the work of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the gym is very small, and therefore it is incredibly crowded and stuffy; </li><li>  despite the fact that the televisions located in the rooms provide for the connection of external media, the connectors are closed with plugs; </li><li>  despite the information stated in the advertisement and on the site, not all rooms have a refrigerator; </li><li>  the restaurant in design and the proposed menu is more like a pub, and the prices in it are unreasonably high; </li><li>  despite the fact that the rooms are equipped with metal-plastic double-glazed windows, they strongly allow cold air to pass through; </li><li>  despite the information specified in the rules of residence, you will not be able to receive an order from the restaurant in your room before noon; </li><li>  the cost of living is constantly increasing, but conditions are not improving; </li><li>  the restaurant is open only until midnight, which is very inconvenient (it is better to visit neighboring 24-hour institutions); </li><li>  the bathroom does not have a shower, but only a plastic screen that allows water to pass through. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Having studied all the information about the hotel, as well as the reviews of travelers who have already managed to visit it, we can say that this is a pretty good option for accommodation in St. Petersburg.  The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location.  This is the central part of the city with good transport interchange.  In addition, there are a lot of cultural attractions located within walking distance. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel is most often chosen by those people who arrived in the city for a business purpose.  They even have a separate room category.  They are characterized by the presence of a separate office, as well as by the good quality of the wireless Internet signal.  And if your goal is to see the city in all its glory, then settle in a junior suite on the top floor.  It is also recommended to book an orientation tour at the hotel‚Äôs tour desk. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings of this hotel can be noted unreasonably high prices for both accommodation and related services.  So, there are some malfunctions in the operation of the equipment, as well as the irrationality of the layout in the rooms.  We can not say about the uncomfortable schedule of the restaurant.  You will not receive an order for a room before noon, but you will not be able to relax in the evening either, because the establishment closes at midnight.  We can say that such an overpricing is largely due to the advantageous location of the hotel.  Therefore, if you want to live in the central part of the city, near transport hubs, you will have to turn a blind eye to some of the shortcomings in the hotel, as well as the unreasonably high cost of services. </p>
