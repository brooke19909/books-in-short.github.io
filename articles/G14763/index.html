    <h2>  Ah, how you want to warm yourself! </h2><p>  Before plunging into the simulation, let's discuss: Do <span>dogs</span> need <span>clothes?</span>  Or <span>is it a whim of</span> adults who in childhood did not play enough dolls?  Mi-mi-bear doggie asks for the podium of a child’s dream: you can put it on, put on shoes, comb your hair as you like.  He will not even bark about his preferences. </p><p>  It seems that one should not exaggerate the value of someone's unfulfilled desires and aspirations.  Along with them there is simple human practicality and caring.  Modern dog experts say that small and short-haired dog breeds are in great need of additional “skins”.  Otherwise, they simply cannot stand the changing Russian weather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is no coincidence that needlewomen are so interested in ready-made patterns of clothes.  For dogs of small breeds - their own (and not only) they are ready to sew and knit day and night.  Along the way, many become cool designers themselves!  Considering that the consumption of materials is minimal, the occupation is very profitable and enjoyable: both the beloved four-legged one is always “like a needle”, and creative self-realization is evident. </p><h2>  We select the fabric </h2><p>  The most popular subject of a dog’s wardrobe is walking overalls.  In it, funny crumbs are not afraid of rain, snow, or dirt.  They do not shake the whole body in the cold, like maple leaves in the wind, but confidently run in front of the owners, gaily glancing around.  True, a balanced approach is required.  It is hardly worth dressing the dogs in a “jumpsuit” without any special need: the hair spins, falls off, loses its appearance. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, it is worth making sure that there is at least one (universal) pattern of clothes “in the household”.  For dogs of small breeds, you can sew everything you need on it.  About the fabric.  As a rule, preference is given to light water-repellent samples.  Often used "Bologna", microfiber, raincoat, rubberized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you don’t want to overfill the chest of drawers with many items of the original wardrobe, you will still sew three overalls: one will serve as a cloak, the second as a fur coat, and the third as a windbreaker. </p><p>  An important condition: the clothes of the pet must have a detachable insulated layer.  The lining fabric for long-haired dogs is taken “satin”, with a slippery surface, in order to avoid tangling of the integument.  As a rule, it contains viscose and silk. </p><h2>  Making a pattern for cutting </h2><p>  If your pet is such a small “square”, then this pattern of clothes is just right for him.  For dogs of small breeds you have to work with jewelry precision, so do not rush, measure seven times - cut once.  The distance from the base of the neck to the base of the tail (AB) is the main thing.  By measuring it, divide the resulting figure by eight.  This is taken as a basis for marking a sheet of paper (tracing paper). </p>

    <p>  So, a grid of cells with a side equal to 1/8 AB should appear on the paper field.  On the "squares" reproduce the pattern.  Owners of large dogs working in a graphic editor can enlarge the image to the required size, print in fragments, then glue them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Clasps can be different.  In this case, there is a Velcro on the back.  If your dog has a short coat, you can sew a zipper.  The width of the "leggings" ("sleeves" - in this case, any concept is suitable) is adjusted using the same "Velcro", elastic, cord (less convenient, but can always be made from improvised materials). </p><h2>  Process has begun </h2><p>  We make two identical parts, of which we will make the upper part of the costume.  Please note: they are all cut (with sleeve).  Cut out the gusset (insert under the armpits).  We set notches along the axial (central) line of the fabric parts (the steeper the back bend is more cuts in the form of triangles).  Do not look that pattern of clothes for dogs.  There are a lot of small breeds, and even more trifles of technology! </p><p>  The edge is processed with an oblique inlay from the main fabric (width 3-3.5 cm) or a finished edging tape (sold in the departments of goods for needlework).  The lining for the fastener is a rectangle of fabric (length = AB, width = 8-10 centimeters). </p>

    <p>  Well, here we have learned to make patterns for clothes for dogs.  Do-it-yourself wardrobe is a matter of time.  In the meantime, we sit down at the sewing machine and sew the first update.  Having finished the details, ironing the tucks along the seam.  Having turned the blank inside out, we sew the sleeves.  We sew over seams manually or overlock.  Louse gusset.  It is important to follow its alignment with the <span>shared thread</span> (in this direction the fabric is stronger).  A slanting neckline sewn neatly while processing the neck and back of the overalls gives the product a “factory look”. </p><h2>  Toychik, toychik!  What about a bulldog? </h2><p>  Attach the Velcro fastener (acts on the principle of burdock) along the back and bottom of the “legs”.  New thing is ready!  Decoration of overalls is a matter of the hostess's taste.  Design your own patterns of clothing for dogs of small breeds.  York (Yorkshire Terrier), according to many, is a breed that is especially nice to dress up.  Affectionate, funny dog ​​in beautiful clothes is a cute sight. </p><p>  Bulldogs are larger than terriers, but they also freeze in cold weather.  They also sew overalls.  The booty will not hurt.  The cover covering the back and trunk does not constrain movements, is easily adjustable in size.  The colored line in the last figure indicates the top of the blankets.  The detail is double.  Sew on top.  Ponytail eyelet helps to fix the product. </p>

    <p>  We fasten the details with an elastic band (in the place on the drawing is a red square).  With it, you can adjust to expand or narrow the opening for the head.  Bulldogs are stocky.  If you decide to <span>take a pattern</span> for another breed, pay attention to the width of the body, if necessary, reduce the base. </p><h2>  ladybug </h2><p>  The blanket has a lower part of three parts (the picture shows a blue paste).  It is worn in the manner of a “doctor’s robe” (as if you were wearing a shirt “backwards”).  Having clasped a body, it is clasped on a back by means of "flypaper".  Sew the garment around the edge.  You must admit that this is a very fascinating activity - do-it-yourself clothing for dogs. </p><p>  Patterns, ideas - your own Model House in action.  A cute wrap can be crocheted without a crochet column or any other dense viscous.  With experience, you can swing at a cute sweater.  Choose yarn according to the task: for a little fashionista dress, take cotton, silk.  For a sweater - Angorka, soft wool.  You can use the "loose" thread (profitable and economical). </p>

    <h2>  We continue to create </h2><p>  You still do not know how to sew clothes for the dog with your own hands?  Patterns are easier than easy - for you.  Actually, you can do without them.  Nowadays, they produce a huge number of hosiery for men, women, children.  Bright mohair, bamboo, cotton, wool, down.  Let's open a secret: from them it is possible to make clothes for a small dog, since the knitwear stretches well. </p><p>  What about a shirt for Moseka?  It can be sewn in just a few minutes!  Where is our old daughter or son t-shirt?  She will be useful to us!  We measure (just like in humans!) The girth of the chest, the length of the back (though from the place where the collar is put on to where the tail grows from).  Og t-shirts should be the same.  From the neckline, measure the length of the product.  Cut in the manner of “tailcoat” (the back part is longer, in front - shorter).  Round the line.  Make a border (you can just bend and hem). </p><h2>  The client is ready - you can sew </h2><p>  All that is sewn is subject to knitting if you like knitting.  Pattern of clothing for dogs of small breeds is used similarly.  Why not make a lined coat?  You can knit it, sew from the rest of the knitwear (do not forget about the lining), trim it with fur, decorate it with an expressive large button (and it can be crocheted).  If you have a dachshund - lengthen the pattern.  Do not forget about seam allowances.  Do the fitting - your "customer" is always there. </p>

    <p>  Speaking of dachshunds.  Many owners complain: it’s difficult to find a store costume for this breed.  We have to sew ourselves.  Especially go to the "longies" vests.  Sew easily, even in the absence of tailor skills.  The vest fastens on the back.  The neck can be knitted (according to the principle of "collar" sweaters). </p><p>  A vest equipped with belts, if necessary, turns into a carrier for a dog.  Picked up by the handles - carried!  That's how fascinating the theme is “Pattern of clothes for dogs”!  Small breeds of individuals dressed up.  One feels that many have thought: what if, contrary to the advice of dog handlers, sew an overalls and a Doberman? </p>
