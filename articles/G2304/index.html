    </li></ul><p>  Some experts also attribute pedagogy to the section of such sciences.  Thus, it turns out that valeology is a science about the main human issue, one of the whole complex that deals with human health problems, both physical and mental. </p><h2>  What is valeology? </h2><p>  So what kind of science is this - valeology?  To answer this question, we turn to the etymology of the name.  The term is formed from two components of Latin origin: "valeo" or "valere" - to <span>be healthy,</span> and the well-known "logos" - doctrine, study. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So it turns out that valeology is the science of the art of being healthy, leading a healthy, proper, <span>active lifestyle, and</span> accustoming to it from childhood. </p><p>  From the side it may seem that this science does not carry anything complicated in itself.  However, it is not.  Indeed, valeology considers health comprehensively, holistically, including all its sides and aspects, and studying from all sides and options (mental, social, mental, moral, physical).  Due to the global nature of the concept, valeology turns out to be connected with a whole complex of other sciences. </p><h2>  Subject and object of study </h2><p>  What does the science of valeology study?  The main subject and object of its study are: </p><ul><li>  physical and genetic health mechanisms inherent in every organism; </li><li>  a person is integrated, including all its components, which affect the state of any kind and type of health. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about valeology as an object, then the main object of its study will be pedagogical foundations aimed at forming an independent desire in children and adults to achieve a <span>healthy lifestyle.</span> </p>

    <p>  The combination and complex application of all methods of valeology research allows you to get very good results with positive development dynamics.  And not only among children, but also among adults.  So, for example, this led to the fact that the 21st century was marked by a "fashion for health."  That is, now to maintain a healthy lifestyle - it is relevant, fashionable, youth and healthy.  It is foolish to deny in this a deliberate long-term impact on children's consciousness, namely, valeology and related sciences. </p><h2>  Where and when is valeology studied? </h2><p>  Valeology is studied mainly in the course (school) or as a student discipline.  After all, it is clear that the foundation of healthy lifestyle should be laid precisely at these ages.  In the school course, this subject most often takes the form of semi-game, semi-cognitive lessons called "Hello, the science of valeology!" </p><p>  At the same time, it is important to make sure that classes in valeology are not of a heavy forced nature, but are perceived as something light, exciting.  Then the children will be happy to absorb all the knowledge that this science wants to convey. </p><p>  To do this, it is better to choose non-standard forms of conducting lessons, and select topics so that there is always the possibility of practical research, a little laboratory work.  Quizzes, puzzles, competitions should be arranged more often, and information and communication technologies should be used during classes. </p>

    <p>  With students, everything is a little simpler and more serious.  These are almost adults, many of whom, unfortunately, have already been or are exposed to the antagonists of valeology: smoking, alcohol, drug addiction, daily consumption of fast food, physical inactivity and so on. </p><p>  Therefore, a whole serious course is needed here, which includes a number of theoretical and practical exercises, which will cover all the issues of valeology as a whole and will show its significance. </p><p>  It is best to play in contrast and give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe difference between those who maintain a healthy lifestyle, and between those who refuse it, to describe the benefits of such a lifestyle.  Valueology is the science of human health, and therefore students should understand how important it is, this is health itself and its timely preservation. </p><h2>  Interdisciplinary communications </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that valeology is a complex science.  Therefore, it is organically combined with many other sciences and sections that study a person and his health.  Consider the relationship of valeology with other sciences. </p><ol><li>  Physical Culture and sport. </li><li>  The complex of <span>biomedical sciences</span> (genetics, sanogenesis, pathology, biology, ethology, etc.). </li><li>  The complex of environmental and geographical sciences (geography, ecology, geology, etc.). </li><li>  The sciences of philosophy and sociology (aesthetics, cultural studies, methodology). </li><li>  Economy. </li><li>  The complex of psychological and pedagogical sciences (didactics, education, pedagogy). </li><li>  History. </li><li>  Political science. </li><li>  Right.

    </li></ol><p>  Obviously, valeology is a very labile and extensive concept that relates to almost all aspects of a person‚Äôs life, which at least somehow touch upon issues of mental, physical, mental and moral health. </p><h2>  The role of this science in school </h2><p>  Even from school, it is very important to make it clear to the child how important it is to be healthy.  After all, children have slightly different values, and they begin to understand the full significance of health only after they become ill with something.  Therefore, you need to try to explain to them that valeology is the science of health, its preservation, disease prevention and strengthening the general physical condition of people. </p><p>  Best of all, children will understand this if we give them an example of specific cases of people's lives before they thought about healthy lifestyles, and after they began to actively conduct it.  Show what hereditary diseases and human tragedies can be avoided if you turn in time and listen to your body. </p>

    <p>  It is also important to teach children to independently compose for themselves a competent and correct dietary diet in terms of healthy lifestyle, daily routines and do not forget to pay attention to physical exercises. </p><p>  With the proper organization of such classes, valeology will certainly leave a true imprint on the consciousness of children.  And this, in turn, will entail only positive dynamics in their future lifestyle. </p><h2>  Generalization </h2><p>  So to summarize.  Valeology is a science about healthy lifestyle, about complex measures that must be applied to maintain one's own health, strengthen it and prevent diseases. </p><p>  This is a kind of branch of medical science aimed at the formation of consciousness in people regarding the importance of their own and universal health.  This science has its own goals and objectives, research methods that help it achieve positive results. </p>
