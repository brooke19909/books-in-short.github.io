It allows the existence of areas of worldview that are incomprehensible to the mind, but completely permissible due to qualities such as intuition, feeling, faith.  Therefore, it characterizes the special nature of reality.  To some extent, his tendencies were studied by such philosophers as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Delta, Bergson. </p>

    <h2>  Characterization of irrational </h2><p>  Irrationally is a behavior inherent in free people who can afford not to think about the consequences.  This mode of action is a <span>philosophical worldview,</span> which implies the impossibility of understanding reality by scientific means.  As representatives of this doctrine explain, reality and its individual derivatives, such as life and psychological processes, do not lend themselves to generally accepted laws.  Such a state can only be subject to the elect, for example, the geniuses of art or a certain superman.  According to the theses of this doctrine, an irrational person is that individual who, violating all previously approved laws, with the help of subjective thinking is able to understand the basic laws of life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The influence of illogical behavior on research </h2><p>  Irrationally is not scientifically or without a logical approach.  Philosophical teachings in this area are divided into such areas as intuition, psychology, the contemplation of something super-real, as well as the appearance of inexplicable, but subjective experiences in a person.  All these facts caused a repeated and deeper consideration of this phenomenon.  First of all, researchers of human psychology, which at one time was deprived of close and thorough study. </p>

    <p>  Many early experiments were not taken for lack of evidence of the manifestation of irrational behavior among employees of not only research centers, but also among representatives of rational thinking.  But many serious theoretical problems that arose later forced scientists in the field of <span>psychology of</span> human <span>behavior</span> to return again to the study of illogical human activity. </p><h2>  Incomprehensible actions </h2><p>  Irrational behavior is an action aimed at obtaining a result without premeditated actions and evaluation.  Such behavior does not have previously meaningful options for the development of a situation, question or task.  Usually it is associated with a spontaneous manifestation of feelings, emotions that irritate or, conversely, dramatically calm thoughts arising from an emotional outburst. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Typically, such people are able to see reality beyond its logical explanation and with the advantage of some arguments to others.  They focus on actions without pre-prepared action algorithms, called "life instructions".  Most often, such behavior is based on the belief of the person himself in a good result of the work performed, with a complete practical misunderstanding of how the desired result was nevertheless achieved.  Sometimes people have only one explanation - the favor of fate. </p>

    <p>  You can often notice that irrational thinking saves a person from destructive criticism of their own actions and actions.  It brings to the fore the idea that the individual has already encountered such a problem and once again solved it with the help of acquired experience.  Although the problem arose for the first time, its solution was spontaneous and not realized.  This is due to the fact that a person is looking for answers in his subconscious at a sensitive as well as intuitive level, and already in the process of solving the task, he copes with it. </p><h2>  Does irrational thinking interfere or help live? </h2><p>  Growing up every day, a person thinks more and more stereotypically.  An irrational expression is a child‚Äôs speech.  Only a baby can afford to think in such a way, relying on the knowledge laid in it since childhood, and then reinforced all the time, and added new ones received later. </p>

    <p>  In thoughts and conclusions, as in all other global laws of this world, the rule of conservation of energy applies.  Thinking in a stereotypical way is often beneficial: less effort and time are needed.  And well, if the acquired knowledge in childhood is correct, then a person solves the problem in the right way.  But if knowledge is irrational, then a person is less fortunate.  The main factors why such thoughts interfere with proper thinking: </p><ul><li>  they are spontaneous; </li><li>  lead a person away from his main activity; </li><li>  often work in unnecessary situations; </li><li>  cause anxiety and irritability. </li></ul><p>  The faster a person gets rid of illogicality in his thinking and actions, the sooner negative events will stop happening in his life, the psyche will strengthen, and his functional activity will improve.  Irrational is wrong for a sane person. </p>
