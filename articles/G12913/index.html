China expects a new civil war.  Japan still cannot recover from a terrible atomic attack.  Europe is swallowed by ruins.  What about the <span>USA?</span>  <span>In America,</span> everything is fine: the dollar was recognized as international currency, the <span>UN</span> and the International Bank are being created, the construction of new buildings begins.  The USA expects that in the near future they will become a powerful power and will ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the whole world under themselves. </p><p>  In the same year, the powers that be, namely the leadership of New York, came out with a proposal to build the World <span>Trade Center</span> 1 in WTC in Lower Manhattan. They suggest that post-war countries will begin to conduct international trade.  But this could be prevented by the Cold War: Russians with the world's strongest land army acquire an atomic bomb, cast icy looks at Europe and strengthen friendly relations with Asia: they help the Koreans end the war and forever strengthen their relations with China.  It was then that the Americans had to postpone the construction of the WTC indefinitely. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the twin towers </h2><p>  The WTC chief architect seemed to foresee that once the construction he had designed would play a fatal role for the United States.  Minoru Yamasaki wrote that if it were possible, "I would solve the architectural issues that confronted me by designing one-story houses." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It all started on the initiative of the director of the New York Port Authority August Tobin - it was he who proposed the construction of World Trade Center 1 in 46 of the last century. Roughly speaking, he wanted to create something that would bring great income. </p><p>  Legislatures give permission to build 21 buildings on the East River - this is land owned by the Office.  The project is being developed, and when it was already ready (in 1949), an affirmative document was withdrawn. </p><p>  In the mid-1950s, a designed project sees David Rockefeller.  Only its other purpose is to restore the attractiveness of the lower part of the city of New York (Manhattan).  In 1958, they began to develop a plan to increase business activity, and in 1960 began to evaluate the WTC project.  According to it, the complex was to be located on 53 hectares of land owned by the Port Authority, and there was also a 300-meter exhibition hall surrounded by 50- and 70-story hotels and offices.  Entertainment was provided, such as theaters, restaurants and shops.  But only in September 1962 the chief architect (Minoru Yamasaki) was appointed, who worked on the final project, and in 1965 began construction. </p><p>  Yamasaki made his own adjustments: he unconditionally rejected the possibility of building a group of buildings and offered to opt for two twin towers 80 floors high.  From this it followed that the project had to be completely changed.  However, everything happened very quickly: at the end of 1970, the uppermost element of the supporting structure was mounted in a festive atmosphere, and in 1973 the buildings were commissioned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  September 11, 2001 </h2><p>  For almost 30 years, the WTC twins have been the highest missions in the world.  The first tragedy occurred on February 26, 1993. On that day, on the second floor of the North Tower, where the underground parking was located, a truck exploded in which a bomb was planted.  Omar Abdel-Rahman (the leader of the Islamists and the organizer of the attack) hoped that the tower would begin to crumble and touch the second, that is, the skyscrapers would be completely destroyed.  But he miscalculated - the creations of a talented architect resisted.  The victims of the collapse were 6 people, about 1000 were injured, the building completely stopped functioning. </p><p>  102 minutes are the worst in 2001.  Just an hour and a half, and World Trade Center 1 ceased to exist.  At 8:46 a.m. a plane with terrorists on board rammed the first tower, and at 10:28 another Boeing - a second, and these terrible seconds were captured on video.  This terrorist attack is the largest in the history of mankind.  Almost 3,000 people became its victims, another 24 went missing. </p>

    <h2>  Building revitalization </h2><p>  November 21, 2006 was the day when they started the first stage of the construction of the modern WTC 1. This project took a lot of time and finances - almost $ 4 billion and 7 years (like its predecessor, destroyed on September 11, 2001).  The height of the tower is 541 m (with a spire weighing more than 700 tons).  Today, this architectural creation is the highest in New York, the United States and throughout the Western Hemisphere. </p><p>  In those places where the twin towers previously stood, 2 memorials were installed in the form of pools made of granite, and lined with bronze plates along the perimeter with engraved names of the dead.  They are located exactly where the foundation of the buildings was laid.  And WTC 1 itself is located in the western corner of the site.  It turns out that new buildings surround the Ground Zero (memorial of memory). </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics of a modern building </h2><p>  World Trade Center 1, or Freedom Tower, is a commercial and office building.  The structure strongly resembles its predecessors.  This is a light spiral building with a huge spire at the top.  It is glazed outside, and inside the central part there is a large-sized hall.  The height of the room is 24 m, and from here access to offices, restaurants, information centers and exhibition halls is provided. </p><p>  The underground part is equipped with vestibules connected to the railway lines and the city metro.  At the very top, of course, are restaurants that open up a stunning landscape.  Also on the upper levels there are observation platforms.  The lower part of the Freedom Tower is faced with prismatic glass, and the upper is blue. </p>

    <h2>  Some interesting facts </h2><ul><li>  Most of the budget was intended to ensure security in the event of a terrorist attack. </li><li>  In 1776, the United States <span>Declaration of Independence</span> was adopted.  The height of the building is 1776 feet, and for good reason. </li><li>  Glass panels, which were chosen as the facing material, reduce <span>operating costs</span> by 20%, because thanks to them, the interior is filled with daylight. </li><li>  The memorial to people who died and went missing when the previous skyscrapers of Manhattan collapsed is, according to various estimates, the most visited, but the project was criticized for its enormous cost and lack of aesthetics. </li></ul><h2>  What do tourists need to know? </h2><p>  Any excursion in New York includes a visit to the World Trade Center 1. You can also get into it yourself.  The cost of admission to the observation deck is about $ 30.  As in many other countries and cities, here you can buy a New York Pass and visit all the desired places (including WTC 1) for free. </p><p>  Observation platforms in the Freedom Tower (New York, Manhattan) are located at 100, 101 and 102 levels.  High-speed elevators raise the walls of which are mounted displays showing the stages of development of the city as it grows up. </p><p>  Given the terrible tragedy that occurred on this site 15 years ago, many people are afraid to visit WTC 1. When the building was commissioned, the owners waited a long time for the tenants of the premises - few people wanted to take such a risk.  But, as you know, the shell does not fall into the same funnel twice, and I hope that this will actually be so. </p>

    <h2>  World Trade Center 1 - The answer to terrorism </h2><p>  WTC 1 is not just a beautiful architectural object with a panoramic viewing platform.  This is a worthy response to world terrorism, as well as a place where you can honor the memory of dead people.  The modern New York building is one of the main attractions that is most often visited by locals and tourists. </p>
