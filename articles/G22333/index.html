    <h2>  Here it is - Tunisia </h2><p>  Tunisia is a small country located in northern Africa.  Most of the population lives on the Mediterranean coast.  The southern part of the country can be called almost deserted.  The main population - Arabs - are friendly to all tourists. </p><p>  Do not believe the one who says there is nothing to watch in Tunisia.  This is said by those tourists who spent all their time on the beach and were too lazy to see the sights of this country.  The Colosseum, which ranks second in size after the Roman one, has been preserved here.  You can not only see it, but also make a journey through the underground passages, through the halls where wild animals were kept. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the mountainous part of Tunisia, the place of Matmata, where the truly native inhabitants - Berbers still live - has managed to preserve their identity.  They live in caves and are not only ready to show tourists their homes, but also treat them to green tea, prepared according to local recipes.  One cannot but recall Carthage, where excavations are constantly being carried out and more and more exhibits are found that replenish the shelves of museums.  The beautiful sea resort of Nabeul, where the Kheops 4 * hotel is located, also retained its originality.  Before proceeding to the description of the hotel, I would like to talk a little about the town in order to remove all doubts about the quality of rest in this hotel complex. </p><h2>  Former Neapolis - Nabeul Resort </h2><p>  If you go on vacation to Nabeul, you will be met by a beautiful seaside resort, which is the center of pottery production.  In front of the railway station is its symbol - a huge clay jug.  In addition, souvenir shops are open all over the city, where vacationers can purchase Nabel craftsmen‚Äôs products made of kaolin clay and covered with blue azure.  The most popular are shops on Sidi Barket Street. </p><p>  At the top of Cape Bon, the small village of Al-Hawaria retained its identity.  Here are picturesque grottoes, where locals hunt for falconers. </p><p>  The best place for shopping is the Souq al-Juma market, where you can buy everything from painting, leather products and perfumes to various spices and exotic fruits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All hotels are located on the coastal strip.  No exception is the Kheops Hotel 4 *.  It is at this hotel complex that we will stop our attention. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Kheops 4 * and <span>Les Pyramides 3 *</span> make up a single hotel complex located on the first coastline.  It lies north of the city of Hammamet, not far from the central part of Nabeul, just 600 meters away.  A small remoteness from nightlife attracts here those who like a relaxing holiday, as well as numerous families with children.  The complex is separated from the city of Hammamet by a distance of 10 kilometers, 10 times more is the distance to the city of Monastir.  Around are numerous hotels, stretching a whole string along the coastline.  The closest are Omar Khayyam and Nabeul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kheops hotel 4" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/555636.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  When choosing a hotel very often mistaken, as there is a hotel with a similar name, located in the nearest city (Hammamet) - Kheops Aqua 4 *.  It is also a wonderful hotel, and it is located nearby, but still it is a completely different establishment. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Getting to the hotel complex is not difficult.  First of all, you need to get into Tunisia itself.  Nabeul (Kheops 4 * is located here) is located 76 kilometers from <span>Tunis-Carthage</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  From here you can get by rail, taking a ticket to the stop Gare de Nabeul, <strong> </strong>  and then use public transport to get to the nearest stop to the hotel, which is 1 kilometer from the hotel complex.  If the luggage is small, you can walk on foot, but if its weight is significant, it is better to use a taxi.  Traveling here is relatively inexpensive.  So, for example, for $ 3 you can get from one end of the city to the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  General description of the hotel </h2><p>  Among the hotels located in the city, Kheops 4 * (Tunisia) is very popular among tourists.
