It is interesting to observe how the ideals and principles changed during the existence of Soviet power, reflecting on the design of coins and paper notes.  Slogans, important government officials, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting the proletariat under the red banners - all this was embodied not only on the pages of books and in the minds of people, but also on money. </p><h2>  The first Soviet coins </h2><p>  Initially, <span>Soviet money,</span> which replaced the tsarist <span>money,</span> demonstrated a completely new idea for the Russian population - the unification of the proletariat and the creation of a socialist state.  It should be noted that such coins were of an agitational nature (such as, for example, a penny of 1938). </p>

    <h2>  Change in <span>Soviet money</span> in 1935 </h2><p>  A symbolic change in the design of coins issued in 1935.  On their front side was removed the slogan: "Workers of all countries unite!"  This change was a reflection of the change in the foreign policy course from internationalism to the construction of communism within one country. </p><p>  Also, several new ribbons were added to the <span>emblem of the USSR</span> , which symbolized the joined republics.  In 1935 there were only six of them, but by 1957 as many as fifteen ribbons appeared on the coat of arms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Coins of 1938 </h2><p>  Coins of the mentioned year of issue had face values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom one to twenty kopecks.  By the way, the re-issue of such coins occurred only in the fifties.  The <span>1938</span> coins have one special feature - they were minted in a limited edition and with a higher quality than coins that were circulated in the thirties. </p><p>  Interestingly, the composition of the alloy from which these pennies were made is still not known for certain.  Some collectors believe that they used nickel more when chasing, while others believe that silver.  There is no consensus.  Therefore, it turns out that these pennies were surrounded by a halo of mystery, because no one knows for sure how many there were, what alloy they used and what the real price of 1938 coins was.  Who does not inspire research? </p><h2>  1 kopeck </h2><p>  The value of a seemingly useless coin in the thirties, at the moment soared to heaven.  Numismatists highly appreciate a penny of this denomination because of its special engraving and drawing on the reverse.  The weight of a penny is about one gram.  Diameter is fifteen millimeters. </p>

    <p>  Of particular interest is the depiction of the coat of arms of the USSR and the ears on the reverse in that, in contrast to the predecessor coins, there were not seven but eleven on the obverse.  The rising sun was depicted above the ears, and a sickle and hammer were displayed on top of the planet located in the center of the coat of arms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  2 kopecks </h2><p>  A coin of this denomination has several varieties.  The appearance of various varieties of cents is usually associated with difficulties in coinage.  And you can determine their appearance by the number of nodules.  They do this with a magnifying glass and, of course, a directory.  The weight of the named currency is two grams, and the diameter is about two centimeters. </p>

    <p>  The price of a coin, in denominations of two copecks, varies from two hundred rubles to one thousand dollars.  The cost depends on the rarity and type of the penny itself in 1938.  Someone may be interested in the differences in these coins, but someone will not give them attention and sell a rare instance for several hundred rubles.  The rarity of this penny depends, as we have said, primarily on the pattern on the reverse. </p><h2>  15 kopecks </h2><p>  A coin of this denomination is quite popular among buyers, although at one time it was quite common. </p>

    <p>  Its front side was decorated with the emblem of the USSR.  In 1938, the design of the coin did not acquire any particular change, on the contrary, rather, it was simplified. </p><p>  On the reverse of a penny its nominal value is indicated.  The inscription "15" occupies most of the reverse, and oak branches are depicted on the sides and top.  The mass of the coin is 2.7 grams, the diameter is 19 millimeters.  As on other kopecks this year, the front side of the coin depicts eleven bundles of ears.  They have a meaning - they symbolize eleven republics within the USSR (and in the early thirties there were seven). </p><p>  The price of a coin of 15 kopecks, issued in 1938, varies greatly, but in fairly modest limits - from one to seven dollars.  Such a low price, especially in comparison with other coins of 1938, may surprise someone, but in general, it is easily explained by the large circulation. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the features of alloys have always protected coins from counterfeiting and did not allow counterfeiters to reveal the secret of the production of cents.  This phenomenon is noticeable in 1938.  Whom this invention should consider as its author remains unclear. </p><p>  The socialist ideology, which had a strong effect on people's minds, was reflected on coins, as if emphasizing and recalling the mission of the state that issued this money.  And in general, it is seen how the design and pattern on the reverse of the coins reflected the changes that took place in the USSR in 1938. </p><p>  The change in ideology itself can be traced by comparing the coins of the twenties, thirties, fifties and seventies.  They are strikingly different.  First, the slogan <span>‚ÄúWorkers of all countries unite!‚Äù</span> Disappears <span>,</span> and then all the campaign symbols and images (for example, the image of workers and peasants on banknotes) disappear. </p><p>  The influence of socialism, as is known, went beyond the borders of the Soviet Union.  In communist China, money also acquired a propaganda character. </p>

    <p>  In the image of the renminbi, for example, one can notice the same idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting the proletariat and the peasantry in the struggle for socialism. </p><p>  Indeed, money has always been a daily necessity, and the images on it were a reflection of the spirit of the nation (for example, American presidents on the dollar), and this is a natural course of things. </p>
