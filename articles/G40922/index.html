In addition, she has the ability to dye hair, changing their natural color.  Henna is a vegetable, and therefore absolutely safe.  This dye is made from the leaves of lavsonia - a low tree or shrub belonging to the genus derbenic.  Raw materials for natural powder are collected during flowering plants.  The leaves that grow on the branches of the highest tier are used to produce art painting on the skin, since their ability to stain is highest.  Raw materials procured from the lower parts of Lavsonia are ground to a powder less intensely.  Indian henna, obtained from these tiers of the bush, is used for hair coloring. </p><p>  The powder is packaged immediately after its receipt in vacuum due to the inability of the paint to maintain its beneficial properties during prolonged storage in the open air.  Raw materials derived from various parts of Lawson are widely used for medicinal purposes.  Various wounds are treated with powder, they relieve skin diseases, as well as ailments of the skeletal system and headaches. </p><p>  Indian henna has been widely used as a hair dye.  She is able to change their natural color, giving a copper saturated shade and a pleasant shine.  Indian henna makes hair thicker, lush and stiff; it prevents hair loss and eliminates dandruff.  Powder from the leaves of lavsonia and on the skin of the head has a beneficial effect.  There is evidence that henna was used by the prophet Muhammad.  However, it must be borne in mind that this coloring agent does not have the ability to completely change the color of the hair, which is natural for them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since ancient times, painting, which was carried out on the body using henna, has been very popular among the people of Central Asia.  It was applied for religious or aesthetic purposes.  Such paintings were called mehndi.  Henna gave the drawing the ability to stay on the skin for a significant period, which amounted to a time period of up to three weeks.  At the same time, various shades of mehndi (from light orange to dark red and black) were provided as a result of mixing the product with various additives. </p><p>  Indian henna, reviews of which testify to its popularity as a therapeutic agent, is widely used in medicine in the Arab states.  The ability of Lavsonia to produce a strong disinfecting effect finds its application in the treatment of wounds and sutures, as well as in getting rid of various dermatological ailments and bone diseases. </p><p>  Rinsing the mouth with a solution of henna is very useful for stomatitis, as well as ulcers on the lips, cheeks, and tongue.  The application of powder from the leaves of lavsonia to painful areas has a calming effect in acute abscesses and inflammations.  A mixture made from natural wax, <span>rose oil,</span> and henna extract is effective for pain in the back.  If the patient suffers from smallpox or chickenpox, then paste obtained from the leaves of lavsonia is used.  The tool is applied directly to the ulcers, which contributes to their speedy drying.  In this case, the patient's eyes are protected. </p><p>  Indian henna helps to enhance the brilliance of nails when applying paste from this healing product.  The smell of dry leaves of lavsonia remarkably scares away blood-sucking insects, and is also able to relieve headaches and increase potency. </p>
