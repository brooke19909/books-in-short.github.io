  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to remove the Nokia lock code: an emergency!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, a mobile phone has been considered not as an expensive toy, but as a necessary thing in everyday life.  And therefore, any failure of the device in operation can not only cause negative emotions for the owner, but also cause a violation of the labor process, etc., and this is no longer a joke.  None of even the coolest brands and models are immune from such misunderstandings. </p><p>  For example, the mobile phone hung on the lock: the security code was forgotten or it was not known at all if the phone was ‚Äúused‚Äù, bought by hand, and the new owner did not hesitate to ask for the necessary numbers.  The company is well-known and beloved by many Nokia.  How to remove the Nokia lock code?  People who have faced a similar problem know that the trouble is fixable, although sometimes they have to tinker. </p><p>  So, to remove the Nokia lock code at home, you can use at least two options. </p><p>  <strong>Option one: the "scientific" poke method.</strong> </p><ol><li>  If the mobile phone turns on, it should be connected to the computer through PC Suite.  Then it will be possible to remove the Nokia security code if it is requested immediately after turning on the device. </li><li>  You should download the JAF Setup utility, the drivers for it will work from any Nokia boot disk. </li><li>  Turn on the phone, find out what its resistance is.  For different models, it can vary. </li><li>  Next, you will need two small, 30 centimeters, wires and two ordinary sewing needles. </li><li>  The whole structure is connected in this way: needle, wiring, resistance, wiring, needle.  The sequence must be strict!  Power from 3.6 to 4 V is connected. The connection is given to the + and - buses, or the BSI contact is isolated from the battery contact.  Between the contacts of the Cnd and BSI batteries, those 2 needles are inserted.  Next, click on the power button on the phone.  The device itself should not twitch, vibrate so that the needles do not fly out.  A few seconds after switching on, the display should indicate with the inscription ‚Äúlocal mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúTest mode‚Äù that the experiment was a success. </li><li>  Next, a USB cable connects the phone to the computer.  The latter should identify Nokia as enabled and working properly.  We install drivers through the computer.  Next, you need to install the JAF program, open it and click "start". </li><li>  The next step, how to remove the Nokia lock code - go to the bb5 tab.  There, near the Read User Code item, check the box and click on Service.  When a new dialog box appears, click on the ‚ÄúRead Code‚Äù item. </li><li>  When the operation is done, the program itself will write the device code to the left of the button <br>  Read Code. </li></ol><p>  Note: this method is good for mobile phones created on BB5 platforms. <br><strong></strong></p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The second method: "software"</strong> </p><p>  This method is also used at home, although, of course, they know how to remove the Nokia lock code in workshops at mobile phone shops.  But addressing them costs time and money, and you can do everything yourself promptly and free of charge, which in itself is beneficial. </p><p>  So, another way to ‚Äúrevive‚Äù - using the program Mbro USB Nokia Tools Lite.  It is useful if the phone asks for a password before turning on, and therefore it cannot be connected to the computer.  Then you can try to get the lock code this way: </p><ul><li>  The program needs to be installed and unpacked, launched. </li><li>  Then connect the phone through PC Suite. </li><li>  The button with the microphone is hovered over and clicked on it. </li><li>  In the program window, in the last line there is the same security code that was needed.  It should be entered into the phone to check the operation.  And, besides, it‚Äôs better to write down the code so that later you don‚Äôt have to fight with the phone again. </li><li>  This method, which tells how to remove the Nokia lock code, as well as the password, is suitable for those phones that turn on completely.  The program itself works on computers where <span>Windows XP</span> or Winows7 are installed as OSes.  And as phones, respectively, the smartphone models Nokia N79 and <span>Nokia 6300.</span> </li></ul><p>  In the end, the phone can be formatted if no other options are suitable.  But this is an extreme case.  Although, then you can completely update the software, put in a different, more interesting operating system, various utilities and, ultimately, get a new model, even a more advanced one - just to ‚Äúpull‚Äù the filling, ie  The "insides" of the mobile phone. </p>
