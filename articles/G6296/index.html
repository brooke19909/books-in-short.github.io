  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main types of immunity and ways to increase its protective function</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, everyone, including children, is well aware that immunity is the main defensive power of the body that prevents the disease and the spread of infections.  This phrase is very firmly included in the everyday life of modern people, but few people think about its essence.  But there are certain types of immunity, knowing which, a person can not only broaden his horizons, but also make certain changes to his lifestyle, which will help strengthen the immune system of the human body. </p><p>  So, immunity is not only the body‚Äôs ability to show good resistance to pathogens of infectious and other diseases, but also a reaction aimed at destroying any extraneous microorganism in the body that can harm it.  The most important cells in our blood, such as lymphocytes, white blood cells, and macrophages, are the guardians of our health that protect it.  These cells of the <span>immune system</span> are responsible for the production of so-called antibodies that synthesize certain reactions, as a result of which harmful viruses and microbes die. </p><p>  Doctors distinguish the following main types of immunity: </p><ol><li>  Congenital.  Such immunity is inherited and therefore it is sometimes called genetic, which transfers all available information from parents to children.  To increase the innate immunity for parents, there are certain recommendations, observing which they increase the chance of having a child with strong immunity.  To a greater extent, these recommendations are related to maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle, quitting smoking and alcohol, as well as living in clean air. </li><li>  Acquired.  Here, immunity directly depends on the living conditions of a person, starting from the moment of his birth, and on various factors of external influence on the body.  Strong innate immunity can become the main basis for the further development of the body's immune forces, since in this case many unfavorable factors will enhance the body </li></ol><p>  By the way, the concept of immunity, the types of immunity and the factors that affect it should be well known to every person, because, having this knowledge, many people will be able to develop certain habits and lifestyles that will improve human health.  To date, a large number of drugs have appeared on sale - immunostimulants that enhance immunity and contribute to better health.  Thanks to such additives, anyone can, in the shortest possible time, increase their immunity to many diseases, including colds and viral diseases. </p><p>  However, you should not rely on medications alone.  Types of immunity, although they affect our body, but much depends on lifestyle.  The fact is that our body is very sensitive to our condition and what we are predisposed to.  Therefore, a person who is accustomed from childhood to be in the cold and not be afraid of him automatically has strong immunity, which well suppresses any <span>catarrhal diseases.</span>  If a person has never been in the cold, then his body has not developed the right reaction to the cold, and when it gets into <span>extreme situations,</span> all the generated heat is used to heat the upper skin, resulting in overcooling of the human internal organs, and it catches a cold. </p><p>  That is why the types of immunity should be known to every person.  You should also pay attention to the fact that even with weak innate immunity, you can develop good protection due to properly organized tempering procedures and a balanced diet.  There are many examples of how people became strong and healthy, despite the pain in childhood.  That is why, despite the fact that there are several types of immunity, everything is in the hands of the person himself, and a lot depends on his will. </p><p>  Great benefit in <span>strengthening immunity</span> is performed by swimming, which not only strengthens the cardiovascular system and lungs, but also has a general hardening effect on the whole body. </p>
