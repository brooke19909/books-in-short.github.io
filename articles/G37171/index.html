However, they are also the most problematic, since it is they who are most often faked by attackers. </p><p>  According to experts, to exchange <span>fake money,</span> scammers go to gas stations, car washes, service stations, to small shops and other organizations where the workflow is on stream and there is no way to check the bills for authenticity.  But far from always it is necessary to use expensive equipment for this.  About how to conduct a test without it, we will discuss later in the article. </p>

    <h2>  Banknote in 1000 rubles close-up </h2><p>  The 1997 banknote was first put into circulation in early January 2001.  The size of the thousandth bill corresponded to 157 x 69 mm.  It is made of quality cotton paper.  which was attended by drawings in the form of a monument to Yaroslav the Wise, a chapel and the Kremlin of the city of Yaroslavl in the background (on the front side of the banknote), the bell tower and the Church of St. John the Baptist (on the back). </p><p>  The bill is presented in blue-green color.  It contains several machine-readable protective properties, and is also distinguished by the presence of the emblem of the Bank of Russia.

    <h2>  Security signs on a thousandth bill </h2><p>  To avoid fakes, bank representatives gave each sample of the thousandth bill a certain degree of protection.  For example, during the manufacture of each banknote, light green and red fibers were introduced, presented in a certain sequence and followed by alternating yellow and red. </p><p>  Another form of banknote protection is the addition of a transparent protective line containing a repeating set of words.  However, you can see it only when viewing a banknote in the light.  In addition, <span>watermarks</span> present on the right and left sides (in the margins of the bill) act as reliable protective elements. </p><h2>  Modification of the thousandth note in 2004 </h2><p>  In 2004, the old thousandth bill underwent certain changes.  During its development, new methods of protection were involved.  For example, a vertically placed inscription appeared: "2004 Modification." </p><p>  In addition, the coat of arms of the city of Yaroslavl on the bill was covered with the same special paint as the emblem of the bank on the 1997 banknote.  Among other changes introduced in the production of 1000 rubles, we can also highlight: </p><ul><li>  the introduction of several colors into the paper at once - light green, red and gray; </li><li>  the addition of a diving <span>metallized thread</span> ; </li><li>  changing the print of the bank‚Äôs emblem (it acquired embossed outlines and is made in green); </li><li>  adding a digital denomination made by microperforation; </li><li>  the appearance of a field with hidden moire stripes; </li><li>  changing the print of a digital value (done in gray); </li><li>  change of an ornamental multicolor strip; </li><li>  the introduction of new signs recognizing for cars (determined by the action of ultraviolet radiation). </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the updated thousandth bill (you can see the photo in the article) has not changed much compared to the 1997 model.  However, she acquired a number of additional signs to help distinguish bank money from counterfeit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Modification of the thousandth bill of 2010 </h2><p>  The next modification of 1000 rubles occurred in August 2010.  In particular, she touched on the color scheme.  In general, the design of the previous 2004 remained.  Additionally, on the front side of the paper appeared the inscription ‚ÄúModification of 2010‚Äù.  Among other innovations displayed on banknotes, we can distinguish the following: </p><ul><li>  the appearance of protective fibers of a gray tone and two-tone; </li><li>  the appearance of a wide protective thread; </li><li>  the appearance of a combined watermark in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coupon field; </li><li>  applying the coat of arms of Yaroslavl with special <span>magnetic paint</span> with additional visual effects; </li><li>  the appearance of thin relief strokes on the coupon fields; </li><li>  increasing the height of the digits of the serial number located on the left; </li><li>  the appearance of a new element with small colored stripes (located at the bottom of the bill); </li><li>  Introduction to paper of several elements with magnetic properties. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the thousandth banknotes of 2004 received additional signs visible under ultraviolet light. </p>

    <h2>  What security signs were present on the 2006 money? </h2><p>  At the time of issue of the five thousandth note, the Bank of Russia introduced the following types of protection: </p><ul><li>  hidden moire stripes in the fields; </li><li>  the use of an optically variable type of paint in the image of the coat of arms of the city of Khabarovsk; </li><li>  the use of a coating with the effect of polarization (when applying the emblem of the bank); </li><li>  use of digital designation of face value; </li><li>  use of colorless stamping; </li><li>  Increase the first digits in the serial number from left to right. </li></ul><p>  As can be seen from the list, 5-thousandth banknotes of 2006 had reliable protection.  However, this did not stop the attackers.  According to experts, along with banknotes with a face value of 1000 rubles, five-thousandths fell under the scammers' sight.  In order to reduce the number of fakes, the Bank of Russia conducted a new modification procedure. </p><h2>  Modification of the <span>five thousandth bill of</span> 2010 </h2><p>  The next according to the bank‚Äôs plan, the modification period of 5,000 rubles was September 2011.  What has changed?  If you pay attention to the new money, you can find a lot in common with the 1997 samples.  However, unlike them, in the updated banknotes the combination of primary colors has changed.  For example, in place of bright shades came more calm pastel colors. </p><p>  In addition, the thousandth denominations of 5,000 rubles were supplemented with the following insignia: </p><ul><li>  the presence of thin relief strokes at the edges of the fields; </li><li>  moire stripes with an additional color segment; </li><li>  combined watermark; </li><li>  the coat of arms of Khabarovsk with an optical variable and the effect of image displacement when changing its position; </li><li>  the presence of additional elements with magnetic properties. </li></ul><h2>  Simple Banknote Verification Methods </h2><p>  Despite all the efforts of the bank, banknotes of 1,000 and 5,000 rubles continue to be faked.  And even if this happens much less often than before, there is always the possibility of acquiring a worthless fake.  But how to check a thousandth bill?  Whether it‚Äôs 1000 or 5000 rubles, checking them out will not be difficult.  In particular, you can use the simple methods themselves. </p><p>  So, the first thing to do is to carefully examine the money received.  One of the most common signs of fake, according to representatives of the bank, is the presence of an uneven font and low-quality printing.  The second sign is fuzzy or completely absent rendering of image details. </p><p>  The third important point is when the paper used to print money has a different density.  According to experts, such a difference can be determined by examining thousandths of banknotes in the world.  And, of course, it is worth paying special attention to the presence of watermarks, emblems and protective colored hairs.  In addition to this, there are other verification methods specific to each bill separately.  We will tell you more about them. </p>

    <h2>  How can I check a thousandth bill? </h2><p>  Holding a banknote in the amount of 1000 rubles, pay attention to the coat of arms of Yaroslavl.  On real money, you can see a horizontal iridescent strip located in the middle.  If you turn the bill, then this strip should move up or down (relative to its original position). </p><p>  The second thing to look at is the year of the thousandth bill.  You will see 1997 on the original. And when placing the bill, you will see the modification year - 2004 or 2010. The third sign of authenticity is the presence of a watermark in the form of a portrait of Yaroslav the Wise (on a white field of a banknote). </p><p>  It is also necessary to carefully probe the inscription ‚ÄúBank of Russia ticket‚Äù and the adjacent strips.  Since the inscription was created for people with disabilities, this text and stripes are embossed.  You can easily feel them with your fingers.  In addition, carefully look at the uniform green field of the banknote.  When tilted, yellow and blue stripes can be seen against its background. </p><p>  And finally, upon closer examination, the drawing of the building, located on the right side of the chapel, consists of small graphic pictures and inscriptions. </p>

    <h2>  How to check a five thousandth bill? </h2><p>  The five thousandth bill also has its own security signs.  For example, if the banknote is tilted to the side, then the image of the coat of arms on it will change its crimson color to golden green.  The second important point - tilting the banknote, pay attention to the plain field (located between the inscriptions "5000" and "Khabarovsk").  Against its background, as a rule, rainbow stripes appear. </p><p>  The third sign is the presence of watermarks in the margins of the banknote.  On the one hand it is "5000", and on the other - a portrait of N. N. Muravyov-Amursky.  Next, carefully look at the security thread.  With real money, it is not all hidden under the paper, but partially protrudes, forming a kind of pearly dotted line.  In addition, when viewing it in the light, you can see a bright number of 5000 against a uniform dark background. </p><p>  Now you know how you can verify money for authenticity.  According to the representatives of the bank, only three signs are enough to make sure that the banknote is real. </p>
