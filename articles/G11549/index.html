  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Board of Ivan the 3rd</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Prince Ivan Vasilyevich 3rd was the son of Vasily Vasilyevich 2nd Dark of the Rurik dynasty.  The reign of Ivan the 3rd was remembered by the unification of a substantial part of Russian lands around Moscow, its transformation into the center of the Russian state.  In addition, an important achievement was the complete liberation of Russia from the rule of the hated Golden Horde.  A normative legal act or set of state laws was adopted - Sudebnik - and reforms were carried out that laid down a local land tenure system that was different from the patrimony. </p><p>  Ivan the Great was born in January 1440.  His direct name was Timothy, but in honor of John Chrysostom the prince was named Ivan.  The first mention of Ivan the 3rd as the ‚ÄúGrand Duke‚Äù falls on around 1449, and in 1452 he becomes the head of the army that successfully liberated the Kokshengu fortress.  Ruling a short time the state of D. Shemyak was poisoned, and the ongoing bloody <span>internecine war,</span> unleashed not without his participation, began to decline. </p><p>  The reign of Ivan the 3rd begins with his father.  He runs Pereslavl-Zalessky, who at that time was one of the key cities in the Moscow state.  The formation of his views is influenced by military operations and campaigns.  As the first nominal commander, he later led the army, which closed the way to Moscow to the invading Tatars. </p><p>  In 1462, the years of the reign of Ivan the 3rd begin when, after illness and the death of his father, he received the right to inherit the throne and most of the state territory.  He owns 16 cities, and Moscow belongs to him on an equal basis with his brothers.  Fulfilling the will of the dying father, he divided the land by will between all the sons.  As the eldest son, he ascends the throne.  The reign of Ivan the 3rd begins with the release of gold coins, which he marked the beginning of the reign. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The country's foreign policy during this period was aimed at uniting the lands of Russia (northeastern regions) into a single Moscow state.  I would like to note that it was such a policy that was extremely successful for Russia.  The reign of Ivan the 3rd, which is marked in history by the beginning of the unification of Russian lands, did not suit everyone.  For example, it was contrary to Lithuanian interests, so relations with the <span>Grand Duchy of Lithuania</span> were tense, and cross-border clashes took place constantly.  The successes that were achieved thanks to the expansion of the country contributed to the growth and development of international relations with Europe. </p><p>  Another important point noted the reign of Ivan the 3rd.  This design is for the Russian state of independence.  The nominal dependence on the Golden Horde was discontinued.  The government concludes an alliance with the Crimean Khanate, actively speaking on the side of the opponents of the Horde.  Skillfully combining military force and diplomacy, Ivan the 3rd successfully orientates foreign policy eastward towards the <span>Kazan Khanate.</span> </p><p>  It is worth noting separately the <span>results of the reign of Ivan the 3rd.</span>  Much has been done to unite the Russian principalities.  Tribute payments to the Horde Khan were also finally stopped, which brought considerable benefits to Russia. </p><p>  Difficult times began in 1480, when the prince of Lithuania entered into an alliance with the khan of the Horde, and the <span>Livonian Order</span> came to Pskov amid the rebellion of the Lithuanians.  The situation was resolved as a result of a bloody battle in favor of the Russian state, which received the coveted independence. </p><p>  The Russo-Lithuanian war, which was a confrontation between the two states, which lasted from 1487 to 1494, ended with the conclusion of a peace treaty, during which Russia transferred most of the conquered lands, including the Vyazma fortress. </p><p>  You can also note the positive results of the reign of Ivan the 3rd in domestic politics.  At this time, the foundations are laid in the management of the command and local system, the centralization of the country and the fight against fragmentation are carried out.  The era was marked by a cultural upsurge.  The heyday of the annals, the erection of new architectural structures everywhere took place in this period of time.  This once again emphasizes that Ivan the 3rd was an outstanding ruler, and his nickname "The Great" characterizes him in the best way. </p>
