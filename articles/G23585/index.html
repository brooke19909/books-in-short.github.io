    <p>  Definition </p><p>  First, we will understand what a trader is, what his activity is.  This word comes from the English verb to trade, which translates as "exchange", "trade" or "use for personal purposes."  This term appeared on the London stock exchange, where a trader was called a person who, at his own risk, engages in exchange trading.  In simple words, this is a special kind of speculator who makes a living through fluctuations in the value of securities and foreign exchange quotes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to become a trader" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/265647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to become a trader </p><p>  Is it difficult to master this profession?  There is no single answer to this question.  On the one hand, indeed, in order to trade stocks or currency, it is not at all necessary to have an economics degree or spend several years piling over a mountain of textbooks.  Moreover, you can generally purchase or find an advisor program on the Internet that will trade itself around the clock, and the user will only need to monitor it from time to time and keep the computer constantly on.  But real experts who know what a trader is, firsthand, will say that no software is able to replace the human mind, and world events sometimes change so unexpectedly that, relying on an adviser, you can very quickly lose all the capital deposited into the account. </p><p>  If you approach this issue from the technical point of view, you only need three things to conduct trading: a <span>trading platform</span> (most now use Metatrader 4 or 5 versions), making a minimum deposit (from $ 10 and above) to the account of the selected broker and high-quality access to the Internet.  Pretty simple, right?  In order to start trading - yes, but in order to successfully and for a long time work in this field - no. </p><p>  What is a trader?  This is a man with all his fears, weaknesses, emotions, feelings.  When at least ten dollars profit looms on the account, I really want to fix a positive result and be glad of my sagacity.  Well, when as a result of an unsuccessful transaction losses begin to grow, it is very, very difficult to part with hard-earned funds.  Many, especially beginners, literally hope for a miracle, believing that the movement of the asset will soon change its direction in the right direction.  But if this does not happen, the losses only increase.  Soon they ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the entire deposit.  Therefore, here, what is needed first of all is not knowledge, but self-control and cold calculation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trading trader" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/266309.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  Is trading worth it? </p><p>  We recommend that you first try yourself in contests.  This will help you understand how close this activity is to you.  Many of them are held free of charge, and some brokers, for example MMCIS, can withdraw prizes without any restrictions.  If you have decent results, then perhaps a successful trading trader will come out of you, and if not, well, at least you will know that you should not go in cycles more on this business.  In fact, trading on the stock exchange is a rather complicated and painstaking work, and for all its advantages, one should not forget that it often has large losses.  However, it all depends on the trading style, and this, as they say, is a completely different topic for discussion. </p>
