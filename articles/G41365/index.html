From this attack, 6 thousand people died, and another 15 thousand were seriously injured.  Since then, this type of weapon has been constantly improved.  Traditionally, it consists of toxic substances and their means of delivery to the target. </p><p>  The basis of chemical weapons is toxic toxic compounds.  They infect humans and animals, infect the terrain, air, water and the rest of the environment.  As delivery vehicles, mines and rockets, land mines, drafts, and grenades are used. </p><p>  Chemical <span>factors (damaging factors)</span> are the properties of toxic substances that have a negative effect on the enemy.  Such weapons are used not only to destroy the enemy, but also to reduce their combat effectiveness.  Thus, it can be used as an auxiliary tool to help accomplish the task.  Secondary damaging factors of chemical weapons represent further consequences of their use.  Such phenomena include contamination of the environment, food supplies, weapons, clothing, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Consequences of use </h2><p>  Poisoning substances have various physiological effects.  The damaging factor of chemical weapons can cause nerve damage in the body.  Soman, sarin, etc. possess such properties. Their chemical factors (damaging factors) harm the human body and thereby cause paralysis, muscle cramps, and death.  Such consequences are the result of a nervous system disorder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Chemical factors (damaging factors) of lumisitis and mustard gas have a skin-boiling effect.  Digestion, respiratory system, and eyes also suffer from these substances.  The affected skin within a few hours after interaction with these toxic substances, as a rule, turns red, and later blisters and ulcers appear on it. </p><p>  Chlorocyan and <span>hydrocyanic acid</span> have slightly different properties <span>.</span>  They enter the body through the respiratory organs or through the stomach along with poisoned food and water.  These substances cause severe shortness of breath, cramps, paralysis, and a constant feeling of fear.  Chemical factors (damaging factors) of some other reagents can also cause hallucinations, impaired coordination and mental disorders. </p><h2>  Phytotoxins </h2><p>  Weapons of this type are also used to destroy crops (primarily cereals).  This is done in order to deprive the enemy of food supplies.  This undermines not only the food base, but also the military-economic potential of the enemy.  Such chemical weapons and their damaging factors became world famous after the use of the American army during the Vietnam War. </p><p>  Gradually, a whole group of poisons - phytotoxins.  Among them, herbicides used to destroy grassy vegetation, vegetables and cereals stand out especially.  The consequences of their use resemble the damaging factors of a chemical accident.  The most famous herbicide is Agent Orange.  The British first tested it in Malaya, then the Americans in Vietnam.  The name was a reference to the characteristic orange color of barrels in which toxic reagents were transported.  Today phytotoxins are an important weapon of environmental warfare. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Chemical attack protection </h2><p>  Most often, modern chemical weapons are missiles that burst right in the air.  A characteristic sign of such an attack is a dark, scattering, rapidly settling cloud of colored or white.  So the poisonous substances get into the air, and from there - into the rest of the environment.  Their drops are clearly visible on the asphalt, leaves and walls.  Another sign of the presence of toxic substances is the mass death of birds, wilting greens and flowers. </p><p>  The extreme toxicity of modern chemical weapons is the norm.  Therefore, both the civilian population and the military must respond to the danger of infection promptly and smoothly.  In this case, there is always something to fear: any damaging factor of chemical weapons can cause serious illness and death. </p><p>  In case of anxiety, a gas mask is put on.  If we are talking about substances that have an effect on the skin, then a special suit is also required for protection.  However, the most reliable shelter is a shelter.  Before entering it, people need to take off their outer clothing and the used protective equipment.  In a properly equipped shelter for this purpose there is a vestibule.  It is an additional precautionary measure - so you can be completely sure that poisonous substances will not get into the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Just like the damaging factors of a chemical accident, the dangers associated with the use of chemical weapons await the person at every step.  Some shelters (e.g. basements) do not guarantee absolute security.  Such places can help out if drip and liquid poisonous substances are used, but they cannot protect against gases, vapors and aerosols in the air.  Therefore, in certain cases, people use gas masks, even while in refuge. </p><p>  Each chemical damaging factor affects a person only if he is in the focus of infection.  Leaving the danger zone can be extremely difficult.  Chemical weapons and their damaging factors are massive.  Gases, aerosols and spray materials can cover vast areas.  In such circumstances, the evacuation of civilians, as a rule, requires high-quality training and remarkable organization on the part of the state. </p>

    <h2>  Biological weapons </h2><p>  The basis of biological (or bacteriological) weapons are biological agents.  They are selected specifically for military purposes.  Under the influence of the damaging factors of this weapon, people, animals and plants become ill with serious ailments.  The biological agents necessary for bacteriological attacks are pathogenic microorganisms.  They are pathogenic, i.e., cause infectious diseases.  Their other damaging factor is waste products.  Once in the human body, they cause severe poisoning due to their high toxicity. </p><p>  In some details, the damaging factors of chemical and bacteriological weapons have some similarities.  For example, it is clearly noticeable in the case of crops.  Both chemical and biological weapons are used to destroy enemy crops.  For this, not only bacteria can be used, but also insects - the most dangerous pests for cereals and vegetables. </p><h2>  Bacteria </h2><p>  Pathogenic microorganisms used in biological weapons, according to their characteristics, are divided into several types.  These pathogens of infectious diseases have different structures, sizes and other properties.  The most common bacteria.  The common damaging factors of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are fully correlated with the danger posed by these creatures.  The main purpose of their use is to destroy or weaken the enemy. </p><p>  Bacteria are of plant nature.  Most of them are extremely vulnerable to high temperatures, sunlight, disinfectants and sudden fluctuations in humidity.  At the same time, pathogenic bacteria can be the causative agents of such deadly diseases as anthrax, tetanus, botulism, plague, cholera, melioidosis, glanders, etc. In addition, these microorganisms feel great at temperatures below zero.  Bacteria designed for biological weapons are grown under artificial conditions.  For their mass production, technologies are used that are used in the production of medicines, vitamins and antibiotics. </p>

    <h2>  Viruses, Rickettsia and Mushrooms </h2><p>  Another type of biological weapon is viruses.  These dangerous microorganisms can exist and multiply only inside foreign living cells.  They parasitize on the body of their master.  Viruses are resistant to temperature differences.  They are the causative agents of more than 70 diseases, including yellow fever, smallpox, etc. Thus, the damaging factors of chemical and biological weapons are equally dangerous - they can cause serious disturbances in the functioning of the body and death of the victim. </p><p>  The intermediate position between viruses and bacteria is rickettsia.  They cause diseases such as spotted fever, typhus, etc. Interestingly, in the natural environment, rickettsia is transmitted by arthropods.  The striking factors of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons differ in that they are deeply contrary to nature.  Missiles, shells, bombs, warheads - all this is created in order to make destruction unnatural in scale. </p><p>  Another type of biological weapon is mushrooms.  Like bacteria, they are of plant origin.  These organisms form spores that are resistant to drying and freezing. </p>

    <h2>  Biological attack actions </h2><p>  The effectiveness of bacteriological weapons lies in the fact that after the formation of the focus of the disease, pathogens continue to spread due to new patients.  Thus, it is enough to start an epidemic, and its further development is only a matter of time.  Of course, in the case of biological attacks, there are a number of measures necessary to stop the death of ever new people.  Bacteriological weapons have several vulnerabilities that distinguish chemical weapons.  Protection from damaging factors, however, can only be effective if the characteristics of the enemy attack ‚Äî the type of microorganisms and their weaknesses ‚Äî are exactly known. </p><p>  In war, bacteria can spread not only through shells, but also through rodents and insects - the main carriers of dangerous pathogens of deadly diseases.  In the case of the use of ammunition with biological agents, a characteristic cloud of fog or powdery substances appears at the place of their rupture. </p><p>  To protect against bacteriological weapons, gas masks and respirators are primarily used.  They are relatively small, practical and reliable.  It is also necessary to wear protective equipment designed for the skin.  According to the rules of civil defense, people must leave the streets and stay indoors with closed windows and doors.  The main thing is to prevent the bacterial product from getting on the skin, clothing or the respiratory system. </p><p>  The population‚Äôs immunity to certain types of diseases can be achieved through deliberate prevention: vaccination, the use of serums, etc. In any case, the important part of protection against bacteriological weapons is the observance of hygiene rules and sanitary requirements regarding water supply and nutrition for people.  Cooking should be done only in places isolated from the source of infection.  It is necessary to wash the dishes not only with special solutions, but also, for greater certainty, to subject them to boiling.  In the event of an epidemic, more than ever, it is important to stop the spread of panic.  The energy of each person should be aimed at preventing the negative consequences of the use of dangerous weapons by the enemy. </p><p>  Finally, quarantine is mandatory.  It is definitely necessary in the case of the spread of especially serious diseases: cholera, plague, etc. The quarantine regime is needed to completely isolate the focus of the disease from the surrounding population.  On the borders of this special zone, special security is established and the position of commandant is established.  Patrols are carried out, movement is controlled, violators of the regime are detained.  Particularly careful protection is needed in hospitals, infectious isolation wards and at checkpoints. </p><p>  People who are inside the quarantine zone are forbidden to leave its borders, as well as to transport their animals and personal belongings.  Crossing of checkpoints is permitted only by the chief of civil defense.  The transit crossing through <span>the affected area is</span> tightly controlled <span>.</span>  In fact, it is prohibited.  Exceptions can be made only for railway transport.  In isolated areas, regular disinfection is performed.  Quarantine is removed only after the pathogen completely dies. </p>

    <h2>  Nuclear weapon </h2><p>  Nuclear weapons appeared in the middle of the 20th century, during the Second World War.  By its properties and power, it is the most deadly.  The modern military arsenal allows the use of nuclear weapons in the air, above water, under water, on the ground and underground.  An explosion from it can instantly destroy people and disable equipment, destroy structures and entire cities. </p><p>  The first consequence of using a nuclear warhead is a shock wave.  This is the most powerful damaging factor of such weapons.  The shock wave with giant speed spreads in all directions.  If a man finds himself at the epicenter of an explosion, he will be left without any chance of salvation.  The only protection against nuclear weapons are special shelters and shelters. </p><p>  An explosion is a source of light radiation consisting of infrared and ultraviolet rays.  It acts for 15 seconds and during this time causes severe skin burns, as well as damage to unprotected eyes.  You can protect yourself from light radiation indoors or with the help of special clothing made of non-combustible material. </p>

    <h2>  Radioactive contamination </h2><p>  Penetrating radiation is a much longer and longer term damaging factor for nuclear weapons.  It is a stream of neutrons and gamma rays penetrating the environment 12 seconds after the explosion.  Radiation affects all living organisms.  In humans and animals, it causes radiation sickness - a terrible disease that ends with the destruction of the body from the inside and death. </p><p>  A nuclear explosion cloud is a source of <span>radioactive contamination.</span>  <span>The zone of</span> its distribution can stretch for hundreds and even thousands of kilometers.  When radioactive substances get into exposed areas of the body, local skin lesions appear.  Hazardous compounds can also enter the body.  To protect against infection, special shelters and personal protective equipment are used. </p><p>  When interacting with the environment, the radiation coming from the explosion zone creates a powerful electromagnetic pulse.  It damages cable and wire lines, and also damages equipment, including alarm, communication and control systems.  The damaging factors of nuclear and chemical weapons are particularly dangerous for life.  That is why the use of such ammunition is limited or prohibited by various international conventions and agreements. </p>
