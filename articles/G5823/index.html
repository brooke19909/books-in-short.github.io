    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  So, U Sladku 3 * (Prague) is a small family-type hotel located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  The hotel occupies one staircase of a residential building, so it is always quite quiet and comfortable here.  It is ideal for those tourists who prefer peace and quiet.  It is small, but comfortable, the cost of rooms is more than democratic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the entrance to the hotel all vacationers are waiting for a huge number of living plants and flowers.  It creates a feeling of real home comfort, which is so necessary for tired tourists.  The interior is decorated in the best traditions of the Czech style.  The hotel has an elevator, but many prefer to use the beautiful staircase. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Perhaps the largest administrative district of the city is precisely Prague 6. U Sladku 3 * <span>(Czech Republic, Prague)</span> is located in it.  The famous Prague Castle is only a 15-20 minute walk away.  In front of the hotel there is a public transport, tram stop, where in just 20 minutes you will reach the city center and all its iconic sights.  Tourists note the excellent location of the hotel, because you do not have to travel a considerable distance in order to walk around the city, at the same time you do not need to put up with the noise, bustle, and incessant music coming from the main streets of the city. </p>

    <p>  Not far from the hotel there is a small cozy restaurant, where for a little money you can get acquainted with local dishes, drink a glass of real Czech beer.  On the same street with the hotel there are quite a lot of Chinese shops where you can buy souvenirs with the symbols of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you consider yourself a rather demanding tourist, the location of the hotel may not seem to you so profitable and convenient.  It should be understood that you will have to get to all the sights: on foot or by public transport.  In fact, a walk through the old streets of the city is a gift, not a punishment, for many tourists.  That is why every tourist for himself must set the main priorities of the rest.  But without exception, note the proximity to the airport. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The issue of checking into a hotel is relevant for all tourists.  Surely no one wants on arrival to face the need for a few more hours to wait for the room keys.  After the journey, every tourist wants to relax, get in order, have a bite and go for a walk around the fairy-tale city faster.  Hotel U Sladku 3 * (Prague), despite the rather affordable cost of rooms, was able to maintain the atmosphere of home comfort.  All staff are polite, attentive, most often check-in occurs earlier than the due date - you will definitely not be hungry and tired under the door.  Even if the room is not ready for your arrival, you will be offered another option or a luggage room.  You can go for a walk around the city, and upon returning your luggage will already be in the room. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The level of comfort depends on the rooms.  The administration offers 23 double and 8 triple.  The rooms are small, but taking into account that you will spend only night here, there is enough space for sleep and relaxation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotel U Sladku 3 * (Prague) offers a rather modest design of rooms.  If this is a double room, then you will see two single beds with bedside tables, a small wardrobe.  Here you will not see a TV, a refrigerator, but tourists, in principle, do not need them.  If the availability of satellite TV and a refrigerator is fundamentally for you, this is definitely not your option.  Even for an additional fee, you will not get what you want.  The furniture is quite old, it has not been repaired for a long time.  On the floor, the carpet is quite clean, without stains, which is good news.  We move to the bathroom.  To receive hygiene procedures, a shower is provided.  It is far from ideal, but it is quite suitable for a shower.  If you are not confused by the lack of a bathtub and a hairdryer in your room, the U Sladku 3 * hotel (Prague) will suit you.  Reviews of vacationers sometimes speak of insufficient quality of plumbing, but upon request, all breakdowns are eliminated.  The bathroom has all shower facilities, towels and cosmetics.  Interruptions in the supply of hot water are sometimes observed, especially in the evening.  Rooms are cleaned daily, bed linen and towels are changed at the request of vacationers.  In general, the rooms are quite clean and comfortable - what else do tourists need. </p>

    <p>  Some tourists complain about the lack of laundry and a washing machine in the room.  The problem in this case is solved - contact the reception staff, quite often they go towards the guests and provide an opportunity to put things in order. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel U Sladku 3 * (Prague) has its own restaurant where you can have breakfast.  Breakfast is included in the price of the buffet.  Of course, if you are used to relaxing in chic all-inclusive hotels, breakfasts may seem meager and varied.  But for the European treshka, it‚Äôs very good: breakfast cereals, granola, yogurt, cottage cheese, bread, sliced, eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, tea, coffee.  It is enough to eat.  Tourists who leave for an early excursion can order breakfast with them - for this it is necessary to warn the administration the night before. </p>

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Wireless internet is available on site.  The signal quality can hardly be called ideal; in rooms it is sometimes impossible to catch it at all.  If necessary, you can contact the friendly staff and ask for a modem reboot - the situation, albeit slightly, but will change.  Most often, guests of the hotel are tourists who are primarily interested in <span>Prague</span> itself <span>.</span>  U Sladku 3 * offers everyone to purchase tickets for transport at the reception, as well as book an excursion program.  Here you will find guides, a detailed map of the city - in general, everything you need for an inexperienced tourist who came to Prague for the first time.  The friendly Russian-speaking staff will answer all your questions, help you decide on routes, tell you how to get to the necessary point in the city.  Rarely is the staff so friendly, polite and caring. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is pet friendly.  If you cannot leave your pet at home, take it with you.  The hotel is fully heated, as it is located in a residential building.  Not all hotels can boast such an advantage.  If you suddenly feel cold, please contact the hotel‚Äôs 24-hour reception desk - they will bring the room temperature to the required level. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Most of those tourists who come to Europe understand the value of the city itself.  That is why often the main criterion for choosing a hotel is the cost of a room in it.  Hotel U Sladku 3 * (Czech Republic, Prague) is a budget option, which is due to its popularity among city guests. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As already noted, the hotel is located in a residential building, therefore it does not have its own territory.  There is no conference room, spa complex, swimming pool and sauna, the hotel is fully designed for tourists.  You can consider this a drawback, but most European 3 * hotels will also not offer you entertainment. </p>
