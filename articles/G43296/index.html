    <h2>  Alexandra enters the aviation regiment </h2><p>  In 1941, the enemy stood near Moscow itself.  Stalin announced the preparation and formation of women's aviation regiments.  They were supposed to include women from the Air Force, Osoaviahim, KA and the Civil Air Fleet.  Then the Komsomol appealed to all the girls with a proposal to go to serve in the aircraft.  Akimova Alexandra immediately seized the moment and became a volunteer.  After that, at the <span>Pedagogical Institute.</span>  <span>Lenin</span> sent a document according to which Akimova was to receive a full payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  She was heading to the front.  But they did not have time to calculate it, since she had to come to the collection point the very next day.  However, at that time she was least interested in money, her main dream came true - at last she could go to war. </p><h2>  Women's regiment formation </h2><p>  The formation of women's regiments was led by <span>M. M. Raskova.</span>  The collection point in Moscow was the Military Academy.  Zhukovsky.  Many students, technicians, and pilots from flying clubs came to the regiments; among the volunteers, one of the first was Akimova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet military leader akimova alexandra fedorovna" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1249826.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  The formation of the regiment number 588, to which Alexander was attached, was completed in the Saratov region, in the flight school.  Engels Military Volga District.  The regiment was nightly, light bomber.  For him, Po-2 aircraft were allocated.  The commander of the regiment was Evdokia Bershanskaya.  Commissioner - E. Rachkevich. </p><h2>  Alexandra gets to the front </h2><p>  Alexandra was identified in one of the groups by an arms mechanic.  Akimova was very upset because she dreamed about the <span>profession of a pilot.</span>  But she could not disobey the order and began to diligently master the new profession.  At Engelskaya VAShP, courses for aircraft masters were created.  They got Alexandra an additional profession in aviation technology.  So Akimova Alexandra Fedorovna, whose photo is in this article, was at the front. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1942, on the twenty-seventh of May, she flew out for the first time on a combat mission.  There were two squadrons in her regiment.  In each - ten aircraft and 112 personnel.  Subsequently, this amount was doubled. </p><h2>  Alexandra Regiment </h2><p>  The women's aviation regiment, in which Alexander served, the Germans called "night witches."  The planes on which the girls flew were considered training or coherent before the war.  But this was in the hands of the Russian army, since at first the fascists did not consider these aircraft at all as combat units. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akimova Alexandra Fedorovna biography" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1249824.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  But the Germans quickly changed this view.  And very soon, for one downed plane in Germany, they gave not only a cash bonus, but also an extraordinary vacation.  Pilots inflicted such accurate "sniper" attacks on fascist positions that the Germans had to take women's air regiments very seriously. </p><p>  During its existence, the regiment participated in many battles.  Alexandra's regiment made twenty-four thousand sorties and dropped more than three million bombs on the enemy.  Subsequently, this aviation regiment began to be called the 46th Guards.  And on his banner two orders soon appeared.  The regiment was awarded the honorary title "Taman".
