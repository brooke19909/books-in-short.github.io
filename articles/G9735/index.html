It was at this time that the riverbed became more full due to melting snow.

The ridge will have to be overcome on foot (approximately 1 kilometer); </li><li>  From Yekaterinburg you need to go along the Serov highway to the city of Severouralsk.  From there, head for the village of Bayanovka and from it along a <span>dirt road,</span> adhering to the western direction, drive about 80 kilometers.  A trail leads to the waterfalls, which is hard to miss; </li><li>  For lovers of extreme travel, there is the option of rafting along the Lampa River to the Uls stream, near the mouth of which a trail begins, about 2-3 kilometers long, leading to waterfalls. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gigalan waterfalls map" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1139140.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  After rains, usually forest roads become more impassable, so this fact should be taken into account when planning a trip.  You also need to stock up on additional cans of gasoline and spare tires, as there is no infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the waterfalls.  It is better to choose cars with all-wheel drive and a fairly high clearance, since there are deep puddles on the way, and in some places you have to cross the river ford, because the bridge sometimes flushes. </p><p>  In general, Zhigalan waterfalls deserve to be visited.  If you are not afraid of a vacation with tents surrounded by wildlife, then this is the perfect place for a vacation.  Here you can relax not only with your body, but also with your soul, forget about the hustle and bustle.  No wonder these waterfalls are considered the pearl of the Northern Urals. </p>
