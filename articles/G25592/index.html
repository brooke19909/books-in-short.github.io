    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  This is the first thing you need to pay attention to.  Before you get a loan at Sberbank, you need to carefully read all the conditions.  So, a loan is issued for personal consumption in rubles.  The minimum amount is 300,000, the maximum is one and a half million.  Duration - from 3 months to 5 years.  But there is one caveat.  If a person applies to the bank with temporary registration, then a loan will be issued to him for such an amount of time that will not exceed its validity period.  There is no commission for providing the service.  And security is not required - this is also important to remember. </p><h2>  Secured by </h2><p>  Now you can talk in more detail about specific cases of loan issuance.  And it’s worth starting with loans issued with the guarantee of individuals.  Judging by the reviews, it is easiest for people who are customers of the bank.  That is, those who have a registered contribution or a salary card there.  To get a loan, they only need to bring their passport.  In addition, they can get a lower rate.  So, is it profitable to get a <span>loan</span> from this <span>bank?</span>  Judging objectively, it’s not very.  Looking at the example, you can understand why. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Suppose a man who receives a salary of 40,000 rubles per month on a Sberbank card wants to get a loan for a year.  He has a wife with an income of 30,000 rubles / m, which is also taken into account.  With such indicators, they can give him a loan amount of only 172,000 rubles.  At a rate of 13.9% per annum.  The monthly payment will be 15,435 rubles.  And the total overpayment amount is 13,223 rubles.  All this can be calculated and double-checked using a loan calculator. </p><p>  And if you need a million for 2 years?  Experts say that an application for such an amount will be approved if each spouse has a monthly income of 100,000 rubles.  Then the payment will be 47 965 rubles, and the final overpayment - 151 175. </p>

    <h2>  Loan to household managers </h2><p>  Sberbank has a special credit program created for people who own their own subsidiary plots.
