Mobile Phone Nokia 222 Dual Sim</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not so long ago, phones sold under the Nokia brand were in high demand.  They are deservedly called the best, as they were distinguished by a high level of quality and battery life.  But time does not stand still.  Every year, many new models that are equipped with innovative technologies appear on the market.  The Finnish company, striving to follow the fashion and saving on production costs, gradually slowed down, giving way to other brands such as Apple, Samsung and others.  It is worth noting that even smartphones from Chinese manufacturers have become more attractive to buyers. </p><p>  Finding a phone sold under the Nokia brand is currently quite difficult, as the company is now led by Microsoft.  But in 2015, the new Nokia 222 model goes on sale.  Specifications, reviews and a description can be read below.  The phone is a typical button device.  What technologies did the developers use?  Is there anything interesting about him?  Does it meet modern requirements?  These questions are often asked by buyers who pick up a new mobile phone.  Answers to them are contained in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 222 specifications reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605127.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, she did not completely abandon the old brand name, using it for classic devices.  As a rule, during their development, preference was given to proven technologies. </p><p>  The Nokia 222 phone was produced in two versions.  The first is classic.  It is a typical all-in-one with a button keyboard.  The model is designed to work with one sim-card.  The second option looks no different from the first.  The form factor corresponds to the classic design.  The only thing is that it has two slots for sim cards.  The manufacturer called this model Nokia 222 Dual Sim. </p><p>  The devices received an updated operating system, which allows you to work with a wide range of different programs.  The color screen and the convenient keyboard unit are undoubtedly an advantage.  The target audience is children and the elderly.  Also, this model is purchased as a second phone, since it is simple and high-quality. </p><p>  Assembly is carried out in Vietnam.  Such news will please those who have a negative attitude to products from the Middle Kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 222 dual sim" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605116.jpg" width="500"></div>

The stores are presented in two classic colors - white and black.  Light - the weight is only 80 g, the dimensions are optimally selected (116 √ó 50 √ó 13 mm).  According to the instructions, such dimensions correspond to both a simple model with an index of 222, and a dual-SIM - Nokia 222 Dual Sim.  Due to this, the phone lies perfectly in the hand, does not slip.  In the lineup there are options with a matte and glossy body.  The latter are marked with the prefix Rome. </p><p>  The front panel is visually divided into two halves.  At the top there is a screen, a speaker.  The bottom is allotted for the keyboard unit.  Under the "0" key is a hole for the microphone. </p><p>  The back panel is simple.  There are no unnecessary details.  In the middle of the cover, the brand name is printed horizontally.  At the top is the lens, and below it is the output speaker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 222 phone" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The button unit deserves special attention.  It has an almost square shape.  All buttons except the central one (joystick) are oval, the same size.  This gives a special style.  The numbers are large, clearly visible even to people with low vision.  Soft keys and call accept / reset buttons are located in pairs under each other.  How to set up quick access to applications in Nokia 222?  The instruction will give answers to these questions.  According to the information contained in it, for the soft keys and arrows of the joystick, individual settings are provided.  Each user can, depending on personal preferences, change the purpose of these buttons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the digital block, the owners have no comments on it.  Button layout isolated from each other.  Due to this, a clear relief appears, which allows you to clearly distinguish between the rows.  Therefore, the phone is suitable for those who are accustomed to dial, as they say, blindly. </p><h2>  Nokia 222: specifications, screen reviews </h2><p>  Looking at a mobile phone, you can not keep silent about the screen.  Its diagonal is only 2.4 ∫.  If you compare with smartphones, then this size will seem ridiculous.  But for a typical push-button telephone, these are perfectly acceptable characteristics.  Display type - LCD Transmissive, equipped with a TFT-matrix.  The resolution is small - 320 √ó 240 px.  The image is not very clear, as the number of pixels is only 167 ppi.  But users have no complaints about the transfer of colors, they are all displayed as realistic and saturated as possible.  Viewing angles are good.  In bright sun the screen fades a little, but the information remains readable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="software for nokia 222" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605150.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Many buyers are interested in what specifications the camera in Nokia 222 has?  Reviews presented on the network are not encouraging.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãonly 2 megapixels.  Currently, this resolution is quite small.  Using it is difficult to take a truly high-quality photo.  However, if you need to quickly capture a moment (in haste), then this will be quite enough.  Using the camera complicates the lack of a flash.  But to improve the quality, the developers used 2X digital zoom. </p><p>  The unit can also record videos.  The permissible maximum resolution is 320 √ó 240 px.  Shooting is carried out at a speed of 15 frames per second. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  What points should I look for when choosing a phone like the Nokia 222?  Specifications, reviews and, of course, battery life!  Previously, the devices of this brand wore the title of centenarians, and this was well deserved.  But can the new model boast high rates? </p><p>  The phone is equipped with a BL-5C lithium-ion battery.  Its capacity is 1100 mAh.  For a push-button device with a weak screen, this is quite enough.  This model can be actively used for 20 hours, and not only for making calls, but also for listening to music, watching videos, passing levels in your favorite game.  The manufacturer claims that in standby mode a simple model will work for about one month, and the one that provides support for two SIM cards - within 20 days. </p><p>  The owners claim that they have to charge the phone no more than once every three days.  According to these data, the device is a worthy follower of the legendary Nokia models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 222 instruction" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Applications </h2><p>  This model cannot be called a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, since it has advanced functionality.  The manufacturer used the Series 30+ platform, which is compatible with a large number of applications.  Programs for Nokia 222 can be downloaded and installed without problems.  They work well, without freezes.  The device has a built-in player for playing music tracks.  Its menu has an equalizer that allows you to save individual settings.  Also on the phone, the user will find a program for watching videos. </p><p>  The manufacturer provided for the ability to access the Internet by integrating the Opera Mini browser.  A number of popular applications are available for owners, such as social networks, weather and others. </p><p>  Gamers will be interested in what is offered in the standard "stuffing."  The manufacturer entered into an agreement according to which the user has the right to download games from the Gameloft service for one year.  The only limitation is that you can install only one game per month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 222 setup" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605159.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Even the simplest phone, which will be used only for calls, must have enough memory.  After all, every person will want to set some favorite music tracks in order to listen to them on the way to work.  The model with an index of 222 will surprise owners with the amount of memory.  Although only 16 MB built-in, the manufacturer has provided a slot for removable media.  The Nokia 222 memory card must be in micro-SD format.  The maximum allowable volume is up to 32 GB.  The user can fill the storage with music, games, photos, videos. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What negative aspects were noticed by the owners?  First of all, the imperfection of the operating system.  According to many, the updated version is significantly inferior to the previous one.  Also, some users noticed that the SIM card slot is standard, which is currently not very convenient.  Most devices have long switched to micro.  Comments were also on the resolution of the screen and camera.  According to modern requirements, they are very low.  However, the biggest inconvenience is the lack of a Wi-Fi module. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 222 memory card" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1605165.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  Now let's move on to the positives.  The first setup of Nokia 222 is pretty easy.  In order to set your favorite ringtone for an incoming call, just go to the phone book or use the corresponding sub-item ‚ÄúGalleries‚Äù.  The loud sound of the speaker is a significant advantage of the device.  Also, users focus on modern display technology, thanks to which even in bright sun the screen does not fade.  Practicality, build quality, long battery life, ease of use - all these criteria have become the hallmark of this model.  And of course, all buyers were mesmerized by the cost.  Currently, Nokia 222 is sold for approximately 3000-4000 rubles.  This is pretty good for an advanced feature phone. </p>
