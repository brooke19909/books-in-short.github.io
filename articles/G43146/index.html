    <h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  A new multi-storey project from the developer Gatchinsky KKZ CJSC - the Resnoy residential quarter - was erected along the southern border of Gatchina in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMaly Kolpanov.  This is the airdrome.  If we talk about the exact address of the location of the complex, then this is the Rechnoy microdistrict, houses from numbers 1 to 4. In addition to residential buildings, there is a kindergarten with 140 beds in the quarter.  His house number is 5. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Gatchina is located from the center of St. Petersburg at a distance of 42 kilometers.  To get to the "River Quarter" (Gatchina), you should leave the city for Pulkovo highway, passing into Kiev.  Then, having passed the city along Kievskaya, leave on Staraya Doroga Street, which passes into Central.  The quarter is located almost at the transport artery itself, which makes it very convenient to enter it.  Travel time to the nearest Zvezdnaya metro station in your own car will take no more than half an hour.  Such proximity to the metropolis makes the apartments in the residential complex ‚ÄúRiver Quarter‚Äù (Gatchina) very attractive.  In addition, there are many types of public transport, with which you can get to the place of work in St. Petersburg or Gatchina and vice versa.  These are fixed-route taxis, buses and commuter trains. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  The development consists of two buildings of residential buildings, one of which consists of 194 apartments, and the second of the 101st.  Residential buildings were erected using monolithic-brick technology, thanks to which the apartments will retain warmth and comfort in almost any weather conditions.  This comfort will also be facilitated by two-chamber double-glazed windows installed on all windows of the apartments of the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the River Quarter in Gatchina, the project provides for a variety of apartments in terms of layout and size: from one-room to three-room.  Their area is from 39 to 90 square meters.  Almost all apartments have loggias and balconies with cold glazing.  Security of residents is provided by intercoms with the ability to connect video equipment.  Comfort and warmth at any time of the year will be provided by our own boiler house. </p><h2>  The infrastructure of the complex is internal </h2><p>  The photos of the ‚ÄúRiver‚Äù quarter in Gatchina show that its internal infrastructure allows residents and their children to play on playgrounds and sports grounds, walk along the alleys and enjoy the fresh air.  On three sides, the quarter is surrounded by parks: Western, Prioratsky, Palace.  To the south of it is a fairly large lake Kolpan. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  All objects of the social infrastructure necessary for a comfortable life are located from the residential complex almost within walking distance.  In addition to its own kindergarten, in the district there are also kindergartens, general education schools in the amount of four.  There are also many shops, pharmacies, a clinic and a gym for residents. </p><h2>  Reviews about the residential complex </h2><p>  Reviews about the River Quarter in Gatchina are already available on the Internet in sufficient quantities.  Among them are both positive and negative.  Buyers express a positive opinion more often in connection with the fact that the houses of the first stage are built of brick.  This building material has excellent sound insulation and maintains a comfortable microclimate in apartments in the off-season.  Also, apartment buyers are pleased with their choice because of the relatively low prices for residential real estate offered by the developer.  Traditionally, the most expensive are studio apartments, where the price of one square meter reaches 66 thousand rubles.  The most inexpensive are three-room apartments.  Their price per square meter is 48 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Almost all residents living in the complex are satisfied with the place chosen by the developer for the construction of their project.  This area is a place with the most favorable environmental conditions.  Surrounded by parks and a lake, the quarter gives its residents the opportunity to enjoy the fresh air and feel all the charm of life outside the city, in nature. </p><p>  As for the negative reviews, most of them are connected with the remoteness of the complex from St. Petersburg (42 kilometers from the Ring Road).  Owners of their own vehicles are also not satisfied with the lack of underground parking and a very limited number of places for ground parking.  Not everyone liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developer to rent houses with apartments in which interior decoration was not carried out.  This could significantly save their money, which they were forced to spend on repair work. </p>

    <p>  Reviews about the second stage in the "River Quarter" in Gatchina are the same as about the complex as a whole.  Only more negativity is added due to the quality of building materials.  In the second stage, a frame system for building houses is used.  By its quality characteristics, it is significantly inferior to brick.  Otherwise, there are no global complaints.  All the negative impression is balanced by the favorable environmental situation in which the developer so successfully located his project. </p>
