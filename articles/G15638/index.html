Often, potential tourists ask on the forums the question: “Which building is better to choose in Pitsunda?”  Most of all travelers are interested in which of them has more recent repairs and updated plumbing.  To this, vacationers respond that the overhaul in Pitsunda was made in the Four Towers, in rooms of the 1st - 3rd categories and suites. </p><p>  Future guests are also interested in whether Wi-Fi “catches” all rooms.  To this, the guests of the defense industry say that the Internet is available in all rooms: kurort free (without password) and with a password provided for 10 days with a subsequent renewal. </p><p>  The most enthusiastic guests respond to the buildings "Pine Grove" and "Boxwood Grove."  Everything here - accommodation in rooms, service, food, helpfulness of the staff - is extremely popular with vacationers.  This option is surely recommended for accommodation to future guests of Pitsunda. </p><p>  Vacationers call the Lighthouse building in the Pitsunda defense and industrial complex the most remote.  From it to the checkpoint you need to walk about 20 minutes through the forest, along the promenade the road will take even more time.  Despite the fact that the trade in necessary goods in the resort, according to guests, is too poorly developed, this factor may become critical for some.  In the rooms of this building, according to the residents, it’s quite clean, the employees daily vacuum, take out garbage, clean the rooms, etc. The furniture in the rooms is creaky, old, but you can use it.  The elevator per week may not work here 4 times due to lack of electricity.  Hot water is supplied at 7:00 - 7:30, so those who leave for the beach early in the morning have to go unwashed.  Beach guests of the Mayak building are called unequipped, in addition, they report that opposite the boarding house there are dangerous funnels and undercurrents, and there is no rescue service here.  Therefore, not so long ago, a man, whom no one had warned of danger, drowned here by negligence. </p><h2>  Impressions of vacationers </h2><p>  When choosing a vacation spot, the reviewers advise future guests of the boarding house to decide what is more important for them.  Those who choose a vacation in Abkhazia are lucky: they will be among the fabulously beautiful nature, they will see the crystal clear, unusually warm sea.  Tourists ambiguously judge how indigenous people greet guests.  Many people call Aboriginal people unusually cordial and friendly, but some reviewers call them rude and rude. </p><p>  Holidays in Abkhazia in general are a sea of ​​impressions of a beautiful country, which, according to tourists, everyone should see at least once in a lifetime.  But there is a high probability that vacationers will have to face everyday difficulties, a lack of service and the entertainment industry.  So, many guests of the Pitsunda boarding house state with chagrin: they did not like much here.  In particular, they call bad, <span>tasteless food,</span> inattention of employees to guests, poor-quality service in rooms, in the dining room, noise in the territory of the defense industry, poor organization of staff work, etc. </p>
