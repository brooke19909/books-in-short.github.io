  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ski complex "Lata Track": reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ski resort is located in the western district of Moscow.  It is a short drive from the municipal area of ​​Krylatskoye.  The complex operates year-round.  It is designed for both winter and summer holidays.  Lata Track has slopes for downhill skiing and snowboarding.  For children, riding on inflatable "cheesecakes" is provided. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.75046" data-lng="37.427458" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/5/2/3/2523.png"></div><p>  With the onset of spring, an equipped cycle path begins to work.  Its length is almost fourteen kilometers.  It was built in 1980 and was intended for participants in the Olympic Games.  Today, the Lata Track bike track is used to host championships and championships of the highest level.  There are football, basketball and volleyball courts.  There are tennis courts.  Athletics competitions are held. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><div class="photo" data-original="strana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort" class="if uuid-2415951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415951.jpg"></div><p>  The ski resort covers an area that once belonged to a small village.  Household waste and garbage left after digging the foundation pit of the metro station were brought into it.  The holding of the Olympic Games in Moscow dramatically changed life in the area.  The metropolitan leadership created a zone with modern buildings and developed infrastructure on the site of the former landfill.  Along with the Lata Track bike path, a <span>rowing canal</span> was equipped <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction of residential areas began two years later, the closing field of the Olympics.  In 1991, this district received the status of a municipal district.  Currently, Krylatskoye is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly and prosperous parts of Moscow.  The ski resort is located on a hilly area.  Its area is almost 4 km². </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The nearest metro stations are Molodezhnaya and Krylatskoye.  They are within reach.  Around the Lata Track complex, protected forests grow.  The air here is clean and clear.  Within walking distance from the main entrance of the ski resort are concentrated public transport stops.  Buses and fixed-route taxis that go to the capital and settlements of the <span>Moscow Region</span> run past them <span>.</span>  For those arriving by car, there is ample parking.  Places on it are free. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vostnod.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex scheme" class="if uuid-2415950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415950.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the snowy slopes and tubing slides, the Lata Track complex also has a concert venue, a summer cinema and a street stage.  In the summer, they cater for corporate events and meetings, celebrations and wedding ceremonies.  Numerous cafes offer a tasty and inexpensive meal.  There are rental points for ski and sports equipment.  The complex serves as a base for youth schools. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Lata Track (Moscow) runs an educational institution for children and adolescents with disabilities.  Its name is “Snowball”.  Every winter, a skiing school opens its doors.  It has its own slope and lifts, the use of which is included in the cost of training with an instructor. </p><h2>  Routes </h2><p>  There are four main slopes at the disposal of visitors to the base: </p><ul><li>  "Main". </li><li>  "Training". </li><li>  "Sports". </li><li>  "Wide". </li></ul><p>  A cross-country ski area is available.  The length of the “Main” is 350 meters, the “Training” - 250 m. The length of the “Sports” - 300 m, “Wide” - 300 m. </p><h2>  Summer in Krylatskoye </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hipdir.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer in Krylatskoye" class="if uuid-2415954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415954.jpg"></div><p>  In March, volleyball and tennis courts begin to operate.  Employees of the ski complex "Lata Track" clear the snow track and ice the bike path.  A mountain bike track opens. </p><h2>  Plans </h2><p>  In the coming years, the base management is going to make a partial update of the installed equipment and sports equipment.  An overpass will appear in the area designated for skiing.  Its task is to increase the elevation.  Football fields and pools will start working.  A sandy beach will appear.  Stands for spectators will be built along the bike path.  All planned innovations should raise the Lata Track sports complex to a qualitatively different level. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ski2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski base" class="if uuid-2415953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415953.jpg"></div><p>  Opinions about the rest in Krylatskoye diverged.  One likes absolutely everything.  Others believe that the base has long been outdated and needs to be overhauled.  In the midst of winter holidays and holidays on the slopes is always noisy and crowded.  Affects the proximity to the center of Moscow.  The slopes offer a picturesque view of the surrounding forest.  According to the parents, the children enjoy skiing with great pleasure, and then transfer to the inflatable "cheesecakes". </p><h2>  Optimal choice </h2><p>  Residents of the capital believe that in Krylatskoye there are the most convenient slopes for beginners.  They are well snowed and free of ice.  The order is provided by qualified personnel.  Instructors are always ready to help.  A medical team is on duty.  The tubing track gives a lot of positive emotions.  She's cool, but safe.  An exception is days of heavy snowfall.  At this time, inflatable "cheesecakes" glide poorly on the surface of the hill, sticking to the slope. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="winter.spusk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Track Lighting" class="if uuid-2415959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415959.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced skiers are advised to come to Krylatskoye on weekdays.  Judging by the reviews, there are too many people at Lata Track this weekend.  But this is not a reason to leave the proven track for tubing and ride on the "wild" slopes.  A large number of vacationers are injured on them annually. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  Some did not like the hills in Krylatskoye.  They argue that the routes are poorly snowed, covered with ice crust, which spoils the surface of skis and snowboards.  At the same time, the cost is quite high.  One lift costs about 90 rubles.  It happens that "cheesecakes" glide poorly on a hill.  It is almost impossible to get to the end of the descent.  People ahead of time return the tubing, while paying 600 rubles for skiing.  They say that before the tracks were in better condition, and riding on them brought pleasure.  And the prices were two times lower. </p><h2>  Back to USSR </h2><p>  Complain about the service at the local diner, "Full Fox."  Waiters and cashiers are rude.  The service is slow and slow.  Making tea and snacks takes more than 40 minutes.  In a cafe obscene language sounds.  At the same time there are children. </p><h2>  Legacy of the olympic games </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forum.velomania.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bike Lane" class="if uuid-2415952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45514/2415952.jpg"></div><p>  As for the bike path, it is called life-threatening.  Along it there are no information plates and signs.  Cyclists ride at tremendous speed.  There are no pedestrian walkways for walks.  Asphalt pavement is of very poor quality.  Pits, cracks and potholes are everywhere on it. </p><h2>  Remarks </h2><p>  A lot of complaints about the lifts that have remained in the Lata Track complex since Soviet times.  Children constantly fall from the anchor.  It's all about a too small landing platform.  Not everyone has time to get down.  To get a ski pass, you need to go a long way.  The ticket office is a ten minute ski ride from the car park.  Subscriptions are written out very slowly.  Waiting for their turn of three people can drag on for fifteen minutes. </p>
