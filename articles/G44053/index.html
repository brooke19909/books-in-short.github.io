  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hurghada Hotels Reviews Speak For Yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Stunning coral reefs and turquoise waters, ideal for windsurfing, have made Hurghada a famous resort town.  This city is within easy reach of the fabulous islands and the Eastern Arabian Desert, and currently stretches 25 km along the Red Sea.  Hurghada can rightly be called one of the best places for diving in the world.  The resort described by us has become relatively recent, earlier in its place there was an ordinary fishing village.  If you compare Hurghada with Sharm, then there are a lot of sandy beaches, but much less coral reefs. </p><p>  The main part of Hurghada hotels is located directly on the coast and has its own beaches with sun loungers and <span>parasols.</span>  Although, there are also public beaches with a paid entrance.  When choosing hotels in Hurghada, reviews should be studied with particular care. </p><p>  As we noted above, all the beaches in Hurghada are sandy, but already right next to the coast you can find a magnificent beauty <span>coral reef.</span>  In the city we are describing, there are a couple of hotels where coral reefs begin already right on the shore.  It is insanely beautiful, although it causes some difficulties associated with entering the sea. </p><p>  If you look at the reviews of visitors about Hurghada hotels, you will understand that it is best to select the Hurghada resorts in which European staff works.  This is due to the fact that local residents are a bit intrusive, and sometimes even uncivil. </p><p>  It should be noted that Hurghada in terms of the number of hotels per capita ranks first in the world.  And this is not surprising, since here on the coast there are more than 200 hotels of different chains (Marriott, Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, Sofitel, etc.).  Despite all of the above, Hurghada continues to rebuild to this day.  New complexes for vacationers are constantly appearing here, there are a lot of hotels designed for families.  Most of the hotels in Hurghada leave positive reviews.  This is due to the fact that basically maintenance personnel have in their vocabulary the necessary number of words, so that vacationers can easily understand and fulfill all their requirements.  Most Russian tourists say they feel at home here.  Rereading reviews of <span>hotels in Egypt, Hurghada</span> will seem like a paradise.  <span>Dining at the hotel is</span> organized according to the <span>buffet.</span>  The range of dishes offered is quite wide and is able to satisfy the tastes of even the most demanding gourmets.  In restaurants you will find many dishes of fish and vegetables.  Pleased and the proposed variety of fruits.  Most tourists travel to Egypt on an all-inclusive basis.  Therefore, breakfast, lunch and dinner are usually included in the price.  And you can have a meal here at any time and in any restaurant on the hotel‚Äôs territory, which are often located right on the beach.  If you look at reviews about Hurghada hotels, you will understand that the food here is organized at a European level. </p><p>  Due to certain climatic conditions, you can relax in Hurghada all year round.  Even in winter, in the month of February, the water temperature here is as much as 22 degrees, and the air warms up to 25 degrees.  It should be noted that due to the fact that Egypt has a rather dry climate, the high temperature is much easier to tolerate here than in the Black Sea resorts.  And the presence of a constant sea breeze makes relaxing on the beach, even on hot days, quite comfortable. It should be noted that the beaches of Hurghada are very suitable for families with children.  They are gentle enough and the sand on them is fine and clean. </p><p>  Hurghada is a tourist city located on the shores of the Red Sea.  This is a very beautiful place with numerous beaches located on the background of desert mountains.  Hurghada is a unique place for <span>scuba diving</span> and surfers. </p>
