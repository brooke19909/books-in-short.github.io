This aspect is one of the main qualities of the city of Quito, which attracts tourists from all over the globe.  Also, this settlement is considered one of the "highest" in the world - the city is located at an altitude of 2850 meters above sea level, on the mountain volcanic slope of Pichincha.  Despite the fact that the city does not have access to the oceanic bay, the wide and full-flowing river Guaylyambamba flows on its territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of ecuador" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main attractions of Ecuador are concentrated in Quito.  In the capital there are many churches and monasteries that belong to different eras.  But all of them are centers of a single religion - Catholicism.  Churches are located in the southern part of the city, and in order to completely bypass all the <span>architectural monuments of</span> the area, it will take far more than one day. </p><p>  The main here is the temple of San Francisco, which was founded in the colonial period.  Along with it, the temples of La Campagna, San Agustin, Santo Domingo and others appeared in Quito.  An abundance of stucco molding and wall painting can be considered a distinctive feature of all the sights of the capital - a similar artistic element is present in every church and cultural institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecuador Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16255.jpg" width="600"></div>

And before the capital of Ecuador was officially certified in the country's constitution, Quito was ruled by Peru.  In connection with such changes, local residents tried in every possible way to protect their hometown.  As a sign of this, a monument was erected in the form of a gigantic diva, which spread its wings over the city, protecting it from mythical dangers.  Today, this sculptural masterpiece is located on the main observation deck of the city - El Panecillo. </p><p>  The capital of Ecuador boasts a variety and a large number of restaurants that offer their visitors a variety of cuisines.  Among those there are institutions with Greek cuisine (Mosaic restaurant), as well as Italian, American and Brazilian.  The most popular fast food chain in Quito is El Espa√±ol.  But every tourist who comes to Ecuador should definitely try the local cuisine, which is offered in its full colors in an institution called Hornado. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Quito Ecuador" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/16256.jpg" width="500"></div>
