Now we proceed to the classification of <span>the observation method.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Surveillance Included: Open and Hidden</strong> </p><ul><li>  Open observation is characterized by the fact that a researcher, falling into a group of people whose behavior interests him, does not hide the purpose of his presence.  So, the psychologist, being among the children, offers them to play the game, while being the leader.  During the process, he observes the participants and draws conclusions.  Or, for example, a journalist, being in a crowd of protesters, will not hide the fact that he needs to make a report, however, he will also take part in the event. </li><li>  Covert observation is most often used in the study of a conflict situation, where the researcher plays one of the roles: it can be a provocateur that excites feelings and causes emotions in people for their bright manifestation, or a peacemaker whose goal is to smooth out sharp corners and encourage people to reconcile. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Surveillance Included: Direct and Indirect</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This method of obtaining information can be direct if the researcher contacts the participants in the event.  Indirect observation suggests that a psychologist, journalist, or sociologist explores the phenomenon using other social facts.  The latter <span>type of observation</span> contradicts that included only if the researcher uses a remote method of obtaining information that does not imply contact with participants.  If communication is established, then observation can be indirect. </p><p>  <strong>Surveillance Included: Standardized and Unstructured</strong> </p><ul><li>  The presence of a research plan or its absence determines the type of observation.  So, if a psychologist or journalist noted for themselves a plan of action, then observation is considered standardized. </li><li>  Spontaneous observation, which does not have a strict implementation plan, is unstructured. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Surveillance Included: Systematic and Unsystematic</strong> </p><ul><li>  Systematic is carried out with some periodicity.  Usually it is used during large studies that need time-tested information: for example, determining the impact of a new technique on personality development.  Especially often, systematic observation is used by psychologists in working with children, where they note how much the child has changed, what are the trends in his development. </li><li>  Non-systematic observation implies that the researcher conducts it only once. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Included observation method: laboratory and field</strong> </p><ul><li>  Laboratory observation is the collection of information in specific conditions, prepared artificially before the start of the study.  In this case, the psychologist creates a special atmosphere, prepares materials that the group will work with, and the journalist invites participants to the studio in a laboratory form and (for example) conducts an interview. </li><li>  In the field form, the study is conducted in vivo, which were formed by objective circumstances. </li></ul>
