In simple words, thanks to this type of insurance, the culprit of an accident will not pay for car repairs and treatment of people injured in an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coverhound.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to do" class="if uuid-2960402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960402.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the question of where to make OSAGO is almost a leader.  This happens because all motorists want reliability from their insurers, transparency of their conditions and simplicity in the process of processing all documents. </p><h2>  Overview of Insurance Companies </h2><p>  So, let's figure out where to do CTP. </p><p>  Let's start by reviewing the main insurance companies that currently offer the most comfortable conditions for their clients. </p><p>  In order to stay at the best company, you can perform a calculation for all insurance institutions through an online calculator or read reviews on where it is profitable to make OSAGO for a car.  However, one must know that for one client specific conditions will be good, but for another they may not be suitable at all.  Different votes should not be trusted, because the ratings are often wound up in them.  According to the statistics of reliability ratings, it is worth giving the following list of the most reliable insurers to date in descending order: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  In the first place is AlfaStrakhovanie (Moscow, Tsvetnoy bul., D. 32, p. 1. ICD Bank sales office). </li><li>  Next are ROSNO, VTB Insurance (Moscow, Chistoprudny Boulevard, d. 8, p. 1) and VSK. </li><li>  In third place is ZHASO with Ingosstrakh (21 Klimashkina St., Moscow) and Capital. </li><li>  MAKS occupies the fourth position along with Renaissance Insurance (M. Paveletskaya, Derbenevskaya nab., 7 p. 22 (4th floor) and RESO - Garantia. </li><li>  The popular organization Rosgosstrakh together with SOGAZ shares the fifth position. </li><li>  Further, in descending order, the remaining lines are occupied by ‚ÄúConsent‚Äù (42 Gilyarovskogo St.), ‚ÄúENERGOGARANT‚Äù and ‚ÄúTransneft‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  The article presents not all addresses of companies where it is beneficial to make OSAGO, but only the most famous. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditsesame.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rsa osago" class="if uuid-2960408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960408.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that all these listed companies are today the most reliable insurers, however, it is still up to the client to decide which organization to choose for these purposes. </p><h2>  Where is it cheaper to do CTP? </h2><p>  So, with the rating, everything is clear, but you still need to know how best to get a cheap insurance policy for your car.  Currently, the main tool is the Internet, thanks to which you can find out any information of interest.  In order to determine the design, you first need to find out from your friends where to do CTP, and how much they like this or that organization.  Further, having highlighted several institutions, it is worthwhile to find reviews about them and read all the information that concerns them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Perhaps the comments may not be very good to meet, as a result of which they will cause doubts among customers.  Then you should call the hotline or directly to the office of your region and ask all the relevant questions.  In addition, forums can come to the rescue, where you should ask about the quality of activity of this or that insurer.  For example, based on the statements that people leave in their reviews, it is reported that AlfaStrakhovanie and VTB Insurance offer the most favorable conditions this year. </p><p>  It is important to note that some companies illegally change their rules.  For example, they can insure only powerful and new cars.  Too cheap an insurance company for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance should arouse suspicion in the client, because most likely, the person will either be sold an additional service, or the forms will be lost and they will be sold as real copies. </p><h2>  The process and conditions for obtaining insurance in 2018 </h2><p>  The basic order in the process of applying for a policy consists of several points.  If you stick to them, then you can save a lot on the policy.  Initially, a person should decide where to make OSAGO insurance.  Then all the documents are collected in one folder, you can go to the office for delivery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online calculator" class="if uuid-2962389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2962389.jpg"></div><p>  As part of the CTP, you need to know that insurers are also interested in selling additional services to customers.  Therefore, it is always necessary to carefully check what is given for signature.  After carrying out all the above manipulations on the hands of the car owner should have the following papers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Personal documents. </li><li>  The presence of the original policy, on which the customer and insurer are signed, along with the seal of the insurance company and a special state sign, of the established form. </li><li>  An attachment of a set of OSAGO rules that you must read. </li><li>  Two copies for the possibility of notification of an accident.  In the event that there are not enough of them for the insurance period, you can contact the company where the CTP was issued and ask for more. </li><li>  The presence of a memo. </li><li>  Receipt of a receipt of payment, which is issued to the insurer. </li></ul><p>  Now let's talk about the electronic policy. </p><h2>  Electronic policy </h2><p>  Many people wonder where it is better to make an electronic insurance policy. </p><p>  According to article 15 of Federal Law No. 40, an insurance policy can be purchased online.  Such an electronic policy is endowed with the same rights as the standard one, and does not differ in cost. </p><p>  Here is a list of companies selling OSAGO via the Internet: this is Ingosstrakh along with Rosgosstrakh, Alfa Insurance, GAIDE insurance company, Moskovia, URALSIB Insurance, Tinkoff Insurance, VSK and etc.  Thus, you can always purchase an electronic policy on the official website of one of these institutions.  Let‚Äôs figure out where to do OSAGO on a motorcycle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.honestjohn.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where it is cheaper to make a cTP" class="if uuid-2960403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960403.jpg"></div><h2>  Does a motorcycle need insurance? </h2><p>  According to domestic law, insurance is subject to absolutely any type of transport that is capable of moving at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour or more.  The law also applies to ATVs and mopeds.  Motorcycle insurance is a must.  It is worth remembering that the absence of a motor third party liability insurance policy will cost eight hundred rubles.  And leaving the road without insurance threatens a fine of five hundred rubles.  Registration of this policy is necessary for motorcycle drivers in order to be able to protect their motor civil liability. </p><p>  In other words, reimbursement based on insurance is only possible in cases where the motorcycle driver acts as a provocateur of the accident.  Against this background, payments are not made to restore the bike itself, but directly to cover damage to the injured party.  Given the fact that motorcycles are considered the most dangerous participants in the movement of all road vehicles, the acquisition of OSAGO allows drivers to protect themselves from additional financial risks in the event of an accident.  Motorcycle owners may insure liability against the following risks: </p><ul><li>  From damage resulting from an accident. </li><li>  Against theft and theft. </li><li>  As an opportunity for insurance against natural disasters. </li><li>  From accidents. </li><li>  Protection against unlawful actions of third parties. </li></ul><p>  You can do this at any <span>insurance company</span> that deals with CTP. </p><h2>  Members of the RSA, which carry out the registration of OSAGO </h2><p>  Here is the list <span>of PCA members</span> for OSAGO: </p><ul><li>  The company "Absolute Insurance". </li><li>  "Renaissance Insurance." </li><li>  Institution "Alfa Insurance". </li><li>  "GUTA-Insurance" is also a member of the RSA for CTP. </li><li>  Borovitsk Insurance Company </li><li>  Group "VSK". </li><li>  The company "Ugoria". </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.autoguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to make a car osago" class="if uuid-2960407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960407.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I calculate the cost of an insurance policy for a car online? </h2><p>  To calculate the cost of this document online, you just need to follow a few simple steps: </p><ul><li>  Choose a make of car. </li><li>  Next, you must specify the model of transport for which a person wants to take out insurance. </li><li>  It is reported, inter alia, the year of manufacture of the vehicle. </li><li>  Indicate the beginning of the CTP insurance period. </li><li>  They enter technical data along with information about the drivers admitted to the management and the owner of the car, including. </li><li>  Confirm consent to the processing of personal data. </li><li>  Press the button for calculating the insurance service. </li></ul><h2>  What else should you know about CTP insurance? </h2><p>  Before buying a policy, a person should be aware that not only the official institutions of insurance companies are engaged in the sale of such policies, but also brokers with fraudsters.  The last two have positive and negative sides.  Brokers give the client the opportunity to choose which company the person wants to purchase the policy from, but in this situation, they act as intermediaries, which means that a person will have to give a little more of their money to purchase insurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aarp.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is it better to make an electronic insurance policy" class="if uuid-2960405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960405.jpg"></div><p>  It is definitely difficult to answer the question of where it will be cheaper to purchase OSAGO insurance for your car with round-the-clock delivery, since there are a lot of similar companies and they replace each other daily, letting new companies in their place.  In any case, it will cost the client more than the usual purchase of car insurance in a standard organization. </p><h2>  Fraud </h2><p>  Now for the scammers.  Among the so-called brokers, they are also found, which means that you can get caught without much difficulty.  They are invited customers to buy insurance with a ready-made seal, at retail or in bulk.  And everything would be fine, but such forms may turn out to be false, although they can be true, however, the information after the conclusion of the agreement will not go to a single PCA database, and it follows that in case of an accident, no payments will be made to the person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edelmanfinancial.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to do osago addresses" class="if uuid-2960406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960406.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, it is necessary to say that before headlong turning to the first company that comes across for CTP, you need to read the relevant information, analyze everything and draw the right conclusions.  Car owners can also buy an electronic policy, which will certainly help to save a lot more time and money, however, this should be done exclusively within the personal account on the official website of the insurer company. </p><p>  We examined options where to do OSAGO. </p>
