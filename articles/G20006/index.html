They choose this country because of the relatively low cost of trips, rich culture and good, truly European service.  However, living in five-star complexes is very expensive, so many tourists prefer to stay in budget hotels.  For example, in La Pineda, the Golden Donaire Beach 3 * hotel is popular.  It is about this inexpensive option for accommodation that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Holidays in La Pineda </h2><p>  This small coastal resort is located in Catalonia and is famous for its clean air, sandy beaches that are not crowded with numerous tourists, as well as excellent conditions for families with small children.  It got its name from the Spanish name for the Mediterranean pine - there are a lot of such trees here, which makes the local air truly healing.  La Pineda is a relatively young resort that has just begun to gain popularity.  Its promenade is considered the longest in Catalonia. </p><p>  The sea here has a very flat, gentle entrance, which makes this place ideal for swimming with young children.  The beaches in La Pineda, as a rule, are sandy, only occasionally they are interrupted by pebble sections of the coast.  The infrastructure at the resort is also designed for family vacations - everywhere you can find open shallow pools and children's clubs, and restaurants and cafes provide a special menu for kids.  In addition, La Pineda in Spain is traditionally considered the ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù city, because our compatriots most often choose it for their holidays on the coast of Catalonia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location Features </h2><p>  Golden Donaire Beach Hotel (Spain) is built right on the seashore, so tourists do not have to spend a lot of time walking to the beach and back.  You can reach it in just 2-3 minutes.  In addition, the complex is located just 300 meters from the main promenade of the resort, so in the evenings guests love to stroll along the promenade, visit the cafes, restaurants and taverns opened there.  A bus stop is located next to the hotel.  At the same time, tourists can choose a route that allows them to get to the major cities of Catalonia, for example, Tarragona or Barcelona.  The nearest supermarket is just 100 meters away.  Tourists with children are also advised to visit the local water park - the distance to it is approximately 500 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastline and pool" class="if uuid-2344034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2344034.jpg"></div><p>  But the airport from here is at a decent distance.  The nearest of them is in Reus.  The distance to it is only 15 km, but aircraft from Russia rarely land there.  Typically, tourists choose to arrive at an airport near Barcelona.  Flights go there much more often, and the cost of the ticket is ultimately much cheaper.  That's just the airport is almost 110 km from La Pineda, so tourists will have to spend a lot of time on the road.  But most of the amenities can be reduced to zero if you book a transfer to the hotel in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  General hotel information and check-in rules </h2><p>  Complex Golden Donaire Beach (Spain) was built in 1969, but do not worry about the state of its number of rooms.

The Golden Donaire Beach complex, in their opinion, has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  very friendly and friendly staff who always try to quickly solve the problems; </li><li>  the choice of dishes in the restaurant is not very large, but all the food is very tasty and beautifully decorated; </li><li>  great children's animation, which kids really like, so they themselves ask for a mini-club; </li><li>  excellent location - the hotel is located directly on the beach; </li><li>  Despite its small area, the rooms have enough space, and they are also regularly cleaned well. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="szallas.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In-room bathroom" class="if uuid-2344052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2344052.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Golden Donaire Beach complex reviews are different.  There are negative ones among them.  And although many tourists appreciated the level of service at the hotel, they could not help but notice the following serious shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  sometimes in a restaurant they can spread food on dirty plates; </li><li>  There is a highway next to the hotel, therefore it is impossible to sleep at night with an open window - the noise of passing buses interferes; </li><li>  not all rooms have fresh repairs; </li><li>  the air conditioner does not work well, and sometimes it also makes a lot of noise; </li><li>  next to the pool in the evenings it was very noisy, which prevented tourists whose windows overlooked the hotel courtyard. </li></ul><h2>  So is it worth choosing this hotel for your vacation? </h2><p>  Of course, Golden Donaire Beach Hotel is not suitable for those travelers who are looking for a chic place to stay.  However, for tourists with low requirements, it is quite possible to recommend it.  It is worth noting that the complex is focused on couples with children, the elderly and youth companies who prefer to relax without noisy parties.  For these categories of tourists there is everything that they may need. </p>
