    <h2>  Security </h2><p>  In order for the repair of Hansa washing machines not to be delayed for a long time and not require a lot of money, the manufacturer decided to provide for trivial breakdowns and establish safety measures.  For example, there is protection against leaks of various kinds and from accidental reprogramming during operation of the machine.  Especially the latter function helps young mothers, whose children love to click on interesting buttons on unfamiliar subjects.  There are systems that regulate the amount of foam and determine the balance of linen.  Thanks to the first function, the rinsing of the powder is good.  If there is too much foam, the washing machine itself will add the right amount of water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine hansa whs 1241" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1303549.jpg" width="600"></div>
