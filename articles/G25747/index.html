As the heroes of past centuries, and today.  <span>Memorials, monuments,</span> cemeteries and necropolises - this is an incomplete list of objects that perpetuated the courage, courage and bravery of Russians and soldiers of other states, standing on the side of the Good. </p><h2>  Afghan war </h2><p>  This is the last armed conflict in the history of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which began in 1979 and ended ten years later.  The prerequisites at first were the revolution in Afghanistan, as a result of which the Democratic Party came to power, and then the Civil War, the Islamists and riots in the ranks of the Republican army, as well as interference in the affairs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on the US side opposite the government. </p><p>  Some time later, after persistent requests from the government of the new republic, the Soviet Union decided to come out in hostilities in support of the Afghan people.  There is still no debate among historians about how justified and truly necessary such a decision was.  During the war in Afghanistan, a large number of Russian soldiers died. </p><h2>  Internationalists Park in St. Petersburg: the history of creation </h2><p>  In honor of the warriors of different nations who fought in support of the Afghan people, the Internationalist Park was laid in St. Petersburg.  The time of its creation dates back not to the era of the Soviet state, but to the period of the formation of the Russian - 1998. </p><p>  First, a memorial complex to the Afghan soldiers was erected on the historical territory of the former Romanovo village, then a church. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Nearby, on a hill, a little later, another monument was erected - to soldiers of special forces who gave their lives in the service of the Fatherland.  The first monument to the commandos in the city.  It is a group of fighters moving along a plane tilted at an angle and resting on a support cross.  Among the commandos there are sailors and foot soldiers.  One of the soldiers carries a rescued child in his arms.  The rest cover it with fire from a machine gun and pistols.  The plane is made in the form of a fragment of a crumpled body armor with a target deposited on it for the sight of snipers. </p><p>  The authors of the monument are V. Bukhayev, A. Ivanov, M. Tskhadadze. </p><h2>  Memorial to the heroes of the Afghan war </h2><p>  The main monument of the Internationalists' Park in the Frunze district was the monument to the Afghan soldiers from pink granite, on which the names of all those who died in the fighting in Afghanistan were carved.  This is not just a monument, but a whole <span>memorial complex, the</span> basis of which became the more than two-meter figure of the Grieving Mother. </p>

    <h2>  St. George's Church </h2><p>  Nearby was built the church of St. George the Victorious - the patron saint of the Russian army.  This is a two-story church with a tented roof over the central volume and three onion domes.  One of the domes is crowned by a tent, while the other two focus on the belfry and the eastern semicircular apse.  These heads are located on the light towers-lanterns.  The temple is built of red brick, but recently its walls are bleached with lime.  The side portals with triangular pediments have an arched semicircular design.  Of the decor, only tiers of kokoshniks decorating the base of the tent roof can be noted.  They resemble lace.  The whole appearance of the temple echoes the stylistics of ancient Russian temple architecture of the 15th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="internationalist park saint petersburg" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54338/1986568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The church regularly hosts the Nativity of Christ Church in the basement and Sunday school in one of the later buildings.  There are buildings and household purposes.  The church occupies an important place among the Orthodox churches of the St. Petersburg diocese - it stores a particle of the relics of St.  George, donated by the abbess of the Gornensky monastery. </p><h2>  The place of the park in the life of citizens </h2><p>  The Volkovka River previously flowed through the park.  After breaking down the park zones, the river was filled up, only a pond was left in the center of the complex - a favorite vacation spot for merchants.  According to the citizens, the park attracts with its cozy layout and views, but it is located far from the metro - at the corner of Bucharest Street and Slavy Avenue.  But soon the situation should change - a new metro station will appear near the park - ‚ÄúProspekt Glory‚Äù. </p><p>  In the park you can see an audience of different ages - pensioners sitting on benches along the straight paths, mothers with strollers walking along the alleys, schoolchildren walking and playing sports.  On weekends, municipal authorities often hold <span>events</span> for city dwellers in the <span>St. Petersburg</span> Internationalist Park.  Then on the sites there are stalls and scaffolds.  Recently, a holiday has become popular when sky lanterns are launched.  There is also an open amphitheater. </p><p>  The park is open to guests and residents of the city at any time of the day and at any season. </p>
