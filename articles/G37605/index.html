Crafts from vegetables and fruits in kindergarten</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If the teacher asked to bring children's <span>crafts from vegetables and fruits</span> to the kindergarten, you can quickly make them at home from the available material.  It is easy to turn an apple into a funny figure, a carrot into a caterpillar, and sweet pepper into a pirate.  You can make a whole composition of physalis and bring this original creation to kindergarten. </p><h2>  Autumn crafts </h2><p>  Children's (from vegetables) creations are sometimes asked by educators to bring at the end of summer.  By this time, a new crop is ripening, and many ideas appear that can inspire the guys.  Arriving from the cottage, parents and children can bring eggplants grown personally.  You can buy them in the store.  This is a great material for creativity.  You will learn how to make a penguin right now. </p><p>  To make it stable, cut off the evenly rounded end of the eggplant.  Place the fruit on its flat surface with the green cap up.  Now he will turn into the face of a charming penguin.  If a tail remains in this place, do not cut it, because it looks so much like the nose of a polar bird.  Eyes can be made from beads.  Cut the dark skin in front of the figure so that the white belly of the penguin becomes visible. </p><p>  To make small wings of a polar bird, cut the skin from both sides from below and from the sides, slightly lift it up. </p><p>  From vegetables, you can even make ice cream (very similar to real).  Place the carrots in a clear glass with the sharp end down.  Attach the cauliflower inflorescence to the dull side of the carrot in the form of a scoop of ice cream. </p><h2>  Apple Craft Ideas </h2>

    <p>  If you can bring children's crafts from vegetables and fruits to the garden on a plate, help the baby turn several carrots into cancer.  Put the largest in the center of the dish, not cut it in the middle to the end, so that its abdomen is indicated.  Turn small root vegetables into claws, make a mustache from dill trunks.  Press 2 peas of dry black pepper into the place where the eyes should be.  Cut the tail of an arthropod from three rectangular slices of carrots.  That's how you can arrange children's crafts from vegetables.  Kindergarten will turn into an exhibition when the pupils will bring creations of their imagination and hands. </p><h2>  Pear dog </h2><p>  For the next job you will need 2 pears.  One fruit will be slightly smaller than the second.  Prepare other vegetables: asparagus, zucchini or bell peppers.  To make the dog stable, cut its paws out of solid natural material - pumpkin or zucchini.  Place the big pear with the tail up, attach the paws from below.  Make the upper ones from the incised skin of the fetus. </p>

    <p>  Put the small pear on the big one horizontally, prick it on the tail and additionally fix it with three toothpicks.  To make the whites of the animal‚Äôs eyes, cut off the pieces of the skin of the fetus from the place where they will be.  In the middle of the pupils, press 2 peppercorns, you can use buckwheat for the eyes and tip of the nose. </p><p>  From the pepper or corrugated zucchini, cut off the crown, remove the pulp.  Make a cutout in the middle of this hat, insert the flat end of the asparagus into it, and attach the panicle to the body, next to the dog‚Äôs front paw, with a toothpick.  It remains to draw a mouth with a knife, and the smiling animal is ready. </p><h2>  Edible figurines </h2><p>  If you want to beautifully arrange a table for dinner with simple products with your son or daughter, you can even do this from potatoes.

    <p>  Remove part of the skin from the top so that the light face of the animal appears.  With a fork, fluff the pulp a little, put two peas in there, they will become the eyes of the mouse.  Cut 2 circles from raw or boiled carrots, stick them on the top of the head - these are the ears, and turn a rectangular block into a nose.  Take three thin pasta, pierce them under the nose.  These are the funny tendrils of a mouse.  Only they and the peel are not edible, everything else is suitable for food.  Such characters will diversify the table and cheer the household. </p><h2>  Children's crafts on the theme "Vegetables" </h2><p>  It is interesting to turn some vegetables into others.  Disguise the physalis as cabbage and pumpkin, making a beautiful panel.  The basis for it can serve as a plain decorative pillow.  If you don‚Äôt have one, it can be easily sewn from brown velvet, layered with foam rubber or stuffed with synthetic winterizer. </p>

    <p>  In the fall, the physalis ripens into orange lanterns.  Pick three fruits in advance while they are still green.  For creativity you will need the same amount of orange.  From the green paper, cut the border that will be the outer leaves for the cabbage.  Put the unripe physalis inside, glue the blank on the pillow.  Place two more heads of cabbage in the same way.  Orange physalis will become a pumpkin, cut out leaves from green paper or fabric, glue them and small pumpkins to the base.  You can decorate the edges of the pillow with a cloth of other colors, making an applique on the theme of vegetables. </p><p>  There are many ideas for such crafts.  So, you can turn a banana into a dog, a daikon or a carrot into a rat, and a fresh cucumber into a crocodile.  The main thing is to learn to notice the features of natural material so that it arouses imagination and helps to develop the creative abilities of children. </p>
