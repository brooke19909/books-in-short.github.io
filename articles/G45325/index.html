  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the road Samara - Syzran by car and other transport</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The third largest and economic city of the Samara region - Syzran is located on a hill on the right bank of the Volga.  It was founded at the end of the XVII century by decree of Peter the Great, as a fortress to strengthen the eastern borders of the Russian Empire.  Today it is a petroleum refining center and a major transportation hub.  It has a well-developed infrastructure connecting it with the regional center and a number of other cities.  This article focuses on the Samara-Syzran road. </p><h2>  By car </h2><p>  With the regional center, the city is connected by a high-quality Moscow highway, exit on the M-5.  Distance Samara - Syzran by car will be 170 km.  It is not far, although in Central Russia many regional centers are located at about the same distance from Moscow.  Only 14 liters of gasoline, a little over 2 hours, and you are in the neighboring city.  The route passes near several large settlements - Volzhsky, Kurumoch, Zhigulevsky, the center of the Russian automotive industry of Togliatti.  The road goes around the famous reserve (Samara Luka).  From the junction M-5 leaves in Syzran.  You can reach the Oktyabrsk before reaching and enter the city from the other side.  The length of the route does not increase. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  Without a great desire to drive yourself, you can go by public transport.  From the Central Bus Station of the regional center, six cars leave daily on two routes passing through Syzran.  One comfortable intercity bus, the rest are FIAT buses.  The way Samara - Syzran in time will be a little longer than when traveling by own car, but cheaper by almost 100 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Bus Station Samara" class="if uuid-2502586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2502586.jpg"></div><p>  Private taxi services are also available.  More expensive, but not depending on the route schedule.  When traveling from Syzran to Samara (in the pool), the cost will be similar to traveling by bus.  BlaBlaCar service offers a trip for only 200 rubles. </p><h2>  By electric train from Samara </h2><p>  The most reliable and cheapest transport, as always, is railway transport.  Three electric trains daily run strictly according to the schedule in the direction Samara - Syzran and two routes according to a special schedule.  Without traffic jams and problems, for 179 rubles and 40 kopecks an electric train will deliver a passenger to the desired station.  The fastest train will arrive in less than 2 hours.  The travel time of the rest is comparable to a trip by car. </p><p>  The neighboring cities on the Volga always had good water connections.  It was believed that this route was slow, but convenient.  The 21st century has changed everything radically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rechflot-63.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berth in Syzran" class="if uuid-2502588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2502588.jpg"></div><p>  There was a river route Samara - Syzran, which will be able to deliver people from one port to another in just 2 hours 15 minutes.  Only at night can you drive faster.  But what could be nicer on a hot summer day to ride along the Volga on the high-speed Voskhod.  So far, the existing transport is a legacy of the Soviet era, but we hope that the river park will be updated, and soon more convenient and modern ships will sail along the route. </p>
