    <h2>  The road from Vladivostok to China </h2><p>  <span>The large passenger flow on both sides of the Russian-Chinese border creates favorable conditions for competition in the transport market, which, in turn, provides reasonable ticket prices.</span> </p><p>  <span><span>Tours to China</span> from Vladivostok are very popular due to the agreement between the Russian Federation and the PRC, which sets forth the procedure for visa-free entry to both countries if a person travels as part of a group.</span>  <span>Such group trips, however, impose a number of restrictions - entry and exit only as part of a group and the use of the same <span>border crossing.</span></span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>To visit China as part of a group, you should book a tour at one of <span>the</span> city‚Äôs <span>travel agencies</span> .</span>  Visas for independent travel to the named country will have to be issued through the PRC consulate with a ready invitation or by contacting one of the specialized agencies of the city that are professionally engaged in paperwork for these trips. </p><p>  <span>To get from Vladivostok to China can be in several different ways.</span>  <span>Firstly, it is worth considering the option of flying on an airplane.</span>  <span>This option allows you to get to your destination as soon as possible, but at a price that exceeds the cost of both a bus tour and, in some cases, a train ticket.</span> </p><p>  <span>One-way flight on the route Vladivostok - Beijing takes 2 hours 40 minutes and usually costs no more than ten thousand rubles.</span>  <span>Flight to Shanghai costs one and a half times more expensive, as this is a more popular destination for Russian travelers.</span>  <span>With transfers in major cities of China, you can get to almost anywhere in the world.</span> </p><p>  <span>As for the railway connection, regular trains do not connect Vladivostok and Harbin, however there is a daily train departing from the Grodekovo station near the capital of Primorye.</span>  <span>Such a trip will take about eleven hours.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Cities of North China </h2><p>  <span>One of the most popular cities in the northern part of the PRC for Russians is Harbin.</span>  <span>Russia has a long history in common with this city, which began during the time the Russian Empire was building a railway in eastern China.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>After the Russian revolution, numerous refugees from Russia settled in this city, who escaped repression and persecution in their native country for one reason or another.</span>  <span>And a</span> large number of memorable places makes Harbin a popular destination for history buffs. </p><p>  Once in the city there were two dozen churches and a whole network of Russian schools, but such prosperity for fugitives from Russia lasted only until the end of the thirties, after which all Russians had to leave the country.  But many of them in their diaries recalled that it was time, as if stopped in its movement, and the city existed according to the rules of the pre-revolutionary Empire. </p>
