    <p>  A prerequisite for the creation of a multimedia lineup for the company was the opening of a store called “Nokia Music Store”.  There, for a small fee, the user could purchase their favorite compositions.  A little later, the service began to work under the name “Nokia Internet Radio”.  Thus, the company had to “wind up” the popularity of the above platforms.  And due to what could this be done?  Unless only by maximally filling the segments of the mobile phone market with special music devices.  And “Nokia 5310” has become just one of these devices.  The model hit the mid-price segment at the very beginning of sales.  It is interesting that this happened then. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  “Nokia Express Music 5310” was recognized by international experts as a very thin device, which not all models of the Finnish manufacturer could boast of.  With a height of 104 and a width of 45 millimeters, the thickness was only 10. Moreover, the mass of the device is 71 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reliability </h2>

    <p>  The flanks on the sides of the screen are sloping.  In fact, they are nothing more than inserts made of metal materials.  Special multimedia keys are built into the flanks, which have become a feature of the corresponding model range.  If we talk about colors, they are made in blue or red colors.  The plastic is quite pleasant to the touch.  It has a dark gray color.  The back panel of the phone is decorated with a special ornament consisting of dots.  You can immediately notice the signature inscription “Nokia”, which is made in the same color as the metal inserts on the sides of the screen. </p><h2>  Screen protection </h2>

    <p>  “Nokia 5310”, the display of which is covered with a protective glass, has a matrix made by TFT technology.  A glossy insert is formed at the junction.  There, in turn, there is a slot that is necessary for the successful use of the conversational speaker.  There is also a light sensor, which allows the device to assess the level of lighting at a given point in time and change it in automatic mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The diagonal of the screen is two inches.  I remember that the 6300 and 6500 models were equipped with similar components. They were also quite good phones, but they were positioned precisely as beautiful design solutions.  At the same time, the devices did not have special functionality in general, what can we say about multimedia parameters.  On this issue, the Nokia Express Music product line is more specialized, one of the devices of which we are considering today. </p><p>  So, with a screen diagonal of two inches, the resolution is 240 by 320 pixels.  Color reproduction - up to 16 million shades, everything with her is normal.  The picture on the screen is displayed in good quality, it is unlikely to complain about the brightness and saturation in the room.  In addition, good viewing angles obtained through the use of a matrix based on TFT technology should be noted.  The situation is slightly worse under natural light.  In the sun, the picture burns out in some way, but if it becomes more difficult to read text from the screen, then it’s a little.  In general, there is something to praise the company's engineers for sure. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The Nokia 5310 phone is equipped with a keyboard unit, which consists of a navigation key, as well as four more buttons.  Two of them are soft keys, for which quick calls of the corresponding functions can be assigned, from a notebook to an alarm clock.  Two more keys correspond to the functions of accepting and rejecting a voice call.  The navigation button for the size of the middle, just the golden mean.  At the same time, the main unit is represented by small numeric keys located quite tightly.  They are located back to back.  The buttons are pressed clearly.  It is possible to make a mistake while typing, but, as a rule, this happens quite rarely.  There is a standard white backlight.  It is distributed evenly throughout the keyboard unit.  In any light, the backlight works well.  She does not hurt her eyes. </p><h2>  Left and right sides </h2><p>  Here we have a small connector, to which you can connect a charger.  On the opposite side, you can find a special rocker key, designed to adjust the volume level.  With its help on the phone, you can completely turn off the sound, as well as “wind” it to the maximum.  On the right side there is a special mount in which you can thread the strap for added reliability.  It will be worn on the arm or neck (depending on the type of strap itself). </p><h2>  Lower and upper ends </h2><p>  At the bottom, we will not notice any elements and connectors.  An interesting solution, because, as a rule, the Finnish manufacturer decided to “decorate” their devices from below with a charging port.  It seems that the company decided to make an exception, and now we have exactly what we have.  For the rest, it should be noted that there is a standard connector on the upper end intended for a 3.5 mm standard wired stereo headset.  There is also a microUSB format port, to which a cable is connected for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop.  It also allows you to charge the device.  The connector is covered by a special protective plug made of plastic materials. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  On the back is the camera lens.  It is located on top, and the module itself has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  In the lower part of the device we have special slots made for sound from polyphonic sound speakers.  There are three of them.  At the same time, the speakers are one less.  However, they are located close enough to each other, so obviously we can’t talk about playing music with stereo effects.  If we remove the back cover, we find under it a battery with a capacity of 860 milliamps per hour.  There is also a connector for installing a SIM card.  On the side there is a slot in which the user can integrate an external microSD format drive. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  So, what verdict can be reached by phone based on feedback from the owners?  Let's try to summarize and give a general assessment of the device.  The call plays in 64-tone quality, with an average volume.  In most situations, the volume is really not enough, the device turned out to be somehow quiet.  On the street, the device is heard very, very badly, especially in conditions with an increased noise background. </p><p>  In the room, you can also miss an incoming call if the phone is located, for example, in your pocket.  And it will not be any difficulty.  Probably, such features can be immediately recorded in the flaws of the phone, however, this will be the most significant minus.  If we talk about the quality of communication, then there are no complaints to the device in this regard.  The cellular network is stable, it does not disappear anywhere at the most inopportune moment.  Which, in principle, is typical for devices of the corresponding generation. </p><p>  The vibrating alert is also average in intensity.  In 50 percent of cases, it is not very audible, but this is how it shows itself quite decently.  The device has become a good musical solution for a wide audience.  The device looks quite attractive, its dimensions also suit a large number of potential buyers.  No wonder the devices of the line were presented as youth solutions, because for her it is a phone with a good set of functional features.  Firmware “Nokia 5310” can be found on the official website of the Finnish manufacturer. </p><p>  In general, we can say that if you want enhanced functionality musically, you should move forward without focusing on this model.  However, if the user needs exactly the basic level, then Nokia 5310, the characteristic of which was presented in this article, can become a really optimal purchase option. </p>
