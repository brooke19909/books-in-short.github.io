This is one of the most ancient and beautiful parts of the country.  There are large ancient cities and small villages with a traditional lifestyle.  Ferghana region makes a serious contribution to the state economy and is of significant interest to tourism. </p><h2>  Geography and biology </h2><p>  The Republic of Uzbekistan is located in the center of <span>Central Asia</span> .  The Ferghana region is located in the southern part of the Ferghana Valley and is one of 13 territorial and administrative districts of the country.  Its area is 68 km¬≤.  The region occupies a flat territory with a slight elevation above sea level to the southeast.  The valley is represented by all types of landscape: it is enclosed by the Altai Range, and the northern part is occupied by steppes.  The region is rich in water resources.  The rivers flowing down from the mountains form a wide water network, which is collected in <span>the Syr Darya River.</span>  An additional water supply is provided by the Central Ferghana Reservoir. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferghana region" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1264080.jpg" width="559"></div>

    <p>  Convenient location in a fertile valley makes the world of flora and fauna of the Ferghana region extremely rich.  Many different plants grow here.  Mostly the whole flora is of cultural origin, since natural vegetation is solonchak meadows interspersed with oases.  However, man has turned this land into real paradise.  The animal world is also very interesting.  Of the large animals here you can find wild boars, foxes, wolves.  But the greatest species diversity occurs in small animals and birds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Settlement history </h2><p>  The Ferghana region began to be populated in the 1-2 century, when various Turkic tribes began to develop this territory.  However, the oldest sites of people found by archaeologists date back to 7-5 centuries BC.  Stone tools and remains were found in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Selengur site in the region.  In total, scientists counted 13 <span>cultural layers</span> on this earth.  Since 1709, the Kokand Khanate was created on the site of the Ferghana region.  Shahrukh II and his descendants ruled this land, expanding their borders at the expense of neighboring states. </p>

    <p>  In 1821, the 12-year-old Madali Khan came to power, during the reign of which the state significantly expanded its holdings and strengthened.  The khanate was a very strong formation and held onto its power until 1842, until the lands were ceded to the Kyrgyz ruler.  For power over such a fertile land there has been an ongoing intense struggle between the sedentary people of the Sarts and the nomadic Kipchaks.  Heads of the country constantly replaced each other.  The history of the area is full of tragic episodes.  Permanent unrest led to a weakening of the country's defense power, which led to the fact that the Bukhara emir, who was defeated by Russian troops in the mid-19th century, seized power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Russian and Soviet periods </h2><p>  Since 1855, the Ferghana region, before which was under the rule of Turkestan, was embraced by the fire of <span>internecine wars.</span>  Khudoyar Khan, the Bukhara governor in Kokand, could not maintain power over the uprising tribes and, under the onslaught of the offensive of the Russian troops, was forced in 1868 to accept the terms of a trade agreement with the Russian Empire.  Now Russians and Kokandans received the right to free movement, trade, for which they had to pay a tax of 2.5%.  Khudoyar Khan remained the governor of the territory.  In 1875, the Kipchaks, led by Abdurahamn-Avtobachi, rebelled against the power of Khudoyar, which was joined by local clergy and opponents of the Russian occupation.  A new force of about 10 thousand people invaded the lands subordinated to the Russians, besieged the city of Khojent and entrenched in the Mahram fortress. </p>

    <p>  On August 22, 1875, General Kaufman with his army knocked out the rebels from the fortress and captured Kokand and Margelan.  The lands were subordinate to the Russian emperor.  However, as soon as the troops left, unrest flared up again.  General Skobelev, who headed the Namangan department, severely cracked down on the rebels, and the entire territory of the Ferghana region was annexed to the Russian state.  Skobelev became the first governor of the Ferghana region.  After the revolution in Russia, <span>Soviet power also</span> came to Uzbekistan.  In 1924, an administrative reform was carried out, and the territory led by Kokand became part of the Uzbek Socialist Republic.  In 1938, a new territorial unit was formed - the Ferghana region.  During the Soviet era, the region is actively populated by the Russian population, industrialization is underway, and infrastructure is being built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the Ferghana Region, whose regions were significantly strengthened economically, remained part of Uzbekistan, which declared its independence in 1991.  In 1989-90, there were massive clashes with the Kyrgyz population, and migration began.  Today, the Ferghana region is returning to its original structure.  The industrial component gives way to agricultural traditions.  The region, like the whole state, is restoring Muslim customs and lifestyle, although relations with Russia are not lost.  Over 25 years of independence, new cultural and economic ties have been established.  The Ferghana region today embodies the features of the traditional Uzbek region. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Ferghana Valley is a unique place.  Surrounded by mountains on all sides, it has special climatic conditions.  It is not in vain called the pearl of Uzbekistan, since almost ideal conditions for human life are truly created here.  The Ferghana region has a sharply continental climate, with fairly mild winters and hot summers.  Average winter temperatures are -3 degrees, summer - +28. </p>

    <p>  The only drawback of the local climate is strong winds, especially in the spring, which dry out the soil, carry away the fertile layer, depleting the land.  The region also has a low rainfall, but the moisture requirements of agriculture are covered by irrigation with water resources.  The Ferghana region has a milder climate than in the neighboring regions of the valley.  Here the weather is quite stable, little prone to sharp fluctuations.  The region has developed favorable conditions for growing many heat-loving crops, including cotton, rice, tea. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Ferghana region (Uzbekistan) - the area is quite densely populated.  Almost a third of the population of the whole country lives here.  Its density is 450 people per 1 km¬≤.  The ethnic composition of the region is diverse.  82% of the inhabitants are Uzbeks.  Other nationalities are represented by small groups: Tajiks - about 4%, Russians - 2.6%, Kazakhs - 1%. </p>

    <p>  The official language is Uzbek, although the residents of the region also speak Russian well, and young people study English without exception.  The official religion practiced by 95% of the population is Islam.  The dynamics of population growth in the region is 1-2% per year.  Gradually, the average life expectancy, which today has an indicator of 70 years, is growing.  The average age of a resident of the Ferghana region is 23 years.  The population today is increasingly concentrated in cities. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The Ferghana region today is mainly an agricultural region.  Although the capital of the region is a large economic and industrial center.  Many large enterprises of the chemical, food, light, oil refining industries are located here.  Here, spare parts, furniture, fertilizers, glass, cement and many other products are made.  A large contribution to the economy of the region is made by agricultural enterprises that grow cotton, rice, cattle, providing not only domestic needs, but also actively trading with other states.  The development and stability of the economy is facilitated by the extraction of minerals: oil, sulfur, gas, limestone, which are an important export object. </p>

    <p>  A ring railway runs through the region, connecting large cities of the country and the region.  The total length of the tracks is 200 km. </p><h2>  Administrative divisions and cities </h2><p>  Ferghana region is divided into 15 fogs - administrative districts.  Each is governed by a leader appointed by a hakim.  Large cities of the Ferghana region (Uzbekistan): Ferghana, Kokand, Margilan, Kuvasay - have the status of regional subordination.  Most of the population of the region is concentrated in them. </p><h2>  Ferghana </h2><p>  The main city in the Ferghana region is its capital.  The very translation of the name from Persian - "diverse" - says a lot about this place.  About 350 thousand people of different nationalities live here.  The city dates back to 1876, when the Russian governor of these lands, General Skobelev, founded the new capital.  For some time the city even bore his name.  Such a history of occurrence was reflected in the appearance of Ferghana.  Initially, it was built up with buildings in the European style: Officer's meeting, post office, governor's residence, headquarters, theater, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral - all this was the beginning of a special city, atypical for Central Asia.  Here, planning was initially introduced with straight streets. </p>

    <p>  Ferghana experienced the most rapid growth in Soviet times, especially after the Second World War, when a large number of industrial enterprises were built here, and higher educational institutions opened. </p><p>  Today Ferghana is a very beautiful and green city.  There are a huge number of gardens and parks.  The main attractions of the city are the House of Officers, the former House of Officers - the theater, the <span>cathedral mosque of</span> Jome Masjid, the old fortress. </p><h2>  Kokand </h2><p>  Another major center is the city of Kokand (Ferghana region).  Its history begins in the 5-6 century.  Ancient tribes lived here.  Since 1709, the city has been the capital of the powerful Kokand Khanate.  Advantageous placement on the Silk Road provided the development and wealth of Kokand, which constantly attracted invaders here.  The long history of the city is a series of wars and changes of rulers.  Since the establishment of Soviet power, the city has been calm, and after the declaration of independence of Uzbekistan, it has returned to its national and cultural origins. </p>

The tourism sector is actively developing in the city: hotels are being built, museums are opening, and infrastructure is growing.
