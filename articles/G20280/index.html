    <h2>  History of the Mordovian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: the first half of the 20th century </h2><p>  In 1918, the building of military communism was going on in the future republic, as well as throughout the country.  He suggested certain economic, social and political events.  In 1918, accelerated nationalization of industry began.  The SNH was formed, a ban was established on private trade, direct exchange of goods in the village and the city.  Landlords' estates were seized from the owners, land was redistributed.  The country's leadership created a variety of forms of use of the territories.  These were agricultural cooperatives, and communes, and partnerships for working together on the land, as well as state farms and collective farms.  In practice, all these measures have caused serious damage to the population. </p><h2>  Civil confrontation </h2><p>  It began in the same 1918. Mordovian counties twice turned into a frontal zone.  A significant number of Red Army forces were stationed on the territory of the republic.  At the end of May 1918 the <span>rebellion of the Czechoslovak</span> Corps began.  Penza turned out to be a hotbed of rebellion.  660 fighters from Ruzayevka and Saransk were sent here to suppress the rebellion.  In October 1918, the creation of the First Rifle Regiment began.  In April-May 1919, the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee, which formed the eponymous division, was located in Saransk.  In general, more than 70 thousand people were mobilized in Mordovia.  Workers and local authorities provided assistance to the army.  But the tough policy of the authorities, especially the surplus appraisal, intensified the discontent of the peasants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mordovian Assr in the postwar years" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1553161.jpg" width="600"></div>

Representatives of all social strata took part in these uprisings.  Together with the peasant riots, speeches began in military units.  Deserters began to take part in the uprisings.  In July-August in the Krasnoslobodsky, Insarsky, Saransk, Ruzaevsky, Narovchatovsky counties more than 7 thousand of them were revealed. </p><h2>  Policy Summary </h2><p>  In addition to the victory of power, the elimination of intervention, <span>military communism</span> brought ruin to the country's economy.  Industrial production decreased significantly, and sown areas were cut everywhere.  The financial system was in a deep crisis, inflation was at a high level, and tax policy was degrading.  In 1928, the formation of statehood in the republic began.

    <h2>  Industry </h2><p>  <span>The Mordovian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic</span> had extensive production facilities.  They housed evacuated equipment of enterprises in the Oryol, Bryansk, Kursk regions, Belarus and Ukraine.  Many of them began in the fall of 1941 to produce products for the front.  By mid-1942, enterprises were operating at full capacity.  The restructuring of production was quick enough, because it did not require significant changes in technological processes.  The Saransk Mechanical Plant and Elektrovypryamitel enterprise, which were put into operation, made it possible to form the basis for the development of industry and the creation of a personnel reserve in the post-war years. </p><h2>  Assistance to other regions </h2><p>  <span>The Mordovian ASSR</span> received about 80 thousand evacuated citizens.  On the territory of the republic, 26 boarding schools and orphanages were formed to accommodate more than 3 thousand children.  During the first months of the war, residents brought up and adopted more than 1.3 thousand orphans.  The republic rendered all possible assistance to territories especially affected by the German occupation.  In 1942-1943, about 10 thousand heads of cattle, 4 thousand horses were transferred to the Oryol, Smolensk, Tula, Ryazan regions. </p><p>  The republic and Leningrad helped.  More than 240 thousand residents of different nationalities went to the front from Mordovia.  Most of them died.  Thousands of Mordovian soldiers became heroes.  Many of them distinguished themselves during the defense of Moscow, the Brest Fortress, Leningrad, Sevastopol, on the Kursk Bulge and near Stalingrad. </p>

    <h2>  Mordovian ASSR in the postwar years </h2><p>  The battles with the German invaders caused enormous damage to the national economic complex of the whole country.  The consequences for the Mordovian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic became severe.  The republic suffered huge losses.  Most of the working population was called up to the front.  In the villages remained old people, children and women.  The republic experienced a shortage of equipment and machinery.  The lack of combines, tractors, and other agricultural machinery caused delays in harvesting, spring field work.  The area under sowing has significantly decreased, livestock productivity has worsened, the number of livestock has decreased. </p><p>  As for industry, here in the post-war years, the machine park was updated.  Production technology has changed significantly.  Along with the reconstruction and expansion of existing enterprises, the construction of new ones began.  So there were cement, cable, electric lamp, tool and other plants.  By 1950, there was an increase in gross output.  However, in spite of some successes, a downward trend in production appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of mordovian assr" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1553165.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Way out of the crisis </h2><p>  The 1950s are considered the most successful period in the development of the country's economy.  It was at this time that the basis was formed for the subsequent strengthening of the national economic complex in all regions.  In 1959-65  went through the process of transforming Mordovia from an agrarian into an industrial republic.  By 1965, more than 12 thousand tractors were involved in agriculture, all operating collective farms were electrified.  The total grain yield was 700 thousand tons.  There has been a tendency to increase wages.  Thus, the wages of employees and workers increased by more than 25%, and the incomes of collective farmers almost tripled. </p>
