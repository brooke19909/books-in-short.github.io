    <p>  The beautiful <span>Club Hotel</span> Sunbel is located on the picturesque seashore, in the resort village called Beldibi.  This is a quiet place that is perfect for a relaxing, leisurely vacation with all amenities.  Naturally, if you wish, you can get to other settlements.  For example, just a kilometer from the hotel building there is another small village Goynuk.  The distance to the center of Kemer with all its attractions is about 15 kilometers - you can get here by taxi or rented transport.  By the way, there are several shops, entertainment and shopping centers in Beldibi, so you are unlikely to feel cut off from the environment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest international airport is located on the territory of the large and famous resort town of Antalya - the distance to it is 45 kilometers.  Nevertheless, it is not worth worrying about this, as the hotel, as well as travel agencies, provides tourists with a transfer. </p><h2>  Brief description of infrastructure and territory </h2><p>  As already mentioned, <span>the Club Hotel</span> Sunbel 4 * hotel is located almost on the seashore.  It can be considered relatively small, since the total area is 5500 square meters.  Nevertheless, the entire territory is well equipped and well maintained.  In the center is a multi-storey building, where, in fact, the rooms are located.  In the courtyard there is a swimming pool, sports and children's playgrounds.  The exterior, as well as the interior design of the building, is a successful combination of modern architecture and oriental culture.  The territory is decorated with palm trees and exotic flowers, there are places for relaxation and walking.  The small area in the hotel is compensated by the atmosphere of real home comfort and genuine hospitality. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the hotel was built in 1996.  And in 2003, a complete reconstruction of both buildings and the entire territory was carried out.  Today the hotel meets all international standards.  By the way, almost every year the hotel arranges certain cosmetic repairs in order to create the most comfortable conditions for guests. </p><h2>  Turkey, Club Hotel Sunbel 4 *: description and photos of rooms </h2>
