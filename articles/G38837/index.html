This can be done at any time of the year, because it is not difficult to make primroses with your own hands.  It is enough to have at hand the necessary materials, including colored and white paper, scissors and glue.  Of course, such flowers can not be compared with natural ones, but they can be a wonderful decoration of the interior of any room or a great gift for a loved one. </p><h2>  Corrugated paper snowdrops: preparatory phase </h2><p>  One of the most famous <span>spring flowers</span> are snowdrops.  Therefore, it is not surprising that, having decided to make primroses with their own hands, most large and small craftsmen and craftswomen think of them.  Moreover, there are a huge number of options for creating this flower.  As for the snowdrop, which will be discussed later, for its manufacture you will need green and white corrugated paper, wooden skewers, threads, glue and scissors.  The volume of materials depends on how much it is planned to make primroses from paper. </p>

    <p>  With your own hands, you will first need to prepare a blank for the stamen.  To do this, cut out a small rectangle from green and white paper and bend their upper edge by 0.5-1 cm. Next, you need to prepare blanks for the petals.  Cut three long strips from white paper and, twisting each of them at the top, bend inward.  Twisting must be done like the action with which the candies are wrapped.  It is also necessary to cut an oblong leaf or two from green paper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Corrugated paper snowdrop assembly </h2><p>  Now it remains only to collect the flower.  First, you need to wind a green blank for the stamens on the tip of the skewer, then white, and then fix the petals with a thread.  Next, from a green corrugated paper, it is necessary to cut a narrow long strip and wrap it with the entire skewer, starting from the lower edge of the flower and ending at the bottom of the stem.  During this process, leaves must also be wound onto the skewer.  The bottom of the paper should be secured with glue to prevent unwinding.  You can make a whole bunch of such snowdrops to present to someone as a gift or to decorate your own room.  After all, there will probably not be a person who would not have been pleased with such primroses of paper.  With your own hands, you can also make other flowers that harmoniously fit into an already prepared bouquet of snowdrops. </p>

    <p>  To begin the manufacture of crafts should be the creation of stamens and petals, which will be composed of future paper primroses.  With your own hands you need to cut a strip of paper 4 cm wide and 6 cm high - this will be the stamen of the future flower.  It is important not to forget to make small incisions along the upper edge of this part.  For the petals, ovals with pointed edges of sizes similar to the first element will be needed.  Each flower requires one stamen and three petals.  The color of all details depends solely on your imagination and the paper at hand. </p><h2>  Assembling crocuses and placing them in a vase </h2><p>  First, stick the stamen to the tip of the wooden skewer.  Then, for the convenience of making DIY primroses, make small cuts in the lower part of the petals and fix them on a skewer around the stamen.  You will need to wrap the skewer with a strip of green paper - this will be the stem.  In addition, it is necessary to cut the leaves and also stick to the appropriate place.  You can make a lot of such crocuses, while it is advisable to use paper of different colors. </p>

    <p>  It remains to make a vase.  The cardboard tube must be pasted over with white paper.  Next, cut a circle of a larger diameter than the sleeve.  After that, on the bottom of the tube you need to make incisions of about 2 cm in length and bend them outwards, and then glue the part to the cardboard circle.  Cover the imperfections of the lower part can be cut around the shape of the bottom of the vase in a circle with a hole inside.  The product can be decorated at your discretion.  Now it remains to place the primrose flowers made earlier in the vase.  With your own hands, the created beauty is ready. </p><h2>  Narcissus: quilling applique </h2><p>  At a time when snowdrops and crocuses are blooming in the forests and mountains, residents of various settlements can see luxurious daffodils in the flower beds.  And, probably, many people have a question about how to make these primroses with their own hands from paper.  Perhaps one of the most beautiful and interesting crafts in this case is the application in the technique of quilling.  For its manufacture you will need a set of <span>strips for quilling,</span> scissors, glue and cardboard for the base. </p><p>  For each daffodil flower you will need 6 strips 30 cm long in yellow or white.  All of them must be curtailed in the form of an ‚Äúeye‚Äù.  To make one stamen, you need to prepare 3 lemon strips 2 cm long and twist them into a tight round spiral.  The role of the stem will be played by a green strip of 10 cm, and for the manufacture of leaves you will need a forty-centimeter strip, twisted into a free spiral and elongated in the shape of an ‚Äúeye‚Äù. </p>
