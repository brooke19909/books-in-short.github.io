Assessment of Ivan the Terrible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first tsar of all Russia, Ivan the Fourth, or <span>Ivan the Terrible,</span> whose personality profile is of interest to many of our contemporaries, acquired over the years of his reign a huge amount of land, sometimes resorting to ruthless means.  Also known for creating a centralized power system.  But it is not known what contributed more to his celebrity: merits to the state or cruel and unbridled disposition? </p><h2>  Ivan the Terrible: personality and era, as well as the surrounding atmosphere </h2><p>  The Russian Tsar, who ruled since 1547, was the grandson of Ivan the Great and the son of Basil the Third.  His mother is a princess of Mongolian descent.  When Ivan was three years old, his father died, and five years later his mother died (according to some reports, she may have been poisoned).  Around the growing up boy reigned an atmosphere of constant rivalry and deception.  Young people suffer from poor health, abuse, manipulation and lack of education. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-583892" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/583892.jpg?1576561778"></div><p>  The struggle in the palace for power develops into bloody enmity.  Ivan himself has repeatedly watched or heard of killings and beatings.  And often he himself was subjected to verbal and physical attacks.  Unable to strike his tormentors in response, he vented his disappointment on defenseless animals, which he brutally tortured and threw from the tops of the towers.  So Ivan the Terrible spent his childhood.  <span>Characterization of</span> his <span>personality</span> is a difficult task, because much is known about him, but even more is forgotten or simply silent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Educated, extraordinary and incredibly devout </h2><p>  At the same time, Ivan intensively reads books and reads them at an incredible pace.  He writes a lot, learns to play music and becomes a great rider.  Intellectually, he was noticeably more developed than his surroundings.  The personality and characterization of Ivan the Terrible during that period of government is carefully studied by many historians.  This man is so striking in his eccentricity and scholarship that he can easily be put on a par with the most competent rulers. </p><p>  Yes, he is cruel, but at the same time very pious and constantly observes the complex rites of Orthodoxy.  He takes an active part in various church events.  At sixteen, in 1547, Ivan was crowned.  Three weeks later, he married Anastasia Romanovna Zakharyina-Yurieva. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-583901" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/583901.jpg?1576561778"></div><p>  She was chosen at a parade of girls presented to the young sovereign.  The queen gave birth to six children, of whom only two survived.  During their joint thirteen-year stay, Anastasia always had a calming effect on the stubborn, nervous and unstable disposition of her husband. </p><h2>  Beginning of the reign: conscientious leader </h2><p>  It was during this period, from 1547 to 1560, that the assessment of the personality and activities of Ivan the Terrible, as a rule, carries the most positive features.  He becomes a conscientious and pious leader.  Ivan appointed an advisory council, founded the National Assembly of Current Reforms in Local Government, and drafted a new code of laws that standardized the responsibilities and duties of the aristocracy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-583890" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/583890.jpg?1576561778"></div><p>  The personality of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible is becoming popular not only in the Russian state.  He takes control of the Volga and access to the Caspian Sea, encourages trade with various European countries, including England, France and Holland.  Moreover, inviting foreign masters, is engaged in the decoration of Moscow.  And it should be especially noted for its high progressive administrative policy.  So Ivan the Terrible began to reign, the characterization of his personality is known not only to historians, but also to many well-read people. </p><h2>  Awakening of cruel temper </h2><p>  In 1553, Ivan the Fourth suffered a serious illness, during which he began to suspect his nobles of disloyalty.  Decides to take revenge on their families by torture and execution.  And when his wife dies in 1560, the period of bestiality begins. </p><p>  Now, contemporaries have a completely different Ivan - Grozny.  The personality characteristics of this king are thoroughly understood even in the school curriculum, and each student knows that from that time on he begins to be distinguished by unlimited cruelty.  The family life of Ivan the Fourth becomes more unstable, emphasizing his egocentrism, insecurity and manic temperament. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-583895" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/583895.jpg?1576561778"></div><h2>  Messy family life </h2><p>  In 1561 he marries the beautiful <span>Maria Temryukovna,</span> but soon gets tired of her.  Two years after her death, Ivan marries Marfa Vasilyevna Sobakina, the daughter of a merchant who dies in two weeks. </p><p>  The fourth wife of Ivan the Terrible - Anna Alekseevna Koltovskaya.  He sends her to the monastery, and in 1575 he marries for the fifth time to Anna Grigoryevna Vasilchikova.  An unreasonable lady got herself a lover whom Ivan the Fourth planted on a stake right under her window, and the adulterer was tonsured a nun.  His last wife was Maria Fyodorovna Nagaya.  Ivan the Fourth married her in 1581.  There are versions that some of Grozny's wives died from poisoning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-587891" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/587891.jpg?1576561778"></div><h2>  Ruler famous for his cruel disposition </h2><p>  Of course, many historical figures are known to readers.  Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Second and so on.  But Ivan the Fourth is the king that everyone has heard about, even someone who is not at all familiar with history.  What caused such general fame? </p><p>  Perhaps this is the most severe period of his reign, which had its heyday from 1564 to 1572.  When, according to historical sources, John Vasilievich ruthlessly tortured and killed thousands of his subjects, and many even with his own hands.  His goal was to cleanse the earth of "insidious elements."  In 1570, on the basis of unverified allegations of <span>treason, the</span> entire city of Novgorod was tortured.  Sixty thousand citizens were slaughtered in one week. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-583899" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25551/583899.jpg?1576561778"></div><h2>  Should I strictly judge this historical figure </h2><p>  Ivan the Fourth ruled until 1584.  Some historians note his merits to the state, some blame him for being too suspicious and cruel, many blame him for infanticide ... How to figure out which one is right?  The only possible option is to go deep into history yourself, but it will take a lot of time.  Therefore, we will go the other way.  What will help to get to know each person better, be it neighbor's uncle Vasya or the famous Ivan the Terrible?  Characteristic personality.  Briefly dwelling only on the main details, one can note his boundless suspicion, insatiable cruelty and extreme depravity.  According to historians, these are the most outstanding character traits of this king. </p><p>  During his reign, hardly at least one family of noble origin was not affected by the willfulness of the king.  Countless <span>farmland</span> was abandoned during the attack by the guardsmen, and landowners were forced to leave their homes in search of salvation.  As soon as this person was not called: a <span>tyrant, a despot, a</span> maniac, the murderer of his own son ... "In general," the reader will say, "a gloomy personality."  And the childhood of Ivan the Terrible played a decisive role in this.  Because, most likely, already in his youth, the painful cruelty that manifested itself in adulthood was laid in the boy.  Being brought up in the atmosphere that reigned in the palace, Ivan the Fourth did not have the opportunity to communicate with his mother or father, no one provided him any support - neither physical nor moral.  So it‚Äôs not for us to judge him for the instability of temper or the failure of the psyche. </p>
