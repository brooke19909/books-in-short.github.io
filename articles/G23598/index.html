C√¥te d'Ivoire: Country Information</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A small state in western Africa, the world has long known as the Country of Slaves, the Land of Grain and the place of the Golden Quays.  The material will introduce a country whose name translates as Ivory Coast.  Tourists are interested in what kind of people live in this country, what nature there is, what capital.  Thousands of visitors annually come to C√¥te d'Ivoire for the sake of this attraction.  The thing is that this city was built by the French, and the local architecture is very close to the architecture of <span>medieval Europe,</span> but at the same time it has its own zest. </p><h2>  Coffee country </h2><p>  The territories of the modern republic began to be populated at the beginning of the Stone Age.  The first inhabitants were the pygmies.  But they led a nomadic way of life.  Therefore, soon other tribes came to these lands, those that still live in the state.  With the development of colonial conquest, the migration of peoples stopped. </p>

    <p>  From the end of the 15th century, Europe exported gold, wood and coffee beans from these lands.  <span>March 10,</span> 1893 the land was declared a <span>colony of France.</span> </p><p>  Tribes constantly fought for independence.  The maximum uprisings occurred during the recruitment into the army in connection with the First World War. </p><p>  In 1934, the capital of C√¥te d'Ivoire was proclaimed.  She became Abidjan.  Soon, in 1945, the first batch was founded, which until then was a union of local farmers.  He created and headed the organization Felix Ufue-Boigny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1957, the country received autonomy status.  And on August 7, 1960, the <span>Ivory Coast</span> became an independent state.  The leader of the aforementioned party was elected President.  By 1979, the state had grown economically.  It ranked first in the export of coffee beans.  Subsequent years were characterized by drought.  This led to a decline in development. </p><h2>  City of cut leaves </h2><p>  Abidjan is the first official capital.  C√¥te d'Ivoire is a unique region where each locality has its own legend.  This city was no exception.  The myth says that when the first military Europeans intended to build a port on these shores and got off the ships, they met the local population.  Peasants carried on their heads baskets with cut leaves and branches. </p><p>  One of the men asked the Africans what this village was called.  But the poor did not understand French, in which people from distant lands spoke to them.  Moreover, they perceived unknown words as a threat.  One man thought that the visitors were dissatisfied with their work.  Then the daredevil cried out to them in reply: ‚ÄúAbidjan‚Äù, which meant ‚Äúthese are cut branches‚Äù.  Europeans have designated a place on the map. </p>

    <h2>  Homeland of the head of state </h2><p>  President Felix Ufue-Boigny has done a lot for his country.  It was under him that the republic flourished and developed.  In 1983, a new capital was formed.  C√¥te d'Ivoire led Yamoussoukro.  This city is the birthplace of the first ruler.  This is precisely the reason for the transfer of the center of the state. </p><p>  The town dates back to the end of the 19th century.  It was founded by the French colonialists.  It was the first center of C√¥te d'Ivoire until 1934, when Abidjan took its place. </p>

    <p>  The area is located two hundred kilometers from the Atlantic Ocean.  The latter fact has caused a long road to economic recovery.  The fact is that Europeans preferred to invest in items that lie on the coastal zone.  So Abidjan grew up.  That is why the current capital of the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire has long remained invisible. </p><p>  A new history of the city began after independence.  With the reforms of Felix Ufue-Boigny, the Ivory Coast began to rise. </p><h2>  Provincial capital </h2><p>  In the center of the country has its own airport (only three cities take airplanes).  Outside, agriculture is actively developing.  Yams, bananas, cocoa beans are actively grown.  Livestock is represented <span>by cattle,</span> goats and sheep.  Although most industrial facilities are concentrated in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro has food and wood processing companies on its territory. </p>

    <p>  Although the center was relocated, the residence of the central government and foreign ministries remained in Abidjan.  Because of this, few foreigners knew that Yamoussoukro is the capital.  C√¥te d'Ivoire developed rapidly and quickly, and in the years 1960-1980 huge investments began to be made in the city.  But already from the 80s there was a noticeable crisis.  The decline in export prices negatively affected development. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The climate in the country varies from tropical to equatorial.  The whole year is characterized by high humidity and significant rainfall.  Most of the rains occur in April-July and October-November.  Average temperature +30. </p><p>  In 2010, the city's population was almost 250,000. Most (more than 60%) came from the Bacongo and Bate-ke tribes.  Despite the fact that the official language is French, many communicate in their native dialect. </p>

    <p>  Does not have any high-quality higher education institutions in the capital.  C√¥te d'Ivoire today has a big problem with the education system.  The center of student life is Abidjan.  Every teenager dreams of going abroad to study. </p><p>  According to the religious composition, more than 50% are Christians, although in general in the country almost 40% are Muslim.  Such a number of Muslims is due to the fact that a large proportion of them are illegal and foreign workers. </p><h2>  The heart of the capital </h2><p>  Now tourism is actively developing.  Golden beaches and exotic lands attract more travelers.  Unique is not only the nature of the country, but also its architecture.  Proponents of such art can look at national clay houses covered with palm leaves, or give preference to modern creations. </p>

Everyone who likes religious architecture knows where to go.  They are aware what kind of country this is, what capital.  C√¥te d'Ivoire has long called the construction of its business card.  It was built on the model of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.  Height - 158 meters.  The number of parishioners the church can accommodate is 11,000. They decorated it with marble from Italy and French colored glass.
