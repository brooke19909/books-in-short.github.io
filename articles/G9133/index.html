It is located in the southeast of Primorsky Krai.  It was named so thanks to the three freshwater lakes located on the coast.  Today, Primorsky Krai, Triozerye is one of the favorite vacation spots not only for residents of Primorye, but also for many tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Triozerye, Primorsky Krai on the map" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/468545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  Primorsky Krai (including Triozerye Bay) was once part of such states as Bohai, the Chinese Empire of Zin, the Russian Empire and the Far Eastern Republic. </p><p>  In the XIII century, numerous Mongol raids almost destroyed the Jurchen states, which led to the desolation of these territories.  It was only in the 19th century that the Russian Empire began the active development of the Far Eastern lands, which, in fact, led to the appearance of the Primorsky Region, and then the region of the same name. </p><p>  Relatively recently, Triozerie Bay, Primorsky Territory, has become open for tourists.  The map shows that earlier it was considered a border zone, as a result of which its visit was very limited.  There were never industrial facilities on this territory, therefore the nature of the bay remained almost pristine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Triozerye is famous for its sandy <span>beaches, the gentle</span> azure sea and the untouched, primitive nature.  The water in the three fresh lakes is much warmer than the sea.  Their bottom is silty and slippery, therefore, for the convenience of bathers, the banks are equipped with special bridges.  In addition, large crucians are found in the lakes - a dream for avid anglers!  According to experts, a vacation in Triozerye (Primorsky Territory) can be safely compared with a stay at the best resorts of the Black Sea. </p><p>  The nature here is very rich and diverse.  The slopes of the hills are overgrown with dense deciduous forest, in which a huge number of mushrooms and other wild plants.  Having planned your vacation in these places, you can fully enjoy all the natural resources. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that the Primorsky Territory (Triozerye in particular) also has many romantic and cozy places in the form of small bays with white sandy beaches and picturesque granite cliffs.  They will be appreciated by lovers of solitude and silence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Triozerye Bay, Primorsky Territory" class="if" height="483" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/468546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Business card Triozerya - Rock Cruiser </h2><p>  Triozerye Bay, Primorsky Krai, is proud of its main attraction - the rocky island Kreiser, located just a few kilometers from Cape Povorotny and considered the most southern island.  It is located on the very border between the open waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan and the Gulf of Peter the Great.  His profile is beautifully visible from Triozerye Bay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rock owes its name to Lieutenant Colonel V.M.  Babkin, who, being in those places in 1860 with his crew aboard the schooner Vostok, made her description.  It seemed to him that she was very similar to a cruiser, sailing. </p><p>  In fact, the rock practically does not resemble the shape of a ship.  It is asymmetric and consists of two semicircular hills of different heights. </p><p>  The rocky island Cruiser (Primorsky Krai, Triozerye) is small in size.  It has a length of not more than 300 m and a width of about 150 m, but the height of the cliff is more than 50 m. It has one single beach that is suitable for tourists.  It is located on the mainland side, where there is mainly woody vegetation: oaks, linden and barberry thickets.  On the west side it is covered with grass. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the island is small, there are scents of romance and adventure.  Nowhere is such a strong sensation, except on this amazing island: you are as if you are somewhere on the edge of the Earth ... Its virgin beauty and the majestic appearance of the rocks excite the imagination and call for travel and exciting adventures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Triozerye, Primorsky Krai" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/468547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rocks - "feathers" </h2><p>  Cape Laplace, Primorsky Krai, Triozerye - these are picturesque rocky ledges, called by tourists ‚Äúfeathers‚Äù, which really look like bird feathers that stood up from the wind. </p><p>  You can get to the cape, named after the French mathematician, along the coast, but there are too many obstacles along the way.  It is best to take the famous path through the taiga.  By the way, the rocks of Cape Laplace were chosen by birds of various species, for example, dives, gulls and eagles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsky Krai, Triozerye" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21144/468548.jpg" width="600"></div>
