    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  In June 1913, a very well-off couple Gelevich sanatorium "The Seagull" was founded in this wonderful city.  Evpatoria does not occupy beauties, so the place was chosen successfully.  True, then it was called differently - "Private Free Sanatorium them.  Gelel and Gulush Gelelovich. "  Since 1915, the complex began to visit artists of the Moscow Art Theater, including Vakhtangov and Stanislavsky.  In 1924, the sanatorium became a state health resort.  In honor of the artists of the Moscow Art Theater was named "The Seagull", as they often staged the play of the same name by A.P. Chekhov upon arrival at the sanatorium. </p><h2>  Versatility "Seagulls" </h2><p>  Initially, the health resort treated children with anemia, scrofula, rheumatism and tuberculosis, although in general the complex was bone tuberculosis.  In the 60s there was an outbreak of polio, and the leadership of the sanatorium decided to open two corresponding departments.  In 1965, all poliomyelitis and tuberculosis patients were taken out, and the sanatorium again became rheumatological.  And since 1970, the neuropsychiatric and nephrological departments were opened.  Nowadays there are many profiles in Seagull: cardiological, rheumatological, neuropsychiatric, gastroenterological, therapeutic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Evpatoria health resort gull" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/676326.jpg" width="400"></div>
