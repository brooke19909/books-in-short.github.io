  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Melting point of aluminum</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Aluminum is a light metal of white color with a silver tint, soft (you can bend it with your hands), can be processed well, and at the same time is quite durable.  It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity.  In its pure form, aluminum is almost never used, its use is practiced in the form of alloys with copper, carbon, tin, titanium, manganese and zinc.  In terms of electrical and thermal conductivity, aluminum is second only to silver and copper.  At the same time, impurities of vanadium, chromium and manganese reduce these indicators. </p><p>  Aluminum actively reacts with acids and alkalis, forming chlorides, sulfates, aluminates and other compounds.  In air, the metal is instantly coated with an oxide film, which protects it from subsequent oxidation.  The melting point of aluminum is in the range of 660.1 degrees, the metal in molten form has good fluidity.  This metal is characterized by high ductility, frost resistance, corrosion resistance when interacting with distilled and fresh water. </p><p>  Experts note that corrosion resistance depends on the purity of aluminum - the higher it is, the greater the resistance.  Corrosion can be caused by surface disturbances in the oxide film.  It has been proven that the melting point of aluminum rises as its purity increases.  Possessing excellent casting qualities, the metal during crystallization gives great shrinkage, this indicator is important in the manufacture of responsible casting from this metal. </p><p>  The melting point of aluminum can vary depending on the material used as an impurity.  The leaders in the production of aluminum in the world are Russia, USA, Canada, Australia.  The range of use of aluminum is quite large, our ancestors used aluminum in the form of compounds (alum) as an astringent in medicine, for tanning leathers, and for extending the shelf life of paints. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A sufficiently low melting point of aluminum made it possible to melt it in primitive conditions. </p><p>  <span>Alumina</span> (corundum) is found in nature, it is used as an abrasive material, and its varieties - sapphire and ruby ‚Äã‚Äã- belong to the category of precious stones.  Since in its pure form aluminum is unsuitable for technical use, it is most often used as raw material for the manufacture of various alloys.  The range of aluminum alloys is quite extensive, it is constantly updated (using different technologies). </p><p>  Currently, such alloys are used to make food cylinders, cans, kitchen utensils and various household items.  Important consumers of <span>aluminum alloys</span> are the automotive, electrical, instrument-making, chemical, defense, and metallurgical industries.  At what temperature aluminum is melted, it is taken into account in the manufacture of components for the defense, space and nuclear industries. </p><p>  One of the most common non-ferrous alloys is duralumin, it was developed in the last century by the German engineer A. Wilm.  The melting point of duralumin was approximately 650 degrees.  The essence of his invention lies in the fact that the aluminum-based alloy after heat treatment acquires greater strength and hardness.  Experts immediately took advantage of this and let him go for the needs of aeronautics.  The new alloy has become one of the main structural materials in the aircraft industry. </p><p>  Currently, the term duralumin means a large selection of aluminum alloys, characterized by high strength.  In addition to copper, modern alloys contain manganese, silicon, magnesium, etc., in strength they are close to low-carbon steel.  Today, these alloys are widely used in the aviation industry, in the manufacture of high-speed trains and in a number of other cases. </p>
