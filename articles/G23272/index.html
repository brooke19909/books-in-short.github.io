    <p>  Pavlovsky <span>Park (St. Petersburg).</span>  A brief history of its creation </p><p>  The spring of 1778 should be considered the date of foundation of the park.  According to the original plan, the country residence of the heir to the throne Pavel Petrovich, the future Russian Emperor Pavel the First, should have been located here.  A small regular park was to surround the residence.  In his arrangement, the spouse of the heir Maria Fedorovna took an active part.  The future Pavlovsky park owes its layout to its taste.  And the requests of the owners of Pavlovsky (this place is called in historical documents of that time) are focused on the best achievements in the field of landscape design that could be observed in eighteenth-century Europe.  All monarchist dynasties in Europe of that era paid close attention to landscape gardening art.  After the construction began, the creative imagination of the heir and his wife broke out, and Pavlovsky Park was significantly expanded.  Maria Fedorovna led the work of architects, and everything here developed in accordance with her will.  The heir to the throne preferred to live in Gatchina, so in 1788 he transferred Pavlovsky to the undivided possession of his wife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pavlovsky park St. Petersburg" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274888.jpg" width="499"></div>  After the murder of <span>Paul the First</span> and the accession to the throne of the new emperor, Maria Fedorovna moved to Pavlovsk permanently.  She put all her strength and energy into the development and arrangement of her palace and the park around it.  For this, the best European artists and architects were involved.  And the palace and park ensemble entered its heyday.  For a long time after the death of the Dowager Empress, Pavlovsky Park attracted attention and was the place where the court audience loved to spend time.  But gradually, interest in him began to fade, and Pavlovsk began to desolate.  The Soviet period of history turned out to be difficult for this aristocratic suburb of the capital.  After the revolution, museum funds underwent uncontrolled squandering.  But the park suffered the most during the blockade of Leningrad.  Pavlovsk was in the zone of German occupation.  Many values ‚Äã‚Äãwere plundered by the Nazis.  But Pavlovsky Park and the palace were restored in the postwar period.  Although the destruction was catastrophic. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pavlovsky park working hours" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/274889.jpg" width="499"></div>
