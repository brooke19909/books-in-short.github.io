And, of course, the All Inclusive program has been introduced at the Talassa Mahdia 4 * Hotel.  We gathered information for the article mainly from the reviews of tourists.  It should be said that this hotel was completely renovated in 2014.  And although he is still part of the Thalasso Hotels Tunisian chain, hotel management has changed for the better.  Now the hotel can rightfully add the word “water park” to its list of services.  Reviews of recent years about the hotel as a whole are very favorable.  Now consider the hotel in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia 4 Mahdia" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Tunisia is known as a country in which thalassotherapy was one of the first to practice.  Sea treatment involves a lot of procedures.  And many can be tried on yourself in the thalasso center of the Thalassa Mahdia 4 * hotel (Tunisia, Mahdia).  Mahdia as a city has been known since antiquity.  The ancient Romans called it Aphrodisium and even then considered it a resort.  Even in the harsh time of the Middle Ages, the opinion that the inhabitants of Mahdia was fully mastered is that they have fully mastered the "art of living."  In this city there are two things that are considered the best in all of Tunisia.  These are beaches and fish.  And so that tourism, which began to develop rapidly in Tunisia from the fifties of the last century, does not interfere with the indigenous fishing of local residents, it was decided to divide Mahdia into two parts.  The old, Medina, with its port, harbor, fish market and mosques, has retained its colorful identity.  Not far from it, three to four kilometers, stretched along the most beautiful beaches with snow-white sand, “Tourist Zone”.  The Talassa Mahdia Hotel described here is located in this area, and many guests praise the water park.  From the international <span>airport of Monastir</span> to the hotel go about an hour (forty-five kilometers). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Thalassa Mahdia 4 * (Mahdia) occupies a fairly vast territory of three hectares.  On it stands only one four-story building stretched along the coast by the letter “P”.  The rest of the territory is a garden, swimming pools.  Beautiful paths between manicured lawns lead to the sea.  The hotel is on the first line and has its own beach.  Reviews often mention that upon check-in tourists are offered to pay from twenty to fifty dollars for a sea view.  Do not splurge.  The hotel building is designed so that eighty percent of the rooms have direct or side sea views.  Tourists were satisfied with both the cleanliness of the territory and the location of the hotel regarding the resort infrastructure.  To all the entertainment resort area of ​​Mahdia walk about two hundred meters.  Nearby there are shops and cafes where you can smoke a hookah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia 4 Hotel Tunisia Mahdia" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512119.jpg" width="600"></div>

All of them belong to one category - the standard.  Do not be afraid to live on the upper floors - in a long curved letter “P” the building has two elevators.  The rooms differ only in area.  They can accommodate both single travelers and families of four.  Each room has air conditioning.  But it works for free only from June 15th to mid-September.  Almost every room (but not all) has a balcony or terrace.  As befits hotels of this level, the bathrooms include hygiene products and a hairdryer.  The bedroom has a TV (catches four Russian channels) and a telephone.  Reviews say that filling the minibar and using the safe is at an additional cost.  Clean the rooms - despite the tip - good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia 4 Mahdia Tunisia reviews" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where are guests fed? </h2><p>  In the hotel Thalassa Mahdia 4 * (Mahdia), the All Inclusive program is operating.  Main meals are buffet style in the main restaurant, which has a small outdoor terrace.  Breakfast time suits everyone: for whom it’s too early to go on an excursion, and who wants to sleep late.  But if it’s too early for ten in the morning for sleepyheads, they can have a late breakfast (with a smaller choice of dishes) until eleven.  And already at half past twelve dinner is being served.  Snacks and fast-food dishes are available on the restaurant's terrace for up to five hours.  Dinner runs from half past six to nine.  Anyone who is accustomed to eating up at bedtime can replenish his body with unnecessary calories from eleven in the evening until midnight.  The hotel has three a la carte restaurants.  Their visit is free of charge only once per stay and by appointment.  Free alcohol - only locally produced.  Drinks are served in the lobby bar, on the beach and by the pool.  There is also a "Moorish Cafe" on the territory, but the service there, as well as in the "Disco Bar", is paid. </p><h2>  How to feed guests in Thalassa Mahdia Aquapark 4 * (Tunisia, Mahdia) </h2><p>  The all inclusive program in Tunisia is somewhat different from the one to which a spoiled tourist in Turkey or Egypt is used.  Tables do not break from eating.  But unused products from breakfast then do not migrate for lunch and dinner.  There is plenty to choose from.  You can get enough of the usual European dishes, but you can also taste the delights of Tunisian cuisine.  Due to the fact that the food at the Talassa Mahdia Hotel is not round-the-clock, but according to the schedule, there are queues for the opening of the restaurant.  But if you come half an hour or forty minutes later, you can enjoy the same choice of dishes in the absence of crowds.  In Italian and Tunisian à la carte restaurants you can only have dinner.  They work from seven to ten in the evening.  There is another à la carte venue on the beach - Fisherman.  It specializes in fish dishes and barbecue.  This restaurant is open during the day - from half past one to three. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia Aquapark 4 (Mahdia)" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512128.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, pools, water park </h2><p>  Thalassa Mahdia Aquapark 4 * (Mahdia) - hotel of the first line.  The flat terrain provides a smooth descent to the sea.  The beach at the hotel is private, and, therefore, sunbeds and umbrellas are free for guests.  Towels are subject to a deposit.  Security does not let outsiders only into the hotel, and merchants can walk along the beach.  But they, as the reviews claim, are not annoying.  Tourists described the beach as ideal.  No stones, dangerous currents, burning jellyfish.  The sand is white and soft, the sea is warm.  Sunset at sea is suitable for swimming babies.  Five freshwater pools are free to use.  Of these, two adults in the open air and one indoors, with heating, but it works only in bad weather conditions.  At one pool there is an aquapark, which consists of several adult slides.  For children there are two swimming tanks.  One of them has a slide, but, according to reviews, it’s completely crumby for skiing (2-3 years).  The thalasso center has a chic indoor saltwater pool.  But it is available only for a fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia Aquapark 4 (Tunisia Mahdia)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512135.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services and Facilities </h2><p>  The thalasso-center “Elissa” at the Thalassa Mahdia 4 * hotel (Mahdia) won the most rave reviews.  Procedures and relaxation there are worth the money spent.  From morning until evening, the hotel guests are entertained by animators.  For children from four to fourteen years old, there is a mini-club consisting of two age groups.  Wireless internet is a paid service.  The hotel has an arcade with shops, you can exchange currency.  Welcome cocktail and compliments for birthday or newlyweds are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thalassa Mahdia 4: reviews and prices tunisia Mahdia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512102.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say </h2><p>  Consider another aspect of the description of the hotel Thalassa Mahdia 4 * - reviews and prices.  Tunisia (Mahdia in particular) is a resort more expensive than Egypt.  A weekly tour to the hotel we are describing costs two people forty-five thousand rubles (it includes flight, transfer, accommodation and meals on an all-inclusive basis).  But tourists who visited the hotel believe that the rest was worth the money.  The Thalassa Mahdia 4 * hotel (Mahdia, <span>Tunisia) is</span> described as very good, with clean rooms, kind friendly staff, a busy water park and spacious pools.  The beach and the sea are beyond praise.  The location of the hotel was also very popular with tourists.  You can easily reach the Medina and join the Moorish culture.  Food tourists described as good.  To avoid queues, you do not need to storm the restaurant to its opening. </p>
