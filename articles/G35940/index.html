The fact that it saves the events of our lives and allows us to recall them from time to time and relive the joyful moments.  You can forget even very vivid emotions, but if they are captured in a photo, looking at it, you seem to come back again in a happy time for you. </p><p>  And to look at beautiful photographs is one of the most pleasant pleasures.  Especially if these are the shots on which you turned out very well.  But, you must admit, among all the variety of images available in your archive, successful ones can be counted on the fingers. </p>

Therefore, quite often you can hear the following question: ‚ÄúHow to get good at photographs?‚Äù Many people are surprised and do not understand: how is this so, it seems that a person is beautiful and charming in life, and looks different from himself in the photo ... So, let's let's talk about what needs to be done (or what, on the contrary, is not necessary to do), so as not to spoil your own portrait?

    <h2>  Reasons for a failed photo </h2><p>  Remember how often from friends or acquaintances you have heard the phrase: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get in the photographs ...‚Äù.  The following is a series of comments on what they did, how they were photographed, but ... the result remains unchanged.  Of course, you can shift all the blame on the lack of photogenicity.  But, as it turned out, this is out of the question.  Any professional photographer will answer you that there are no ugly people.  And bad pictures are obtained either because the abilities of the ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù leave much to be desired, or because the subject does not understand very well what is required of him, but there is no one to explain. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Well, we will take this responsibility upon ourselves and try to give an intelligible answer to a question that interests, if not all, then very, very many: "How beautiful is it to get in photographs?" </p><h2>  Rules for great photography </h2><p>  One of the first conditions that are mandatory for execution is the presence of an aesthetic appearance.  It may seem strange to someone, but it really is.  Get a good photo is much easier if your appearance is in perfect order.  And the face, and hair, and clothes. </p>

But here there are a number of nuances.  I would like to note that by naturalness is not meant the absence of makeup and <span>home clothes.</span>  Rather, it is about looking, posture, facial expressions, gestures.  You do not need to specifically open your eyes wider if they are not big enough or to pout your lips, trying to express your sexuality.  All these tricks will look unnatural, which means stupid and ridiculous.  Learn from children - this is who is the model for shooting.  Children never pretend, and that is why almost all the kids are great at photographs.

    <h2>  Poses for a good photo. </h2><p>  How good is it in photos?  In addition to the above rules, you should very carefully monitor the position of the body during the photo shoot.  Pay special attention to your posture, since it is from it that a positive result will depend.  It goes without saying that not everyone can always maintain the position of a stretched string, but this is not required.  Just during the shooting, do not forget to straighten as much as possible and straighten your shoulders.  Remember: even when the back is slightly bent, the photo looks like a wheel.  Direct posture is the key to beauty and femininity.  But do not forget that puzzled by the alignment of the spine, you can <span>not pay attention</span> to the stomach and other parts of the body.  Remember the actress of the famous film ‚ÄúOffice Romance‚Äù, and how she taught the main character to walk: ‚ÄúEverything in yourself!‚Äù  We can say that this rule applies to shooting.  Performing it, you will not be disappointed to see the finished photo. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

No matter how you take pictures, standing or sitting, do not arrange them wide.  It is better if your knees are as closed as possible, and your feet will look in one direction.  You think this is not so important?  In vain!  Even such seemingly little things have a negative effect.

    <p>  And one more important point.  All your limbs (both arms and legs) should be present in the whole photo.  Do not try to hide them in other parts of the body.  In the picture, it looks like you are a disabled person.  Agree that there is nothing good in this. </p><p>  Watch the position of your head and neck.  Especially in those moments when you are in a sitting position.  Thinking, you can lower your head too low, and as a result you get a photo with no neck - the head and shoulders right away.  Not very pretty. </p><p>  All of the above rules are general in nature, but they will also help you understand how beautiful it is to turn out on photos.  In order to find your winning poses, it is recommended to pre-train in front of the mirror.  It may take you more than one hour, but believe me, it's worth it! </p><h2>  Clothing for shooting </h2><p>  The general recommendations that determine the requirements for clothing for shooting include the following: the absence of too loose, knitted, multi-colored and lapid things, a turtleneck and other options with a high collar.  And now in more detail about how good it is to get in photographs, what clothes to wear. </p><p>  So, tights.  It is better if they are very thin and natural in color.  In no case do not use the option with Lurex. </p><p>  Sportswear also looks pretty ridiculous, if, of course, this is not some kind of exercise related to physical education. </p>

And if it is also with the neckline, then this is generally a fairy tale!  If your wardrobe has a classic-style dress and exquisite jewelry in your casket, consider that the question ‚Äúhow to get beautiful in a photograph‚Äù is half solved.

    <p>  As for the color scheme of clothes, it is important here not to merge with the background.  Pictures in nature (in summer) imply the ability to wear things of various shades, with the exception of green. </p><p>  Shoes must be in heels.  Well, let the shoes not be visible in the photo, but they give your appearance grace and elegance.  Try taking pictures at low speed, and then - in heeled sandals ... Do you feel the difference?  That's it! </p><p>  Another significant element is accessories.  They can be any, but do not overdo it.  A beautiful hat, beads in tone, gloves always look very good on photographs.  Or, for example, a ripe bright fruit (apple, peach, and so on) in your hands will also only benefit.  Make sure that this detail matches the general theme and direction of the photo. </p><p>  When choosing clothes for shooting and asking the question: ‚ÄúHow do you get beautiful in a photograph?‚Äù, Adhere to the golden rule: the main thing is that the suit is sitting!  Buntings, formed as a result of things not worn in size, can even turn an Thumbelina into a thick toad. </p><h2>  Professional shooting.  How to prepare? </h2><p>  If you decide to spend money on professional photographs, then it is advisable to carefully prepare yourself so that you don‚Äôt worry about throwing away money and don‚Äôt cry to your friends in a waistcoat: they say that I‚Äôm not good at photographs ... A professional photographer can give you a number of useful tips about , what to pay special attention to upcoming shooting.  And if you follow them, your pictures will be successful and will please you.  Let's look at some of the recommendations.  After all, the question of how to get better in photographs worries so many women. </p><h2>  Makeup </h2>

Best of all, if you use the services of a make-up artist - he knows exactly how to make the face of a photo model the most attractive.  But if you decide to cope on your own, at home, then do not forget that makeup for a professional photo shoot is significantly different from everyday make-up.  Here you can apply all the cosmetics you have in a much larger volume.  For example, carefully tone the skin with a foundation, use false eyelashes, do not save on blush.  No, no one calls to make an artificial mask out of a face and apply tons of cosmetics, God forbid!  Just add brightness.

    <p>  Do not think, looking at yourself in the mirror that you look like a monster, in the photo your war paint will look much more natural.  But if, on the contrary, you don‚Äôt take advantage of our advice and go for professional photography with a little make-up or no makeup at all, relying on natural beauty, it is not known what kind of evil joke the camera and light will play with you.  You can‚Äôt only rely on the professionalism of the photographer and the processing of images on a computer; it‚Äôs better to make every effort to achieve a positive result.  Doubt your strength?  In principle, right.  The art of applying makeup has been studied for years.  Then go ahead to the makeup artist! </p><h2>  Hair </h2><p>  Hairstyles better in advance.  A few days before the photo shoot, try to do exactly the styling with which you plan to shoot.  Suddenly, the finished result will not suit you very much?  You should not delve into the creation of masterpieces on your head, using all kinds of hairpins, ribbons, jewelry and so on.  The best option would be loose hair.  Curly, slightly wavy, straight - not so important, the main thing is that they are clean and look natural.  It is worth paying attention to their condition.  For example, damaged hair with split ends or unpainted roots, of course, are not suitable for a professional photo shoot.  Yes, and in ordinary pictures do not look very ... </p><h2>  Photographer Recommendations </h2><p>  The photographer performs the same role as the doctor in the clinic.  So, there can be no question of being embarrassed by him or arguing with him.  Do not be embarrassed, behave naturally, listen to his advice, do not hide emotions - all this will allow to achieve mutual understanding and get beautiful photos as a result. </p><p>  Believe me, all those feelings that you will give access to photo shoots will bring the desired result.  Even if you made a mistake with the choice of a wardrobe, or the photographer has a naughty light or a camera, you still get good.  Because sincere emotions - laughter, surprise, joy - always enliven the image.  That is why there are no bad children's photos.  After all, the child does not think about how he should look in the photo, and behaves as in ordinary life - he smiles, gets angry, gets angry, laughs.  As a result, we have great pictures and great memories. </p><p>  And yet: in no case do not argue with the photographer, because he knows better how you look in the photo, it is he who looks into the lens, not you.  In the event that you know for sure that the profile picture is not for you, just ask not to take you in this perspective.  It's your right.  You didn‚Äôt conclude a contract, right?  Or voice other problems that concern you, but do it in advance, and not during the photo shoot. </p>

    <h2>  Warm up before shooting </h2><p>  It‚Äôs good if you have time to warm up a bit before taking a picture.  This will help you better feel your body during the photo shoot.  There is no need to perform any special difficult exercises.  Just move your head from side to side, raise and lower your arms, legs and so on.  You can greatly strain the whole body, and then sharply relax.  Such an exercise will also help get rid of moral stress. </p><p>  How good is it in photos?  This question includes quite a few rules, now you know some of them and, following them, you will surely achieve a good result. </p><h2>  Dark photos </h2><p>  And now about why dark photos are obtained with self-shooting.  Most often, the reason is either using the camera without a flash or low light sensitivity. </p>
