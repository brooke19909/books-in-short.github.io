In 80 <span>percent they simply</span> throw out, sometimes they spread cardboard in stores under their feet so that they do not spread the dirt, and they also make bird feeders.  However, this is not all that can be done out of the boxes, as we will discuss in more detail in the article. </p><h2>  What can be the use of boxes in the development of children? </h2><p>  In educational institutions, the task of psychologists and teachers is to contribute to the development of children's imagination.  The simplest test to identify the level of imagination is to give the child a simple subject and task: ‚ÄúWhat can be done with it?  Name as many options as possible. ‚Äù </p><p>  And the psychologist begins this exercise with a matchbox.  The preschooler first verbally explains the options for creating new objects from it, and then in practice tries to translate his ideas.  Daily exercises develop thinking, imagination, speech, fantasy, as the psychologist achieves the non-standard use of ordinary objects. </p><p>  For example, crafts: box houses, a tractor, a carriage, a truck, a booth, a closet, a TV are standard templates, and a cockerel, a dog, a rocket, a well, a built-in kitchen - these answer options speak of <span>imaginative thinking.</span>  Volumetric and complex crafts contribute to the development of spatial and abstract thinking, artistic and aesthetic taste. </p><h2>  Crafts from large boxes </h2><p>  Do not throw the boxes out from under the refrigerator, TV and other large equipment, and together with the child give them a second life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be made out of boxes" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/348646.jpg" width="277"></div>

Build several floors with different services: a car dealership, a garage, a dining room, with cable cars and bridges leading to the floors. </li><li>  Kitchen for daughters.  Make a built-in gas stove, washbasin, refrigerator, table for a little helper.  Do not forget to make dishes and food from improvised materials. </li><li>  DIY house out of the box <span>for a child.</span>  <span>Children</span> love to build their homes, piling up chairs, tables and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãrags.  Help them build their house out of cardboard, carving windows, a door, making a roof.  And they can paint and paste the ‚Äúwallpaper‚Äù themselves. </li><li>  Cabinet for toys.  From a few boxes, create a whole <span>chest of drawers for toys.</span>  The child will immediately begin to put things in their houses, especially if you do them according to a children's plan. </li><li>  Transport.  From the boxes you can create whole masterpieces: a bus, a trolley bus, a tram, a steam locomotive, a truck - at least for toys, at least for the child himself. </li></ul><h2>  What can be made of medium-sized boxes? </h2><ul><li>  Gift wrapping.  The easiest option is to decorate shoe boxes with scrapbooking paper and decorate with bows. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts of boxes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/348639.jpg?1394111950584" width="500"></div></li><li>  Transport for dolls.  Using cardboard and bottle caps, you can build a variety of cars and trucks. </li><li>  TV and mini-theater.  With the help of boxes and applications of colored paper, you can play various tales and cartoons.  If you do not know how to draw, it is enough to stick pictures from magazines and coloring books on a solid foundation. </li><li>  <span>Dollhouse houses.</span>  You can build a tall building, where each box defines a room, or make a flat dwelling for small toys from one. </li><li>  Furniture for games.  Beds, dressers, wardrobes, sideboards, sofas, armchairs, tables, chairs and other attributes of everyday life can be made with your own hands from ordinary things. </li><li>  Photo frames.  The bottom of candy boxes can be used as a photo frame for photographs, drawings or crafts of a child.  At the same time, it can be decorated on the outside with various decorative trifles and paints.  Such "paintings" perfectly decorate the nursery. </li><li>  Unusual gifts.  A simple gift for mom or grandmother: paint and paste over the bottom of the candy box with flowers, butterflies-applications.  Imagine how dear the little man will be delighted, having received a piece of summer in the winter evening! </li></ul><h2>  Crafts from small boxes </h2><p>  With large objects, everything is clear, but what can be done from boxes of juice, milk, matches and other little things?  All the same: cars, ships, houses, cribs, furniture, TV, chest of drawers.  Can be used for crafts with various applications and improvised material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself house out of the box" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/348641.jpg?1394112002102" width="400"></div>

For example, cup holders for office supplies.  If you take several boxes of different sizes, decorate them with paper or tie them with threads, connect them in a single line, you will get different containers for brushes, pens, pencils and even erasers. </p><p>  Caskets for thread and jewelry can also be made from small boxes.  Create vases and make paper roses and flowers.  You can make animals and decorate them.  In any case, children offer a lot of ideas for making crafts from boxes.  Organizers for needlewomen are especially relevant, just decorate the boxes, glue them together and get small compartments for beads, floss and other accessories. </p><h2>  A simple example of how to make a dollhouse out of a box </h2><p>  The house can be made in vertical and horizontal position.  A tall building is created from several boxes, where each stands for a room.  In fact, we are trying to recreate a house like Barbie‚Äôs.  To do this, glue each wall with ‚Äúwallpaper‚Äù - decorative paper or fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a house out of the box" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/348642.jpg?1394112037447" width="357"></div>

    <p>  Do not glue the boxes between each other so that you can conveniently install furniture.  Now equip each room by gluing tables, chairs, beds, curtains, etc.  Next, glue the ‚Äúrooms‚Äù together and build a roof.  It turns out that on one side a view of all the rooms opens up. </p><p>  How to make a house out of the box in a complicated version?  You can make stairs to all rooms and conduct electricity.  And also create a wall with doors and windows, which opens for games. </p><p>  For miniature dolls, the house can be made from one box.  Just divide its bottom with cardboard walls with doors and windows that define the rooms.  Next, just stick the furniture.  The convenience of such "desktop" houses is that they covered them with a lid and removed before the next game. </p><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of ideas for joint creativity with a child at minimal cost, and what can be done from the boxes - the children will tell you themselves! </p>
