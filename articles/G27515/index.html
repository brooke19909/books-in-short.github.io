At that time, the segment represented a rather narrow circle of manufacturers, the list of which included the Chinese company DOD.  Despite belonging to the budget category, the models of this brand were in high demand - the devices were valued for good quality and overall good functionality.  Largely due to these advantages, the company manages to withstand the competition today, when the market for automotive accessories is oversaturated with offers for different groups of consumers.  Confirms the high demand for Chinese products DVR DOD LS460W.  The review of the model presented below will allow you to form an opinion about the qualities of the device and the advantages over competitors. </p><h2>  Instrument Overview </h2>

    <p>  The car assistant is positioned as the flagship model in the DOD line, which is confirmed by the price of 13-14 thousand rubles, and a good internal filling even against the background of modern representatives of the segment.  It is enough to note the supply of the device with Sony optical components, due to which a decent image quality is ensured.  Also, the <span>DOD</span> LS460W car <span>DVR</span> is equipped with <span>a GPS module</span> that extends the functionality of the device.  However, such additions today are unlikely to surprise a sophisticated car owner.  The rest of the model is a typical representative of the highest level in the class of premium registrars.  For such a price you can find models from more famous brands, but it is better to refuse prejudices about their technological superiority.  By its example, DOD breaks the stereotype of low-quality Chinese products and adequately holds its position even in the high price category.  Of course, its products are not without flaws, but they are also present in devices from first-tier brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  DVR Package Contents </h2><p>  Despite belonging to the premium class, the model does not indulge in refinements in the kit.  A car enthusiast receives a DOD LS460W with a set of standard accessories, including the following: </p><ul><li>  <span>Power adapter.</span> </li><li>  Fixture for fixing to the panel on a <span>double-sided tape.</span> </li><li>  Mounting device with suction cup on the windshield. </li><li>  AV cable. </li><li>  Mini-USB cable </li><li>  A disk with software. </li><li>  Instruction </li></ul><p>  I must say that the Chinese manufacturer responsibly approached the implementation of auxiliary devices.  Unfortunately, today many companies save not only on accessories, but also try to use cheap materials in the manufacture of required components.  In the case of DOD, the kit, although modest for its price, but its every element is executed flawlessly - this applies to the cords, and to the clips with a charger. </p><h2>  Device specifications </h2>

    <p>  It is possible to judge the possibilities for the registrar to perform its immediate functions only after familiarizing yourself with the indicators of technical filling.  Immediately it is worth noting the rather high potential of optics, supported by the functionality of the DOD LS460W.  An overview of the characteristics of the model is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The dimensions of the device are 112 mm in height, 60 mm in width and 37 mm in thickness. </li><li>  Weight - 100 g. </li><li>  Matrix - Sony Exmor. </li><li>  The number of lenses is 1. </li><li>  Lens optics - represented by a 6-layer glass lens. </li><li>  Screen - 2.7 inch LCD. </li><li>  Memory capacity - the use of micro-SDHC up to 32 GB is provided. </li><li>  Connectors - mini-USB, AV-out, HDMI. </li><li>  Battery - 240 mAh cell. </li><li>  The length of the power cable is 395 cm. </li><li>  Operating temperatures range from ‚àí25 to +70 ¬∞ C. </li><li>  An additional option is a motion sensor, microphone, G-sensor, backlight, built-in GPS receiver. </li></ul><p>  The manufacturer sought to give the recorder wide functionality that will be implemented on the basis of high-quality Sony Exmor optics.  Such decisions are not often found among companies belonging to the middle class.  Usually nominally technological ‚Äúchips‚Äù are used, but the practice of operation proves the inefficiency of their work on the platform of cheap equipment.  In this case, both the hardware and the declared optional organically complement each other. </p><h2>  Control </h2>

    <p>  In the case of controls, the opposite approach is observed.  The developers did not turn to the fashionable technology of touch screens and implemented a classic push-button configuration.  Blocks with keys frame the display in a circle, and on the right side there is a hole for resetting.  The upper part of the DOD LS460W device contains two buttons: the first is for power management, and with the help of the second the user can turn recording on and off.  Also on the sides are the main controls for the menu, recording modes, microphone, etc. As for the connectors, they are conveniently located and do not cause problems when connected.  The menu is made according to the classical scheme and consists of several sections with settings modes.  For example, the recorder mode is provided with two sections: one allows you to configure video, sound and GPS indicators, and the second is designed to control the main operating parameters of the device.  The button scheme interacts optimally with the menu and is easily mastered. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Video quality </h2><p>  In daylight, materials with a good ‚Äúpicture‚Äù are obtained.  But in cloudy weather, moving objects become blurred, and even large text is hardly distinguished.  However, under optimal conditions, the registrar provides sufficient detail, although, according to some users, there is not enough contrast.  One of the main tests that determine the quality of the work of DVRs is to determine the number of the car by the freeze frame.  With this standard, the DOD LS460W GPS copes with dignity, allowing you to distinguish between signs on both standing and moving cars at a distance of one and a half hulls.  The rooms are practically unlit, although car headlights and headlights can cause some problems.  Due to obvious factors, night shooting is getting worse, but the device still provides high detail, allowing you to see small elements. </p><h2>  GPS functions </h2>

    <p>  This module today is received even by representatives of the initial segment.  Another thing is that it is not its presence in itself that matters, but the capabilities provided by the receiver.  In the case of the "Chinese", the owner gets a fairly wide range of functions.  First of all, it is a record of speed and coordinates.  That is, the video stream is recorded synchronously with the movement of the car on the map and indicating the labels.  Along with this, the speed mode and direction are displayed on the DOD LS460W screen with large icons on a dark background.  Any speed adjustments are also displayed when synchronizing with the speedometer.  A speed controller is also provided.  If you specify the normative range, then going beyond it will be accompanied by the corresponding signal from the registrar.  Similar functions are present in many navigation modules, but in this case GPS has a high data processing speed - accordingly, the recorded information does not lag during braking or acceleration. </p><h2>  Communication features </h2>

    <p>  The device can be connected to a TV and computer.  For these purposes, the corresponding connectors are provided in the DOD LS460W.  The user manual, for example, notes that connecting the model to a computer via a USB-mini-USB scheme will be accompanied by automatic device detection.  The recorder is connected to the TV via the HDMI port, and an image corresponding to the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù on the device itself will appear on the screen.  After that, the owner can use the entire list of options of the device with the exception of the possibility of video recording. </p><h2>  Device mount </h2><p>  The device is fixed using special brackets, and power is supplied through a separate mini-USB cable.  In this case, the kit provides two brackets.  The standard fixture has a vacuum suction cup, and a more advanced version of the latch is a panel for mounting on <span>double-sided tape.</span>  Both schemes provide for the adjustment of the position of the device through a special hinge.  Further, the optimal position is insured with a nut.  This is not to say that the DOD LS460W GPS DVR is not durable and reliable in fixed form, but it is worth noting the variety of the installation configurations themselves.  For example, the device can be placed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mirror or fixed to the glass area with silk screen printing.  The installation process itself can be performed with one hand, but, again, the quality of the installation is questionable. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback about the registrar </h2><p>  The model has many positive properties, and, most importantly, most of them are attributed by the owners to the direct function of the DVR.  In terms of quality of recording, opinions are mostly positive.  It also noted excellent detail, and ample video settings in the DOD LS460W GPS.  Reviews about recording in bad weather and at night are, of course, less enthusiastic.  However, if you compare with the performance of other models of the same segment, you can come to terms with slight distortions.  The device is also praised for the convenience of mounting with two brackets to choose from, for the flexibility in connecting to other devices and for the compact size. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There is little criticism of this model, but it is important to consider that the device is premium, so the high requirements are justified.  For example, owners note a maximum capacity of 32 GB, while flagship models from other manufacturers are increasingly receiving 64 GB.  The absence of a CPL filter is also noted, which could improve the quality of the video material provided by the DOD LS460W GPS DVR.  Reviews almost do not criticize the characteristics of finished recordings made in the daytime, but in poor light conditions there are certain interference. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  DOD is not a newcomer to the DVR market, and its wealth of experience today allows us to offer devices that match the functionality of advanced models from competitors.  Of course, the attractive filling of the DOD LS460W assistant fully corresponds to a decent price tag, but this model also has serious advantages.  First of all, this is the use of high-quality modern matrices, which are rarely used even in the device segment for 13-14 thousand rubles.  Next, you can highlight the well-disclosed potential of the GPS module.  The receiver not only performs the tasks required for the flagship dashcam level, but also does it without delay and at the optimum speed. </p>
