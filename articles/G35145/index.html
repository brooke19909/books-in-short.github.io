The issue was aired under the title “Man’s Fist”.  At the time of the filming of the program, Irina was 21 years old, the last 1.5 of whom she was in a coma.  The girl’s mother Svetlana explained that her daughter’s current condition is a result of the beatings that her legal husband inflicted on her.  This fact is proved in court, and Konstantin is serving a well-deserved punishment in a correctional institution.  An appeal to television is Svetlana’s last hope.  She is forced to look after her daughter alone, there are not enough funds, her strength is running out.  Irina Datsko has been in a terrible state for a year and a half, her attending doctors ascertained the death of the brain.

Irina was born and raised in the village of Selenduma of the Buryat Republic.  Early enough, the girl married Konstantin, an ordinary guy who lived in the neighborhood.  In the marriage, the couple had a daughter, Julia.  According to relatives of Irina, family squabbles ending in assault in this family always happened.  Several times, relatives even tried to persuade the girl to divorce her tyrant husband.  However, Irina did everything possible to smooth out all conflict situations and tried to save her family.  Selenduma is a small village, a traditional Russian outback.  There is practically no work and prospects here, all young people are leaving for the nearest large cities.  Irina Datsko also went to work in Ulan-Uda, leaving her young daughter with her father and grandmothers.  The girl arrived in her native village on the birthday of Julia.  In the evening after the holiday, she went to meet with a friend in a local cafe.  When Irina returned home, her husband met her with another scandal on the basis of jealousy.  In the course of clarifying the relationship, Konstantin began to beat his wife.  As investigators later established, Irina received multiple blows to the head, after which her husband threw her to the floor and began to kick her.

The man was convicted of grievous bodily harm, the court decided to convict and sentenced him to imprisonment in a general correctional facility for 6 years.  Konstantin himself is not satisfied with the verdict.  He dreams of freeing himself as soon as possible, because he still has a young daughter, in the education of which he plans to actively participate.  The “Let them talk” program has also consecrated in detail the life of Irina herself and her loved ones.  Her mother takes care of the injured girl.  Despite the serious condition, doctors refuse to take Irina to the hospital.  The girl looks terrible, she is very exhausted, on her body numerous extensive bedsores.  Doctors have not given favorable forecasts for a long time and have recognized the patient’s current state as vegetative.  According to relatives, Irina reacts to what is happening around, and when her daughter visits, she even cries and tries to make sounds.

Immediately after the broadcast went to the account of the mother of the crippled girl, funds for treatment began to arrive.  Doctors who offered their help on a non-profit basis also responded.  Almost immediately after the scandalous television broadcast, Irina Dacko was admitted to the Semashko Republican Clinical Hospital.  In this institution, a survey was conducted and treatment was prescribed.  But, despite all the efforts made by the doctors, the patient died on June 17.  Experts say that they did everything possible, but the girl was initially in too bad shape.  Many of our compatriots were very upset by the news that Irina Dacko had died.  The girl’s funeral was held in her native village, almost all local residents came to them.  Today this story is no longer discussed even in the Selendum, but it must not be forgotten.  Indeed, many of our compatriots personally face domestic violence every day ...
