    <p>  The whole history of education and training dates back to the beginning of the development of civilization on our planet.  In almost all ancient civilizations, the beginning of learning and the emergence of schools gave rise to writing.  The formation of the education system can be considered by the example of the history of the school in ancient Egypt.  Even in the period of the Old Kingdom, the <span>first schools</span> began to appear at the palace of the pharaoh <span>.</span>  They were created for the training of builders, architects, doctors and officials, they took training very seriously and, as a rule, ordinary people did not get there. </p><p>  With the further development of the state, the history of the emergence of schools was continued, schools appeared at the temples.  They taught writing here, this profession was in great demand at that time.  Later, schools appeared at large state institutions, where they mainly trained boys aged 7 to 16 years.  The main subjects for training were literacy, writing and numeracy.  For writing, students used a thin reed stick and black paint, and a new line began with red paint.  From here comes the name "red line".  The children performed their training in a letter on polished limestone plates, since writing on papyrus was too expensive.  The plates were made split into a ruler or into a cage, depending on the subject of instruction.  The history of the school has so far preserved notebooks in a ruler and in a cage. </p><p>  If the student already perfectly mastered writing skills, then he was allowed to write on a small scroll of papyrus.  Texts were specially selected for writing, the content of which helped the further training of future specialists (these were instructions, hymns and religious texts).  The history of the development of the school in ancient Egypt suggests that in those days much attention was paid to the creation of libraries, ancient texts were collected and stored in them.  During <span>archaeological excavations</span> , notebooks were found with solutions to various practical problems, for example, calculating the number of workers for construction work, determining the required area of ‚Äã‚Äãcrops, and others.  Future officials in Egypt were given assignments to memorize religious texts, and practical sciences were intensively studied at higher <span>levels of education</span> . </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the school in Egypt suggests that, in addition to basic subjects, students were engaged in swimming, gymnastic exercises, and learned good manners.  Higher nobility gave their children to military schools.  Pupils in temple schools studied astronomy and medicine, but particular attention was paid to religious education.  A similar path of development, as the history of the emergence of schools shows, has been trained in other ancient civilizations.  There are many facts that testify to classes with students in the Babylonian civilization, in ancient India and China, as well as in the Mayan civilization and the Aztecs. </p><p>  The history of the school continued in ancient Rome and Greece.  Then the school did not resemble modern at all.  Only one student came to the teacher, and there were no school buildings.  Subsequently, Greek philosophers and speakers began to take several students to study in order to give them lectures on various clever things.  By the way, the word "school" is translated from Greek as "leisure".  Interesting, isn't it?  The well-known <span>philosopher Plato</span> created his own small school, which he called the Academy.  So over time the history of the school passed and it finally became the way we know it now.  In ancient Russia, the word "school" began to be used since the XIV century, although already in the XI century there was a school at the palace of Prince Vladimir in Kiev, and in 1030 <span>Yaroslav the Wise</span> founded a school in Novgorod.  The system of education included the antique <span>seven free arts:</span> three basic (grammar, dialectics and rhetoric) and auxiliary (arithmetic and geometry, astronomy and music).  First, the teaching was conducted by the Byzantine, and then by domestic scientists. </p>
