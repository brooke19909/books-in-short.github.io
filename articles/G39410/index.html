The diet is not suitable for people suffering from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.  Of the fruits, only watermelon and melon. </li><li>  The rooms are very dirty, they are not cleaned at all on the balconies.  Plumbing in the bathroom is old and works poorly. </li><li>  Ants may appear in the rooms, which bite painfully.  Or huge cockroaches. </li><li>  Do not give out toiletries even after request and extra tips. </li><li>  The hotel staff dilutes alcohol, and also asks for money for any services, including free ones. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel leaves a double impression.  Soviva Resort 4 * description has a good, but in practice, after leisure, tourists leave reviews advising never to choose this hotel.  Of course, it is hardly suitable for a high-quality and well-paid vacation.  If you have large means, it is better to choose another hotel.  But the tourist complex is well suited for a budget holiday.  Inexpensive rooms combined with a rich entertainment program, a large swimming pool and a clear sea will give tourists a comfortable stay at an affordable price. </p>
