  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frisian Islands: description, weather conditions, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Frisian Islands are a fairly large archipelago located in the North Sea, off the coast of Norway.  A chain of islands of various sizes stretches along the territory of three European states.  Therefore, the islands of the archipelago are not always evenly divided between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. </p><p>  Most of the islands are inhabited, with good infrastructure and a lot of tourist attractions.  However, there are small islands of land in the chain on which there are no permanent settlements of people.  Some of them are reserves, others, due to their natural features, are completely unsuitable for life. </p><h2>  Beaches in the north of the Netherlands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.holland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Texel houses" class="if uuid-3115474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3115474.jpg"></div><p>  A chain of small West Frisian islands stretches in an arc along the coast of the Netherlands and separates the North from the Wadden Sea.  The five largest islands are inhabited and very well maintained, they have hotels and shops.  Each island has its own anthem, flag and status of a separate community.  And this despite the fact that only a little more than 23 thousand people live in the West Frisian Islands. </p><p>  A few centuries ago, the islands of Texel and Vliland were a single island.  Then the water level rose, and the strait divided them.  Now, between two pieces of land goes steam, which has to maneuver between the shallows in shallow water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tesel Island is the most well-groomed in this part of the archipelago.  Many old houses, picturesque streets and picturesque landscapes. </p><p>  But Vliland travelers dubbed "Northern Sahara."  Almost the entire island consists of sand dunes that move around the territory under the influence of frequent winds. </p><p>  The inhabitants of this Frisian island are trying to stop the movement of the dunes, growing coniferous and deciduous forests.  They are so unwilling to give their land to the sea that they have learned to turn sands into flowering meadows and fields.  Experienced tourists recommend coming to Vlland in April, when tulip fields bloom all over the island. </p><h2>  Untouched nature and national parks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hihostels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sand Dunes in the Frisian Islands" class="if uuid-3115476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3115476.jpg"></div><p>  When deciding to relax in the Frisian Islands, you need to tune in to a leisurely union with almost untouched nature.  Many islets are protected by UNESCO as unique natural ecosystems, the familiar life of which is not disturbed by civilization.  For example, the island of Richelle is considered a kind of "maternity home for seals", during the winter about 300 babies are born on it. </p><p>  A trip to the islands needs to be agreed in advance, since these are protected areas, but the impressions of such a visit will be enough for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is good to travel around the territory on bicycles, slowly exploring the surroundings.  Only when approaching the famous heathlands, you need to be careful, to drive on two wheels on them will not work. </p><p>  Despite the fact that in June and July it is quite warm and you can swim in the sea, do not forget about warm clothes and an umbrella.  The weather on the Frisian Islands is very unpredictable, and rainfall can begin at any time. </p><h2>  Places where cars do not drive </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Spiekeroog Island" class="if uuid-3115477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3115477.jpg"></div><p>  The group of East Frisian islands, territorially related to Germany, consists of seven inhabited islands and approximately five untouched.  It is here that fans of a relaxing outdoor recreation, lovers of eco-tourism and silence strive to get here. </p><p>  In addition to the beautiful landscapes, people are attracted by the fact that car traffic is prohibited on the islands.  All movements are carried out on ferries, which constantly run near the coast. </p><p>  Life in this part of the Frisian Islands flows slowly and calmly.  This is what attracts travelers here who are tired of the hustle and bustle of big cities. </p><p>  The most popular among tourists is the island of Shpikerog.  It is on it that the most comfortable hotels, spas and wellness centers are located.  And lovers of silence prefer to relax on Wangeroog, the most picturesque island of the group. </p><p>  When planning a trip to the Frisian Islands, it is better to consider in advance that there are no noisy youth entertainment.  The main category of tourists are elderly people and families with children, most often the Germans themselves.  In addition, the rest here is quite expensive, the average cost of a room in a four-star hotel is $ 116, and a room in a house can be rented for about $ 20 per night. </p><h2>  Mussel Museum and Crown Prince Residence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.google.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches on the island of Norderney" class="if uuid-3115478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3115478.jpg"></div><p>  Arriving to rest on the Frisian Islands, it is worth wandering around each of them, breathing in the healing sea air and getting to know the local sights.  For example, take a tour of the seabed, which is held at low tide.  And if you're lucky, take a picture with fur seals who love to relax on the sandy beaches. </p><p>  Arriving on a ferry to the island of Shpikerog, you should definitely visit the Mussel Museum, whose collection contains more than 3,000 shells from around the world.  And ride the streets of the islet on a horse-drawn cart, stopping at the most interesting places. </p><p>  And the small island of Norderney, the locals nicknamed "Small World".  There is so often a thick fog that it seems that the island is separated from the rest of the world by a dense curtain.  Although it was here in the middle of the XIX century, Crown Prince George V of Hanover founded his summer residence. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, the most comfortable weather on the islands lasts from May to September.  It is then that you can bask on the sandy beach, enjoy swimming between the islands and enjoy first-class wines and fresh fish dishes in coastal restaurants. </p><h2>  Pearls of the North Sea </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.germany.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cycling on the island of Sylt" class="if uuid-3115479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/3115479.jpg"></div><p>  Among the many North Frisian islands of Germany, three stand out: Sylt, Fer and Amrum, where you can break away from the boring reality and plunge into the world of silence and solitude.  Long beaches with white sand, high windmills, preserved houses with reed roofs and amazing purity and silence ... </p><p>  Sylt Island is considered the most prestigious, it is very popular among tourists, and in the summer months the beaches are literally crowded.  It is here that the most sophisticated restaurants, expensive hotels and entertainment are concentrated. </p><p>  The second largest island, Fer, is more suitable for a quiet family vacation, leisurely walks and watching the life of seals.  In terms of tourism infrastructure, it is not inferior to Sylt, but much fewer visitors come here. </p><p>  The smallest and most picturesque of the North Frisian islands is Atrum, which is half covered with sand dunes.  Its area is only 20 square meters.  km, but there is everything for a comfortable rest and relaxation. </p><h2>  Wide beaches and pine forests </h2><p>  Of the entire placer of the North Frisian Islands of Denmark, only six small islands belong.  Only three of them are constantly inhabited by people, and the southern island, Reme, is a popular resort. </p><p>  The entire western coast here consists of wide desert beaches covered with fine sand and shells.  Thanks to the constant winds, fans of windsurfing, water skiing and sailing love to visit this island.  For the convenience of guests, a network of pedestrian and bicycle paths has been laid around the island, and it is connected to the mainland by a wide dam, which greatly facilitates entry from Denmark. </p><p>  There are almost no hotels on the island, but the owners of cozy houses gladly rent out visitors.  Horse riding along the dunes, walking through pine forests and exploring colorful local houses are a pleasure.  And, of course, very tasty and fresh fish, which is prepared in a cafe right on the beach. </p>
