This is the largest settlement in the south-west of the country, famous for the traditions of navigation and fishing.  The number of inhabitants exceeds 250,000.  A mild climate, a convenient bay for yachts, ancient architecture attract thousands of tourists here. </p><h2>  Where is the city of Plymouth </h2><p>  Plymouth (with administrative city status) is located at the junction of the historic regions of Devon and Cornwall.  The estuary of the Tamar and Plym rivers forms a natural harbor, sheltered from storms.  It is no coincidence that the HMNB Devonport, the largest operational naval base of the Royal Navy in Europe, is located in the vicinity. </p><p>  Transport links with the city are well developed.  The M5 Federal Highway connects Plymouth with Central England.  Exeter Regional Center is 60 km away, and London is 310 km away.  Tourist liners and passenger ships run along the coast.  Newquay International Airport is 60 km away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elevation.maplogs.com" data-author=": Alan Lomax, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plymouth Attractions" class="if uuid-2530672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530672.jpg"></div><h2>  Early story </h2><p>  Traces of people who lived here in the Upper Paleolithic were found in caves near Plymouth in England.  During the Bronze Age, a port already existed here, one of the largest on the coast.  This is evidenced by numerous artifacts collected by archaeologists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the famous "Geography" of the ancient Greek historian Ptolemy, the settlement Tamari Ostia (a city in the Tamara estuary) is mentioned.  It was guarded by a large fort, built on the coastal cape Round Head and connected to the sites of Lineham Warren, Boringdon and Maristow. </p><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  Until the end of the 10th century, Plympton was located upstream of the Plym River.  However, at the beginning of the XI century, the river began to quickly silt.  Merchants and fishermen were forced to build marinas at the mouth.  Over time, residential buildings were also moved closer to the sea. </p><p>  In the Old English settlement it was called Sutton, at the beginning of the XIII century it was already referred to as Plym Mouth ("mouth of the Plym river").  The current name Plymouth in Britain was established in the 15th century, and was first officially mentioned in the charter of King Henry VI, dated 1440. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artuk.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plymouth, a city in England" class="if uuid-2530670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530670.jpg"></div><h2>  Renaissance </h2><p>  At the end of the 15th century, a quadrangular fortress with round towers in every corner was built in the Barbican area.  She still adorns the coat of arms of the city.  The main purpose of the fortification was to protect Sutton Harbor, which was the main base until the creation of the Plymouth Shipyard. </p><p>  Tensions with France and Spain forced the English Parliament to allocate funds to expand the defenses.  The result was a chain of six artillery blockhouses, a fort on St. Nicholas Island and a fortified entrance to Sutton Bay, equipped with a long chain to delay enemy ships.  In 1660, the Royal Citadel was built in Plymouth (England), making the port virtually impregnable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.okmayflower.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the city of Plymouth" class="if uuid-2530702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530702.jpg"></div><h2>  New World </h2><p>  During the period of great geographical discoveries, the city became one of the world centers of navigation.  It was one of the main export ports of wool.  The fame (among the enemies) of Plymouth was brought by the captain, adventurer, privateer and slave trader <span>Francis Drake.</span>  He became famous not only for impudent pirate raids, but also led the <span>defeat of the Invincible Armada of the</span> Spaniards, determined to conquer England.  Moreover, from 1581 to 1593, Drake headed the city hall. </p><p>  In 1620, pilgrim fathers set off from Plymouth in England to develop the vast lands of North America.  They founded a successful colony in the current <span>state of Massachusetts,</span> which became the basis for many myrrhans.  Until now, in New England (USA), they honor the memory of the founders and observe many traditions long forgotten in their homeland. </p><h2>  Subsequent development </h2><p>  Throughout the 17th century, Plymouth gradually lost its importance as a trading port.  Goods made in other parts of England have become too expensive to transport through the city.  However, he remained the base of slavers transporting black African people to plantations of South, Central and North America. </p><p>  The Second Wind opened after the construction of a large shipyard on the east bank of the Tamar River.  The first dock was commissioned in 1690.  The subsequent ones were commissioned in 1727, 1762 and 1793.  Many Plymouth residents found work here.  Gradually, the village of Devonport grew around the shipyard, whose population by 3000 reached 3,000. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.principalinternational.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plymouth, UK" class="if uuid-2530722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530722.jpg"></div><h2>  Pearl of South West England </h2><p>  At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, Plymouth (Great Britain), thanks to the efforts of a group of architects and builders led by John Falston, acquired its current neoclassical appearance.  The pearls of architecture were the Athenaeum, the Royal Theater, the Royal Hotel and Union Street.  Today it is one of the most romantic cities in Cornwall and Devon. </p><p>  In 1768, local chemist William Cuckworthy founded Plymouth Porcelain, one of the first porcelain manufactures in the British Empire.  This was made possible by the discovery of special clays in Cornwall.  Plymouth porcelain was produced by solid-phase synthesis and differed from other manufacturers in a special ‚Äúcold‚Äù sparkling whiteness. </p><p>  By the middle of the XIX century, the urban agglomeration Plymouth - Stonehouse - Devonport was formed.  Today it is united in a single administrative unit - ‚Äúcity‚Äù.  To connect the enclave settlements, in 1812, the construction of a bridge in Plymouth Sound was started according to the project of John Renny.  However, numerous technical difficulties, unsteady soils and frequent storms dragged on the construction for many decades.  The author of the project did not live to see the opening of the bridge, which took place only in 1841. </p><p>  In the 1860s, a ring of forts of Palmerston was built around Devonport to protect the shipyard from attack from any direction.  By this time, the port regained its commercial significance.  Through it, many goods were imported from America and Europe, including corn, wheat, barley, sugarcane, guano, sodium nitrate, and phosphates.  The end of the 19th century was marked by a technological revolution.  A railway was drawn to Plymouth, trams appeared in the city, cars, streets were lit by gas lamps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plymouth, Britain" class="if uuid-2530663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530663.jpg"></div><h2>  Twentieth century </h2><p>  During the First World War, Plymouth in England was a port where troops from the colonies of the British Empire were delivered.  Ammunition was also made here.  Despite the fact that the main units of the Royal Navy moved to a safer place (in Scapa Flow), Devonport remained an important base for coast guard and escort ships. </p><p>  During World War II, Devonport was the headquarters of the Western Defense Sector.  Plymouth and shipyards were badly damaged during the Nazi air raids.  During the opening of the second front in the summer of 1944, the city played an important role as a point of deployment of landing ships. </p><p>  After the war, the leading English architect Patrick Abercrombie was engaged in the reconstruction of the destroyed quarters (in total, about 3,700 houses and industrial facilities were destroyed).  By the way, he also developed a recovery plan for London.  The main task was to relocate residents from densely built-up crowded slums to the suburbs with individual low-rise buildings.  Builders coped with a difficult task.  By 1963, 20,000 new homes were erected. </p><p>  Many old buildings in the center were demolished, and in their place a zoned modern building with green spaces was created.  A vivid example of mid-20th century architecture is the Plymouth Civil Center in the style of modernism. </p><p>  Shipyard "Devonport" has retained its significance.  In particular, they are engaged in the repair and conversion of aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines of the Royal Navy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caremark.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plymouth hoe" class="if uuid-2530714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2530714.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Plymouth </h2><p>  England is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.  The city is visited by tens of thousands of tourists every month.  Among the most interesting objects we note: </p><ul><li>  Sutton District.  Includes over 100 historic buildings, a harbor and the largest paved street square in the country. </li><li>  Embankment Barbican - sea gates of the city.  One of the few ancient quarters that escaped destruction during the Second World War. </li><li>  Plymouth University, one of the largest in the UK. </li><li>  The limestone cliffs of Plymouth Hoe, currently intensively built up by coastal structures, including defensive ones. </li><li>  Smeaton Tower.  This is a former lighthouse of the XVIII century, and now - an observation deck. </li><li>  The city has 20 war memorials.  Among them stand out Plymouth Naval Memorial (which is an analogue of the tomb of the Unknown Soldier) and Armada Memorial (opened in honor of the 300th anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada). </li><li>  National Marine Aquarium (the deepest in the country).  About 400 species of underwater inhabitants live here. </li><li>  The Saltram estate is a mansion of the era of George II. </li><li>  Royal Fort Crownhill, 1860s. </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.3805931" data-lng="-4.065654499999937" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/0/7/7/4077.png"></div><p>  Plymouth is a favorite destination for yachtsmen and photographers thanks to the picturesque city harbor. </p>
