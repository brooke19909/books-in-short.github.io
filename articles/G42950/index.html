Well-known cars from Philips and Delonghi are already tired of everything, so you should pay attention to less known, but the same high-quality options.  The product line remains unchanged, as do the technologies that are used for the stable operation of the device.  They differ in name and brand. </p><p>  In this review, we will focus on the coffee machine De Longhi ESAM3000 Execution.  We will consider reviews, as well as the price category and options.  In the entire line, this device is considered the cheapest.  The released modifications 3000 and 2600 differ only in appearance and control panel.  That is why everything that will be described in the review applies even to other models - 2200/3200/2800.  Their difference, again, is in design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="espresso coffee machine de longhi esam3000 execution reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1972070.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Strengths </h2><p>  It should be noted immediately that the kit includes instructions.  Coffee machine De Longhi ESAM3000 Execution reviews are positive.  Why?

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Capsules for a coffee machine are sold freely.  The brewing group works with wetting, so all the features of the taste will be revealed at the highest level.  Keeping an eye on this item is easy.  It should be washed only once a week under running water.  All working parts must be lubricated at least every six months.  Use for this should be food-grade grease. </p><p>  The machine has an automatic channel flushing, which allows you to remove all contaminants after switching on and idle.  This will delay the descaling, and the resulting taste will be as ‚Äúclean" as possible.  However, it should be noted that De Longhi ESAM3000 coffee machine uses too much water.  Reviews confirm this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee machine capsules" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1972072.jpg"></div>

To make it better understood, this happens in the range from espresso to americano.  The strength varies from 7 to 14 grams of ground type material. </p><p>  Feeding height adjustment is also available: from 75 to 105 mm.  Thanks to this, you can even set tall glasses, although in order to make a latte I would like a slightly larger range. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="espresso coffee machine de longhi esam3000" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1972073.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Optional bonuses </h2><p>  The De Longy 3000 coffee machine has a special option called Eco.  Thanks to it, you can save electricity, but the function is not particularly effective.  In the reviews from customers, you can read that there is no particular saving, but you have to wait 10 seconds longer, compared to the usual cooking speed, also the cup heating is turned off.  Although the latter function is not very useful even in normal mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="espresso coffee machine de longhi esam3000 execution" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1972074.jpg"></div>
