The hotel staff speaks several languages, so they will understand you if you want to speak English, Ukrainian or French. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the Sheraton Hotel, located on Akademika Koroleva Street, I would like to draw attention to the guest reviews, thanks to which you can make your opinion. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the guests of the complex leave quite conflicting reviews.  And someone doubts at all that the hotel deserves five stars.  But let's talk about everything in more detail. </p><p>  The Four Points By Sheraton Hotel in Kaluga is a new establishment built in the city center.  Therefore, the interior decoration is made taking into account modern standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="four-points-by-sheraton-kaluga-hotel.nochi.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway station Kaluga" class="if uuid-3212526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3212526.jpg"></div><p>  The guests of the establishment highly appreciate the convenience of the hotel's location.  From it it will not be difficult to get to the railway station of Kaluga.  Near the hotel there is a public transport stop.  The bus station in Kaluga is combined with the railway station.  Trolleybuses, minibuses and buses stopping in different directions stop here.  Therefore, you can get anywhere in the city.  If desired, you can book a transfer in advance at the hotel.  However, tourists say that it‚Äôs easy to get there. </p><p>  Convenient location allows quick access to attractions in the city center.  In walking distance there is everything that is necessary for tourists and business people.  Nearby you can find shops, inexpensive cafes, restaurants, supermarkets and other interesting places.  When staying at the Sheraton, you will not have to spend time on long trips.  According to the guests, a convenient location is one of the advantages of the establishment. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  As we mentioned earlier, the Sheraton Hotel in Kaluga (the address is given in the article) is new.  Its interiors are made in a modern style.  The hotel is very extensive and diverse.  And yet, even here, guests have contradictions.  Tourists agree that all apartments have an expensive atmosphere and excellent equipment.  But trouble also happens here.  The rooms are kept clean and tidy.  But in the corridors you can sometimes see trays with the remnants of food that the guests exhibit as part of the room service.  According to the guests, the dishes are brought to the room very quickly, but the garbage in the hallway is removed much more slowly.  This moment, apparently, is not adjusted. </p><p>  All apartments of the hotel are quite spacious and comfortable.  They include bathrobes, towels, slippers and high-quality cosmetics for the body and hair.  Of course, you should not use a disposable razor, since its quality leaves much to be desired, but all other detergents are very worthy.  Sets in the bathrooms consist of body lotion, cotton pads, ear sticks, shower caps, small files, toothpaste and brushes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Four Points By Sheraton Kaluga" class="if uuid-3212522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3212522.jpg"></div><p>  The bathrooms are ergonomic and include showers.  If you believe the reviews, it is the latter that sometimes cause troubles.  The fact is that the doors in some rooms on the cabins are missing or broken, so after bathing, all floors become wet.  It is very uncomfortable. </p><p>  In the room guests are provided with bottled drinking water, capsules for a coffee machine.  Stocks of drinks and tea are replenished regularly.  But instead of capsule coffee, they can very well put bags for making an instant drink.  Each room has an ironing board and an iron, it is incredibly convenient that you can put your clothes in order without extra visits to the reception. </p><p>  Balconies are not available in all rooms.  And in some rooms, the exit to them is covered by armchairs.  The big advantage of the establishment is the large, comfortable beds and very high quality bedding.  It is very comfortable to sleep on soft pillows. </p><p>  It is incredibly convenient that the rooms have a work area and a computer.  Thanks to this, if necessary, you can safely work.  The wireless internet is of excellent quality and works well throughout the building.  The closet in the room is equipped with automatic lighting for convenience.  Also, the light automatically turns on when entering the room.  In general, the rooms are beautiful and functional, living in them is very comfortable.  There are no problems with audibility. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As an additional service at the Sheraton Hotel, you can order food in your room.  The hotel also has a restaurant.  According to guest reviews, dishes from his menu are very tasty.  Buffet breakfast is served in the mornings.  The cost of breakfast is 850 rubles.  According to visitors, the menu of the morning meal is repeated daily.  Typically, breakfast includes pancakes, a variety of pastries, omelets, cereals, broths, bacon, pickles, fresh juices, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yogurts, cottage cheese. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marriott.com.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Four Points By Sheraton Kaluga" class="if uuid-3212518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3212518.jpg"></div><p>  The most enthusiastic reviews guests leave about desserts.  Their choice is great: eclairs, mousses, cakes, pies and much more.  Someone is satisfied with the food, and someone notes that the cost of breakfast is too high.  There are cafes and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, so there is always a choice where to spend the evening and eat. </p><h2>  Service Reviews </h2><p>  The Sheraton Hotel (Akademika Koroleva St. 16) has a spa center.  The cost of his visit is included in the stay, so everyone has the opportunity to have a good time.  According to guests, the spa area is very modest in size, so it is always very crowded there.  The pool is very small, swimming in it is uncomfortable.  The spa announced wraps, but staff do not recommend using this service.  In general, tourists are not satisfied with the bath complex. </p><p>  The hotel has its own built-in parking.  But, according to tourists, it is very uncomfortable, the driveways are too narrow.  Therefore, the machines are sandwiched between the columns.  But this nuance is not the main disappointment.  Unpleasantly surprises guests the fact that parking is paid.  Moreover, the cost of the service is quite high (500 rubles per day).  Tourists who travel a lot note that such services in hotels are always included in the price.  In addition, the cost of rooms is quite high, because the institution is positioning itself as a five-star hotel.  If you plan to travel by car, then in ‚ÄúSheraton‚Äù, in addition to room and board, you will also have to pay the cost of parking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="four-points-by-sheraton-kaluga-hotel.nochi.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus station Kaluga" class="if uuid-3212527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3212527.jpg"></div><p>  According to guests, the hotel staff is very attentive and good-natured.  At the reception they always try to help and tell about everything that interests you.  No less nice staff in the restaurant.  Service at the hotel is organized at a decent level. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel complex has been operating not so long ago, it already has its regular customers.  People who regularly come to Kaluga note that they consider this hotel the best in the city.  Guests choose it for many reasons.  Some people like beautiful rooms with a modern design and panoramic windows, while others like food and a convenient location. </p><p>  The advantages of the institution make his regular customers come back to him again and again.  Indeed, many guests remain delighted with the hotel.  Of course, there are some minor flaws in the hotel.  Sometimes plumbing malfunctions occur.  The bulk of complaints are related to faulty booths.  The rest of the hotel complex makes the most pleasant impression.  Regular customers note that for four years nothing has changed in the appearance of the institution and the service.  The rooms are still clean and comfortable, and the staff are attentive service.  The hotel is equally good for families and for business trips. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The cost of living in a hotel is quite high, but it's worth it.  Many tourists note that the complex deserves the highest ratings.  Regular customers, according to reviews, rightly consider it the best hotel in Kaluga.  If you are going through here, you can check first hand whether this is so. </p>
