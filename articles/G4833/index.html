Rules for its replacement</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone who has a washing machine, sooner or later the question arises of its repair.  The most common problem is the failure of the <span>heating element</span> - the <span>heating element.</span>  Most often, the culprit of the accident is the scale deposited on it.  Its appearance provokes poor water quality and frequent washing at high temperatures. </p><p>  Failure is manifested in the absence of water heating, the washing time is significantly increased - the machine unsuccessfully tries to heat the water. </p><p>  You can carry out work on replacing the heating element yourself, without contacting a service center.  The main thing is to choose the right heater for the washing machine, in accordance with its model.  But not always, knowing only the model of the device, it is enough to simply pick up the components.  Often you have to pick up analog parts. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a heater for a washing machine? </h2><p>  When choosing a <span>heating element</span> , the following features should be considered: </p><ul><li>  Type of seat.  As a rule, in modern washing machines it is the same, therefore, problems should not arise.  Take this item into account for owners of devices that are more than 15 years old. </li><li>  The presence of reinforcing collar.  It is located together with the seal.  If you choose a heater for the washing machine without a collar, and put it in the appliance, for the place of the part in which it was, then there is a high probability of the heating element falling out during washing. </li></ul>

For example, the heater for the LG washing machine of most models comes with it.  If there is a hole, but the sensor itself is not connected, you can put a cap. </li><li>  The length of the heating element.  It‚Äôs best to fit the size of the old one, although a slight difference is allowed.  For example, the heater for the LG washing machine of modern models is short, and for Electrolux or Zanussi it is long. </li><li>  Power of the heating element.  Today you can pick up a heater with a power of 800-2200 watts.  The higher this value, the faster the water will heat up to the desired temperature. </li><li>  The shape of the heating element.  It can be straight or curved. </li><li>  Coating.  For example, the heater for the Samsung washing machine is most often ceramic.  According to the manufacturer, it is less prone to scale. </li></ul><h2>  Location of the heating element </h2><p>  Replacing the heating element is not particularly difficult even for a person far from repairing washing machines.  The main thing is to determine where it is located.  Depending on the model, the disassembly process and the location of the heating element may vary.  In some washing machines, the heater is located in the front, while others have a back under the lid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ten for the lg washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1571952.jpg"></div>

On the back of the washing machine, a removable hatch screwed into place may be provided.  One has only to open the back cover and next to the engine you can immediately see the outer part of the heater with power wires and a nut in the middle.  If the rear hatch does not open or the heater is missing, then you have to disassemble the front. </p><h2>  How to replace the heating element through the front panel? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, removing the front panel is at times more difficult than the rear.  The whole process is divided into several stages: </p><ol><li>  First you need to remove the top cover.  To do this, on the back of the machine you need to unscrew the screws and pull the cover towards you and up.  Care must be taken not to pull out the plastic clips, without which the lid will not snap back. </li><li>  Disconnect the control panel of the washing machine.  First you need to pull out the powder container.  To do this, pull out the container, press the latch button inside and pull it to the bottom.  If there is no button, then just lift the container slightly and pull it towards you.  After two or three screws become visible - unscrew them.  The remaining screws are located on the top or side of the control panel, unscrewing them, carefully remove the panel and, without disconnecting from the wires, put on top of the washing machine. </li><li>  Detach the <span>rubber cuff</span> on the hatch of the washing machine.  With the door open, use a screwdriver to gently pry the spring clip that holds the cuff and remove it by pulling it in a circle.  Further, the rubber is simply removed from the housing of the washing machine.  Also on the hatch are the lock lock screws, unscrew them, and push the lock inside. </li><li>  The front panel of the washing machine.  Having done all of the above, you can finally get to the internal parts of the washing machine.  It remains to unscrew the screws securing the front panel.  They are usually located below and above the washing machine.  Below they can be hidden by a decorative panel, from below on the sides, or next to the drainage filter.  Then you should remove the panel with your hands and set aside.  Now access to the heating element is obtained. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Replacing the heater in the washing machine </h2><p>  No matter where the heating element was located, its replacement actions are exactly the same.  If the <span>heater for the washing machine is</span> already purchased, you can immediately install it in place. </p><p>  It is necessary to remove all wires from the contacts from the old heating element, they sit very tightly, so you can carefully help yourself with a screwdriver.  Then unscrew the screw securing the heating element and carefully remove the heater. </p><p>  A new heating element is installed, as removed, only in the reverse order.  Also, in the reverse sequence, all removed parts are mounted and the screws are screwed. </p><h2>  Prevention of damage to the heating element </h2><p>  To prevent damage to the heater, it is necessary to combat the formation of scale.  To do this, you can clean the device with citric acid once every 3-4 months.  It is necessary to fill 60 grams of acid into the powder container and start the washing program at 60 degrees without laundry.  If there is a suspicion that a lot of scale has formed, then at 90. After this simple procedure, both the drum and the heater are completely cleaned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ten for washing machine samsung" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1571819.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also a simple way, if not prevented, then significantly reduce the rate of scale formation, this is a constant wash in warm rather than hot water.  That is, use programs up to 40 degrees.  In this case, electricity is well saved. </p>
