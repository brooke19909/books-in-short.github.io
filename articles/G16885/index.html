    <p>  The central office of the company is in Chelyabinsk.  The list of representative offices is quite large; you can see it on the official website of the company and choose a suitable place where it will be convenient to carry out insurance at Asko.  Chelyabinsk (the addresses of company offices are also located on insurance policies) is not the only place where Asko is located.  It should be noted that the company has representative offices in the Chelyabinsk and Kurgan regions.  And also in the city of Yekaterinburg, Krasnodar Territory, the city of Rostov-on-Don and other cities of Russia. </p><h2>  Asko Policy: Insurance </h2><p>  Chelyabinsk is a large industrial center.  There are representative offices of all federal insurance companies.  But there are statistics that it is Asko insurance (Chelyabinsk) that covers about 70% of the local OSAGO market.  This is primarily due to the fact that the federal insurance companies, when selling the compulsory insurance policy, offer to issue additional insurance.  Because of this, a person has to pay more for the policy.  In addition, some federal companies have allocated a segment of cars that they take for insurance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Asko (Chelyabinsk) <strong></strong>  it doesn't work like that.  The company management has chosen a different path.  Offices accept all comers for insurance, without imposing any additional products.  In this regard, there were difficult periods when people had to take turns from early morning or late at night to conclude a contract.  In this period of time, by the way, a lot of negative feedback from the company's customers arose.  This was due to a lack of understanding of the current situation in the market in such a service sector as insurance. </p><h2>  Asko (Chelyabinsk): customer reviews </h2><p>  The company "Asko" received negative reviews, since with a large number of people wishing to apply for a policy, the company had a shortage of forms.  Then the management adopted a customer service system for coupons. </p><p>  Customers spoke about the company‚Äôs employees with special gratitude, because thanks to their hard work and stress resistance, the company managed to establish favorable relations with customers. </p><h2>  CTP insurance deficit </h2><p>  Recently, the situation has changed - the deficit of CTP insurance policies has disappeared.  This is due to the measures taken by the SAR to resolve the situation in the problem regions of the Russian Federation.  PCA was developed and introduced a system of "single agent".  Its essence lies in the fact that when a client contacts the company‚Äôs office, he randomly gets the policy of any insurer who has joined this insurance agreement.  Thanks to this, Chelyabinsk began to receive additional security with CTP insurance forms, as well as other problematic regions of the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asko insurance chelyabinsk addresses" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1643196.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In addition, insurance companies are currently required to sell electronic insurance policies.  For some categories of citizens such insurance is convenient.  "Asko" (Chelyabinsk) also offers this type of service for policyholders - anyone who needs an insurance policy can go to the company's website, register and print an electronic version of the policy after filling out a specific form. </p><h2>  Opening new branches </h2><p>  YuzhUral-ASKO has established itself as a reliable company in the insurance market.  Many people trust her and want to make contracts here.  The geography of its divisions is expanding.  In 2016, representative offices were opened in the Krasnodar Territory, namely in the cities of Sochi and Krasnodar.  Also earned an office in Rostov-on-Don. </p>

    <h2>  Shares </h2><p>  YuzhUral-Asko regularly holds various promotions for its customers.  Therefore, policyholders have the opportunity to receive discounts or participate in lotteries.  As a rule, they are confined to significant dates.  For example, to the 25th anniversary of the company, a new apartment with a modern renovation in Chelyabinsk was raffled off.  The draw was held between those customers who had a valid property insurance policy. </p><p>  On the company's website you can make an electronic calculation of insurance policies for CTP, CASCO, property and VHI programs.  If you have any questions related to insurance or an insured event, you can call the call center of the company "Asko" (insurance, Chelyabinsk).  The phone is presented on the official website and is printed on policies.  The call center is open around the clock, so you can call at any time. </p><h2>  Features of insurance products </h2><p>  It is worth noting that YuzhUral-Asko cares about its customers, and there are a number of privileges on insurance products that you should pay attention to when concluding an agreement.  For example, customers who have issued an MTPL policy are provided with a free call service for an <span>emergency commissioner.</span>  And the insurers who have drawn up the Antiklesh contract can be calm about the presence of immunoglobulin in the clinics with which Asko has an agreement.  The company also monitors tariffs for other types of insurance.  For example, the cost of CASCO insurance is usually lower than that of federal insurance companies.  And for regular customers the opportunity to receive cash payments on hull remained. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance asko chelyabinsk reviews" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1643263.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  When choosing a company to conclude an agreement, Asko should be considered as an option for insurance coverage of property, health or civil liability.  It has established itself as a reliable UK, which has existed for more than 25 years, has a large number of representative offices and branches throughout the country. </p>
