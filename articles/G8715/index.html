    <h2>  Departure </h2><p>  Very often, our current problem appears due to the battery drain.  Detecting this phenomenon is not so simple.  After all, few people will independently begin to check whether the battery is well attached to a mobile phone.  Especially if before there were no problems with this. </p><p>  To exclude this option, remove the back cover of your mobile, then firmly press the battery to the phone.  It remains only to check whether the device will turn off.  Yes?  Then the reason is clearly in something else.  Not?  So you have found the source of the problem. </p><p>  What to do next?  It is recommended that you secure the battery in some way so that it fits snugly against the terminals.  In this case, the mobile is usually taken for repair and explained what exactly needs to be fixed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Why does the phone turn off by itself?  The next reason for this behavior is nothing more than a battery problem.  Its malfunction almost always leads to the fact that the mobile device begins to turn off and on by itself.  Do not be surprised at this. </p><p>  What to do in this case?  Think about how long your phone has been working.  Have you followed the battery care guidelines?  Have charging always started after a full discharge of the "problem" component?  If not, then the reason most likely lies precisely in the battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the phone itself turns off and on" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To eliminate this trouble, just replace the faulty component.  Usually, after acquiring a new battery, the phone stops turning off without permission. </p><h2>  Battery charge </h2><p>  The reasons do not end there.  Why does the phone turn off by itself?  Check battery power.  Not the most common, but practical case.  It is the low battery of the phone that causes the device to turn off. </p><p>  This situation is quickly resolved.  All you need is to charge the phone, and then turn it on.  You will notice how the problem disappears by itself.  From now on, just keep an eye on the battery.  Then you will not have any surprises with the phone.  In any case, you will be prepared to turn off the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Except that the reasons for such behavior do not lie in anything more serious.  Why does the phone turn itself off and on?  Under such circumstances, the device‚Äôs battery and its problems are not always the source of the problem.  Everything is much more serious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the phone itself turns off and turns on samsung" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320794.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that if you notice how the phone turns off on its own and then turns on, it's time to check the device for viruses.  They become the cause of most gadget malfunctions.  It is impossible to predict exactly how the phone will respond to a particular virus. </p><p>  To exclude infection, it is recommended to use special anti-virus programs for mobile devices.  Or take the gadget to a service center.  There you will be helped not only to check the phone, but also to "cure" it if necessary. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  The list of possible causes of our today's problem does not end there.  Why does the Nokia phone or any other phone turn off?  If all of the above options are not suitable for you, then you can think about installed programs and applications.  Utilities often cause problems with the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why does the Nokia phone turn off" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are several possible options.  First, you have little space left on your mobile.  In this case, you just need to make room.  Remove some of the most unnecessary programs or games - and the problem will disappear by itself. </p><p>  The second is device overload.  It is recommended not to open many applications at the same time, as well as to clean the phone from utilities.  Something unnecessary there is sure to be found. </p><p>  The third is the presence of malware.  To fix the situation, you have to find and fix the problematic utility.  After that, you won‚Äôt have to wonder why the phone itself turns off and on (Samsung, Nokia or some other).  After all, the problem will disappear.  Its reappearance is possible when the gadget is again cluttered with programs. </p><h2>  System crash </h2><p>  Why does the phone turn off when charging and not only?  The latest common variant of this behavior is crashes in the device‚Äôs operating system.  They happen simply from time to time, and from viruses, and from the number of installed programs and applications.  But most often, malfunctions in the operating system are the result of incorrect firmware. </p><p>  In order not to understand the situation for a long time, you just need to reflash the gadget.  Doing it yourself is not recommended.  It is better to take the phone to a service center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the phone turns off when charging" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1320791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Usually, after flashing all problems are fixed.  If even after that nothing helped, it's time to change the phone.  Indeed, sometimes the reason lies in equipment malfunction.  In such a situation, only a complete replacement of the gadget will help.  Now it‚Äôs clear why the phone turns off by itself.  It is not as difficult to fix this problem as it seems.  The main thing is to know where to start.  By the way, you should think about the firmware only after eliminating all of the above reasons. </p>
