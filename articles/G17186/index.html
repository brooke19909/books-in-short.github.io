    <h2>  History with geography </h2><p>  Krasnodar Territory today is a fertile place for tourists.  The warm sea, small mountains, green thickets are especially appreciated by visitors from the cities.  Here are just places with truly wildlife here almost gone.  And those that have not yet been "ennobled" by the ubiquitous tour service are often replete with the remains of tourist feasts: bottles, traces of bonfires, garbage.  10 years ago, a place located 400 meters from Kabardinka, in a gorge at the foot of the Markhot ridge, looked almost the same.  Forest, dense blackberry thickets for many years served as a ‚Äúwild barbecue" for locals and visitors.  Not everyone cleaned up after themselves, and gradually the beauties of nature disappeared under a layer of garbage. </p><p>  But once a man came here who was able to appreciate the incredible beauty of this unique corner of nature.  Having bought the land, the entrepreneur first simply cleaned it of debris.  A little later he built a dam, and the resulting pond ‚Äústocked‚Äù with fry of sturgeon and trout.  It became not to recognize the abandoned site in the village of Kabardinka.  Kastalskaya font is its new name.  Plot on the street  Revolutionary, 148 turned simultaneously into a trout farm, font, restaurant, one of the most beautiful places on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Font and forests - the whole Kabardinka beauty </h2><p>  Today, tourists from <span>Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk,</span> even Anapa and Sochi tend to visit the village.  Kabardinka.  The Kastalsky font attracts them, as all beautiful attracts.  Arriving here for the first time immediately surprised by the landscape before my eyes.  Palm trees, boxwoods, pines, junipers like eyelashes frame a small but stunning transparent lake.  Landscape designers have tried as organically as possible to fit figuredly trimmed shrubs into natural thickets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Castal font Kabardinka photo" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744318.jpg" width="600"></div>  Unusually shaped fountains only emphasize the originality of <span>a windmill</span> and stone paths, the airiness of openwork <span>wooden arbors,</span> perched on the banks of a <span>crystal lake, the</span> whiteness of a two-story peaked ‚Äúold‚Äù building in which the restaurant is located.

The youngest daughter of King Nereus was homely against the background of her sisters.  The girl suffered so much that she decided to escape from her home and, hiding on the ship of Yasson, went with him to distant Colchis.  Only at night she dared to appear on deck, but that was enough to fall in love with her beautiful companion Yasson - Dmitry.  Having learned the secret of the girl, he vowed to keep her forever, if Lydia seemed to him in the afternoon.  An embarrassed and frightened girl escaped from the ship.  She wandered along the coastal thickets for a long time until she found a clearing with a spring and a lake.  Hidden in the thicket, they looked so much like their homeland that Lydia named this corner by the name of her native Castal places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castal font kabardinka reviews [1]" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744338.jpg" width="600"></div>
