  <section class="page js-page"><h1>M3 highway - road to Kiev</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the upcoming holiday season, many plan to travel by car.  This time is not only for relaxing at sea resorts, but also visiting your friends and relatives living, including in the former Soviet republics, such as Belarus and Ukraine.  The M3 highway, popularly called Kievka, leads to the border with the latter.  It begins at the end of Leninsky Prospekt. </p><p>  Leaving it from Moscow, the motorist begins to hope that the roads will be crossed off from the list of Russian ills.  However, this hope has not yet come true.  But!  First things first. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="M3 highway" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/53739.jpg" width="600"></div>  M3 highway - history of occurrence and geography </h3><p>  The design of the modern highway was started in 1938, its working route was laid from Moscow to Sevsk.  The military operations in the forties made significant adjustments to the construction period, which accelerated in 1959.  In four years, about 400 kilometers of the route were built. </p><p>  <span>Asphalt concrete pavement</span> appeared on the M3 during the reconstruction carried out in the late sixties - mid seventies.  Then the <span>width of the roadway</span> was increased <span>.</span>  Since then, global restructuring has been carried out only in the territory of the immediate Moscow Region, local repairs were carried out in some areas and their condition is satisfactory, the rest is almost the same M3 highway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The map of the area along which the road is laid indicates a fairly calm landscape typical of the East European Plain.  However, despite this, the route has several dangerous sections with sharp turns (50, 220 and 426 km) and dangerous ascents and descents (245 km). </p><p>  The road passes through the territory of four regions: Moscow, Kaluga, Kursk and Bryansk. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Route M 3" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/53738.jpg" width="600"></div>  M3 highway - technical condition </h3><p>  The condition of the road varies quite a lot in its different sections, but asphalt pavement is present throughout its length.  So, on the territory of the Moscow region there are no serious complaints about the quality of the canvas, marking and readability of the signs.  The emergency section of the road starts from a turn to Kaluga and stretches to the border of the Bryansk region: the quality of asphalt is poor, there are potholes, ruts.  Only one lane in each direction exacerbates the already difficult situation in the area.  The second difficult stretch of the road begins beyond Bryansk and ends at a bend in Sevsk. </p><h3>  M3 highway - development prospects </h3><p>  Today we can definitely say that this road requires not just repair of asphalt, but global reconstruction, because the infrastructure of some of its sections has not changed since the sixties.  In particular, an increase in traffic and speed limits is necessary, since the highway is the main one connecting Moscow and Kiev.  Some segments require an urgent increase in the level of security: the construction of dividing fences, replacement of signs, widening of curbs and so on. </p>

The M 3 highway is subject to global reconstruction with an increase in the number of lanes in the narrowest sections to four in each direction.  The work will be divided into stages, the implementation of which will take several years.  According to preliminary data, the project implementation period is 2020.  Alas, the road will be paid, and alternative bypass routes are only being discussed.
