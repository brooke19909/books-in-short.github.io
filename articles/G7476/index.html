There is no software or driver disk, but the stock update can be downloaded from the official website of the brand, where you need to select the gadget category and model, that is, Gmini MagicBook T6LHD.  The instructions for the device are modest, but the developer has embedded the full version of the manual in the memory of the device itself, so there should be no problems with usability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many users in their reviews complain about the lack of a charger.  The manufacturer put a case for an e-book in a box, but for some reason forgot to equip it with a network memory.  Therefore, you will have to buy it separately or use any charger from a smartphone or tablet, since USB interfaces are not picky. </p><p>  The case for an e-book looks modest, but the universal dimensions of the gadget allow you to choose any other one you like, even from clean leather or flexible plastic.  There are no specific holes in the protection, so any orientation of the cover (horizontal or vertical) is suitable. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Gmini MagicBook T6LHD e-book is made of soft-touch rubberized plastic.  The front side has a glossy design, and the rear is matte.  It feels like velvet to the touch.  The corners of the gadget are noticeably rounded, and in appearance it looks more like an oval than a rectangle. </p>

    <p>  As for the build quality, here users leave exclusively positive reviews.  Gmini MagicBook T6LHD does not creak, crunches, and does not break even with a strong pressure on the case, and all structural parts are tightly and competently fitted to each other.  The device looks solid and serious, and if you turn it in your hands, you feel that you are holding a solid device that does not give away cheapness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most of the front panel of the Gmini MagicBook T6LHD (6 inches) is occupied by a display.  The brand logo flaunts above it.  The bottom frame is reserved for function keys: a navigation joystick with the buttons "OK", "Back", "Context menu", "Home" and on / off the backlight of the gadget. </p><p>  On both sides of the device there are duplicate swing pages.  Users have repeatedly thanked the manufacturer for such a well-thought-out move and left positive reviews on this subject.  Gmini MagicBook T6LHD turned out to be universal for both left-handed people and right-handed people, and protective accessories, like the same case, are easy to pick up. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the rear of the device, the reader‚Äôs series, screen matrix type and conveyor number are indicated.  At the end on the right side you can see the interface for SD-cards, protected by a dummy.  The latter is adjacent to the case very tightly, so you will have to make the appropriate effort to remove the card.  Users leave mixed reviews about this.  Gmini MagicBook T6LHD turned out, on the one hand, more protected from dust and dirt due to the absence of gaps on the case, and under the plug including, but on the other hand, people without strong nails will have to resort to using screwdrivers and a similar tool to insert / remove the card , which is not very convenient. </p>

    <p>  At the top end of the device there is a micro-USB interface, a mini-jack audio jack (3.5 mm), a hot reset key and a power button with a charge indicator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The overall user experience of the design and appearance is generally positive.  There are no elements that cut the overall style or annoy the owner.  Everything is done in calm and universal colors. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  Thanks to its dimensions (179 x 123 x 11 mm), the gadget is convenient to hold even in one hand, and due to the pronounced roundness of the corners it fits almost perfectly in the palm of your hand.  As mentioned above, the rear of the case has a matte finish, so the device does not slip and does not try to fall out of hand. </p><p>  All function keys are pressed easily, but with due elasticity and a distinctive click.  At first, there may be difficulties in the perception of buttons due to duplicated rockers for turning pages, but users say that you quickly get used to it, so that the discomfort disappears after an hour or two. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  Users in their reviews separately thank the designers for the presence of the ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù button in the reader, which greatly facilitates usability in general.  If this button is not acceptable for you in such devices, then you can reassign it to some other function for the Gmini MagicBook T6LHD. </p>

    <p>  Firmware from the official site (stock) will not help in this, but numerous amateur builds can change almost all the functionality as you like, even upside down.  The only thing worth clarifying is that you will have to install them at your own peril and risk.  It often happens that poor-quality amateur firmware can damage part or all of the internal system of the Gmini MagicBook T6LHD: the gadget does not turn on, friezes, lags and other problems appear.  Yes, and you will lose the guarantee, so it is better to use the official software for the gadget. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  Despite the full touch control, all the functionality is duplicated by mechanical buttons, which does not infringe on the rights of either fans of modern tapas or traditional ‚Äúkeyboardists‚Äù.  The owners in their reviews have repeatedly thanked the developer for such a constructive approach. </p><p>  The weight of the device is 230 grams, which is slightly more than that of similar devices, but the reader almost does not feel in your hand as something heavy and tiring, so any discomfort during operation, according to users, does not arise.  The case noticeably aggravates the gadget, but protection from all sides and a more attractive appearance is a clear plus. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Naturally, the main and decisive factor for the purchase of this kind of technology remains the screen and picture quality.  E-Ink Pearl HD technology has been used in readers since the end of 2011 and has proven itself in gadgets of this kind. </p>

    <p>  One of the main features is the fact that the design does not emit its own light, nor does it flicker, which has an extremely positive effect on vision, especially with prolonged use of the device.  In addition, the output image is similar to a paper sheet, which is also comfortably perceived by the reader. </p><p>  The contrast level at a more than acceptable level is 12 to 1. Rare competitors in this segment can boast of such a ratio (the most common - 7 to 1).  This level allows you to easily read almost any font with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels. </p><h2>  Backlight </h2><p>  If you like to read in the dark, then by pressing a special key you can turn on the backlight.  More modest readers working on electronic ink are deprived of this function, but there is also a fly in the ointment: the device discharges much faster when the backlight is on. </p><p>  This mode gives the screen a pronounced blue tint, which you get used to pretty quickly.  The backlight is evenly distributed, so that no unlit areas or stripes are observed.  The level can be adjusted on a scale from 1 to 8. The first step is almost invisible even in the dark and does not blind at all, transmitting a diffuse and soft glow.  The latter is pronounced, and you can use it, perhaps, as a flashlight, and not as a surroundings for reading.  For a comfortable pastime in the dark, the fifth or even fourth step is quite enough. </p><p>  If you read the user reviews, you can find out that for most people when the backlight is working, their eyes get tired much faster than with fluorescent lights, so this functionality will be useful, as they say, in a tent or when the power is turned off. </p><h2>  Interface operation </h2><p>  Changing the picture on the screen does not happen instantly, as it is organized, for example, on smartphones and tablets.  But this not only does not interfere with reading, but on the contrary helps to calm the eyes.  The gadget's interface does not slow down at all and almost immediately opens large libraries.  Naturally, on the ‚ÄúLes Miserables‚Äù of Hugo (5 volumes) or on ‚ÄúPeople of Good Will‚Äù of Farigul (27 volumes), the device will stumble and think for a while. </p><p>  Touch control may not be as accurate, but sensitive, and tap does not require strong pressure.  Sometimes this control greatly facilitates the operation, but basically it is much more interesting, and more practical (the screen does not get fingers dirty) to work with the mechanical component. </p><p>  Users in their reviews say that they are completely satisfied with the characteristics of the screen.  For the reader, the proposed matrix capabilities and the output image are the very thing.  The gadget does not lose paper media at all: the high definition of the image, the view under the ‚Äúsheet canvas‚Äù and the presence of backlighting are pleasing. </p><h2>  Work impressions </h2><p>  The gadget can read books aloud, but with one nuance unpleasant for the domestic consumer - only in English and Chinese.  The same amateur firmware can correct this defect, but the voice assistant does not always work correctly, and it reads strictly defined fonts. </p><p>  Pleased with the abundance of codecs.  In addition to the usual TXT, FB2 and RTF formats, the device recognizes the mobile extensions MOBI and EPUB, as well as the rare PRC, TRC, SNM and OEB.  Moreover, no problems arise with the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù PDF format.  Everything that the reader "eats" is displayed properly and without any problems, if the file itself does not. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  As for some additional features, judging by the reviews, there are practically none of them.  Yes, and expect from the reader something like a video or radio is not necessary.  Users note that the gadget loses music quite tolerably, although small drawdowns occur if an audio file in high bitrate is caught.  Pictures, like photographs, are displayed in black and white without any hue or saturation. </p><p>  In general, the device copes with its purpose 100%, and for other charms, refer to the shelf with tablets and smartphones. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Matrices of this plan, working on electronic ink technology, are extremely energy efficient, because the main energy consumption occurs when turning pages and working with navigation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gmini magicbook t6hd review" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1722721.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  Battery life can be calculated, if not months, then weeks - for sure.  Our respondent was no exception, and field trials showed that even when reading up to five hours a day, the device will ask for an outlet no more than once every three weeks.
