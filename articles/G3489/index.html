  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Original vases from plastic bottles do-it-yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Handmade masters use a wide variety of materials in their crafts.  One of the easy to use is a plastic bottle.  From it you can make beautiful flowers, toys for children, a weather vane for the garden, arrange a fence in the flowerbed or make a beautiful curtain in the summer kitchen in the country. </p><p>  In the article, we will talk about how to make a vase from a plastic bottle with our own hands, describe in detail the order of the work, and tell you what materials will be needed for this.  Many will say what kind of vase it is - just cut off the top of the bottle, pour water and you can already plant flowers.  But in our article we will talk about other, original vases from a plastic bottle, which are difficult to create with your own hands. </p><h2>  Confetti vase </h2><p>  For such a craft, you need to purchase white acrylic paint, have colorful circles from colored paper or ready-made confetti, beautifully shaped plastic bottles with a narrow neck.  To make a vase from a plastic bottle with your own hands, you first need to wash the container, remove the sticker with glue from its surface.  The bottle should be dry and clean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="modpodgerocksblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="painted vases" class="if uuid-2295883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295883.jpg"></div><p>  Then we are taken for coloring crafts.  To do this, pour a little white acrylic paint inside and turn the bottle in all directions so that the entire inside of the container is painted.  To dry, the bottle is flipped over the neck and placed on an oilcloth to allow excess glass paint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then you need to decorate a vase from a plastic bottle with your own hands.  Prepare PVA glue and small colored circles.  They are glued in a circle with a wide strip in the center of the container.  At the end, the paper is coated with either a layer of PVA glue or acrylic varnish. </p><h2>  Vase on a stand </h2><p>  The next option for making a vase from a plastic bottle with your own hands (photo later in the article) will be a container on a stand.  The appearance of such an craft resembles a glass. </p><p>  To make such a vase, you will need a hot iron, scissors, superglue, acrylic paints of different colors.  As a leg for a vase, you can use either a wide plastic cover or an unnecessary CD-ROM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.simplecraftidea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vases on the legs" class="if uuid-2295895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295895.jpg"></div><p>  With sharp scissors you need to cut the bottle near the neck.  You can make a small vase for snowdrops or other stunted flowers, or you can make a cut higher, then you will get a floor vase with your own hands from plastic bottles. </p><p>  To make the edge smooth and rounded, use a hot iron.  Preheat it and attach the bottle to the hot metal with a cut.  It will melt a little and the edges will be rounded.  Then painting begins.  Acrylic paint is poured into the container and it turns with its hands in different directions until the entire inner surface is painted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We do the same with the cork or disk.  When everything is dry, proceed to attaching the legs to our vase.  To do this, the cork is turned upside down and smeared with superglue.  We lower the bottle down on it and, having pressed it down a little, hold it for several minutes so that the parts are well fastened together. </p><h2>  Woven vase </h2><p>  For such a vase from a plastic bottle with your own hands you need to prepare a large two-liter bottle.  Color can be any.  A little above the middle with sharp scissors, the neck is cut off.  Then vertical strips are cut, but not completely, so that you can pour water for the flowers.  Then all the strips are bent outward along the notch line.  It is convenient to simultaneously bend the stripes, turn the bottle upside down and lightly press. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.logansshooterssupplies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="woven vase" class="if uuid-2295876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295876.jpg"></div><p>  Then the most painstaking work begins.  Each strip must be bent at an angle and, passing through the adjacent strip, wrap for the next two.  This is done with all the bands in a row.  The bends need to be carefully smoothed with a finger so that the vase looks neat and even. </p><p>  When everything is done, you can pour water and plant flowers.  If you decide to make a color vase, then you can either buy a bottle of colored plastic, or paint it with acrylic paints.  You can also dream up and decorate the craft by tying a satin fluffy bow or a strip of fabric in a circle.  You can decorate with a cloth or burlap, paste over with shells or eggshell.  You can decorate a finished vase with any material you wish. </p><h2>  Openwork craft </h2><p>  The following craft is done by cutting the neck and burning holes like lace.  For this procedure, use a wood burner.  The hot rod just needs to be leaned against the plastic in the right place and the hole will melt right there.  If you want to increase its size, then the burner needs to be held a little longer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homesthetics.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork vases" class="if uuid-2295907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295907.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to paint the finished vase with paint of the selected color from the spray can. </p><p>  The article describes several options for manufacturing plastic vases.  You can decorate them at will with any materials.  In the photo presented in the article, all finished products are visible, so after reading the article, you can easily make such crafts yourself. </p>
