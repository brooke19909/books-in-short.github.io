The yarn quality of this manufacturer is often high or satisfactory.  Of course, sometimes there are materials that cause negative reviews, but their number is small. </p><p>  Yarn for knitting "Yarnart Jeans" is one of the most popular materials.  It is comfortable, practical, fits perfectly and worn.  More details about the features of this thread and how to better use it will be described later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; color 11" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354246.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  "Yarnart Jeans": composition and general characteristics </h2><p>  The popularity of this yarn is mainly due to the optimal ratio of its quality, price and thickness of the thread.  Yarnart Jeans is 55% cotton and 45% acrylic.  Labeling on the label contains the abbreviation PAC, which stands for "polyacryl." </p><p>  Such a composition allows clothes tied from Jeans to let air in and absorb moisture.  This is important, since fully synthetic materials create the effect of a greenhouse around the body: a person is either very hot or cold.  For this reason, experienced knitters strongly do not recommend the use of 100% acrylic for either summer products or winter ones (even if the thread is very similar to wool or mohair). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The presence of acrylic fibers in the "Jeans" performs several functions: </p><ul><li>  Cheaper material. </li><li>  Makes the knitted product easier. </li><li>  This results in a color that is more resistant to fading and washing. </li><li>  Gives the fabric a softness that cannot be achieved using exclusively cotton thread. </li></ul><h2>  What to knit? </h2><p>  The thickness of the yarn is characterized by the ratio of the length of the thread in the skein and its weight.  "Yarnart Jeans" is packaged in skeins weighing 50 grams, each of them contains 160 m of thread (320 m / 100 grams). </p><p>  <span>This is a yarn of</span> medium thickness, which is considered universal.  Beginners can safely use it, since all the loops will be visible very well and it is possible to avoid mistakes.  Also, this material is a favorite of many knitters with decent experience: after learning with thin cotton, ‚ÄúIrish lace‚Äù and other aerobatics, they want to quickly connect something simple.  Yarn Yarnart Jeans is perfect for this, depending on the complexity of the pattern, the growth of the canvas is noticeable within a few hours after the start of work. </p><p>  The recommended parameters for knitting tools are indicated on the label of each skein: knitting needles and hook No. 3,5.  As practice has shown, the range can well be expanded: </p><ul><li>  Knitting needles from 2 to 4 mm. </li><li>  Hook from 3 to 4.5 mm. </li></ul><p>  The choice of tools depends on how tightly knits the craftswoman and how tight she wants to get. </p><h2>  Yarnart Jeans: colors and applications </h2><p>  The palette of this material is extremely diverse.  Here you can find color for every taste and for various purposes.  A distinctive feature of the ‚ÄúJeans‚Äù color is its slight abrasion, which imitates the denim style.  This effect becomes more noticeable after several washings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When working with this yarn, it should be borne in mind that it will not be very warm (only material with the content of wool, angora or mohair has this property).  So it should not be used for the manufacture of winter hats and scarves, mittens and sweaters with a high neck. </p><p>  "Jeans" is suitable for the manufacture of autumn and spring <span>sweaters, pullovers</span> and tunics.  It can also be used to tie a poncho for cool summer evenings or a wide open cardigan. </p><p>  Often this thread is used to decorate a home interior.  Here, the thickness and wide color palette of Jeans can be fully utilized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; color 63" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354242.jpg" width="255"></div>

    <p>  Very comfortable and beautiful are knitted <span>sofa cushions,</span> rugs, bedspreads, stool pads. </p><h2>  Interior decor </h2><p>  For <span>knitting pillows,</span> you can choose a color that fits perfectly into the interior or, conversely, will become a bright accent.  It is easiest to work with square pillows, because here it is only important to adhere to the main dimensions and to adhere to the pattern. </p><p>  Round knitted pillowcases are harder to make.  Here you can not do without basic knowledge of the principles of expansion of circular canvases.  Of course, do not be scared and refuse to fulfill your ideas.  Otherwise, how to get the necessary experience?  You just need to take into account the difficulties and nuances and do not deceive yourself about your abilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Pillows connected by a zigzag pattern look interesting and original.  In addition to the decorative effect, this approach opens up the possibility of utilizing the remains of yarn in almost any color. </p><p>  When knitting fabrics with even stripes, you can easily get a lurid and rough pattern.  However, strips with sharp teeth or waves make it possible to organically fit even such contrasting shades of Yarnart Jeans yarn: color 11 and 52. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; colors" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354245.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  Of course, it is better if similar colors are present in one canvas.  When this is not possible, the darkest shade should be used as a separator.  If we are talking about the use of green materials, Yarnart Jeans yarn, color 63, will do just fine with this role. Several dark rows should be allowed after each color strip. </p><h2>  Jeans and voluminous braids </h2><p>  Yarn has an interesting and dense torsion.  This is of great importance for the manufacture of paintings with braids (they are also tows or arana).  From "Jeans" very clear and embossed ornaments are obtained, so the craftswoman can safely display the entire volume of her design abilities, the result in any case will be excellent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; composition" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354241.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  There is a good method to increase the volume of convex elements of aranes: you need to cross an unequal number of loops, leaving more on the front side than on the wrong side.  For example, the best solution would be to knit bundles, each strand of which is 3 loops.  In this case, the strands should be crossed with one loop of the base.  This knitting is good for bags, since in combination with thin knitting needles it creates an extremely dense fabric. </p><h2>  Men's products </h2><p>  Thinking about how to quickly and with minimal cost to connect a men's pullover, many craftswomen choose "Jeans".  The use of gray, blue, green or brown shades can be considered optimal. </p><p>  A wide palette allows you to combine and combine different shades of yarn "Yarnart Jeans": color 33 with colors 54 and 55, for example.  Traditionally they are distributed in stripes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; color 33" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354244.jpg" width="529"></div>

    <p>  Men's products look great, for the manufacture of which a plain thread of a blue hue was used.  The effect of wear allows you to combine such pullovers and sweaters with jeans. </p><p>  Most often, these types of clothes are knitted, because the thread is quite thick and the fabric made by the hook will be very dense.  However, if the idea is to get a jacket with a fastener that resembles a jacket, using a hook will be justified. </p><h2>  Openwork clothes </h2><p>  Often, "Jeans" is chosen to knit an openwork tunic, a women's or <span>children's pullover.</span>  For these purposes, Yarnart Jeans yarn - color 18 or other light shades is the best suited. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot;" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354247.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <p>  An interesting combination of pink and purple flowers of various intensities (shades of 19, 20, 50).  For lovers of Barbie style, the manufacturer offers a huge amount of pink yarn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarnart &quot;Jeans&quot; color 18" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1354243.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <p>  When planning the creation of an openwork cloth, the craftswoman must understand that the thicker the knitting needles, the more loose the knitting will turn out.  For a shawl or poncho that will be thrown over other clothes, you can use very large knitting needles, for example No. 4. A feature of this pattern is the dispersion: because of the large holes it will be implicit.  For this reason, for such products you should not choose complex ornaments, they will still be impossible to appreciate. </p><h2>  Instead of output </h2><p>  Yarn "Jeans" is recommended for beginners and "experienced" for knitting a variety of products.  Its high performance makes it possible to produce durable, beautiful and comfortable wardrobe items for all family members. </p>
