Beaches of Koh Larn</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thailand is the best place to relax.  In this country, there is absolutely everything that a tourist needs for an ideal vacation - these are wonderful white sand beaches and attractions that you must see with your own eyes, because only in this way you can be sure of the charm of this place. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The largest island located near Pattaya </h2><p>  Of course, the most famous resort in the country is Pattaya.  The islands (Ko Lan, Sichang) of Thailand, however, are also very popular among vacationers.  A huge number of tourists visit them annually. </p><p>  The island of Koh Lan, or as it is also called Coral Island, is the largest of them.  Due to the huge number of reefs located on the coast, it primarily attracts its visitors with its perfectly clear sea, as well as beaches.  Literally every 40 minutes, a ferry arrives at this place, which is almost always full of people. </p><p>  The approximate length of the island is only 4 kilometers, and the highest point in this place is located at an altitude of about 205 meters above sea level.  The whole economy here is 100% dependent on earnings from tourists, which, thanks to the close location of Koh Lan to a very popular resort, is quite large. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Things to do on Koh Lan </h2><p>  By the way, there is no public transport familiar to Europeans on the island, this is due to the fact that the distance between the settlements here is scanty.  But, despite this, the so-called motorcycle taxis are quite popular in this place.  For a tiny fee, they will take you anywhere in the island, including the beaches.  They are famous for this place.  Here you can spend your time swimming in the clear water and basking under the gentle rays of the sun.  Sea activities - this is why tourists primarily visit the island of Koh Lan.  The beaches here are always clean, as is the water itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What can you do here?  Diving, snorkeling, riding on bananas, as well as tablets - this is just a small list of entertainment, so you certainly will not be bored! </p><h2></h2><h2>  Wild and official beaches </h2><h2></h2><p>  The beaches of Koh Lan Island can be divided into two types: ‚Äúwild‚Äù and, so to speak, official.  In the first case, we are talking about a place for swimming without various amenities (locker rooms, shops, cafes, umbrellas, etc.).  Official beaches, in contrast, are fully equipped for relaxation, which makes them more attractive in the eyes of tourists. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Tawaen </h2>

    <p>  This is the best place for a family holiday.  The bottom is sandy, like the beach itself.  However, there is one rather big disadvantage for some: there are a lot of vacationers here, so it‚Äôs obviously not suitable for lovers of silence.  But overall, this is a great place where you can spend the most unforgettable days of your life.  The beach is especially popular among Russian vacationers, there are a lot of them.  By the way, it is here that ferries from the world famous resort of Pattaya come. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Thong lang </h2><p>  One certainly cannot say about this place that it is insanely popular, because it is not so at all.  Basically, tourists from China spend their time here.  This beach, most likely, should be attributed to the "wild", because you really can‚Äôt find where locker rooms, umbrellas, sun loungers, etc. are located. But this place will be ideal for those who do not like noise and prefer to relax alone. .  Although there used to be a lot of people here, however, after the road leading here collapsed, tourists were significantly reduced here.  The only way to get to this place is by jet ski or other similar transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Nual </h2><p>  The island of Koh Lan is also famous for its famous beach called Naul - a paradise for those people who truly appreciate and love nature.  Only in this place you can see a unique sight: swimming of the native monkeys.  Sometimes, for fun, tourists call them indigenous islanders. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Daeng </h2><p>  This is a very unusual beach, because you can splash around in water enough only during the onset of the tides.  The rest of the time, tourists are invited to watch the not-so-attractive bottom and bask in the sun.  There are no amenities here, unless you can rent umbrellas and play at the shooting range. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Low cost of services - a big plus for relaxing on Koh Lan </h2><p>  Judging in general, then, of course, servicing the beaches themselves does not yet reach the accepted world standards.  In addition, the prices here are quite acceptable and, as they say, ‚Äúdo not bite,‚Äù for example, renting an umbrella will cost you about 30-100 rubles in Russian, which is quite a penny compared to the cost of this service at other resorts.  It is because of the cheap service that Koh Lan Island <strong></strong>  became even more popular. </p>
