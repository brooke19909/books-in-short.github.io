Clear sea and white sand ... This is a real paradise! </p><h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  Nissi Beach Resort 4 * is located on the coast, which is an indisputable advantage.  A private beach extends in front of the hotel, followed by the Mediterranean Sea.  It offers vacationers a huge tropical garden, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100,000 square meters, and three pools.

    <p>  Vacationers note the presence in the room even of a box with threads and a needle.  Of course, this is a trifle, but still nice.  Sometimes it is necessary to sew something, but nothing.  It‚Äôs somehow not to carry with you hand.  And running away is also inconvenient.  Such small, but significant nuances in service are always pleasing. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  For various events, Nissi Beach Resort provides a conference room with all modern equipment.  Qualified and experienced staff will be able to help you organize any event, and translation services are also provided, as people from different parts of the world relax at the hotel. </p><p>  The hotel has four rooms of different sizes.

And the smallest one is designed for 30 people (area 52.5 square meters). </p><p>  The hotel also hosts wedding events.  Employees provide services for organizing such a celebration. </p><p>  As for food, half board is practiced here.  Regarding food reviews, we can say that in general all tourists are satisfied.  No one remains hungry, there is a variety and nutritious dishes.  You can always choose something new and interesting. </p>

True, this will not bring much joy to our tourists, since everyone arrives by plane. </p><p>  If you want to enjoy the beauties of Cyprus and ride a bit, then you can rent a car at the hotel.  This is very convenient, because you don‚Äôt even need to go outside the complex. </p><h2>  Sports and tourism </h2><p>  One of the best holiday destinations in Cyprus is Nissi Beach Resort.

    <p>  In general, in Nissi Beach Resort (reviews of vacationers confirm this) children's leisure is quite well organized.  A team of children's animators works with kids from morning till night.  Parents are satisfied with their work, because it is very important to engage with the benefit of the children throughout the day.  And parents can take the time to attend adult events, and the children have fun and interesting. </p><h2>  Bars and restaurants within the complex </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to bars and restaurants, since many people are interested in the issue of nutrition.  Not everyone is satisfied with the half-board option, and still I sometimes want to change the situation and spend the evening in a good institution. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has the following bars and restaurants: </p><ol><li>  <em>Ambrosia</em> <em><strong> </strong></em>  <em>Restaurant.</em>  This institution has a beautiful veranda with a beautiful view of the tropical gardens.  The restaurant invites you for breakfast, lunch and dinner, serving international cuisine.  Very often the institution organizes thematic "buffets". </li><li>  <em>Nissi Taverna.</em>  This is the most common Greek tavern with a beautiful view of the sea bay.  It offers traditional local dishes and delicacies, seafood dishes.  The tavern is open all day, but only during the warm period (from April to November). </li><li>  <em>Bacchus Bar and Terrace.</em>  This is a wonderful bar where you can sit quietly in the shade of bougainvilleas, enjoying food and drinks.  In the evening, visitors are entertained by live music and fun activities. </li><li>  <em>Pool Snack Bar.</em>  This bar is located on the terrace by the pool.  Throughout the <span>day, the bartender</span> offers you a variety of soft drinks, cocktails and juices, sandwiches and light snacks. </li><li>  <em>Beach Kiosks.</em>  Five small <span>stalls</span> are located on the seashore.  In them you can buy drinks, snacks, cocktails. </li></ol><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  Particular attention is paid not only to the rooms, but also to the beach, for which thousands of new tourists come here, from the smallest to people of age.  Nissi Beach is 500 meters long.  This is a private landscaped area.  The hotel complex itself is located on the banks of a beautiful lagoon, which is protected from external influences by the islet of Nissi.  Here you can swim, dive, sail, or just walk along the sea in the evening, listening to the sound of the waves. </p>

    <p>  All tourists are definitely satisfied with the beautiful clean beach and the wonderful sea.  Here, with regard to umbrellas and deck chairs, there are a lot of negative comments.  The fact is that when buying a tour it is said that the beach at the hotel has its own, with its own equipment.  In fact, vacationers are faced with the problem that the staff offers only free umbrellas, sunbeds need to be paid separately (2.5 euros per day).  However, if there are no free trestle beds on the beach, then you have no right to use an umbrella.  In general, it turns out that whatever one may say, you still have to pay.  Also, tourists do not like the fact that an employee walks on the beach and constantly checks for paid tickets for sun loungers.  According to vacationers, this is inconvenient, and does not match the level of the hotel. </p><h2>  Nissi Beach (hotel): traveler reviews </h2><p>  Wherever we decide to go on vacation, choosing a resort and hotel, we rely primarily on the reviews of those people who have already been there.  From the experience of others, we form our opinion about the place.  On the one hand, this is correct, since only in this way can one find out the real state of affairs.  Agree that not a single operator and hotel will tell the whole truth, and even more so will not talk about the cons.  This is contrary to their ethics.  Unpleasant surprises appear when a person has already arrived on vacation and cannot change anything. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, each vacationer has his own views on the same service.  Someone likes everything, and someone is more picky.  From a large number of reviews, we form an opinion whether we should go to some place or not. </p><p>  As for the Nissi Beach Resort, the reviews about the rest in it are contradictory. </p><p>  Apparently, the quality of cleaning the rooms and the furnishings of the apartments themselves depend on the cost of housing.  But the fact that the hotel was renovated not so long ago sets up in a positive way, which means that the conditions have been improved. </p><p>  The most enthusiastic reviews from tourists are caused by the sea and the beautiful territory of the hotel.  She is very well-groomed, which is confirmed by numerous photos of vacationers. </p><p>  The good location of the hotel complex is also pleasing.  Not every complex can boast of being on the very shore of the bay. </p><p>  There are regular customers who come here from year to year.  Apparently, people are attracted to something in this place. </p><p>  The tourists leave mixed reviews regarding the food.  Some are unhappy with the lack of variety and taste of the dishes.  But it should be understood that this is a purely individual judgment.  Still, the priorities in nutrition are different for everyone.  The hotel does not update the supply of water in the rooms, so people themselves have to purchase it, which is not very pleasing to tourists.  During the rest, drinks cost a tidy sum. </p>

    <p>  Pets are not allowed in the hotel, and a similar question cannot be resolved even if there is a preliminary request.  In this regard, the administration has a clear position.  It will be useful to know for those who are used to traveling with their pet. </p><p>  But the organization of evening leisure deserves special praise.  Animators work well.  Every evening in the summer, for the adult part of vacationers, theme nights with live music, dance events are organized.  In general, you can not rush to leave the complex, looking for entertainment, since there is something to occupy yourself with, you really will not be bored. </p><p>  If desired, tourists can visit the numerous bars and restaurants located outside the complex, a good location favors this. </p><p>  Very happy with the stay are couples with children, because the sea is very close.  In order to get to the beach, you do not need to go far and cross any roads and tracks, which is typical for many hotels located not on the first line.  In fact, all the time you are on the coast, avoiding the bustle and noise of the city.  In the evenings you can not only walk along the coast and breathe in the sea breeze, but also wander in the silence of the park‚Äôs exotic alleys. </p>

    <p>  Pools also find their customers.  Oddly enough, but some vacationers prefer to bathe in them.
