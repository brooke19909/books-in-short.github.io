Then this article will be your salvation.  Many of the life hacks below will improve the quality of shooting even on the most ordinary camera.  You will learn <span>how to make a photo</span> clearer without special skills and efforts. </p><h2>  Steady camera position </h2><p>  The main reason for blurry photography is movement during shooting.  In order to prevent this, you need a stabilization system in the phone.  If this is not on your phone, then you can purchase a tripod that will fix the position of the device.  But many do not want to purchase such a holder, as it is too bulky and inconvenient.  In this case, it is recommended to hold the smartphone with both hands when shooting. </p><p>  Also, shaking of the device may occur when you need to touch the screen to take a photo.  You can fix this using the timer, which is built into the smartphone‚Äôs camera by default.  Another good way is to use the volume buttons to take a picture without taking your hands off the case.  Also, if you connect the headphones to the phone, then using the button on them you can take a photo. </p><p>  Since making a photo clearer is quite a difficult process, programmers have come up with special photo applications that have an anti-shake function.  Camera FV-5 is just such a program for the Android operating system.  And for users of iOS phones, ProCamera will be the best program for these purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.online-tech-tips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make photo clearer" class="if uuid-2740120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90765/2740120.jpg"></div><h2>  Lens cleaning </h2><p>  Very often the pictures are blurry due to the fact that the camera lens is fogged up or there are spots and dirt on it.  To eliminate this problem, it is enough to wipe the lens with a soft cloth, and it is best to use special wipes for the lenses for this purpose.  But if stains or dust are not wiped, then you need to take it to a service center.  Specialists will either do professional cleaning or completely replace the camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also on sale there are sets of lenses for the phone that improve the quality of shooting.  These lens attachments allow you to take macro shots, the fisheye effect, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.online-tech-tips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a clear photo out of blurry" class="if uuid-2740122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90765/2740122.jpg"></div><h2>  Focus adjustment </h2><p>  Most people use auto focus when taking a photo, but it doesn‚Äôt always work perfectly.  Therefore, this is also the reason for not clear photos.  On many phones, you can adjust the focus by tapping the screen where you want the focus to be.  There is also a very useful focus lock function that allows you to change the frame, but the focus will be fixed at the place where you set the point.  This is a great option to make your photo clearer. </p><p>  For iPhone device owners, to lock the autofocus, just click on the desired location on the screen and hold until a lock appears.  In order to return autofocus, you need to click once at any point on the screen. </p><p>  But users of an Android smartphone will need to download additional applications, since by default this function is not built into the camera.  The Camera FV-5 program we mentioned above has a focus lock, called AF-L. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="petapixel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a photo clearer" class="if uuid-2740166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90765/2740166.jpg"></div><h2>  Light setting </h2><p>  It is known that in good lighting quality photos are obtained.  Therefore, it is worth paying special attention to exposure during shooting.  If there is not enough lighting, and you try to arrange the correct exposure, the camera will keep the lens open for a long time.  This means that photos can be blurry and with noise. </p><p>  One of the ways to make a photo clearer is not to use digital zoom, because when you approach a future picture, sharpness and clarity are lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="images.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a photo clearer" class="if uuid-2740115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90765/2740115.jpg"></div><h2>  Clarity apps </h2><p>  Not always, even with the use of professional equipment, images are obtained in high-quality and structural.  Therefore, many are wondering how to make a clear photo out of blurry?  Programs for processing photographs come to the rescue.  Now in the "Play Store" and the App Store is full of applications in which you can adjust the clarity and sharpness of the photo, but not all of them cope with this goal at 100%.  Below is the top of the best free programs for iOS and Android that will help you adjust the photo: </p><ol><li>  SnapSeed </li><li>  VSCO Camera. </li><li>  Adobe Photoshop Express </li><li>  Aviary </li><li>  Instagram </li><li>  Lightroom CC. </li><li>  MOLDIV. </li><li>  Afterlight </li><li>  Picsart. </li></ol><p>  How to make a fuzzy photo clear using a computer?  The answer to this question is simple - download the program, and in just a few seconds you will get a beautiful structural photo.  During photo processing, it is best to sharpen one specific element, not the entire picture.  This method will help to preserve naturalness, and the photo will turn out not catchy.  Top computer programs: </p><ul><li>  Adobe Photoshop  The rating for this application is 10/10. </li><li>  Movavi Photo Editor - 9/10. </li><li>  GIMP - 8.5 / 10. </li><li>  Paint.NET - 8.5 / 10. </li><li>  ACDSee - 8.5 / 10. </li></ul><p>  Improving the quality of photographs is a rather laborious affair.  Some bloggers spend a day to get a great photo.  But very often the corrected photos come out unnatural and are not so pleasing to the eye.  But still, how to make the photo clearer?  To do this, it is recommended to immediately configure the camera so that the result is a beautiful picture. </p>
