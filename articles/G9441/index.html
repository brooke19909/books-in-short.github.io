Again at sea or hiking in the mountains?  Most, of course, will answer - at sea.  And in order for this vacation to take place without unnecessary excesses, without noise, din, but close to the coast, it is now necessary to start cooking it. </p>

    <h2>  Get acquainted </h2><p>  Where to begin?  Well, maybe from the place where I would like to go or look for a new one.  Open Yandex.Map and methodically explore the warm sea coast.  There are lots of wonderful places on the map, but in order to combine a relaxing holiday and the presence of civilization in the form of quality service, you need to listen to the opinions of experienced travelers and ... your own intuition. </p><p>  In any case, you can safely plan a vacation at the Guest House ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù in Kabardinka, according to reviews - this is just a charming place. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Kabardinka is considered the pearl of the Krasnodar Territory.  A very good location relative to the sea and the bustling large resort cities gives him such a privilege. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you go along the federal highway "Don" (Sukhumi highway), then in the middle between Gelendzhik and Novorossiysk along the Black Sea coast stretches a nice quiet resort Kabardinka. </p>

    <p>  The proximity of the sea, wonderful seaside climate, moderate prices for rental housing in the summer at the Guest House ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù in Kabardinka, well-developed infrastructure, transport accessibility of attractions - all this makes the village so attractive for vacationers. </p><h2>  The climate of the region </h2><p>  The climate is very unique even for the Black Sea coast.  After all, here is the lowest humidity in the district.  The warm sea, the largest number of sunny days a year, unique healing air. </p><p>  Kabardinka is located on the territory of a beautiful valley in the <span>Tsemess Bay.</span>  On both sides of the sharp sea winds and storms, Kabardinka is closed by Cape Doob and the Markotkh Range. </p><p>  The most comfortable climate for relaxing is considered to be the period from the beginning of May to the end of October.  Summer temperature indicators reach + 32 ¬∞ C, and in winter sometimes up to + 15 ¬∞ C.  This makes it possible to think about winter holidays here.  Sometimes, for a change, the New Year can be without snow, but with the sea, Neptune and the Little Mermaid instead of Santa Claus and the Snow Maiden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span><span>You can find out from the attentive and very friendly owners and staff of the Prague guesthouse in Kabardinka a description of the weather nuances for months, or find out from his former guests.</span></span> </p><h2>  Where to spend time besides the beach? </h2><p>  If you want to walk and stretch your legs, disconnect from exclusively summer beach activities, then you should familiarize yourself with those sights that are literally step-by-step accessible from the Prague guest house in Kabardinka. </p><p>  <em>Upside down house</em> .  Great place to have fun.  All upside down both inside and out!  Except the stairs at the entrance. </p>

    <p>  Furniture and appliances are perfectly ordinary, which from an unusual perspective looks very funny.  There are only chandeliers that can only interfere and create a danger to tourists. </p><p>  <em>The largest fountain of the Kuban</em> .  By the summer season of 2017, a fountain was created in Kabardinka in the best traditions of the 50s of the last century with a huge water bowl of 200 liters.  and with beautiful backlighting.  Evening walks of the guests of the Guest House ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù in Kabardinka will be even more romantic. </p><p>  <em>Holy Panteleimon Church</em> .  The first construction of the temple dates back to 1875.  Then the first immigrants in this area - the Greeks - built a temple in honor of the Holy Great Martyr and Healer Panteleimon and placed there an icon brought earlier from Turkey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1936, the temple was destroyed, like many throughout Russia. </p><p>  The current building was erected in 1994 with donations from the local population and is active. </p><p>  <em>Battery captain Zubkov</em> .  This is an open-air branch of the Gelendzhik Museum.  Here are genuine historical exhibits of the 394th battery of the 1st Guards Artillery Division of the Novorossiysk Naval Base of the Black Sea Fleet.  The commander of the battery was from 1941 to 1943, Andrei Emanuilovich Zubkov. </p><p>  Under his command, she heroically restrained the onslaught of the enemy for a year and did not allow the Nazi invaders into the strait, although all this time the enemies ruled over most of Novorossiysk.  But in mid-September 1943, the battery fired a final salvo at the outgoing enemies. </p><p>  <em>Kastalskaya font</em> .  A great place to relax among juniper thickets with cozy gazebos.  The second name is Trout Farm.  In the center is a lake where you can catch fish, which will be cooked here in the kitchen. </p>

    <p>  Since the Kastalsky font is popular among locals, reserving places is in advance. </p><p>  <em>Old park</em> .  It is considered the main attraction.  Here is the only place where architectural features of all cultures and peoples of the world are brought together and uniquely interwoven with natural elements.  This park was opened in 2007, and is called the old one due to the fact that ancient cultures are represented there.  A great opportunity to take a break from saturated sunny days and spend time in the shade and cool under the dense greenery. </p><p>  There is also a dolphinarium and an aquarium, entertainment clubs, possibly yachting, diving.  And if you want something more active, you can get to Gelendzhik or Novorossiysk. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  In Kabardinka, Guest House ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù, according to tourists, is one of the best on the entire coast from Gelendzhik to Novorossiysk.  If you look at the recommendations on the forums left by the impressed vacationers, it is clear why people, having been here once, come back again.  They also recommend it to their friends.  Of the negative, perhaps, only that the beaches are too small.  A photo of the Guesthouse ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù in Kabardinka on the official website is completely consistent with reality. </p>

    <p>  In such a great place, where you return your thoughts in cold snowy winters, the beaches should be large, so that in the next season they will welcome everyone warming here once in the summer.  And yet - it is better to buy wine on the recommendation or in local cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  It can also be emphasized that all the necessary shops, market, post office, pharmacy, bus station, bank, cafes and restaurants are within walking distance. </p><p>  In general, the Guest House itself is located extremely conveniently - a little away from the noise of the street and crowded promenade, but also not far from the center of the town. </p><h2>  Service at the guest house </h2><p>  To make sure of the highest quality of the offered and really provided services at the Guest House ‚ÄúPrague‚Äù in Kabardinka, it is enough to read the reviews of guests who are not the first to come here on vacation. </p><p>  Clean patio, great playground. </p><p>  There is a comfortable gazebo surrounded by greenery in the center of the courtyard, there is a barbecue made of bricks.  From here it will be clearly visible how the children play on the playground.  This layout speaks of a well-designed interior space.  So the parents will rest, and the children under supervision. </p>
