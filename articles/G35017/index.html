    <h2>  Saki Attractions </h2><p>  We will begin our acquaintance with interesting places of the city with the <span>famous park</span> located on the street of the same name, which locals are very proud of.  It is hard to believe that as far back as the end of the 19th century, the steppe stretched on this very spot. </p><p>  In 1890, the city authorities made a decision on landscaping the resort.  The talented gardener P. S. Melnichenko laid the Spa Park in 1891.  He managed to create the seemingly impossible - to make a variety of trees grow on saline soils. </p><p>  The first artesian well in the city was drilled, seedlings were planted, artificial ponds were created - and in just two years an oasis of shade and coolness appeared in the sultry steppe.  There are three lakes in the park.  One of them is Swan, the other two are notable for repeating the outlines of the Azov and Black Seas. </p>

    <p>  The land freed up during the creation of the reservoirs was used to build the original hill on which deciduous and coniferous shrubs were planted.  In total, over three years, 8700 trees and shrubs of 78 drought-resistant species that were brought from Europe, the Mediterranean countries, Japan, and China were planted. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today the park can be divided into two parts: the old one, with an area of ​​15 hectares, which was laid in 1890-1892, and the new one, which occupies 8 hectares, founded in 1953.  The resort park has about 100 species of trees and shrubs. </p><p>  The beauty of flower beds and alleys is revived by more than thirty sculptural compositions.  In addition, the park houses the Obelisk of Glory with eternal flame and the Museum of Local Lore. </p><h2>  Heroes Memorial of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Residents of a city called Saki are cautious and reverent to the memory of the heroes who fell during the war with fascist Germany.  Sights associated with the victory of the Soviet people are always in perfect condition. </p><p>  The memorial is located in the north-eastern part of the city.  Here lie eight heroes of the Soviet Union, which were part of the 3rd motorized battalion of the Perekop tank corps.  A group of military personnel under the command of Sergeant N.I. Poddubny in April 1944 was given the task of reconnaissance on the right flank of the offensive zone of the tank corps near the village of Ashaga-Jamin (today it is the village of Heroyskoye).  After a fierce battle, wounded fighters were captured and shot. </p>

    <h2>  St. Elias Church </h2><p>  The author of the project for this church was the famous Russian architect Kh. K. Vasiliev.  He built temples in Perekop, Alupka, Yanchokrak, Gurzuf.  The choice of a place for a new church in the center of a populous village was not chosen by chance.  There was a bell tower built in 1894, to which the master planned to add a temple building, combining both buildings with an identical design. </p><p>  The architect conceived the temple as an impressive construction in size.  Church of st.  Elijah was made in the style of Russian-Byzantine architecture.  During the years of Soviet power, the St. Elias Church was closed under the far-fetched pretext that the building had cracked and needed major repairs.  Meanwhile, cracks did not prevent the organization of a club in the room. </p>

    <p>  During this period, the church lost many decorative elements of the interior.  The temple was returned to the parishioners during the terrible years of the Second World War.  Here again, services began to be held, which continue to this day.  After 1990, the lost dome and four decorative chapters of the temple, interior decoration and murals, carved iconostasis were restored. </p><h2>  Kara-Tobe </h2><p>  This ancient fortification is located on the outskirts.  Saki (attractions of antiquity are of particular interest to tourists) - the old city.  In the past there was a Greek settlement, the foundation of which scientists date back to the 4th century.  BC  e.  Then it was called Evpatorion. </p><p>  In the 1st century BC, the Scythians managed to expel the Greeks from the Kara-Tobe hill and create their own settlement here, however, not for long.  After some time, the Scythians were defeated by the commander Diophantus, and the Greeks returned to the town.  On the hill, in its very center, a donjon was built - a square two-story tower. </p><p>  In the second half of the 1st century BC.  e.  northwestern Crimea again passed to the Scythians.  Soon Taurica was conquered by the Roman troops of Tiberius Sylvanas, who were called to help the locals.  The Romans were not here for long.  At the end of the 1st century, the Scythians returned here.  Their small hilltop village lasted for several decades.  At the beginning of the II century, residents left Kara-Tobe, fearing the Sarmatians invading Crimea. </p>

    <p>  In 2000, archaeological excavations were carried out in the site of Kara-Tobe, and the International Center “Kara-Tobe” was established.  The main part of the museum’s exposition consists of archaeological finds in the ancient settlement and Scythian necropolis.  Well preserved Greek dishes, covered with black and red varnish, unique “megar” bowls of the finest work.  Nearby you can see Scythian ceramics. </p><p>  The museum exhibits very rare, unique items.  This is, first of all, a plaster cast from an antique silver vessel, owned by a Roman jeweler.  On the second floor of the museum is an exhibition of ancient female jewelry - beads, rings, amulets, earrings, bracelets and brooches.  There are also fragments of terracotta sculpture. </p><p>  Another section is reserved for demonstrating the armament of Scythian warriors.  Here are the tips of spears and arrows, darts.  On the roof of the museum there is an observation deck with a magnificent panorama. </p><h2>  Square them.  Pushkin </h2><p>  In the center of the modern city is this pretty square.  It was created after the war on the initiative of the townspeople, who in the summertime languished from the heat.  As soon as young trees planted in the park began to create shade and coolness, it became a popular holiday destination. </p><p>  Here is a monument to the great Russian poet, created by the sculptor P.F. Movchun.  On the shady alleys there are small sculptural compositions of forged copper according to the plots of A.S. Pushkin. </p><h2>  Mineral water pump room </h2><p>  In the middle of the last century, Sack doctors discovered a new natural remedy.  A fountain of hot water (mineral) began to beat from a well that was drilled in 1956.  This slightly alkaline water contains many trace elements, some rare gases, nitrogen. </p><p>  Thanks to this combination, life-giving moisture has healing properties.  It was called the Crimean Mineral.  Today, Saki pump-room of mineral water is in almost every sanatorium of the city.  It is used for taking mineral baths, as well as for washing patients after mud procedures. </p>

    <h2>  Lake </h2><p>  Often this unique pond is called a kind of natural laboratory.  <span>Saki lake</span> in Crimea is famous for healing mud.  Until the beginning of the 20th century, two large therapeutic lakes were known on the territory of Russia - Sakskoe and Chokrak <span>(Kerch Peninsula).</span> </p><p>  In ancient times, the lake was a Black Sea bay.  In those days, salt was mined here.  At its very bottom about five thousand years ago, steel-gray and gray silts with a layer of salt began to accumulate.  A whole layer formed on top, and dark gray and black silts appeared.  They are healing mud.  Today Saki Lake in the Crimea is very popular.  Both locals and tourists have a rest here. </p>
