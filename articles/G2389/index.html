    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Nha Trang turned into a resort at a time when Vietnam was still a French colony.  Europeans who came here admired the beautiful bay with its islands and white beaches, ideal for relaxation.  So gradually began the transformation of Nha Trang into a resort city.  During the Vietnam War, this place was chosen by the American military, who stayed here very often. </p><p>  Today Nha Trang has become one of the most popular tourist destinations for both Russians and CIS residents.  Located on the shores of the South China Sea, at a distance of about one thousand three hundred kilometers south of Hanoi, the city is the capital of the Vietnamese province of Khanh Hoa.  Its population is more than 400,000 people.  There are always a lot of our tourists.  Apparently, therefore, Russian inscriptions can be seen everywhere.  Even in restaurants, the menu is duplicated in the native language of the Russians. </p><p>  But this is far from the only advantage of the resort.  Its many kilometers coast, sometimes lively, and in some areas secluded, is great for swimming.  In addition, Nha Trang has a developed tourist infrastructure with a large selection of hotels.  Each Russian will find the most convenient option for himself: a person who wants to save money, and a lover of a comfortable stay.  For the latter, many expensive hotels are built right on the seashore.  And for those who are in the economy class, cheaper hotels are great, for example, Thanh Binh 2 Hotel, whose photo and description are presented in this article.  The best time to travel to Nha Trang is winter, when the unbearable heat subsides.  The high season occurs in February, when there is no wind and waves at sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanh Binh 2 Hotel 2 Nha Trang" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2137445.jpg"></div>

In its ten-story building, only thirty-one rooms are equipped.  The hotel cannot boast luxurious decoration of rooms or their large area.  They are more suitable for those tourists who are satisfied with minimalism on vacation.  And this is not surprising when you consider the prices that are set at Thanh Binh 2 Hotel.  The description of the rooms corresponds to the declared category of the hotel.  All have a combined bathroom.  The hotel offers rooms of the following categories: deluxe with sea view and superior apartments.  The latter look out onto the street and feature a balcony. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  The filling of the rooms is standard: two single beds with bedside tables, wardrobe and trunk, a large mirror.  Superior apartments have a guest area. </p><p>  The entire hotel is connected to a single air conditioning system.  They also include satellite TVs, a paid minibar and a safety deposit box.  The code from him can be obtained from the administrator after payment. </p><p>  Ceramic or marble tiles on the floor.  Bathrooms have bathtubs with showers.  Room services such as breakfast or alarm clock are available upon request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanh Binh 2 Hotel 2 Nha Trang reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2137433.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Thanh Binh 2 Hotel has a restaurant and a bar.  This hotel only includes breakfast.  However, our tourists, already vacationing here, recommend buying a ticket only with accommodation - without food.  The fact is that in the restaurant of the hotel, as, indeed, in other Vietnamese hotels of similar star rating, a buffet is not provided.  Meals here can only be obtained with special coupons.  Visitors can choose what they have for breakfast, such as scrambled eggs or scrambled eggs, soup or garlic bread, etc. </p><p>  There are no fruits, desserts or drinks on the menu.  However, breakfast can be used to pay for tea or coffee.  Since, judging by the reviews of our countrymen, the quality of the dishes offered is not at the highest level, the vast majority of hotel guests eat outside of its territory.  Guests can dine both in the hotel restaurant and in one of the nearby inexpensive cafes.  Food and drinks can be brought to the room upon request. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  To get to the sea living in the hotel you need across the road.  Experienced tourists recommend being careful, walking calmly and raising your hand at the transition.  Usually, local drivers stop at this gesture. </p><p>  Upon request, hotel guests can receive beach towels at the reception free of charge.  The presence of such a service in the hotel, according to vacationers, is a plus.  Judging by the reviews, swimming on the beach is quite convenient.  At this point, the coastline is very clean.  The entrance to the sea is convenient, the water is clear.  As our compatriots note, in this part of the coast there are no algae and sharp stones. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  For entertainment, Thanh Binh 2 Hotel offers only paid educational tours.  However, the hotel has a fairly good location, so tourists can explore many attractions on their own.  For example, the famous Cape Hong Chong, located just a few minutes walk away, is a real stone garden that you must see. </p><p>  It is worth visiting the Thap Ba Thermal Center, which is less than three kilometers distant.  Judging by the reviews, most Russians did not even call a taxi to get to it, but preferred to go by public transport.  A bus ticket costs about two hundred rubles.  Here you can buy a course of wellness services, swim in the indoor pool, etc. About the same distance from the hotel is Hong Do, an ancient temple of the sun dating from the sixteenth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanh Binh 2 Hotel, photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2137429.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Positive feedback from tourists </h2><p>  The most controversial opinions are expressed by those who stayed at Thanh Binh 2 Hotel 2 *.  Nha Trang, which most Russians have only positive reviews about, is especially good in February when the monsoons stop blowing.  As for the hotel, it, according to most of our countrymen, is suitable for those tourists who prefer to spend a minimum of time on the hotel territory and return to their rooms only at night.  The prices at Thanh Binh 2 Hotel are fully consistent with the services offered. </p><p>  Among the advantages of this hotel, our compatriots note the proximity of the beach, the presence of a number of grocery stores and inexpensive cafes, and high-quality daily housekeeping.  A big plus is the fast Internet, which has good speed even during rush hours.  Many of our compatriots liked the fact that they did not need to bring beach towels with them.  The Russians appreciated the filling of rooms on a solid ‚Äúfour‚Äù: the furniture is good, the beds are wide and comfortable, the bed is snow-white. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanh Binh 2 Hotel Hotel Reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2137456.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  However, there are also negative reviews.  And first of all, they relate to nutrition: the portions in the restaurant are very small, and the quality and taste of the food leave much to be desired.  Therefore, the vast majority of residents eats outside the hotel - in nearby restaurants and cafes, for example, in an institution located on the second street from the hotel, which was called "At Lesha" and offered delicious Russian dishes.  Here, tourists especially recommend ordering shrimp, which are inexpensive and served in large portions.  Some say that they had problems with hot water in their rooms during the high season, when the hotel was almost crowded.  Many Russians did not like the quality of cleaning: judging by their reviews, the staff practically did not wipe the windows and mirrors.  Another minus of tourists consider the fact that <span>on the beach</span> do not give sunbeds and umbrellas: they have to buy.  Only half of the Russians eventually expressed a desire to return to this hotel again. </p>
