It is simple and convenient.  However, not everyone knows how to recharge a Post Bank card.  It is worth noting that credit institutions strive to make the most attractive service for customers, the use of which will not cause difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recharge card mail bank without commission" class="if uuid-3188484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3188484.jpg"></div><h2>  Translation Methods </h2><p>  Let's list the most popular ways that customers use. </p><ul><li>  ATM "Post Bank" or VTB. </li><li>  Online translation. </li><li>  Payment system. </li><li>  Post office. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that all methods are relevant, therefore, each client can independently choose the most preferred. </p><h2>  Online services </h2><p>  This option is often offered by banking organizations to those who are interested in how to top up the Bank Post card.  This option may turn out to be preferable not only for credit organizations, but also for the clients themselves.

This service is completely free.  If the transfer amount does not exceed three thousand rubles, no fee is charged from the client. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A client can carry out a similar financial transaction using not only the official website, but also the Post Bank mobile application, which must first be downloaded and then installed on its own electronic device. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, using the application, you can get a lot of additional information regarding your accounts, transfers, etc. Now you know one of the ways to replenish the balance of your Post Bank card.  By the way, a similar method is relevant for customers who use a loan product. </p><p>  It is also convenient to top up your phone with a Post Bank card using the online service.  After all, this method saves you from the need to search for an ATM, payment system office or post office, which, you see, is especially convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plusworld.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to replenish card account mail bank" class="if uuid-3188486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3188486.jpg"></div><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  This is another affordable option for customers who are interested in how to top up the Bank Post card.  However, it is worth noting that not everyone can find a similar device nearby.  Nevertheless, this option is relevant and a considerable number of customers find it convenient. </p><p>  Funds are credited free of charge if the client uses the Bank Post ATM or VTB.  It must be clarified that in a third-party device, funds are credited within 24 hours.  That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have to worry if the funds were not received to your card account on the day of replenishment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Be prepared to use the card or information specified in the contract.  An important addition is that the amount of one transaction should not exceed fifteen thousand rubles. </p><p>  As a rule, all clients manage to quickly find out how to replenish the Bank Post card.  This is due to the fact that the devices have a simple menu, which is quite easy to understand. </p><p>  After all the steps are completed, be sure to pick up the check, which will automatically print the ATM.  It is useful in case of unforeseen failures, as a result of which the transfer of funds to your card may not occur. </p><p>  Now you have learned yet another way to replenish your Bank Post card account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pochtabank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to replenish bank card" class="if uuid-3188487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3188487.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment systems </h2><p>  The credit institution has entered into agreements with a considerable number of partners for the convenience of its own customers.  This allows you to replenish the card balance not only online or at an ATM, but also in the Qiwi, Zolotaya Korona services, as well as in the Euroset company, etc. </p><p>  As a rule, funds are credited in these ways on the day of replenishment.  Also, be prepared to pay a commission.  Using these methods, it is possible to conduct a transaction for an amount that does not exceed fifteen thousand rubles. </p><p>  For some customers, it is the use of various means of payment that turns out to be the most convenient option when answering the question of where to replenish the Bank Post card. </p><p>  Be prepared to provide the contract number, data of the card holder, as well as the passport of the person who makes the deposit. </p><h2>  Post of Russia </h2><p>  This bank fully justifies its own name.  Clients were given the opportunity to replenish the Post Bank card at post offices located not only in large cities, but also in remote villages.  That's why for some customers this method will be more convenient than others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kuban24.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Post Bank" class="if uuid-3188489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3188489.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that replenishing the Bank Post card without a commission in this way will not work.  Be prepared to overpay two percent more of the amount you plan to contribute.  In this case, the minimum commission is forty rubles. </p><p>  The Russian Post also has restrictions on the amount of replenishment.  It is not more than five hundred thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  There is no single universal procedure for customers to replenish a bank card.  Let‚Äôs describe what actions need to be performed if you use the Bank Post ATM. </p><ul><li>  So, first of all, the client must prepare the funds and the card, which is planned to be replenished. </li><li>  On the device‚Äôs display, select the ‚ÄúMake Money‚Äù item.  Follow the prompts of the ATM if necessary. </li><li>  Next, you should deposit funds using a bill acceptor. </li><li>  Do not forget to receive a receipt confirming payment.  It will come in handy in case of technical failure. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, when using the Bank Post ATM, funds are credited on the same day.  Therefore, you do not have to wait long. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ura.news" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to replenish card balance mail bank" class="if uuid-3188490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3188490.jpg"></div><h2>  Tips &amp; Tricks </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt say for sure which method will be most convenient and preferable for you.  Moreover, in different situations, you can use different options from the proposed ones.  For example, someone prefers Internet banking, since this method allows you to transfer funds without a commission.  Some users, on the contrary, turn to representatives of payment systems or post offices, as it is required to provide only money and present documents, and the specialist will do the rest. </p><p>  In addition, Post Bank offers a free service called Auto Redemption and is intended for credit card holders.  This option is relevant for those users who, for whatever reason, forget to make the minimum payments on time.  This service allows you not to worry about the occurrence of any delinquencies, as funds will be automatically debited on the date set by the user.  It is enough to take care of the availability of funds on the date of writing off. </p>
