    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  So, first of all I would like to talk about the place where the <span>Beach Resort By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts is located.</span>  It is located on the first coastline, so the distance from the sea is minimal: less than two hundred meters.  And this is a very attractive factor for tourists.  This place is relatively far from the airport: approximately 75 kilometers.  However, this is rather a plus than a minus.  Firstly, the noise of the aircraft will not interfere with the guests.  And secondly, 40 kilometers is not so much, so a trip to the hotel does not take much time.  Tourists overcome the distance from the airport and this hotel in about one hour. </p><p>  Beach Resort By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts is a beach resort located on a hill with stunning sea views.  The eastern tip of the peninsula, located on the sea in such an emirate as Ras al-Khaimah, simply can not leave indifferent travelers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This chic hotel complex offers its guests comfort, coziness and true hospitality.  Many people stay at the hotel: from youth companies to senior couples.  All the advantages of the hotel should be described in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  Additional booking information </h2><p>  This is the last thing I would like to mention.  So, check-in is from 14:00 to 19:00, people can check out from six in the morning until noon.  And travelers who want to go on vacation with their children need to know that for such purposes they will have to find another option for the hotel, since the administration of the complex does not allow settling with minors. </p><p>  You also need to be prepared for the fact that the administration of the complex can pre-authorize the credit card of potential guests within a minimum time after booking.  And by the way, when registering on the spot at the hotel, potential guests are required to present the credit card that was used when booking.  If it suddenly happened that she stayed at home, you will need to pay the entire cost of the stay in hotel in cash. </p><p>  And the last: guests cannot bring drinks and food bought in other places to the hotel grounds.  But this can not even be considered a drawback.  Otherwise, the hotel is excellent, and thousands of tourists have already confirmed this. </p>
