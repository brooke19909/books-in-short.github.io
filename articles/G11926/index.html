Fate measured him only 65 years of earthly life, he spent most of his life in the arena of military operations, more than once was on the verge of death.  His track record does not occupy one page, and among the received awards there are also foreign orders. </p><h2>  Participation in the Patriotic War of 1812 </h2><p>  More than one bright page in the history of Russian strategy and tactics was written by Mikhail Mikhailovich Kuznetsov, whose biography began in 1791.  In the column "Origin" he boldly wrote - "from the Don Cossacks."  This meant that, firstly, from childhood he was used to staying in the saddle, and secondly, from an early age he underwent military training. </p><p>  Free life, surrounded by brave and courageous warriors, could not but temper his character, teach courage and endurance.  Kuznetsov Mikhail Mikhailovich did not receive a high position as an inheritance or patronage, he went step by step towards his cherished goal, gradually comprehending the great science of war.  The military service of the future hero began at the age of 18 (in 1808), of course, in the cavalry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshal Kuznetsov" class="if uuid-2888112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888112.jpg"></div><p>  In 1812, the young cavalryman, along with veterans of military operations, first participated in the Patriotic War of 1812, reflecting the attacks of the French troops.  The next two years, he takes part in overseas campaigns.  In 1813 he received two awards - the Order of St. Anne (4th century) and St. Vladimir (4th century), a year later - again the Order of St.  Anna, but already the 2nd degree. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The King of Prussia signs a decree awarding the hero with the Order of Pour le Mérite, and the Austrian Emperor with the Order of Leopold (3rd class).  These were the first foreign awards, new military battles awaited Kuznetsov ahead. </p><h2>  The suppression of the Polish uprising </h2><p>  The first third of the XIX century for the Russian Empire was marked by numerous wars and uprisings.  By 1831, Mikhail Mikhailovich Kuznetsov received the rank of colonel, only he had to use his military valor against “his” people - residents of the North-Western Territory and the kingdom of Poland.  Polish rebels dreamed of independence from the Russian Empire, the creation of their own state, but their plans were not destined to come true. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rusvelikaia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the Russian Empire" class="if uuid-2888108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888108.jpg"></div><p>  A few rebel groups from the Polish military, students and peasantry were opposed by a professional army, where Mikhail Mikhailovich Kuznetsov was among the leaders.  The result - the uprising was crushed, and the colonel received another award in the form of a golden saber, on which was engraved - the inscription "For courage".  In addition, the hero was expected by another award from the Kingdom of Poland - “Polish Military Order”, but he himself was waiting for his return to his homeland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legendary Ataman Regiment Commander </h2><p>  After the Russo-Polish war and the suppression of the uprising, Kuznetsov Mikhail Mikhailovich was promoted to major general.  It was he who was entrusted with the leadership of the famous Cossack Ataman regiment, bearing the name of His Imperial Highness Heir Tsesarevich. </p><p>  Documents show that a decade later, the Major General is already commanding the Life Guards Cossack Regiment.  In April 1843, he took command of the Don Cossack regiments in the army, and he himself took up a new position as lieutenant general.  Skillful actions at the post of marching chieftain are highly appreciated by the military leadership, awards follow one after another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusoch.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="museum in Paris" class="if uuid-2888115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98075/2888115.jpg"></div><p>  True, they are earned not in the rear, but on the front line, Kuznetsov takes part in the Hungarian campaign, in the Eastern War, fights with the Turks on the Danube and in Crimea.  In 1855, Mikhail Mikhailovich received indefinite leave in connection with a serious illness; in July 1856, a brave Cossack died after a long illness. </p><p>  The descendants were left with a list of his military decorations and a portrait that is now kept in the very heart of the French capital, in Paris, at the <sup>Museum of the</sup> Life Guards of the Cossack Regiment. </p>
