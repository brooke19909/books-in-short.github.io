Each flight may turn out to be the last, and nevertheless, they should experience the pleasure of flying, this is the main condition for admission to the ranks of these brave guys.  They sit at the helm of their car so that designers can modify or improve the <span>aircraft.</span> </p><h2>  Legendary test pilots </h2><p>  The former USSR is simply overflowing with heroes.  Some remained unknown in the history of the country, but not test pilots.  The names of these brave guys immediately recognized the political elite of the country.  Almost all of them received the title of hero of the USSR. </p><p>  One of such people whose name went down in the history of domestic aircraft manufacturing is Valery Chkalov.  Valery Pavlovich began as a fitter at the aircraft factory in Nizhny Novgorod.  And already in 1931 he tested the brand new I-15 and I-16 fighter planes. </p>

    <p>  For his stunts in the air, he even received a sentence and was sentenced to a year in prison, which was later replaced by a suspended sentence.  After all, Valery‚Äôs ‚Äúrecklessness‚Äù was recognized as new aerobatics.  In 1935, Chkalov was awarded the Order of Lenin.  Chkalov‚Äôs crew was the first to fly from the capital to the Far East.  And two years later, he flew across the North Pole and landed in Vancouver.  After such merits, Stalin offered Chkalov the post of People's Commissar of the NKVD, but Valery Pavlovich refused and continued to fly.  Test pilots who died during the flight are doubly heroes.  In December 1938, <span>Valery Chkalov</span> made his last flight.  He died while testing a new I-180 fighter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Military pilots </h2><p>  Test pilots during the Second World War played an important role in military aviation.  Despite the harsh conditions of the war, the Soviet Union was building up military power.  Airline engineering companies produced new advanced machines that required testing.  One of such heroes of the military sky was Sergei Nikolaevich Anokhin.  In 1931 he graduated from a higher glider school.  And already in 1933 set a record in his country.  He stayed in the sky for almost 16 hours on one glider.  Before the war, experienced experimental gliders. </p>

    <p>  During the war, he tested aircraft, gliders.  The first to test a fighter-interceptor with a liquid <span>rocket engine.</span>  In May 1945, during the testing of the Yak-3 fighter, the plane crashed, the pilot was seriously injured and lost his eye, but did not stop flying.  He conducted test flights on such aircraft as Yak, Mig, Su.  In 1959, in the top ten he received the title of Honored Test Pilot.  He made his last flight at the age of 73. </p><h2>  Test Pilot Awards </h2><p>  Until 1958, test pilots were not awarded all sorts of orders for services to their homeland, many retired without a single medal.  Many received the title "Hero of the USSR" only in 1957.  And in 1958, by decree of the Presidium of the Armed Forces, the honorary title ‚ÄúHonored Test Navigator of the USSR‚Äù and ‚ÄúHonored Test Pilot of the USSR‚Äù was established.  Only pilots of the 1st class could receive such a title and the corresponding order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In total, 419 test pilots were awarded this title in the Soviet period. </p><h2>  Post-war period </h2><p>  The development of aircraft manufacturing in the USSR became a priority in the post-war period.  The Cold War between the USSR and the USA led to an arms race.  Ahead was also <span>space exploration.</span> </p><p>  Another outstanding test pilot is Yuri Petrovich Scheffer.  Since 1977, he was a leading tester of the Tupolev plant.  Was in the detachment of the VKS Buran.  He participated in the tests of Su-25 and MiG-25 fighters. </p>
