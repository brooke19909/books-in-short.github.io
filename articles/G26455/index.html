How to make a pompom?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Naturally, in the cold season, we try to dress warmer and protect exposed parts of the body from the wind, especially the head.  For any fashionista, it is important not only to keep warm, but also the popularity and attractiveness of such a wardrobe element as a hat.  At the peak of modern fashion, a women's hat with a pompom is in great demand.  From the proposed variety of models, you can easily choose a style that is ideal for outerwear. </p><h2>  Headwear Models with Pompoms </h2><p>  More recently, it was fashionable to wear women's hats with a small pompom.  Over time, the decorative accessory grew in volume, and today you can find a fairly large element that seeks to equal the size of the head.  Girls wearing a headdress with a pompom look naive and very cute.  Their image acquires playfulness and tenderness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/484791777/large-fur-ball-hats-big-and-fluffy-pom"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's hat with pompom" class="if uuid-2236182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2236182.jpg"></div><p>  Caps can be both narrow and with volumetric texture.  Knitted models made of yarn are very popular.  The fur pompom is very effectively combined with this type of product.  The headgear can have a large knit of braids, tows, various patterns and elements.  Narrow hats often fit with a wide lapel; voluminous models usually have knitted or plastics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the color scheme, in this case there is no limit to human imagination.  Different collections present both monophonic models and a combination of all kinds of shades.  Women's hats with a pompom are very fashionable. They have a transient gradient in two, three, or even four colors. </p><h2>  Features of wearing caps with decor </h2><p>  The choice of headgear must be approached wisely.  Not every model can suit you.  Especially hats with several pompons on the sides and resembling the ears of a beast.  Such models go to extravagant people withstanding a bold style throughout the wardrobe. </p><p>  The narrow style of women's hats with a pompom looks interesting on a girl with long flowing hair.  A short hairstyle goes well with a headgear that has a visor.  Thick and curly hair looks interesting under a knitted female hat with a pompom and volumetric pattern. </p><p>  When choosing a hat, you must also consider your height.  A <span>cap of a large</span> knit will look ridiculous on a short girl.  It is better to choose a small narrow <span>hat with a lapel.</span>  And of course, the selected headpiece should be combined with outerwear both in color and style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/473141289/cream-knit-hat-wool-beanie-loose-knit"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's knit pompom hat" class="if uuid-2236153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2236153.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting cap option </h2><p>  In order to knit a female hat with a pompom, you will need yarn from natural or mixed wool, knitting needles and the initial skills of this type of needlework.  A small piece of faux fur is also needed to create the ball. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The simplest and yet fashionable knitting option is elastic.  The cap with this method is knitted with one fabric, and then sewn along the long side in the form of a pipe.  To get started, knit 76 loops on the knitting needles and knit an elastic band, alternating two purl with two facial loops.  Do not forget about the two edging on the sides of the canvas, which you need to knit in the usual way.  The length of the cap depends on your desire.  Often, in this model, a wide lapel is made, which can be folded once or twice.  After you have tied the fabric of the required length, the crown of the cap must be closed.  To do this, in each second row, reduce the loops, knitting together two things.  When 10 loops remain on the spoke, pass the working thread through them and pull off the crown.  Then sew the edges with a hidden seam and make a lapel.  The hat is ready, it remains to create a pompom and attach it to the top of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whistleandivy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.whistleandivy.com/2015/11/how-to-make-and-attach-a-pom-pom.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's knitted hats with pompons" class="if uuid-2236152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2236152.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a pompom </h2><p>  To create a fur ball, you need to make a blank of cardboard.  Draw a circle on thick paper, taking into account that the diameter of your pompom is approximately equal to the radius of the circle.  Attach a template to a piece of fur and cut out a corresponding circle from it.  Trim the edge of the fabric and, passing the thread through the stitches, pull the fur into a ball.  For stability, fill it with a padding polyester.  Sew a hole firmly and tie the pompom to the hat.  Your new headgear is ready. </p><p>  These hat models look original on men who adhere to a sporty style.  Also, almost all children's hats are decorated with various pompons, which can be made not only from fur, but also from threads for knitting. </p>
