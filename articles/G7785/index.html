He repeatedly showed his courage and courage in military battles, he was too fearless, which killed him.  He played a huge role in the Sevastopol defense of 1854-1855, defeated the Turkish ships during the <span>naval battle.</span>  Admiral P.S. Nakhimov was deeply respected and loved by his subordinates.  He remained forever in the history of Russia.  Today, there is even an order named after Nakhimov. </p><h2>  Biography of Admiral Nakhimov </h2><p>  Pavel Stepanovich Nakhimov was from a poor family of Smolensk noblemen.  His father was an officer and resigned as a second major.  In his youth, Pavel Nakhimov entered the Naval Cadet Corps.  Even during his studies, his natural gift as a leader made itself felt: he was an executive to impeccability, showed utmost accuracy, was always hardworking and did everything to achieve his goals. </p><p>  He showed excellent results in training and at the age of 15 became a midshipman.  At the same age, he was assigned to the Phoenix brig, which was supposed to sail in the Baltic Sea.  At this time, many pay attention to the 15-year-old midshipman, who shows everyone that the maritime service is the work of his life.  His favorite places in the world were a warship and a port.  He did not have time to arrange his personal life, and he did not want this.  Pavel Stepanovich never fell in love and never married.  He always showed zeal and zeal for service.  The biography of Admiral Nakhimov testifies that the sea craft was not just his hobby, he lived and breathed them.  I gladly agreed to Lazarev‚Äôs offer to serve on the frigate "Cruiser".  This naval commander played a large role in the life of Nakhimov: he took an example from him and tried to imitate him.  Lazarev became for him the "second father", teacher and friend.  Nakhimov saw and respected in his mentor such qualities as honesty, selflessness, devotion to the maritime service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The ship "Azov" </h2><p>  Nakhimov devoted three years to serving on the ‚ÄúCruiser‚Äù, during which time he managed to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù from a midshipman into a lieutenant and become Lazarev's favorite student.  The biography of Admiral Nakhimov suggests that in 1826 Pavel Stepanovich was transferred to Azov and again served under the leadership of the same commander.  This ship was destined to take part in the Navarino naval battle.  In 1827, the battle against the <span>Turkish fleet</span> took place <span>,</span> where the combined Russian, French and English squadron took part.  ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù distinguished himself in this battle, coming closer to the enemy‚Äôs ships and causing them great damage.  Results of the battle: Nakhimov was wounded, many were killed. </p>

    <h2>  Commander Nakhimov </h2><p>  At 29, Pavel Nakhimov became the commander of the Pallas.  This frigate did not yet know the voyages and was only built in 1832.  Then, Silistria, which plowed the expanses of the Black Sea, came under his command.  Here Nakhimov becomes the <span>captain of the 1st rank.</span>  For 9 years, under the leadership of Pavel Stepanovich, Silistria carried out the most difficult and rather responsible assignments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Defense of Sevastopol </h2><p>  In 1854-1855, Nakhimov was transferred to the Crimea and, together with Istomin and Kornilov, heroically led the <span>defense of Sevastopol.</span>  He led the formation of naval battalions, the construction of the battery, the preparation of reserves.  He constantly monitored the interaction of the fleet and the army, the construction of fortifications, and the supply of defenders of Sevastopol.  The story of Admiral Nakhimov suggests that his keen eye has always seen how to use artillery and carry out other military operations more effectively.  Often, Nakhimov himself went to the forefront and led the fighting.  During the first bombardment of the city in 1854, he was injured in the head, and the next year - a shell shock.  In 1855, on June 6, when the assault of the city was carried out, he became the head of the defense of the Ship side.  At the peak moment, Nakhimov led a bayonet counterattack by infantry and sailors. </p>

    <h2>  Death </h2><p>  June 28, 1855 should not have been any different from everyday military service.  A detour was instituted in order, Sevastopol fortifications were checked.  At 5 pm, Nakhimov drove up to the third bastion.  Having examined the enemy‚Äôs position, he headed towards the Malakhov Kurgan to observe the enemy.  The sailors and Nakhimov‚Äôs entourage very clearly remembered the day of his death.  The biography of Admiral Nakhimov is evidence that he was very brave, to recklessness.  When a French bullet hit him, piercing through the skull, he stood and looked through a <span>telescope.</span>  Directly to the enemy.  Not hiding or stepping aside despite the exhortations of their subordinates who tried to stop him and did not allow him to the banquet.  He did not die immediately, although without a single moan.  The best doctors gathered at his bedside.  He opened his eyes several times, but was silent.  Admiral Nakhimov died the day after a severe wound.  The funeral took place in the Sevastopol Vladimir Cathedral, the remains of his teacher Lazarev and his military colleagues, Admirals Istomina and Kornilova, are buried here. </p><h2>  Order of Nakhimov </h2>

    <p>  Later, an order was established in honor of Admiral Nakhimov.  He is awarded the outstanding officers of the Navy for the excellent conduct of naval operations, bold decisions, good organization.  The order has several degrees. </p><p>  Pavel Stepanovich did not have such qualities that could not be awarded.  Now this order, as a memory of Admiral Nakhimov, a valiant officer and commander, is awarded to those who show the highest desire to achieve success and excellent results, doing their duty. </p>
