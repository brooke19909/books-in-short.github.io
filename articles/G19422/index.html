Especially when it comes to a city like St. Petersburg.  Therefore, more and more people prefer to turn their attention to the suburbs.  This solution has many advantages.  Among them are relative unity with nature, and a much more pleasant ecological situation (compared with the city), and the ability to build your dream home or make it ready so that it looks perfect from your point of view.  Also, the population density here is significantly lower than in the metropolis, which adds psychological comfort. </p><p>  Life in the suburbs attracts many.  However, with the acquisition of this kind of housing sometimes there are many difficulties.  As a rule, buyers are forced to invest in real estate, which is still under construction.  This is associated with great financial risks.  If for some reason the developer is not able to complete the project, equity holders may lose their money and not get the expected housing.  How to avoid such troubles?  It is important to pay attention to what kind of reputation the developer has earned.  Many citizens have invested their savings in the projects of AyDaDom.  What is the situation with the developer today?  Do interest holders regret their decision?  We will talk more about this later in this article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="idad reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1594534.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  About company </h2><p>  A popular group of construction companies in the Russian Federation was AyDaD (St. Petersburg).  Acted from 2009 to 2016.  The main specialization of this company is suburban construction.  The developer paid attention to the construction of cottage villages in the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What are the basic principles of the functioning of AyDaDom?

The developer also offered the following services: after-sales service, legal support, security services, technical supervision. </p>

    <h2>  "AyDaDom": company reviews </h2><p>  What feedback did customers give about this developer?  Buyers incredibly liked the development plan for all AyDaDom projects (Pavlovsk, Zhemchuzhina, Honey Meadow and others).  Indeed, the company came up professionally: each village had to be gasified, electrified and, in general, equipped with all necessary amenities.  All this was much appreciated by the buyers.  Customers also noted the availability of after-sales service as a ‚Äúplus‚Äù.  Others liked the planned developed infrastructure of the cottage villages, as well as their excellent placement in relation to other objects, cities, transport hubs.  However, in a certain period, everything changed.  The company "AyDaDom" for some reason fell into decay and was close to bankruptcy.  During this period, work was slowed down or suspended.  Dissatisfied reviews of interest holders began to appear, which did not understand what, in fact, were the reasons for the delays.  However, the changes were not long in coming.  The situation was saved by the Finnish company Luonto, which bought out a block of shares in AyDaD and took upon itself all the obligations of the developer for the construction of cottage villages and after-sales service for those already built. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "AyDaDom": reviews about the employer </h2><p>  How did the employees of the company in question feel?  We find quite contradictory responses about the developer "AyDaDom".  Employee reviews, on the one hand, indicate a pleasant team, understanding and humane attitude on the part of management and regular salary payments.  On the other hand, workers claimed non-payment of remuneration for their work.  Perhaps this was due to the period of the company‚Äôs functioning, in which a response was left.  After all, of course, during the crisis of the AyDaD developer, the feedback from employees could not be positive.  Problems in the company inevitably affect its employees and, of course, their well-being.  Working conditions changed, the general tension of the leadership became apparent.  At a certain point, it became difficult or almost impossible to timely pay workers wages.  Nevertheless, this did not end the projects of the AyDaDom Group of Companies.  Employee reviews reflected all the changes that took place in the company.  Today, the situation has fundamentally changed.  How did this happen?  Let's consider further. </p><h2>  Luonto </h2><p>  This company in April 2016 bought "AyDaDom" and assumed all its obligations, which it faithfully fulfills.  Today it is one of the largest developers of suburban areas of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  This Finnish company applies all the previously gained experience in order to build high-quality cottages in the Russian Federation.  Specialists are professional, customer-oriented and ready for development and self-improvement.  To date, the company owns more than one thousand hectares of territory, and offers its customers to purchase a plot in one of the fifteen cottage villages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of current projects </h2><p>  Now the company "Luonto" conducts all the current affairs of the developer "AyDaDom."  Reviews of the employer (Finnish company) report that this developer has organized specialized departments for working with the projects of the acquired company.  What do real estate investors say now?  Buyers treat Luonto as a reliable, trusted developer, and are not afraid to trust him with their money.

    <h2>  "Honey Glade" </h2><p>  One of the most famous projects of the developer "AyDaDom."  Reviews report that it was suspended in 2016, as the Luonto company has not yet been involved in townhouses. </p><p>  The village is located in the Lomonosov district near the Gostilitsky rural settlement. </p><p>  Is it possible to buy real estate in the settlement in question, the construction of which was launched by AyDaDom?  Reviews say sales are ongoing despite project status.  Since the ‚ÄúLuonto‚Äù is sure to deal with it in the near future. </p><p>  What houses can be purchased in this village?  It is planned to build two rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãforty square meters (their cost ranges from 996 thousand rubles to 1 million 280,000 thousand), as well as three-rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseventy-five square meters (their price ranges from 1 million 840 thousand to 2 million 188 thousand rubles). </p><p>  The considered townhouse village, which began to build AyDaDom, customer reviews are considered one of the most promising projects of the Luonto company.  This beautiful complex is being built on the territory of the "Valley of Coziness", another cottage village. </p><p>  There is an opportunity to purchase one-level or two-level budget apartments in beautiful comfortable town-houses of panel-frame type as it was conceived by the previous developer "AyDaD".  Reviews call a special advantage the presence of a house plot, whose area ranges from two and a half to three hundred parts. </p><p>  In total, the village will occupy thirty-six hectares of land.  The first phase (there were three in total) was commissioned at the very beginning of 2015.  It consists of one hundred and forty-four sections, each ranging from forty to eighty-five square meters. </p><p>  It is planned to create a total of 364 separate households in the village. </p><p>  This housing complex, planned by the developer "AyDaDom", "Honey Glade", reviews are called comfortable.  Sewerage, gas, as well as electricity were installed in the village.  The roads of the complex are covered with rubble.  You can enter the territory only through the checkpoint.  All sites are guarded around the clock. </p><p>  How to get to this village of the developer "AyDaDom"?  Reviews of those who have already visited this place more than once recommend traveling along the Ropshinsky and Gostilitsky highways.  Although the road surface on these roads is far from the best, there are only two lanes, which significantly complicates the movement.  You can also use public transport. </p><p>  This housing complex is a great place to live, appropriately selected by the developer "AyDaDom".  Reviews about the "Honey Glade" make a special emphasis on the fact that the village is located in a place with excellent environmental situation.  This is due to the fact that a very small number of industrial enterprises are located near the complex, and the building density is low in comparison with other areas of the city and region.  There are also no landfills or industrial areas nearby.  On the contrary, four hundred meters away is a forest. </p><p>  The complex infrastructure is planned to be rich.  Directly in the "Honey Glade" will be built a children's club and a store.  The neighboring village has a kindergarten, an outpatient clinic and a school.  Also nearby are a gymnasium, banks, a school and shops, a popular ski resort. </p>

The company competently planned all its facilities and made every effort to complete them on time.  When the developer lost the opportunity to properly serve his clients, the company became the property of the Finnish holding company Luonto, which today shows itself worthily in the real estate market. </p><p>  The projects of the developer in question are being successfully promoted today.  He has earned a reputation as a reliable company, as he fulfills the promise to his shareholders.  Cottage villages are gasified, electrified, and constant illumination of all streets is organized.  The territory of the villages is carefully guarded; entry is possible only through a secure checkpoint.  Living in such villages is pleasant and safe.  The landscape design of each of them is individual and carries a certain aesthetic value.  Sometimes buyers have the opportunity to build their dream home almost from scratch, and sometimes they can design an already finished building in the way they always wanted.  In any case, equity holders do not regret the decision to purchase real estate from this developer. </p><p>  Be as vigilant as possible!  Invest your money only in reliable projects.  Always carefully check the reputation of the developer before deciding to conclude a deal (by examining the real reviews of previous customers and other available information about the company).  This will help preserve your financial resources and maintain emotional balance.  Choose only the most reliable developers to ensure your future and the well-being of your family.  Be careful not to ever regret your decisions. </p>
