Over time, in our <span>country, a state</span> began to be called a state that possessed power, independence, independence and, preferably, an impressive size.  In this understanding, a power is Russia, immense, always powerful, invincible and great.

    <p>  And since the Vienna Congress of 1814-1815, the status of "great" for Russia has been documented, and has never been canceled by anyone, no matter how the enemies would like to represent our country either as a "regional state" or an "ear on clay feet." </p><h2>  Power as a symbol of power </h2>

It is a ball with a cross.  The roots of the "power" goes to the <span>Roman Empire,</span> it symbolized the power of the emperor over the entire globe.  In ancient times, it depicted the goddess of victory, Nika, that is, power was obtained as a result of victory or conquest of the globe.  Considering that the symbol also depicted letters indicating parts of the world, such as Asia (ASI), Europe (EVR), Africa (AFR), it remains to be noted: the ancient Romans knew that the earth was round.  Sorry for Giordano Bruno.  But the medieval Poles, from whom Russia borrowed the form of a symbol of power, did not know, and called the state "the tsar‚Äôs apple."

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Come from antiquity </h2><p>  From Ancient Rome, this symbol of power passed to the Byzantine emperors, from where he was borrowed by the German reigning persons, and already from them - the West European kings of the Middle Ages.  In our country, the power of the Russian kingdom was also called the sovereign apple, all-powerful and autocratic.  False Dmitriy I brought power to Poland from our lands. They crowned it with his reign in 1605.  In the Russian tradition, a power is a symbol of the kingdom of heaven, therefore, in many icons both God the Father and Jesus Christ are depicted with a power in their hands.  There were several Russian powers - Tsars Mikhail and Alexei, the small power of Peter II (he ascended the throne at the age of 11, his hand was a child‚Äôs) and the Imperial Power, made for Catherine II the Great.  All the sovereign persons who followed the empress used it.  All these regalia of power are masterpieces of jewelry and priceless treasures of the country, so the first three are stored in the <span>Armory, the</span> last in the <span>Diamond Fund.</span> </p><h2>  The status of powerful countries </h2><p>  As noted above, the term "great powers" was introduced into international everyday life after the defeat of Napoleonic troops.  The authorship belongs to the German historian Leopold von Ranke.  That was the name of his scientific work, published in 1833.  At the <span>Vienna Congress of</span> 1814-1815, the status was assigned to the victorious countries of Napoleon - Russia, Great Britain, Austria and Prussia.  In 1818, France added to this list.  According to many experts, by the beginning of the XX century there were 5-6 great powers on the European continent.  The inaccuracy of the number is explained by the fact that the Great Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed.  The Ottoman Empire, approaching the great one, also disintegrated, and Italy, on the contrary, reunited in 1860, became stronger and more competitive.  In addition to European <span>countries, the USA</span> and Japan join the list of great powers at the beginning of the 20th century. </p><h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  After the Second World War, according to many international experts and political scientists, the <span>G-7 countries</span> belong to the great powers <span>,</span> and they want these countries, or they don‚Äôt want, the great, or even the greatest, is Russia, a power that does not give its infinite wealth Enemies neither sleep peacefully nor live. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia power" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/682883.jpg" width="599"></div>
