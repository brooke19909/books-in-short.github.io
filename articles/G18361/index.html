If previously the source of such data was television or radio, today it can be obtained using a mobile device via the Internet.  Moreover, with the help of special meteorological instruments, anyone can receive an extensive list of data from the source directly at home.  For these purposes, in particular, a home weather station with a wireless sensor is intended, reviews of which indicate high accuracy of information and ease of use. </p><h2>  Features of models with a wireless sensor </h2>

    <p>  Initially, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa home weather station came from classic analog instruments.  And only in recent years, digital devices began to be actively produced, which have extensive functionality.  Thanks to their filling, they allow you to set melodies, perform timer tasks, show calendar information, etc. Moreover, standard electronic weather stations have a serious drawback, measuring temperature only in the room.  Realizing the significance of this limitation, manufacturers began to develop models with remote sensors, due to which the user can learn about the temperature regime and outside their home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But with remote type devices, not everything is simple.  The fact is that there are wired models and devices that work without cable connection.  The second option is just a home weather station with a wireless sensor.  Reviews note the convenience of such a technological solution not only in operation but also in installation.  The fact is that such devices do not require the creation of special holes for the wire, which reduces financial costs. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  The main direction of choice should be the functionality of the device.  The very concept of the weather station determines its multitasking and the ability to work with several indicators.  Without fail, such a device must provide information about temperature, humidity and pressure.  It is also important to consider the range of values ‚Äã‚Äã- for example, the RST weather station in modification 02103 with a remote sensor works with indicators from -50 to 70 ¬∞ C.  But this functionality is for ordinary users who do not need special weather information. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the type of activity of the applicant for such a device, additional capabilities may be required.  In particular, for fishermen, in addition to temperature and humidity, it is important to take into account the characteristics of the wind - its speed and direction.  People working outdoors are also likely to benefit from data on the probability of precipitation.  In addition, the choice of a weather station should be made taking into account the dimensions of the device and the design.  Typically, these characteristics determine the ease of use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  RST Model Reviews </h2><p>  The manufacturer is one of the leaders in the market of weather stations, which is also confirmed by consumer reviews.  If we talk about models with wireless sensors, the RST 88777 version is of most interest. It is not just a device that is designed to provide convenience by eliminating cable connection.  According to the owners, the device in its capabilities resembles professional meteorological complexes.  In addition to the main indicators in the form of pressure with air temperature, such an RST weather station provides information about the <span>ebb and flow,</span> and also warns of the possibility of ice with the help of Ice alert technology.  To these advantages, many add a well-implemented interface with an original way of presenting data - for example, information about the lunar calendar is displayed in the <span>form of animation.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Ea2 Model Reviews </h2><p>  Under the Ea2 brand, good models with wireless sensors also come out.  The base line is a modification of the ED601.  This is a simple device that reflects the basic values ‚Äã‚Äã- temperature, humidity and pressure.  Among its advantages, users note the possibility of placing the sensor at a distance of 30 m from the point where the main weather station Ea2 is installed indoors.  This allows you to use the device in the country with a remote installation.  But there is one drawback to the sensor itself.  Some users indicate a poor tightness, so it is best to hang it in a dry place and protected from the sun. </p><p>  In terms of the availability of additional features, the device will not surprise you with its special capabilities, but the backlight and the option to save readings still add attractiveness to the device.  The main plus that Ea2 weather station has is the price, which is 2 thousand rubles.  For comparison, the multifunctional device from RST is estimated at 8 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  La Crosse Model Reviews </h2>

    <p>  La Crosse brand produces products that are mainly focused on professional use, which in itself indicates a high level of quality.  However, many users of home weather equipment recommend the WS1600 version for home use.  In terms of price, it differs slightly from standard home models, and in terms of functionality it has significant superiority.  To begin with, it is worth noting the wide configuration, which provides a home weather station with a wireless sensor.  The feedback from the owners of this model is especially highlighted by several temperature meters, the function of the anemometer, and also devices for assessing the level of humidity and precipitation. </p><h2>  TFA Model Reviews </h2>

The Crystal Cube model is one of the most interesting in the company's lineup due to the animated display and clarity in the presentation of data.  As for the sensor, it can be installed 50 meters from the main unit.  In general, this is a well-assembled home weather station with a wireless sensor, reviews of which also emphasize the accuracy of the measurements.  However, a lot depends on how correctly the sensor was placed.  This applies to all models, the correct operation of which depends on the nature of the installation, and on presets before use.

    <p>  Models with wireless sensors are the most demanding of installation rules.  True, the difficulties are caused not by the installation itself, but by the placement method.  The installation should be carried out as far as possible from the house, while the measuring device must be protected by a special casing.  However, some models initially have a sealed and damage-resistant housing, so additional protection may not be necessary.  The best way to place it is on a post with a height of about 10 m. As the instruction notes, a home weather station with a sensor remote from the building will show the most accurate values.  If you plan to use the device in order to track wind indicators, it is best to install the sensor directly on the roof.  But in this case, it is important to avoid the proximity of the meter to communication systems, the thermal effects of which can violate the accuracy of the readings. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Meteorological instruments are no longer perceived as something outlandish or inherent exclusively in the work of specialists.  Another thing is that a clear understanding of the tasks that a particular device must solve is required.  As the practice of operation shows, the best weather stations for the home have not only wide functionality, but also resistance to external influences.  This is especially true for devices with remote sensors that work wirelessly.  To get the most accurate weather information, the meter must be correctly positioned and configured.  Also, do not ignore the ergonomic qualities - in the process of daily operation, the way of displaying readings and the presence <span>of warning systems</span> is of great importance. </p>
