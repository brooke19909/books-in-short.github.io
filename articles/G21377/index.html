We hope that it will help all those who are thinking about purchasing real estate. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  "Comfort Park" (Kaluga) is a new generation real estate project, the most modern quarter of the city today, in which many dream to live.  The apartment here will emphasize the status of the owner will be an excellent investment in their future and the future of their children, providing each family member with the maximum comfort of urban life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kp40.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfort park kaluga" class="if uuid-3180389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180389.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Comfort Park" (Kaluga) introduced all citizens to the unique trends of European urban planning, as well as the concept of "city in city".  This is a self-contained neighborhood with its own infrastructure. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><p>  The photos presented in our material will help to get to know the concept of the Comfort Park LCD project (Kaluga) closer.  The general plan involves the construction of 11 high-rise buildings in 5 phases, including residential buildings, parking, social and economic infrastructure.  The complex, designed for 2,754 apartments, will become the largest and most populous in the city.  The first phase of the project has already been built and put into operation, the first tenants managed to settle down and form their own opinion on the complex and technical conditions that the developer provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kaluga.roomberry.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments comfort park kaluga" class="if uuid-3180392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180392.jpg"></div><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  Unique modern technologies and high-quality building materials formed the basis of the Comfort Park project (Kaluga).  The reviews of the first residents became the main confirmation of this, because they did not see anything like it in the city and the nearest regions.  The white and green gamut chosen for the exterior decoration of residential buildings looks modern, stylish, harmonious.  Moreover, the materials used provide excellent heat and sound insulation properties.  In combination with the latest model of plastic windows, it is possible to increase the energy efficiency of each structure by 30 percent, reducing the amount of future heating costs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the Comfort Park residential complex, an ecological clean district of the city, the right bank of the Ob River, was chosen.  By local standards, this is a prestigious area surrounded by a pine forest, which has a chic promenade.  At the same time, only 15 minutes to the central part of the city, which allows you not to break away from public life, take part in all city events.  The developer put into the project the construction of a park that is closed to outsiders, which will become a favorite place for walking and recreation for all residents of the complex.  And the windows of the apartments offer stunning views of the pine forest and the Ob River. </p><div class="photo" data-original="park-komfort.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd comfort park kaluga reviews" class="if uuid-3180404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180404.jpg"></div><p>  Responses LCD "Comfort Park" (Kaluga) cover the topic of ecology.  So this complex is a real gift for those who have long looked after an apartment that combines the charm of urban and suburban life.  No noise, fuss, on the contrary, clean air saturated with resins of conifers, plenty of places to relax in the fresh air, and all this in close proximity to the central part of the city. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The developer put a lot of effort in order to create a truly unique project, which has no analogues in Kaluga and the region.  The infrastructure of the Comfort Park residential complex (Kaluga) is oriented towards complete satisfaction.  A kindergarten, all necessary shops, pharmacies, laundries, bank branches and other organizations in the service sector will operate on the territory.  Fans of active leisure appreciated the presence in the project of fitness centers, gaming and sports grounds of various orientations, as well as tracks for rollerblading, biking and hiking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="snablog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfort park kaluga photo" class="if uuid-3180410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180410.jpg"></div><p>  Underground parking and its own indoor park are the highlight of the complex, which all those who already managed to personally get acquainted with the project managed to appreciate.  In addition, residential buildings are being built simultaneously with infrastructure facilities, so that even the first residents have everything they need right at hand. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  Apartments in the complex are represented by a variety of planning solutions.  A choice of small, one-room, comfortable two-room and spacious three-room options ranging from 43 to 92 square meters are presented to customers.  Here you will not find free layouts that are so popular today, as well as European ones, which imply a combination of the kitchen and living areas, which did not prevent the creation of truly functional living spaces.  Large kitchens, several balconies, isolated rooms, the presence of an additional bathroom are what the first tenants managed to note.  They also liked the competent organization of space, which allows you to use every square meter of space - nothing remains idle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kaluganews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfort park kaluga reviews" class="if uuid-3180408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180408.jpg"></div><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  At the moment, during the construction phase of the Comfort Park apartment (Kaluga) can be purchased at a price of 2.4 million rubles.  The developer cooperates with the largest banks in the country, offering favorable conditions for mortgage lending.  Definitely, as the complex grows and develops, the value of real estate will increase.  That is why, if you really decide to buy an apartment, hurry up. </p><h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  The first phase of the project was completed and put into operation, so the opinion of those who managed to get the keys to their long-awaited apartment has already appeared.  By the way, the queue was delivered on time, without delay, which is good news.  The residents were impressed by the quality of the building, it does not cause any complaints.  Many note that through the use of advanced technologies and the qualifications of workers, they subsequently managed to save on repairs.  All apartments have modern heating radiators with temperature regulators - the ability to maintain an optimal microclimate at any time of the year and significantly save on utilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agency40.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Comfort Park Kaluga" class="if uuid-3180396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180396.jpg"></div><p>  The location of the complex is perhaps its main advantage.  Many worried about the remoteness from the center.  In practice, you can get to the historical part of the city in 15-20 minutes in any way, both by personal and public transport.  Already in the direction of new buildings, a new modern district, additional public transport routes have been launched, so there are no problems with mobility. </p><p>  Quite a lot of questions related to the size of monthly utility bills.  So the residents of the houses talk about the amount of 2-3 thousand rubles for servicing a one-room apartment.  Agree, quite budget.  And, of course, the closed territory, its own park, the opportunity to relax, spend time with family and friends without leaving the complex are impressive. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  "Comfort Park" (Kaluga) is a truly unique project for a small provincial town, which is why it attracts so much attention.  Admittedly, it is justified, because the developer managed to implement in it the concept of building a city in a city that is so popular today.  On the territory there is everything that is necessary for the full life of a modern city dweller, while in order to enjoy peace, tranquility and clean air, you do not need to leave the complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agency40.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfort park kaluga" class="if uuid-3180415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3180415.jpg"></div><p>  If you have been looking at Kaluga new buildings for a long time, are thinking about purchasing your home, definitely visit the construction site, get acquainted with its territory, stages of construction and finishing works in order to form your own opinion and, perhaps, become the happy owner of the family nest of your dreams. </p>
