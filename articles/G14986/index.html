    <h2>  Khreshchatyk in Kiev </h2><p>  This is a world famous street.  How many secrets and mysteries she hides in herself.  A large number of entertaining stories and legends are associated with it.  During the Great Patriotic War, it was almost completely destroyed, and already in peace years restored.  We will introduce you to her and try to reveal all her secrets.  And for this, let's first sit in a virtual time machine and go to the distant past of the city of Kiev. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the name Khreschatyk Street.  The first says that Prince Vladimir baptized Russian people in this place.  The second says that the street got its name from the intersection of the hollows in the place where it was located.  Its active settlement began when the annual fair or auction, as they were then called, was transferred here by royal decree.  Circus performances and folk festivals were also shown here.  This territory was called Khreshchaty Valley.  At the end of the 18th century, a two-story palace was built here for one of the local landowners.  Then other houses began to appear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shevchenko district" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1881587.jpg" width="600"></div>
