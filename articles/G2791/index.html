This person is a famous military leader, as well as the founder of the volunteer movement, Anton Ivanovich Denikin.  A brief biography can tell that he was also an excellent writer and memoirist.  This amazing personality played an important role in the history of the formation of the Russian state. </p><h2>  Children's years and youth </h2><p>  Many students in schools about this great Russian figure begin to learn only with a description of his achievements.  Little is known about childhood and origin.  This can tell his brief biography.  Anton Denikin was born in the county town of Warsaw province, or rather, in the suburbs of Wloclawsk.  This momentous event happened on a December day, the 4th, 1872. </p>

Therefore, at the age of three, the boy was already baptized.  Anton‚Äôs mother was Polish, thanks to this Denikin was fluent in Polish and Russian.  And at the age of four, unlike his peers, he could already read fluently.  He was a very gifted boy and from an early age he was already serving at the altar.

Biography, life story, and various other sources telling about this military figure indicate that at the age of thirteen the boy was already forced to earn his bread by tutoring.  Just during these years his father passed away, and the family began to live even poorer. </p><p>  After completing his studies at the school, he entered the Kiev infantry educational institution, after which he received the rank of second lieutenant. </p><p>  Anton Ivanovich Denikin passed his initial service in the Sedledtsky province.  A brief biography tells of the fact that after graduating from the Kiev school he was able to choose this place for himself, as he proved himself one of the best students over the years of study. </p><h2>  How did a military career begin? </h2><p>  Beginning in 1892, he served in the second field brigade, and then, in 1902, he already received the rank of senior adjutant at the headquarters at the beginning of the infantry division, and subsequently one of the cavalry corps. </p><p>  At that time, hostilities began between the Russian and Japanese states, in which Anton Denikin participated and showed his best.  A brief biography and facts from his life say that he independently decided to leave the army, so he submitted a report requesting a transfer.  As a result, the young man received the post of staff officer, whose duties were to carry out a variety of important tasks. </p><p>  In this war, Denikin proved to be an excellent commander.  For many military achievements he received the rank of colonel, and also had the honor of being awarded orders and various state awards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the subsequent seven-year period of his life, Anton Ivanovich Denikin managed to visit many staff ranks.

    <h2>  Great military merits </h2><p>  As soon as the start of hostilities was announced, Denikin was not slow to ask for transfer to the front to participate in battles with enemies.  As a result, he was appointed commander of the fourth brigade, distinguished himself under his able leadership in many battles from 1914 to 1916.  Many even called them the "fire brigade", as they were often sent to the most difficult sections of the military front. </p><p>  Anton Denikin for military merits received awards and <span>orders of St. George of the</span> third and fourth degree.  In 1916, together with his team, he made a breakthrough in the Southwestern Front and was appointed commander of the eighth army corps. </p>

    <h2>  Revolutionary years </h2><p>  The fact that Anton took an active part in the February events of the seventeenth year of the twentieth century, indicates his brief biography.  Denikin (curriculum vitae for 1917) continued to move rapidly up the career ladder during the years of the February Revolution. </p><p>  At first he was appointed chief of staff, and then made the commander in chief of all armies on the southwestern front.  But at all congresses and meetings, Denikin sharply criticized the actions of the interim government.  He said that such a policy could lead to the collapse of the army and urgently demanded that the war be brought to an end. </p><p>  After such statements, on July 29, 1917, Anton Ivanovich was arrested and first placed in Berdichev, and then transferred to Bykhov, where many of his associates were also detained.  In November of the same year he was released into the wild and with fake documents in the name of Alexander Dombrovsky was able to infiltrate the Don. </p><h2>  Volunteer Army Command </h2><p>  At the beginning of the winter of 1917, Anton Ivanovich Denikin arrives in Novocherkassk.  A brief biography about that period of his life tells us that it was then that the formation of the Volunteer Army began in this place, in the organization of which he took an active part.  As a result, he was appointed to the post of chief of the first Volunteer Division, and in 1918, after the tragic death of Kornilov, he became commander of the entire army. </p><p>  Then he rose to the rank of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia and was able to subjugate the entire Don Army.  In 1920, Anton Ivanovich became the supreme ruler, but he did not stay long.  In the same year, he handed over the reins to General F.P. Wrangel and decided to leave Russia forever. </p>

    <h2>  Emigration </h2><p>  Forced flight to Europe due to the defeat of whites made me feel a lot of adversities and hardships.  Constantinople was the first city where Denikin Anton Ivanovich went with his family in 1920. </p><p>  A brief biography devoted to his life story suggests that he did not provide himself with absolutely no means of livelihood.  He traveled to European cities from one to another until he settled for a while in a small Hungarian town.  Then the Denikins family decided to leave for Paris, where the works he had written were published. </p><h2>  From a military leader to a writer </h2><p>  Anton Ivanovich had the talent to express his thoughts beautifully on paper, so all of his essays and books are read with great interest today.  The first editions came out in Paris.  Fees and payment for lecturing - these were his only earnings. </p>

    <p>  An archive of his works is still kept in the library of <span>Columbia University,</span> which studies Russian history and culture. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  In the forties of the last century, Denikin, fearing forced deportation to the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, emigrated to America, where he continued his literary career. </p><p>  In 1947, a great Russian general died of a heart attack in a hospital ward of a university located in Michigan.  He was buried in Detroit. </p><p>  Ten years ago, the ashes of the four Denikins were transported from the States to Moscow and buried at the Donskoy Monastery with the consent of their daughter Marina. </p>
