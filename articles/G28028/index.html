There, where the discharged air is transparent, dizzying heights and glacier peaks beckon with their inaccessibility.  One of such places in the Caucasus, of course, is the well-known and beloved Arkhyz mountaineering fan.  The route of our trip today is Lunnaya Polyana Arkhyza. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The place where the &quot;Moonlit&quot; is built" class="if uuid-2561235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2561235.jpg"></div><h2>  Russian Switzerland </h2><p>  Wooded, dense, stretching for many kilometers pine slopes, snow-capped mountain ranges, sparkling greens of bubbling rivers and streams, the milky depths of glacial lakes bordering, like a large pearl-blue necklace, the bends of the Caucasus Range - Arkhyz is rightly called Russian Switzerland. </p><p>  Mild climate, a large number of warm sunny days, low altitude, protection from cold, piercing mountain winds - all this creates the special, unique microcosm that the Arkhyz valley represents.  Arkhyz, located on the opposite side from Dombai, is strikingly different from the latter. </p><p>  Despite the fact that both villages are located in Karachay-Cherkessia, they share different gorges and have different heights.  In Arkhyz landscapes there is no Dombai sternness, which is explained, of course, by a lower height - here you will not find a large number of glacial peaks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="The mighty Arkhyz pines" class="if uuid-2561236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2561236.jpg"></div><h2>  The construction of the villages of Romantic and Moonglade is the beginning of the construction of the century. </h2><p>  And, indeed, Arkhyz is practically in no way inferior to Swiss resorts.  The only difference between ‚Äútheir‚Äù Switzerland and ‚Äúour‚Äù Arkhyz for a long time was only in the absence of a well-developed mountain-tourist infrastructure.  And at the end of 2013, to the enthusiastic glee of all fans of this tourist Mecca, a large-scale project was launched to build a world-class ski resort.  Real Caucasian construction of the century! </p><p>  First, the romantic ski resort village was built, in the very first days of its existence it attracted hundreds of tourists from different cities of Russia, the first cable stations started operating.  Then, in Arkhyz, the construction of the first buildings of the Lunar Glade began.  In general, the project plans to build several separate ski villages with their own infrastructure and tracks with a total length of 30 kilometers. </p><p>  Behind the Romantic, new tourist complexes are already being built with might and main, the mountain chain of the slopes of the valley covers all new kilometers of cable cars.  On how to get to the Moonglade of Arkhyz, we will discuss below. </p><h2>  Arkhyz - the starting point of all routes </h2><p>  The old resort village known since Soviet times, Arkhyz is not remarkable in itself.  A large number of low-rise hotels and small residential buildings, cows, chickens and sheep strolling along the road.  The village is interesting first of all because it is from this place that a large number of well-known tourist routes originate, from here numerous mountain trails lead upstream down the seething streams and small waterfalls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From here, there are roads to the Moonglade of Arkhyz, the village of Phiyu and other interesting places.  From here tourists who come from far away embark on breathtaking adventures along winding paths, risky slopes in order to see more and more new and beautiful places.  From here they go on weekly hikes along the famous ‚ÄúAdvanced Necklace Arkhyz‚Äù route among advanced tourists. </p><p>  In the mountains, as we know, one inviolable rule invariably applies - the higher, the more beautiful!  Therefore, long-term parking in one place does not make much sense, everything is created here for perpetual motion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Old village" class="if uuid-2561238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2561238.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern Mountain Chalets </h2><p>  Leaving the old village and rising a little higher along the new asphalt road, after 10 minutes you find yourself in a modern center, built in accordance with all the rules and laws of ski tourism, equipped with everything necessary for winter and not only sports. </p><p>  And a little further along the road, directly behind the village of Romantic, is already a new rebuilt village of Lunnaya Polyana.  The roads leading from Arkhyz connect it with the Romantic, with the Moonlit, and with other future vacation spots.  The unity of the architectural ensemble, characteristic of all these villages, also distinguishes the Moonglade. </p><p>  Modern hotel complexes, tourist centers, cafes, canteens, etc. - all here are designed in a classic Alpine style.  Dark brown and pale cream shades pleasantly harmonize with the snow-white slopes in the ski season and stand out beautifully against the background of spreading fluffy pine hats. </p><h2>  The mild climate of Moonglade </h2><p>  The village Lunnaya Polyana received its name from the <span>Lunar Valley</span> - the very one along which the Arkhyz River flows.  One of several local waterways that flow into the largest and most full-flowing river of the Arkhyz Valley is Bolshaya Zelenchuk.  Sheltered on both sides by the high walls of the mountains, sheltered from the wind, Moonglade almost all year round pleases its visitors with generous sunny days.  Weather in Arkhyz and Moonglade favors a relaxing family vacation;  the climate, as well as the entire infrastructure of modern villages, is very good for families with children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Zelenchuk River" class="if uuid-2561237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2561237.jpg"></div><p>  Most pleasant is the thought that Moonglade is neither the beginning nor the end of a large project.  Other tourist complexes with no less romantic names will follow.  In the meantime, in anticipation of new ski seasons, we will rise on the ‚ÄúLunar Express‚Äù under the quiet rattle of a cable car under the light rustle of the wind in the branches past pine peaks floating somewhere below! </p>
