  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Czech coins: history and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As in most places in the world, Czech currency is issued in the form of paper notes and coins.  Although the <span>Czech Republic is</span> officially a member of the European Union, the euro is rarely accepted as a means of payment in Czech institutions.  Instead, Czechs use their own currency, known as the krone, which is denoted as CZK or Kč. </p><p>  Before the collapse of the country in 1993, the Czechoslovak krona was in circulation, but after Czechoslovakia split and the currency was divided for Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, the krone became a new form of payment for the Czech people. </p><h2>  History of Czech money </h2><p>  Many say that the Czech koruna was the first autonomous currency introduced after the independence of countries formerly part of Czechoslovakia.  But the history of the krona dates back to the 1800s, when money called krone in German and koruna in Bohemia was presented as the first gold currency in the Austro-Hungarian empire. </p><p>  The Czech koruna was withdrawn from circulation between 1939 and 1945 due to the occupation of the German Reich.  They stopped using it, and in the Czech Republic they began to use the Reichsmark.  But after the liberation of the country, the crown returned again. </p><p>  Now twelve forms of the crown are used: six banknotes and six coins of the Czech Republic, each of which has different meanings.  In circulation are banknotes of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 kroons.  There is also a banknote of 5,000 kroons, but it is rarely used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jenniferinprague.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech coins" class="if uuid-2954987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2954987.jpg"></div><p>  Czech coins, the weight and size of which increase in accordance with the growth of their value, have face values ​​of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 crowns.  Each of them, currently used, was designed by Czech architects and sculptors.  The photo of Czech coins shows that each of them is beautiful in its own way.  There are also several specialized and commemorative coins that are of great value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until 2008, the Czechs also used loose change coins, known as gellers (haléř or hellers), but they have since disappeared from circulation. </p><p>  The term “geller” was used to denote a coin that was 1/100 kroons in the Czech Republic (Czech Koruna) and <span>Slovakia (Slovak</span> Koruna), as well as in former Czechoslovakia (Czechoslovak Krona). </p><p>  All Czech currency is issued exclusively by the Central Bank of the Czech Republic (CNB). </p><div class="photo" data-original="maison-palombo.bidinside.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="commemorative coin 5000 CZK" class="if uuid-2954984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2954984.jpg"></div><h2>  One crown </h2><p>  This Czech coin (2 CZK) is made of nickel-plated steel.
