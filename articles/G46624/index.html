    <h2>  Where is Zanzibar located </h2><p>  Before we tell you about the most popular hotels in this place, let's first find out its location.  Zanzibar is a group of islands that are located on the eastern coast of Africa.  From all sides they are surrounded by the Indian Ocean.  On the main island of the same name you will find beautiful nature, ancient monuments and a huge number of opportunities for a relaxing holiday.  Many tourists are interested in the weather in Zanzibar.  We can say that a warm sun always warms here.  Even in the winter months, the thermometer does not drop below 30 degrees during the day and 24 at night.  Precipitation is extremely small and insignificant.  The best time to travel is from June to October. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Zanzibar is one of Africa's favorite tourist destinations.  It will be useful to find out how you can get to this wonderful island.  One of the most convenient options is an air connection between Moscow and Zanzibar.  Unfortunately, there are no direct messages.  If you decide to fly from Moscow to Zanzibar, you will first get to the capital of Tanzania, the city of Dar es Salaam.  Then by sea or by air go to the popular island.  Now, knowing where Zanzibar is located, you can plan trips here and choose the best accommodation, which will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is zanzibar" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/2076282.jpg"></div>
