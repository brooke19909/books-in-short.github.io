  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a deposit?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All banks operating on a commercial basis attract additional funds from legal entities and individuals.  But in order to make a quality investment, a person should clearly understand what a deposit is and what benefits it can bring. </p><p>  So, a deposit account is opened at the request of the client on the terms he has chosen in order to increase the temporarily free funds.  Currently, commercial banks have developed and introduced many types of deposits in order to satisfy the needs of the population.  However, people are still afraid to give their own savings to other people, preferring to keep them at home in the "bank".  This is easily explained by the default of the 90s, when the population lost all their means and was forced to deny themselves in many ways. </p><p>  That is why, before investing, you should understand what a deposit is and what kind of deposit will be most beneficial specifically for you.  Of course, in the modern world, no one is safe from the crisis, but thanks to the development of management quality, the degree of bank reliability has increased significantly.  After all, now he can foresee in time the possibility of an unfavorable situation and take measures to get out of it with the least losses. </p><p>  So, many commercial banks, telling what a deposit is, mention only its advantages, but forget to announce the shortcomings.  In most cases, <span>an individual</span> decides to deposit savings only because of the high interest on the deposit.  But this is precisely what should alert him, because just like that, the bank will never provide fabulous interest amounts.  This means that there is a high risk of non-return of your funds.  Reliability and stable operation of a credit institution - this should be the first thing that the client focuses on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All <span>bank deposits</span> can be divided into two main types: demand <span>deposits</span> and term <span>deposits</span> .  The first <span>type of deposit</span> investment gives the investor the opportunity to get their own money on demand.  That is, if you suddenly needed the whole amount, the bank does not have the right to refuse this request.  According to term deposits, the bank is provided with funds for a certain period, at the end of which it is obliged to pay the full amount with an allowance in the form of interest on the deposit.  The beauty of <span>term deposits</span> is that the <span>interest rate</span> on them is much higher than on demand deposits. </p><p>  Also in banking practice there is a division into replenished and non-replenished deposit accounts.  Non-refundable involve investing for a certain period of time with the inability to further increase the amount.  A <span>replenished deposit</span> gives the client the opportunity to increase the deposit amount with the desired frequency.  The Bank enters into an agreement with the client, which clearly defines the minimum and maximum amounts of additions, as well as the sequence of their implementation. </p><p>  For the convenience of the client, a bank deposit with a minimum threshold of funds is offered.  That is, a certain amount is transferred to the account, which is considered untouchable, and if money arrives in excess of this amount, then they can subsequently be withdrawn without restriction.  When withdrawing funds in excess of the established limit, the bank pays the minimum interest on the deposit. </p><p>  And remember what is a <span>deposit?</span>  <span>This is an</span> agreement between the creditor (in this case, an individual or legal entity) and the borrower (bank) on the first placement of a certain amount of money.  And if this is an agreement, it means that an agreement is formally fixing the deal.  Many people are just too lazy to read its contents, and this is a rash act.  The written agreement must be carefully studied, since usually the most important is written in small print that does not attract the attention of the client.  Timely review of the document will help you avoid problems in the future. </p>
