Especially popular are the so-called pedometers.  They allow you to count the number of steps performed over a certain period of time.  Installing a pedometer on your phone is worth it, if only because this application is able to demonstrate how many calories you lose in one trip to the store, for example.  However, you need to choose the best application.  And in this material we will consider the most interesting options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apkpure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to install a pedometer" class="if uuid-3246890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246890.jpg"></div><h2>  Runtastic pedometer </h2><p>  Runtastic is one of the best companies producing software and gadgets for athletes.  In the line of their applications for monitoring the general condition of the body there are very interesting programs.  But we are only interested in the pedometer.  And this is the Runtastic Pedometer.  There are two versions of the utility: Pro and free.  In the first, there is no advertising at all.  And the second does not differ in any truncated functionality.  How to install a pedometer from Runtastic?  Yes, it‚Äôs very simple - download from Google Play.  This program is there.  And the installation takes place according to the standard scenario.  This application records the number of steps, distance traveled and average speed of movement.  Then all this information can be obtained in the form of a report with a detailed diagram.  A very convenient application for tracking the distance traveled per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifeissweeterbydesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="install pedometer on the phone" class="if uuid-3246892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246892.jpg"></div><h2>  Noom </h2><p>  Great free app for Android devices.  There is nothing easier than installing this pedometer on your phone.  It‚Äôs enough to drive the name into Google Play and then just click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.  You can also download the APK file from the developer's site.  But this method is not recommended.  A key feature of this application is that it is not tied to GPS data to calculate the distance traveled and speed, but uses the built-in G-sensor of the phone for this.  That is why this program is used by those who want to save on traffic and at the same time monitor their health.  Using the application is very simple.  Just click on the "Start" button.  During operation, the program uses the battery very sparingly.  Charge is reduced by only 3% in a few hours of use.  Such economy also suits users very much.  That is why the program is very popular.  Moreover, installing a pedometer application from Noom on a smartphone running Android is very simple.  It is worth trying this application for those who care about their health. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.researchgate.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="install pedometer application" class="if uuid-3246893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246893.jpg"></div><h2>  Accupedo </h2><p>  Great cross-platform application.  There are versions for iOS and for Android.  How to install a pedometer on an iPhone?  Just download from the App Store according to the standard scenario.  Accupedo is definitely there.  A key feature of this program is fully automatic operation.  It is enough to set the time in the settings at which the program should start, and it will automatically turn on and begin to count: the number of steps, distance traveled, average speed, and so on.  The program has an intuitive interface and quite rich functionality.  The utility also has an energy saving mode.  If it is turned on, the program uses only 3-4% of the battery in a couple of hours.  It is worth considering that the utility works exclusively with the G-sensor.  Therefore, traffic is saved.  GPS also does not drain the battery.  Very comfortably.  There are paid and free versions.  The first differs only in the absence of advertising.  But for many users, this is not particularly critical.  And how to install the Accupedo pedometer on a smartphone with an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù on board?  Using Google Play.  This application is there.  It is installed in the usual way.  It is enough to find him there and click on the "Install" button.  After that, you can immediately start the program using the corresponding icon on the desktop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install a pedometer on an iPhone" class="if uuid-3246894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246894.jpg"></div><h2>  Moves </h2><p>  Another successful pedometer from a reputable developer.  A key feature of it is the simultaneous operation with a G-sensor and a GPS module.  Thanks to this, he provides incredibly accurate data on the path traveled, average speed and the number of steps.  All this information can also be viewed in the form of a detailed report with graphs, charts and comparisons with previous results.  Installing the Moves pedometer app on your smartphone is easy.  Just type in the name of the program in a Google Play search.  The desired result will appear immediately.  After that, you just need to click on the "Install" button.  Very simple, right?  The program is not particularly economical in terms of battery (since GPS is used), but it has a nice interface and can work under almost any conditions.  There is also a delayed start timer.  Which is very good if you need to pre-configure the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoxiaomi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="install pedometer on samsung phone for free" class="if uuid-3246895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246895.jpg"></div><h2>  Mi fit </h2><p>  Great app from Xiaomi.  It is fully compatible with wearable gadgets from this manufacturer.  But it is they who are now the most popular.  However, the program can be installed not only on Xiaomi smartphones.  How to install a pedometer on a Samsung phone for free?  Yes, just use Google Play.  Just drive into the search for "Mi Fit", select the desired result and click on the "Install" button.  The application is completely free.  And he has no pro version.  But there is a lot of advertising.  But this is not a tragedy.  This pedometer has many functions and is able to give accurate results, since it uses both a G-sensor and a GPS transmitter.  Of course, he uses the battery not very economically.  But this is not the most important thing.  It is much more important that the user can get the most accurate information about his campaigns, compare them with previous attacks and draw the appropriate conclusions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we tried to consider how to install a pedometer on different smartphones.  But the greater emphasis in this material was placed on a review of applications of this type.  Among them there are very interesting specimens.  And their installation is no different.  Since all of the above applications can be easily found on Google Play for "Android" or in the App Store for iPhone.  Almost all of them are free.  However, some have paid versions.  In any case, the final choice is to make the users.  It is up to them to decide which application is most suitable. </p>
