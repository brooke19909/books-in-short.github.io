    <h2>  Creating a topiary is a popular trend in the world of needlework. </h2><p>  Such compositions can be made independently.  There is nothing complicated in this type of needlework.  In the presence of all the necessary materials, each person will be able to make a decorative tree in a few hours.  In this article, we will talk about such a variety of this souvenir as the topiary "Heart".  An object symbolizing love and fidelity can be made from a wide variety of materials.  The three workshops presented below describe in detail how to make such an artificial tree at home.  We invite you to familiarize yourself with them. </p><h2>  Thread topiary in the shape of a heart.  We are preparing materials for its implementation </h2><p>  This method of creating a decorative tree is quite simple, but as a result of the work you get a charming composition.  For its manufacture, you will need such materials and tools: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  yarn of red, white and pink color; </li><li>  a sheet of thick cardboard; </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  a piece of foam sheet; </li><li>  plasticine; </li><li>  a cardboard tube (a base for cling film or toilet paper); </li><li>  cotton pads; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  wooden stick; </li><li>  wire. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="topiary heart photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/370068.jpg?1396994225389" width="403"></div></li></ul><h2>  Description of the process of making thread topiary </h2><p>  Learning to make the Heart topiary using the following description.  From a cardboard tube we cut off the workpiece in the form of a cylinder with a height of 5 centimeters.  We put it on cardboard, draw a pencil around the bottom.  Cut two identical round parts.  Exactly the same diameter we perform a foam blank.  We glue the cardboard circle to the cylinder, forming the bottom of the container in which the tree will stand.  Inside, insert the foam piece.  From plasticine we sculpt a figure in the form of a cylinder.  She will play the role of a weighting agent.  We place it on top of the foam.  We pierce the second cardboard circle in the middle with a needle or a thick awl and put it on plasticine. </p><p>  How to make a heart for topiary?  On paper, draw a sketch of this figure and cut it out.  The template is transferred to cardboard and we carry out two identical blanks.  We glue each figure with cotton pads on both sides.  Glue a wooden stick on one of the blanks.  We smear the hearts with glue and put one on the second so that the skewer is inside the product.  When this workpiece dries, we trim the edges of the <span>cotton</span> pads protruding beyond the contours of the figure <span>.</span>  Next, the topiary in the form of a heart begins to decorate.  Wrap red part with yarn, decorated with cosmetic circles.  We apply the threads tightly to each other so that no gaps are created.  When the work is finished, glue the tip of the yarn.  From cardboard we cut out blanks (4-5 pieces) in the form of small hearts.  We pierce each figure with pieces of wire, the length of which is 20-30 cm, and fix their edge in the form of a loop in the bottom of the cardboard element.  We wrap all the blanks with thread.  Wrap the wire around a wooden stick, placing hearts in different directions.  Insert the skewer with the lower end into the container, pushing it into the plasticine as deep as possible.  We decorate the topiary trunk with white threads, arranging them in a spiral.  Apply glue to the outer sides of the cardboard pot.  We put pink yarn on it and tightly wrap the container.  We decorate the place under the tree with scraps of red thread, we fasten them to PVA.  Here we randomly arrange the beads.  The composition is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heart shaped topiary" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/370066.jpg?1396994262782" width="445"></div>

Let's make such a souvenir according to the following description.  We make a heart-shaped template out of paper.  Transfer it to cardboard, circle and cut.  We put three napkins together and crumble tight "balls" out of them.  With these blanks we glue the entire surface of the cardboard backing from two sides.  We fasten the elements close to each other, there should be no gaps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heart shaped topiary" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/370067.jpg?1396994308868" width="349"></div>  We smear the plastic tube with hot-melt adhesive at the bottom, apply a <span>satin ribbon</span> to this place <span>.</span>  Wrap it with a "trunk" in a spiral to the very top.  We fix the tip with glue.  We glue this detail to the ‚Äúcrown‚Äù of the topiary decorated with napkins.  Plaster (alabaster) is bred according to the instructions indicated on the package.  Its consistency should be similar to sour cream.  We fill the flower pot with the solution, without adding 5 cm to the top. In the middle, insert the product.  We hold the figure for several minutes, allowing the liquid to solidify.  The surface of the heart is decorated with artificial roses, gluing them tightly to one another.  We lubricate the place under the barrel with glue and lay out a tape on it randomly.  We tie a lush bow from a nylon wide ribbon on a pot.  An exclusive gift for the bride and groom is made.
