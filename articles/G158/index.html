On the one hand, this is correct, on the other hand, we often lose sight of some manufacturers who produce good equipment.  The same thing happened with Doogee Shoot 1. There are very few reviews about this phone, because this manufacturer is not known to Russian consumers. </p><p>  But in due time Meizu did not inspire confidence. </p><h2>  Company </h2><p>  We know a huge number of Chinese companies that produce phones.  But even more remain unknown to us.  Nevertheless, they produce good budget devices that may appeal to a picky consumer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee shoot 1 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022598.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Doogee is a small Chinese factory that has already released several smartphones.  It cannot be said that they received a significant response in the CIS countries, but did not become worse from this. </p><p>  Of course, this company does not have such opportunities as world-famous companies.  Therefore, developers have to sacrifice something.  Most often this is the "filling" of the phone.  From here it turns out that cheap models with some drawbacks get to the market. </p><p>  DooGee Shoot 1 received its reviews, which means that someone knows about it.  The model stood out with a dual camera.  As a marketing ploy, this is a winning option.  Externally, the novelty is not inferior to all new-fangled models.  With performance, everything is somewhat worse, but looking at the price tag, you understand that this is not so significant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  We approached the packaging creatively.  It looks decent, although the features of the budget segment are noticeable.  Before us is a black matte box with a nice soft-touch coating.  The phone is displayed on the front, the model is indicated above it, and the manufacturer‚Äôs logo is modestly placed in the left corner. </p><p>  Inside the box, a small surprise awaits us, which has collected positive reviews.  Smartphone Doogee Shoot 1 came out with advanced equipment.  He was placed on a tablet, under which there is a compartment with other accessories. </p><p>  The Chinese manufacturer introduced a charger, a USB cable to it.  There is all the necessary documentation and a paper clip to remove the SIM card tray. </p><p>  It was decided to add a silicone case to such a standard set.  It is soft but of high quality.  For many, it was just a godsend.  A protective film is already pasted on the screen - another plus.  And also there is a ‚Äúcloth‚Äù for wiping the display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone doogee shoot 1 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022593.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design was noticeably adopted from Huawei.  There are some features of an already forgotten HTC.  The Chinese factory did not ‚Äúbother‚Äù and be original.  Before us is a copy of all modern devices. </p><p>  Since this is a budget segment - no metal cases.  The back cover is made of plastic, with already traditional antenna inserts.  Probably, everyone is already used to them, so Doogee decided not to reinvent the wheel, but to go along the beaten path. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The shape of the case is still the same round.  There are rounded edges of the screen.  Elements all settled down in already familiar places.  In front there is a mechanical button, like Meizu, and on the sides of it there are small indicators that are touch-sensitive control keys. </p><p>  The model is available in black, gray and, of course, in gold.  The black version is the most interesting and bought, although it has acquired a more dark gray shade.  Gold, by the way, is the same far from this color.  It is more beige and pink. </p><h2>  Essential elements </h2><p>  So, the front panel is almost completely occupied by the screen.  It is covered with 2.5D protective glass.  A film is glued on top.  Not the fact that it will serve you for a long time.  As usual, such accessories quickly collect damage and scratches.  May get dirty.  In any case, you can order a couple more from China. </p><p>  The cover is also useful, of course, if you need the usual protection of the back cover from scratches, then it will work perfectly.  The rest can pick up ‚Äúbumpers‚Äù more fun.  The silicone case sits firmly on the case, there are additional plugs for the headset and charging connectors.  If they interfere, they can be cut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee shoot 1 black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022596.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Under the screen is a mechanical oval button with a silver border.  She is also responsible for the fingerprint scanner.  In this regard, the Doogee Shoot 1 phone received good reviews.  Such a sensor is now in fashion, and many users want it to quickly move to the budget segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are touch keys on the sides of the button.  They can be customized to establish more familiar commands. </p><p>  Above the screen is the front camera, next to it is the earpiece.  Immediately placed a pair of sensors. </p><p>  The main surprise is located on the cover of the device.  Here you can hardly lose sight of the two ‚Äúeyes‚Äù of the camera, between which there is a flash.  In the middle of the case is the manufacturer‚Äôs logo.  Above and below there is a black edging.  Usually this is used in metal cases to hide antennas under it.  The manufacturer decided to add this element to his device. </p><p>  The dimensions of the phone are standard.  It is impossible to say that it is large.  It is 15 cm high, 7 cm wide and 8 mm thick.  He weighs up to 170 grams.  In the hands of the model lies well.  Due to the fact that the case is made of plastic, it is lightweight. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  Doogee Shoot 1 Black received good reviews due to the location of parts on the case.  The right end is occupied by the power button.  Above it is a combined tray for two microSIM or one memory card.  Despite the fact that such an arrangement seemed unusual to many, still most of the owners accepted it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee shoot 1 phone reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022592.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the left side, a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for volume control took its place.  The bottom side has got a charger connector.  On the sides of it there are two identical grilles.  Under one of them is an external speaker.  Under the second is usually a microphone.  But in this model everything turned out somehow strange.  The microphone took a seat next to the grill.  As a result, the latter plays the role of decoration. </p><p>  On the case there is an auxiliary microphone for noise reduction.  It is located above the upper ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the camera.  This arrangement is not always convenient, because sometimes it is covered with a hand. </p><p>  The top end is occupied by a single headset jack. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Display Doogee Shoot 1 reviews received good.  Display size - 5.5 inches with FullHD resolution.  Some budget models from popular manufacturers do not even have such parameters.  Before us is a good, high-quality screen with an IPS matrix. </p><p>  He has an automatic brightness control, and a team from Sharp worked on its creation. </p><p>  The display surprised many.  Looking at the price tag of the device, you can expect anything.  In the same case, it turned out that the manufacturer did not save on the screen.  Firstly, a good diagonal, which allows you to read, watch movies, and quickly search for something on the Internet. </p><p>  Secondly, the colors are correct and there are no complaints about them.  Thirdly, the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels was pleased.  The brightness reserve is sufficient for use on a sunny day.  You can customize the display differently using the built-in Live Display feature.  She corrects and calibrates colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone doogee shoot 1 black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022594.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Work autonomy </h2><p>  I was pleased with the Doogee Shot 1. battery. The feedback from the owners was good, since the 3300 mAh battery lasted for a full day.  Thanks to the 5V / 2A charger, the minimum charging time is one and a half hours. </p><p>  The phone can play up to 6 hours of video files.  The problem lies only in the fact that the developers did not deal with optimizations of the "filling" due to lack of money.  Therefore, even if the phone is in standby mode, it is still discharged.  When the screen is on, the device will live 3 hours. </p><p>  Some owners were disappointed that the battery does not always act according to the rules.  Sometimes it can show strange and unexpected ‚Äúmanipulations‚Äù: to lose many percent at night or not to be discharged after an hour of work.  All this, of course, is bad for work.  Therefore, the Doogee Shoot 1 Black smartphone reviews are completely different. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  There is nothing to brag about.  Before us is a simple budget phone, a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  Of course, in addition to communication, he can easily withstand watching videos and listening to music.  It is also enough for surfing the Internet. </p><p>  Toys and demanding applications will have to be abandoned.  The system is not optimized and does not always work correctly. </p><p>  Inside is the quad-core MediaTek 6737T chipset with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  The accelerator also comes from China - Mali T720 MP2.  2 GB of RAM is a boundary indicator.  It will be enough for some, but not enough for someone.  Still, most modern models try to produce with 3 or 4 GB of RAM. </p><p>  The internal memory is also modest - 16 GB, of which only 10 GB is available.  But if this is not enough, remember that you can always sacrifice one SIM card and install a memory card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee shoot 1 customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022597.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In operation, performance is enough with the head.  "Heavy" games will not work as we would like, but you can even try to run them. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  In terms of the various modules and all the technologies that are needed for communication, everything is fine.  The model supports LTE in five bands.  It does not give out aggregation of frequencies, the speed is the lowest possible, but everything works stably. </p><p>  There is OTG support, although most owners did not need it at all.  The rest do not even understand what it is.  Wi-Fi is stable, without glitches.  Bluetooth also does a good job. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As you can see from the customer reviews of Doogee Shoot 1, it was the camera that attracted many.  Firstly, this ‚Äútrick‚Äù is far from even in all expensive models, and secondly, it looks promising.  In fact, as you know, everything is somewhat different.  After all, if it produced such amazing quality, the device would cost several times more. </p><p>  Before us are two modules.  One works in a resolution of 13 megapixels.  This lens was created by Samsung, and there are no questions about it.  The second module is 8 megapixels.  It is needed in order to analyze the depth of the image and create beautiful bokeh. </p><p>  Everything seems to sound good, but in fact it turned out to be deceptive.  If you cover the 8-megapixel module, a message appears on the screen that the lens is closed.  If you ignore it and take a picture, and then repeat the action with the module already open, you will notice that there is no difference. </p><p>  On the one hand, it was clear that this was a marketing move.  On the other hand, has the manufacturer really spent the money on a regular dummy.  It turned out that there is still a difference in the photographs, and it lies in the resolution of the picture.  Pictures are superimposed, thereby improving the final image. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee shot 1 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2022595.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Many people liked the Doogee Shoot 1 front camera. She received good reviews due to her 8 megapixel resolution and portrait processing capabilities. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Here's a budget and unusual smartphone.  Users noted that there are no problems regarding communications and communications.  In this regard, it is difficult to spoil anything.  The connection is good, the sound of the microphone and the speaker is also normal. </p><p>  Many people liked the appearance.  Yes, even if it‚Äôs typical of a modern device, it‚Äôs fashionable.  There were complaints about the placement of parts on the case.  Someone used to that the power and volume button is always nearby.  But these are all subjective moments that are quickly forgotten. </p><p>  Reviews of the Doogee Shoot 1 Gray touched its hardware.  The phone really has a problem with this.  Due to an unoptimized system, we get some problems with the battery and overall performance.  But if you do not need resource-intensive work with "heavy" applications, then the hardware will be enough for you. </p><p>  Before us is a good <span>budget phone</span> for 9 thousand rubles.  He is not bad, both externally and internally.  The device is not suitable for every modern user.  Therefore, it is important to understand what is important to you in a smartphone.  For those who are looking for a fashionable ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, Doogee Shoot 1 is a great choice. </p>
