The amazing beauty of the region struck even Prince Karim Aga Khan VI, who was only 22 years old.  Together with his friends, he organized a consortium of Costa Smeralda to give the region a tourist development.  Since then, the Emerald Coast began to take on a completely different look. </p><p>  The construction of the first hotels began on its territory, which in the summer turned into a meeting place and communication between representatives of the upper class and the powerful.
