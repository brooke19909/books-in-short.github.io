How to sell an apartment without intermediaries?  A step-by-step instruction consists of several stages, each of which will have to pay a lot of attention. </p><h2>  Appraisal of the apartment </h2><p>  Initially, you need to determine the optimal price of real estate.  Different possibilities can be used for this: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  market research, which allows you to find out what the average price is set for similar apartments; </li><li>  pricing on the basis of one‚Äôs own intuition, and under such conditions it is likely that the selected indicator will be excessively high or too low; </li><li>  using the services of a professional appraiser, who, when compiling a report, will indicate what the average price of the studied object is. </li></ul><p>  The latter option is considered appropriate, since you can get really correct and relevant information.

Under such conditions, they have significant debts levied by the bailiffs.  Often, citizens prefer to sell real estate without paying off debts. </p><p>  How to sell an apartment with debts?  You can notify buyers in advance of their availability, so new owners may ask for a reduction in the cost of housing.  Often, buyers are deceived, as they learn about significant debts after the registration of real estate for themselves.

If there is time and opportunity, then you can do the process yourself.  To save time and effort, it is advisable to contact a real estate agency. </p>
