For convenience, it is important to put them in place so that everything you need is always at hand.  You can buy a ready-made box for needlework.  But such accessories are sometimes very expensive.  You can make an organizer for threads with your own hands, and spending a minimum of time and money on it. </p><h2>  Wall organizer </h2><p>  Those who are engaged in sewing professionally and have dozens of skeins available can make a wall-mounted organizer for thread spools with their own hands.  To do this, you need a sheet of plywood, a hammer, long nails, a baguette for decorating the frame, paint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cincinnatiques.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014778.jpg"></div><p>  Size depends on the number of threads.  Cut a rectangle from plywood, make a marking on it, drawing a grid with cells the size of which slightly exceeds the diameter of the coil.  With an awl or a nail, make notches at the intersection of the lines where the carnations will subsequently be driven.  From a foam ceiling fillet or from a baguette, make a frame and insert a plywood blank into it. </p><p>  Paint or decorate in any other way.  You can make a decoupage or burn a picture.  After that drive in the nails.  For best results, they should be placed a little at an angle to the base.  In this case, the coils will not slip and they will be clearly visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the back, you need to attach a hook for hanging or another mounting system. </p><h2>  Thread shelf </h2><p>  You can make an organizer for threads with your own hands in the form of a shelf.  To make it, you need boards or slats 2-4 cm wide. You can use wooden boxes for vegetables.  Using screws or nails, you need to assemble the frame.  Place a few thread poles on it.  The distance between them should be 2 times the length of the coil so that they can be easily taken and put in place.  Drive several nails vertically into each pole at an equal distance.  They will serve as pins for coils.  Fasten the perches in the frame. </p><p>  Such an organizer for threads with your own hands can be hung on a wall or put on a table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sewing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread spool organizer" class="if uuid-3014729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014729.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate it in any way so that it is not just a working tool, but also a decoration of the workplace.  Instead of nails, you can use other fasteners: screws, pegs and even pencils or writing pens. </p><h2>  Cookie box organizer </h2><p>  As a basis for an organizer for storing threads with your own hands, you can decorate a cookie tin box.  Its height allows you to insert the coil vertically.  And due to the fact that the box is closed with a lid, all its contents will be protected from dust.  Such an accessory can be easily transported. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For work, you need a can, a piece of polystyrene foam equal to the diameter of the bottom, wooden skewers.  Manufacturing procedure: </p><ol><li>  First, from the foam with a width of 1.5 cm, you need to cut a circle corresponding to the bottom of the can. </li><li>  You can take sheets of tin, only in this case you need to make 3 layers.  Or use a laminate backing. </li><li>  Divide the wooden skewers into segments slightly less than the height of the casket.  If necessary, clean the cut points with sandpaper. </li><li>  Put polystyrene on the bottom of the casket, insert the sticks into it in a circle so that coils can be easily put on them.  In the center, you can glue a piece of foam, which will be used as a needle bed. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.thescrapshoppeblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014723.jpg"></div><h2>  Shoe box </h2><p>  You can use a cardboard box, for example from shoes, or packaging from other products.  Its surface is sealed with wallpaper, colored paper or fabric.  And the inside is designed similarly to the previous version.  If space permits, you can make cardboard partitions so that in the organizer for threads with your own hands you can find a place for other sewing accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makehouse.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014739.jpg"></div><h2>  Embroidery Tips </h2><p>  All of the options described above were for bobbin thread.  But embroiderers use floss, which is sold in hanks.  With random storage, they get mixed up, which complicates the work.  There are several ways to make an organizer for a thread floss yourself. </p><p>  Plastic bobbins are one of the common options.  They can be bought or made independently by cutting blanks from plastic.  Shampoo bottles that have expired can be used, dense packaging plastic or bottles.  Scissors or a soldering iron cut the shape of the workpiece.  It can be a 6 x 8 rectangle with rounded edges. </p><p>  You can make it in the form of a "bone" or choose any other shape.  It is necessary to make notches in which the ends of the threads will be inserted, this will prevent unwinding.  A mouline thread is wound on such bobbins; for ordering, a label with the manufacturer‚Äôs number or brand is glued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thistleandleaves.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014734.jpg"></div><p>  Such bobbins can be made of thick cardboard, but they will not be as durable as plastic. </p><p>  Another option is a thread holder.  It is a bar with rows of holes cut along the edge.  A color is inserted into each hole.  These holders are convenient for work, so as not to look for the right shades - they are always at hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014759.jpg"></div><p>  You can make them out of thick cardboard by cutting out a rectangle measuring 15 x 10 cm. Along the long edge, you need to make holes with a hole punch, stepping back 1.5 cm. The skein of the mouline thread needs to be straightened in length, folded in half and inserted into the hole with a fold.  In the resulting loop you need to thread the ends and tighten, it turns out "fringe" from the floss.  Above the holes you can write a color number with a pen or felt-tip pen. </p><p>  In order for the cardboard to last until the end of the work, it is recommended to laminate it with adhesive tape on both sides.  And after that, insert the threads. </p><h2>  Floss Storage </h2><p>  To store the floss, you can make an organizer for threads with your own hands.  You will need a cardboard box of a rectangular shape.  If it is narrow, then you need to make bobbins along the width of the box and after winding the threads, insert them in the desired sequence.  If the box is wide, then you need to make cardboard partitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="craftstorageideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY thread organizer" class="if uuid-3014732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/3014732.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate to your liking.  These are just a few ideas on how to make a thread organizer with your own hands.  Each craftswoman can make the most convenient option for her in her favorite technique. </p>
