Only not all services are connected automatically.  And sometimes you have to understand one or another affiliate program.  Today we will find out what the Beeline promotion ‚ÄúHappy Time‚Äù is.  This offer is able to bring a lot of pleasure to subscribers who have been working with our current telecom operator for a long time.  Let's start exploring the task as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline happy time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126617.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  What kind of action is this from Beeline - Happy Time?  This is an offer that allows you to return up to 15% of all communication costs as special points.  In truth, a very tempting offer.  It is worth paying attention: you can spend bonuses at any time for your own needs. </p><p>  True, the percentage of return of funds as points depends directly on how long you are with the Beeline operator.  "Happy Time" accumulates as a whole, starting with 5% of expenses.  In principle, if you have been a subscriber for a long time, you can connect to the action and use its capabilities.  How exactly do this? </p><h2>  Incredible opportunities </h2><p>  We already know the description of the Beeline promotion, Happy Time.  How to connect it, we will talk a little later.  To begin with, it is worth emphasizing all the features of this program.  For example, you can always transfer the accumulated bonuses to a friend.  True, only if he also participates in the proposal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How exactly can an idea be realized?  To do this, dial a special combination.  Write * 767 # payee number payment amount *.  Now it‚Äôs worth clicking on the call button.  And all done. </p><p>  True, the Beeline promotion has some limitations here.  "Happy Time" allows you to transfer comrades at least 10 points, a maximum of 3,000 per day.  They are stored on the balance sheet for 30 days.  If during this time you do not spend bonus points, they disappear.  This is worth considering.  In addition, in the request for sending funds, you must write the subscriber‚Äôs number and the payment amount through a space.  No commas or other signs.  Otherwise, it will not work to realize the idea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline happy time how to connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126618.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Balance check </h2><p>  Another point that you should immediately find out before connecting to the program is a balance request.  It has to be monitored constantly.  After all, "Happy Time" "Beeline" has a validity period.  The points you receive must be spent within 6 months.  Otherwise, they burn out. </p><p>  How is the balance checked in this program?  Dial * 767 * 2 # on your mobile device, and then wait until you receive a message with the remaining funds.  Please note that some delays are possible.  If after 5 minutes no messages arrived, try again.  In principle, this is so far all the important information that should worry the subscriber.  You can join the Beeline company "Happy Time".  How to connect it to yourself?  Now let's figure it out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Well, we decided to participate in a tempting offer from our operator today.  Now you can think about how to bring the idea to life.  There are several approaches.  All of them are easy to learn even for a novice user. </p><p>  Firstly, Beeline Corporation connects Happy Time through the operator‚Äôs official page.  Here you will have to go through authorization, look at the "Shares" section and find the corresponding item there.  Next, click on the desired line and select the "Connect" command.  Enter the activation code in the window that appears (it will come to the mobile in a message) - and the thing is done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="happy beeline time how to use bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126619.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Secondly, the bonus program is also connected using a USSD request.  To implement the method, dial * 767 # and wait for an answer.  That's all, nothing else is needed.  This option is most often used.  We became participants in the action <span>"Happy Time" ("Beeline").</span>  <span>How to use bonuses?</span>  There are several solutions.  Everyone is able to independently choose how to manage their savings. </p><h2>  We spend on communication </h2><p>  For example, anyone has the right to spend their Happy Time bonuses on payment for communication services.  In principle, this is a rather interesting solution.  But it is not used very often.  The service is valid for 30 days.  After that, you will have to reactivate the payment of bills with bonuses.  If you don‚Äôt have enough funds on your balance sheet, the balance will be written off in rubles. </p><p>  How to activate this feature?  A special request will help.  Type * 789 # on your phone and press the call button.  That's all.  In response, you will receive a notification that within 30 days you will be paid with points accrued under the program.  But how to use Beeline Happy Time in a different way?  Is there such an opportunity at all? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use happy beeline time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126620.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Payment for purchases </h2><p>  Yes, of course.  You can spend bonuses to pay for some purchases in Beeline stores and salons.  True, not all of the amount can be paid with points.  But only 10%.  It should be borne in mind that 1 ruble = 1 bonus.  By the way, this proposal most often applies to the acquisition of gadgets from Beeline, as well as equipment for connecting to the Internet. </p><p>  At the time of purchase, you must inform the employee of your intentions to use the accumulated bonuses.  Give your phone number, then give the number of points you need to write off.  The store employee will take all necessary steps to reduce the total cost of equipment.  Perhaps, Beeline Corporation's Happy Time is most often spent on shopping in stores. </p><h2>  Promotions with partners </h2><p>  But this is not necessary to stop.  After all, the above methods are not the only ones that allow you to spend points "Happy Time" ("Beeline").  How to use bonuses differently? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="happy beeline time" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1126621.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This will help special affiliate promotions, which should be viewed on the official page of the telecom operator.  You have every right to cover approximately 20% of the purchase price in the partner store.  Only this is not a constant opportunity.  Rather, periodic.  And it really needs to be tracked.  For example, most recently, subscribers had the right to cover 20% of their purchases with bonuses at Know-How stores.  Perhaps this is a very profitable, but rare occurrence. </p>
