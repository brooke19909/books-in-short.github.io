She will protect the baby in cool weather, will not hinder movements, will look original and modern.  In addition, knitting is a wonderful activity for moms and grandmothers who want to calm the nervous system and get unheard of pleasure from work. </p><h2>  The benefits of knitting for babies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a sleeve" class="if uuid-3111879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111879.jpg"></div><p>  Before you knit a children's sweater, you need to remember the benefits of needlework.  These include: </p><ul><li>  when knitting children's things, a special thrill and tenderness is felt, which has a beneficial effect on mood; </li><li>  it is possible to choose yarn to your liking, giving preference to environmentally friendly threads; </li><li>  at any time you can try on the product, choosing the size as accurately as possible; </li><li>  there is a choice of any style; </li><li>  as the baby grows, the blouse can be increased in size; </li><li>  it is easy to knit a new one from an old product, having previously dissolved the fabric; </li><li>  will be able to complete the original model, which will be unique; </li><li>  significant savings in money; </li><li>  Having learned how to knit well, mom can make needlework a source of additional income. </li></ul><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Before learning how to knit a children's sweater, it is recommended that you carefully choose yarn.  Since this thing is intended for the baby, it should be as convenient and safe as possible for health.  Preference should be given to cotton, woolen or half-woolen threads.  A small presence of synthetic fibers is allowed, as well as the use of home-spinning yarn.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the threads are pleasant to the touch, do not prick, do not have villi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting for beginners" class="if uuid-3111868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111868.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparation of yarn for work </h2><p>  Before knitting a children's sweater, it is necessary to prepare the yarn.  If it is new, it is not recommended to rewind the threads into balls immediately.  To clean them of industrial and household dirt, you need to draw room temperature water into a basin, add baby soap or powder and wait until it dissolves.  Then immerse skeins of yarn in the solution and wash them gently.  After thorough rinsing, it is necessary to squeeze the yarn with your hands, hang it and wait for it to dry completely.  Only then rewind the threads into balls and get to work. </p><p>  A similar procedure should be done with thread that was in use.  Pre-dispose of the old product from the seams, dissolve and collect in soft skeins. </p><h2>  A simple option for beginner needlewomen </h2><p>  Inexperienced craftswomen interested in how to knit a children's sweater with knitting needles for beginners are advised to give preference to one of the easiest and most practical styles.  A needlewoman whose knitting experience will begin with this product will be able to master this principle.  This blouse can be with long sleeves with buttons, zippers or ties.  And you can start your practice with a vest, which the baby will definitely need in cool weather.  It consists of a back and front (can be issued in the form of two shelves with fasteners in the middle). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the choice nevertheless fell on a blouse with sleeves, it should be understood that you will have to separately knit the back, two shelves and sleeves (you can also add a collar and pockets). </p><div class="photo" data-original="nattyknitter.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to tie a sweater" class="if uuid-3111864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111864.jpg"></div><h2>  Back </h2><p>  We offer you to learn how to knit a children's sweater correctly.  Work should begin with knitting the back.  This is to ensure that during the manufacturing process there are no problems.  The back is usually plain or with stripes at the bottom.  In the event of a shortage of threads of one color, it will be possible to add others to the entire jacket, having designed them with shelves and sleeves.  Knitting backs occurs according to the following principle: </p><ol><li>  The back is knitted from the bottom up. </li><li>  You should dial the required number of loops. </li><li>  Knit the first row with facial loops so that a neat edging appears. </li><li>  The next three centimeters of the fabric knit with an elastic band (alternate one front and one wrong side or two loops). </li><li>  Continue knitting the rectangle of the desired size. </li><li>  For the pattern, choose the least embossed knit so that the baby is comfortable lying on his back. </li><li>  In the last row, close all the loops. <div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knit a sweater" class="if uuid-3111866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111866.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Shelves </h2><p>  If you want to make a jacket, then tie the two shelves.  Or repeat the steps indicated for the back.  Then you can make a pullover or sweater.  The size of the shelves is determined by half of the back, plus a few loops on the bar for the fastener.  Start work from the bottom, repeating the principle of knitting the back.  Make two rectangles with a height equal to the height of the back, then close the loops. </p><h2>  Sleeves </h2><p>  If you knit a sweater or pullover, you need to make this detail.  To understand how to tie the sleeve of a children's sweater, you must also read the step-by-step instructions.  Work should begin with a cuff, having previously measured the girth of the handle at the wrist.  The number of loops will approximately equal the number of loops on the shelf.  Having knitted three centimeters with an elastic band, go to the selected pattern.  Continue working to the desired sleeve size along the length, then close the loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewinlove.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY sweatshirt" class="if uuid-3111888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111888.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  When all the parts are connected, they must be carefully stitched together.  It should be remembered that the seams should be almost invisible.  Do not leave a lot of canvas for allowances, since the baby should not rub anything.  You can also make exterior seams with the original design.  Design fasteners in the form of buttons or zippers, optionally add a collar and pockets.  You can also knit a hood in the form of a bonnet or a folded rectangle. </p><h2>  Raglan </h2><p>  Many knit the studied product in the opposite direction.  A children's jacket made with the needles (raglan on top) has a lot of advantages, since it is performed with a single canvas without assembly.  It‚Äôs not difficult to connect it, the main thing is to understand the design principle.  To do this, read the step-by-step instructions: </p><ol><li>  You should start work from above. </li><li>  Measure the neck circumference and dial the desired number of loops (plus six for the bar). </li><li>  To knit several rows with an elastic band (at the beginning and end of a row, knit three loops with a garter stitch for a strap). </li><li>  The next two rows are tied with a garter stitch. </li><li>  It is conditionally divided the number of loops into five parts, since the row begins with a shelf, then there is a raglan line, a sleeve, a raglan line, a back, a raglan, a sleeve, a raglan, a shelf.  For example, out of 78 loops, there will be three loops on the bar, 12 on the shelf, 10 on the sleeve, 24 on the back, again 10 on the sleeve, 12 on the shelf, three on the bar and four on the raglan loops. </li><li>  In the next row, knit fifteen stitches (three on the plank and 12 on the ledge), then double crochet, one front and double crochet, 10 stitches, double crochet, stitch, double crochet, 24 stitches, double crochet, stitch, double crochet, 10 stitches, double crochet, stitch , yarn, the remaining 12 stitches and three for the plank. </li><li>  Knit the next three rows as the loops look. </li><li>  Every three rows add two nakida in place of the raglan line, counting one additional loop for each part. </li><li>  Continue knitting until armpits. </li><li>  Remove sleeves with extra pins. </li><li>  Tie the back and shelves with one cloth. </li><li>  Tie the sleeves to the desired size. <div class="photo" data-original="mariannaslazydaisydays.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's jacket raglan" class="if uuid-3111881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3111881.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  This method will be the best answer to the question of how to knit a children's sweater without seams.  It has a lot of advantages.  The product can be tried on at any time, tied up in the process of the child‚Äôs growth (open closed loops and add the required number of rows), you don‚Äôt need to sew parts whose scars rub soft skin. </p><p>  One has only to start work, and it will become the main and favorite pastime in such a difficult, but such a pleasant period in the life of a woman and her baby. </p>
