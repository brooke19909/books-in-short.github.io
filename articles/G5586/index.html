Miel is no exception.  And so today we will try to understand what this group of companies is doing, what does it really represent?  Is it possible to trust her as an employer and simply as a place to provide certain services?  Or is there some unscrupulous company before us?  It‚Äôs worth sorting out all this, because issues related to real estate are a very serious topic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miel staff reviews" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250711.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  Employment </h2><p>  What is a group of companies called "Miel"?  Real estate is what has become its integral part.  After all, we have before us the real company that works with it.  Or an agency, if you like.  Of course, her activity is also associated exclusively with real estate.  More precisely, with its sale.  We can say that we have a real estate corporation, quite large and popular.  So, the Miel agency does not receive any complaints for its activity.  Everything is extremely clear and simple.  Both applicants and clients are satisfied with this.  What else is worth paying attention to? </p><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  First, let's talk a little about our current company from the perspective of potential employees.  What do they think of this group of companies?  Can you trust her in employment?  Great attention is paid to the vacancies placed by the corporation.  And the Miel agency in this area is not much different from competitors.  This phenomenon is both pleasing and disappointing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why?  Most often they recruit realtors as well as consultant managers.  There are usually no managerial posts.  More precisely, they are all busy.  This means that there will be no prospects for special career growth.  A factor that upsets many applicants.  Nevertheless, working as a realtor or consultant is a normal occurrence in a real estate agency.  You can find a job to your liking.  And for this, the feedback from the Miel staff remains good.  Here you will not hear any deception and loud promises of high posts.  You will know in advance what you are agreeing to.  Therefore, so far there is every reason to trust the company.  In any case, from the applicants. </p><h2>  Job interviews </h2><p>  Well, interviews also play an important role.  These first meetings with a potential employer are put off in the minds of people and help to characterize this or that association somehow.  "Miel" on Petrovka (and not only there) in this area does not receive any negative from applicants.  Is that a little discontent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miel property" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250712.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that the interview itself will be held in the office of the company.  The atmosphere is generally friendly: they communicate with you on equal terms.  This is a rather rare phenomenon that has a huge impact on potential job seekers.  True, there are exceptions.  Occasionally, some arrogance on the part of the employer can be seen.  Such phenomena try to stop very quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Miel staff reviews are good.  They indicate that communicating with the hiring manager is very fruitful.  You can ask your consultant for all the details of the selected vacancy.  He will certainly explain to you the features of a particular activity.  And while no one will not hide anything.  What could be better than complete information about the vacancy and future work?  Thanks to such honesty, Miel at Petrovka, and not only at this address, receives good opinions from applicants.  But is it worth trusting such reviews?  Is everything really as good as it seems? </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Special attention is paid <span>to working conditions</span> at employment.  After all, this factor is important for applicants.  Nobody wants to work in indecent, bad, uncomfortable surroundings.  Therefore, employees often leave their opinions with this in mind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miel agency" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250710.jpg" width="580"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  And Miel (a network of real estate offices) earns positive reviews in this area.  Why?  The company offers not only good and favorable conditions, but also comfort.  Firstly, you will be in a well-equipped office most of the time.  Secondly, you can combine <span>real estate activities</span> with any other.  All workplaces have what any employee needs: a pleasant appearance and full functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Mostly you have to work at a computer or desktop.  Yes, this is predominantly sedentary work, but it still causes joy and interest among applicants.  Many employees dream of a comfortable office and workplace.  The Miel company will provide just such conditions.  They will surely please you.  In any case, this is what many potential employees promise, both current employees and the employer himself. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  A separate place is allocated for the discussion of income from any activity and the company as a whole.  Nobody wants to go to a prestigious corporation that will pay a penny.  Therefore, salary is one of the most important indicators that can both push away and attract.  In "Miel" realtors note that the situation is ambiguous here.  The employer himself promises high profits, interest on transactions, bonuses and bonuses.  About 60,000 a month is now a reality.  But in practice it turns out differently.  And this disappoints many job seekers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miel on Petrovka" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250709.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The whole problem is that real estate activity is a variable thing.  And your salary will directly depend on your transactions.  For this, the reviews of Miel employees can be seen as negative.  It turns out that there is no fixed salary.  There is a likelihood of concluding a very profitable transaction that will bring you quick and great profit.  But it is possible that you, in general, will not receive anything.  Remember, Miel (Moscow and other cities) is a real estate company.  And in such organizations, the salary per se is not paid in a fixed amount.  Only a percentage of transactions.  Well, and bonuses / bonuses at the discretion of the employer. </p><h2>  Freedom and social package </h2><p>  But there are a few more points that have received the attention of applicants.  It is difficult to say whether the employees treat them well, but in general the situation here is the same as with most realtors.  Miel Corporation sells real estate to various citizens.  And realtors, employees in offices, have quite a few opportunities at their workplace.  Which ones? </p><p>  It has already been said that this direction is perfectly suitable for combination.  That is, you can work not only at Miel, but also in some other place.  At a position more stable in relation to earnings.  And it pleases.  The feedback from Miel staff on this issue is really positive.  After all, if you can conclude a profitable deal, then working in a corporation will be just a worthy side job.  And you will not lose your basic salary (for example, from activities in another company). </p><p>  Negative sides in such freedom also exist.  Initially, they promise you a full social package.  Plus official registration, payment of communication and transport services.  But in practice this will not happen.  Official work at Miel is rare.  And make out, as a rule, only the very best.  So, there are no guarantees of a social package.  And you can forget about paying for communications and transport - you‚Äôll have to pay for everything from your pocket.  An unpleasant phenomenon that is disappointing.  Although a similar picture is observed in many corporations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="miel customer reviews" class="if" height="156" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For clients </h2><p>  Well, with the applicants sorted out a bit.  In general, Miel is not much different from its competitors: it does not suit workers too much.  Not surprising, especially given the lack of stable income from activities.  But what do customers think of this organization?  Their opinion also plays an important role. </p><p>  Here, as in the case of workers, there is no single solution.  Some "Miel" are satisfied, others are not.  You can say how lucky.  After all, any real estate office is a risk.  No one knows which seller you come across.  Maybe you and the corporation will simply be deceived! </p><p>  Nevertheless, in general, Miel receives good customer reviews.  Impressions after visiting the offices remain positive.  You will communicate with employees who know their job for sure.  In addition, all offices look neat and tidy.  These are not destroyed shacks, into which it is unpleasant to enter!  You can always contact a realtor of the Miel Corporation and get up-to-date information from him.  This makes me happy.  The quality of service is also on top! </p><h2>  Cheats </h2><p>  But not everything is as beautiful as we would like.  Indeed, in Miel, work is often dubious.  And employees are far from always ready to ‚Äúspread‚Äù in front of a client in order to make money.  Sometimes the lack of stable profit makes itself felt.  This is reflected in the behavior of realtors.  And as a result - on the activities of the entire organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Miel Realtors" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250707.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <p></p>
    <p>  For example, some customers complain that they are not communicating in the best possible way.  There are workers who are rude and generally do not respond to comments.  The phenomenon is not too frequent, but it is present.  And repels many customers.  Communicating with a bad and uncultured, rude realtor is a terrible thing. </p><p>  Another negative point is deception.  And on the part of sellers, as a rule.  But no one blames them, all the bumps are strewed at Miel.  Therefore, sometimes you can hear that this organization is not distinguished by its honesty.  Some transactions are frustrated due to such phenomena.  It turns out that our current group of companies and applicants is deceiving, and customers. </p><h2>  Rates </h2><p>  Another important point is the cost of services.  He also plays a role.  Miel is a prestigious, elite group of real estate offices.  And in it, as noted by buyers, the prices are quite high.  And on the real estate itself, and as a percentage of the transaction.  It repels many.  Yes, I want to always work and deal with good, prestigious companies.  But for their services, they should not ‚Äútear three skins‚Äù.  Everything is good in moderation.  Unfortunately, Miel doesn‚Äôt.  But if you care about the quality of services, as well as the reputation of the agency, you can contact here without any problems. </p><h2>  The choice </h2><p>  The last thing clients look at is the choice of real estate.  This is precisely what makes him put up with some of the negative aspects Miel has.  This organization does offer a wide selection of accommodation.  With it, you can find what you like, without any problems and in the shortest possible time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="miel job" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1250706.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Of course, you have to pay for everything.  That is why many believe that Miel‚Äôs property prices are overpriced.  In principle, it is up to you to contact here or not.  This is a real-life company, which has taken confident positions in the market of goods and services.  You can trust her, but you have to be careful.  Therefore, pay attention to this factor.  The final decision is yours! </p>
