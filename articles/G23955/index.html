The article will talk about the Subini GR4 STR navigator and its functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="13volt.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="navigator subini gr4" class="if uuid-2466680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466680.jpg"></div><h2>  What are these devices for? </h2><p>  The use of accessories that are not standard on the car has become as natural as washing or brushing your teeth.  DVRs Subini GR4 STR (or any other model) have become integral components of the vehicle, and now the lack of it on the windshield somewhere near the rear view mirror creates a feeling of incompleteness. </p><p>  The congestion of large cities of various types with cars poses a threat not only to the environment, but also to the health and safety of any driver.  It is not always possible to correctly recreate the details of a traffic accident, especially if the culprit managed to escape. </p><p>  Here video gadgets come to the rescue, capable of not only fixing the license plate number of the car, but also the details of the incident itself.  It is only important to monitor the availability of free space on the memory card, the level of battery charge and the health of the product itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aregis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector Subini GR4" class="if uuid-2466697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466697.jpg"></div><h2>  Properties and characteristics </h2><p>  This model was designed on an all-in-one basis, therefore it combines a recorder, a radar detector and a navigator.  Subini GR4 is also used as an e-book and multimedia player that supports all popular audio and video formats. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The gadget is jokingly called a legal spy, because the camera lens is mounted so that it is invisible to the naked eye, and a sensitive microphone is able to record all conversations. </p><p>  It supports the ability to update maps of the area, laying a convenient route.  The product even recognizes voice commands, which greatly simplifies operation. </p><p>  It has a color LCD monitor with a diagonal of 7 inches and a resolution of 800 √ó 480 pixels.  Touch screen, control is carried out both by pressing the buttons with your finger, and using a special pen. </p><p>  The processor is not Ambarella, like most DVRs, but the MediaTek MT3351 with a frequency of 600 megahertz, internal memory of 4 gigabytes, and also RAM of 64 MB. </p><p>  An improved model with the V2 marking was also released, which differed from the original with a higher-quality optical lens on the camcorder, 128 MB RAM and 8 GB internal memory. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  As a multimedia player, the Subini GR4 STR works with the MP3 format, and accepts video files from ASF and AVI to 3GP and MP4.  Built-in FM transmitter, DVR and radar detector.  The latter works at a distance of 800 to 1100 meters and picks up signals from speed measuring devices such as Strelka, Vizir, Chris-P and Binar. </p><p>  Integrated GPS module along with the coordinates of cameras and speed detectors.  You can add your own tags. </p><p>  The e-book accepts only files in TXT format. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd-forum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr subini gr4 str" class="if uuid-2466688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466688.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The Subini GR4 STR is appreciated by motorists for its fast performance, versatility and visual appeal.  Judging by the comments, it was acquired by lovers of long trips in order not to get lost.  It catches satellites quickly, no freezes are observed. </p><p>  It is also noted that the Windows CE 6.0 operating system independently finds com-ports for updating all the necessary components of the device to the latest version. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Alas, there are no comrades for the taste and color, which is why there are many complaints about Subini GR4.  Firstly, many note that the Navitel software is not licensed and therefore does not provide an opportunity to upgrade (although someone did succeed).  Secondly, the owners note that the manufacturer recommends contacting Navitel to purchase an activation key, and those, in turn, respond that they are not involved in the implementation of such things.  As a result, the client was forced to return the gadget back to the store, where they also did not know what to do. </p><p>  Thirdly, complaints were received about the incorrect operation of the registrar itself: frequent freezes, which were treated only by a forced reboot. </p><p>  In addition, motorists note that after turning off the product continues to function in the radar detector mode and annoy others with signals that are disconnected only by removing the cord from the on-board network.  Perhaps just a factory defect, because the instructions contain detailed descriptions of how to turn off the sound.  However, some customers do not recommend Subini GR4 for purchase.  Others, on the contrary, say that the gadget is worth the money (8500 rubles in 2013). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd-forum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr and navigator subini gr4 str" class="if uuid-2466689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466689.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing, it should be noted that the biggest drawback is the fact that the model has long been discontinued (approximately in 2013) and you can find one only on Avito, having bought it from someone else. </p><p>  Again, motorists who are interested in correctly recording everything on video are indignant that such a good model lacks a G-sensor and WDR technology.  The functions are very useful, because a qualitatively captured video is a guarantee that the details of the car accident will be restored thoroughly. </p><p>  If the presence of options such as playing audio and video is still clear (the driver can watch the video in traffic or listen to music on the road), then the e-book function leaves more questions than answers. </p><p>  It is difficult to imagine a motorist who drives a vehicle while reading an interesting book on a seven-inch LCD monitor.  Indeed, in this case, the likelihood of an accident increases significantly. </p><p>  The assumption that such is read during a vehicle idle period is relevant only for truckers.  And then during the unloading or loading of goods or rest.  In addition, such operation of the product will quickly drain the battery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="original-dvr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fully equipped Subini GR4" class="if uuid-2466682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2466682.jpg"></div><p>  All other functions of the Subini GR4 STR allow you to positively evaluate the device, but still it has a lot of options that distract the driver.  Therefore, before choosing a product, you should decide on the properties that you would like to see in the future assistant motorist. </p><p>  After all, the gadget should help, not distract.  Many drivers do the right thing when they get acquainted with the comments, watch review videos that allow you to evaluate the quality of the DVR's work, and also consult not only with sellers in stores, but also with friends who have previously encountered similar models. </p>
