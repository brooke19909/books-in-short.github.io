    <h2>  Xenios Anastasia Resort and Spa 5 *: reviews, prices </h2><p>  The average cost of a trip for 2 adults is 100-105 thousand rubles for 7 nights.  However, this price is purely indicative, as it depends entirely on the number of people in the company, room category, length of stay and type of accommodation.  Of course, for those tourists who will choose Ultra All-Inclusive, this figure will increase.  However, if you look at it from the other side, you can save a lot, since almost everything for a vacationer will be provided for free. </p><p>  Reviews are the final, but no less interesting part of the article, because here people have to find out: is it really so good at the hotel as the administration describes, or are there pitfalls? </p><p>  It is not possible to unequivocally answer this question.  Each person has their own vision of a five-star hotel and the level of comfort, so opinions differ greatly.  One part of the guests of the Xenios Anastasia Resort Spa 5 * hotel, the photos of which were presented in this article, were 90-100% satisfied with their stay.  Vacationers mention in the reviews about the beautiful and well-groomed territory, delicious dishes served in the restaurant, and snacks from the bar, friendly staff.  Maids do their job well, regularly and efficiently clean the rooms.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the work of animators - these are tireless young people who are ready to deal with children almost around the clock!  It is fun, interesting, you can go to the beach at any time, only tourists recommend not to forget to buy special shoes, since the entrance to the sea is rocky and there are hedgehogs in the water. </p><p>  The other part of the guests are negative.  For example, one of the reviews mentioned that there was no own doctor on site.  You have to wait for the doctor to arrive from a nearby city, and this can take 40 minutes and an hour.  Also mentioned are the rudeness of the staff at the reception and the terrible living conditions.  Many people write that photos are a way to mislead vacationers, and in fact the rooms look completely different.  At least those that are inexpensive.  Well, what kind of reviews to believe more is everyone's personal business.  One has only to say that the photos are truly mesmerizing, which was already convincing. </p><p>  This hotel may not deserve the five stars that it has, but people come back here and recommend it to their friends, and when it comes time to leave, they get upset.  On Earth there is no hotel that would appeal to absolutely all tourists, therefore, to experience your own impressions, there is only one right decision - to come here on vacation. </p>
