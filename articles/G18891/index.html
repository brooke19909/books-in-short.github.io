    <p>  Each bill has a strictly defined return period.  This means that the owner of the securities may, in advance of time, demand their exchange for previously invested funds.  In addition, such operations involve the payment of cash compensation.  At its core, a bill of credit is nothing more than a kind of sale and purchase transaction.  The interest rate on the loan correlates with the maturity of the securities.  In addition, the agreement concluded with such a loan contains all the information about the terms of full repayment of the debt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of bills </h2><p>  To date, two main types of such papers are issued.  A promissory note is a document containing a requirement to return a specified amount of money in strictly agreed terms.  A transferable involves a refund in favor of a specific third party. </p>

    <p>  The period for which the registration and issuance of securities is carried out largely depends on the agreements between the borrower and the lender.  Usually this period varies from three to twelve months.  Long-term bills are issued for more than a year. </p><h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  It should be noted that the conditions under which promissory notes are issued are more advantageous than standard cash loans.  The main features are the short-term nature of such loans.  Usually their maturity does not exceed one year. </p><p>  Also, even before the expiration of the loan agreement, the borrower must transfer to the bank a fee and cash compensation for the securities received.  In addition, all these payments are made at a time. </p>

    <p>  The amount of the <span>bill loan</span> commission does not depend on how the amount of the loan has changed over the entire term.  In other words, in this case there is completely no amortization of the loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the agreement concluded upon execution of such a loan, the date of return of the loan does not coincide with the day of repayment of the bill.  This should happen a little earlier. </p><h2>  Clearance mechanism </h2><p>  All existing promissory notes loans are divided into two main groups.  The first includes bearer, including accounting and collateral.  They are accepted by banking institutions at the client, in the role of which is a legal entity, giving out a certain amount in return.  The second includes promissory notes, in which securities are used as collateral. </p>

    <p>  Legal entities that have passed all the procedures prescribed by the bank receive a loan to purchase a bill.  Using this security, the company pays with its supplier for the products sold. </p><p>  After the sale of goods and receipt <span>of funds, the</span> legal entity returns to the bank the amount previously taken along with the interest calculated on it. </p><p>  With the help of a bill remaining in the ownership of the supplier, the latter has the right to settle accounts with its counterparties.  He can also return securities to the bank and receive a certain amount for them. </p><p>  Accounting for bill <span>loans of a bank</span> is that the borrower transfers securities by endorsement before the due date for them and receives in return a fixed amount minus a certain percentage, called a discount. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The existence of such loans has a positive effect on the state of the financial and economic system.  One of the main advantages possessed by bill <span>loans from commercial</span> banks is the availability of opportunities for a substantial increase in the volume of purchased goods due to the cheapening of loans and increasing the delay in payments. </p>

    <p>  Companies that use securities for settlement with their suppliers are entitled to a <span>VAT refund</span> on the products received.  In addition, such transactions can minimize the risk of non-payments, since all liability for bills is transferred to the banking institution that purchased them.  Registration of such a loan, as a rule, is carried out according to a simplified procedure. </p><p>  It is also important that mutual settlements made using highly liquid bills can significantly reduce the interest rate for commercial loans provided by suppliers of products.  This is because such securities can be equated with cash. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite all of the above advantages, bill loans have several significant disadvantages.  To date, there are a number of objective reasons that reduce the popularity of this financial instrument.  Initially, such loans involve significant financial costs from the borrower.  It should be understood that the client loses his own funds not only due to discount, but due to accrued bank interest. </p><p>  As for the creditor company, the issuance of such a loan also implies the presence of a considerable number of negative factors.  The main one is the occurrence of risk situations that lead to protests of securities and large sums of money that were legally reserved.  But, despite all the shortcomings that bill loans have, one should not completely abandon this financial instrument.  This is especially true in those situations when it comes to bill elements, characterized by a high degree of activity. </p>
