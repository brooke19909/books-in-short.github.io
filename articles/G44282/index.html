    <h2>  MFI </h2><p>  If the bank requires a complex package of documents that forces the borrower to collect a lot of certificates and make voluminous photocopies of various documents, then to get money on credit at the MFI, you will not need a bunch of documents.  And in time everything will be decided much faster.  The only negative is that even if the borrower collects a large number of documents confirming its viability, the interest rate will still be higher than at the bank.  In addition, the loan amount will be limited, especially if the borrower applies for the first time.  And the loan amount will be issued only in rubles. </p><p>  The list of documents that will be needed to apply is very short and consists of only one item - an identity document. </p><p>  It is possible that the borrower will be asked to provide a second document, but here he can choose himself from the list that the lender will offer. </p>

    <p>  For a cash loan granted, interest will be different, depending on which microfinancing organization the borrower will cooperate with.  The minimum interest rate for first-time applicants is from 0.8 to 2% per day.  Accordingly, the annual percentage will fluctuate: from 292 to 730%. </p><p>  The borrower will be required to return the amount received for a fairly short period of time: from several weeks to six months. </p><p>  If the borrower does not apply to the MFI for the first time, then he can expect to receive a loan on other, more favorable terms.  Repeated loan is characterized by a reduced rate, which is reduced by almost 2 times.  Also, the borrower can count on an increase in the loan amount.  Thus, the company tries not to lose a single customer.  Psychology works here - in this MFI they consider him a serious and positive client when they give money on credit and provide bonuses, so why look better? </p><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  Another way to get a loan is to get a credit card.  According to statistics, more than one third of the population of Russia uses a credit card. </p>

    <h2>  What will be required for its design? </h2><p>  To get a credit card, you will need to collect an identical package of documents, like for a consumer loan.  When you first issue a credit card, you should not count on a large credit limit.  If the borrower takes a responsible approach to monthly payment of the debt, as well as actively uses the card, then his credit threshold will increase.  Do not withdraw cash from a credit card.  Firstly, this is not welcomed by the banking system, and secondly, the fee for issuing cash from a credit card can reach a threshold of 5% of the amount issued.  And sometimes the commission may exceed the issued amount of money. </p>

    <h2>  Interest, repayment period and other expenses </h2><p>  Making a credit card to receive a cash loan does not take much time: from 1 to 7 working days.  Sometimes the borrower does not need to go to the bank to get it - the courier service will deliver a credit card to his home. </p><p>  A credit card has an average life of 3 years.  Each year it will be necessary to pay for the service.  The amount will be calculated based on the type of <span>card: Maestro</span> or Visa, from the credit <span>card</span> limit, plus the costs incurred by the bank servicing the client at the bank branch.  Monthly payment of the loan will be 5% of the credit limit amount. </p><p>  Choosing the right place for lending is the prerogative of every citizen.  You should correctly assess your financial capabilities, plan income and expenses, not make rash expenses in order to repay debts in a timely manner and not worsen your credit history. </p>
