    <p>  <span>The necklace parrot</span> (another name is ringed) is currently a very common pet.  It got its name thanks to a peculiar coloring and the presence of a characteristic strip - a ‚Äúnecklace‚Äù on the neck. </p><p>  The size of these birds reaches 50 cm, the length of the wings is 16-17 cm. The plumage is bright: yellow-green, emerald green with bluish feathers on the back of the head.  In males, a dark stripe resembling a tie passes around the neck.  And females most often do not have such a ‚Äúnecklace‚Äù.  The tail of these birds is long, stepped. </p><p>  Characteristically, necklace parrots have weak legs and run very poorly on the ground.  To move along the branches, they often use the beak. </p><p>  There are a dozen subspecies, two of which are already completely extinct.  The most common include the following: </p><p>  <em>- Alexander</em> 's large <em>necklace parrot</em> is the largest representative of this species.  Its length reaches 48-50 cm. The color is grassy-green with a bluish tint, on the neck there is a pink strip and a black ‚Äútie‚Äù, on each wing there is a burgundy red spot.  These birds live in India, Burma, Indochina and Sri Lanka.  The parrot bears its name on behalf of <span>Alexander the Great.</span>  According to legend, the soldiers of the great commander brought these birds with them, returning from Asian campaigns. </p><p>  <em>- Cramer necklace parrot</em> - outwardly resembles the previous view, but the size is much smaller, and there are no burgundy red spots on the wings.  These parrots have a black beak and a red beak, and orange rings around the eyes.  This species lives in two parts of the world at once - in South America and in Africa.  The Cramer Necklace Parrot acclimatized well in <span>Western Europe.</span>  Its nests can be found in large Dutch and German cities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>- The pink-breasted parrot</em> - its body is dark green, and the chest and top of the abdomen are <span>pink.</span>  Head - gray-blue color, on the neck - black "necklace".  This is a small bird up to 40 cm long. There are six varieties of pink-chested parrots on the islands of Kalimantan and Java.  These birds are not suitable for home breeding, therefore, they are most often caught by adults. </p><p>  <em>- The Chinese parrot</em> has a grassy-green plumage with a grayish tint.  He has a gray-blue head with a ‚Äúbandage‚Äù on his forehead and a wide black ‚Äúnecklace‚Äù on his neck.  In size, Chinese parrots are significantly superior to pink-chested.  They live in southeast Tibet, Indochina, southwest China. </p><p>  <em>- The common</em> - <em>headed parrot</em> is the most beautiful of the representatives of birds of this species.  The plumage is saturated green with an olive tint.  Males have a cherry-red head and neck, and a black tie on the neck.  This is the smallest of the parrot necklaces - its length is only 35 cm. </p><p>  <em>- Red-headed parrot</em> - has a green plumage.  Head - bright red <span>, gray-blue</span> on the sides.  On the shoulder blades there is a reddish-brown spot.  Small bird - up to 35 cm in length.  Lives in South China and India. </p><p>  - The <em>Himalayan parakeet</em> is a fairly large bird (up to 40 cm in length) with a dark gray head, a black ‚Äútie‚Äù on its neck and red stripes on its wings.  You can meet this species in the mountain forests of North India and Indochina. </p><p>  <em>- Pigeon parrot</em> - characterized by the gray color of the head, neck, top of the back and lower body.  And on his stomach and near his eyes he has yellow-green feathers.  There are two colored ‚Äúnecklaces‚Äù on the neck - black and blue-green.  This bird lives in Southwest India. </p><p>  <em>- Long-tailed parrot</em> - green with a yellowish tint in the lower part of the body.  His head is red, on the neck - a wide black stripe.  It lives on Sumatra, Kalimantan and the Malacca Peninsula. </p><p>  <strong>Maintenance and care</strong> </p><p>  Necklace parrots quickly get used to home conditions.  These birds learn to speak well, memorizing up to 60 words.  They have a sharp, loud voice. </p><p>  They are fed a mixture of <span>canary seed,</span> oats, millet and wheat - about 35 grams per day.  Without fail, the diet of these birds includes vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, greens. </p><p>  Necklace parrots live with proper care for about 10-15 years.  They need a spacious cage, and for breeding - a nesting house.  Humidity should be high, and temperature should be medium. </p><p>  Necklace parrots are monogamous and form one pair for the rest of their lives. </p>
