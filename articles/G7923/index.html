Moscow-Mozhaysk: electric train, bus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The capital is no longer able to accommodate everyone, so many of its residents move to suburban cities.  That is why there are such routes as Mozhaisk-Moscow, because residents of remote settlements need to get to work in the capital.  <span>Residents of Mozhaisk</span> are ready to endure temporary inconvenience on the way to work, but they want to live as far as possible from the noisy and dusty capital. </p><h2>  Mozhaysk </h2><p>  Many history buffs are not by chance interested in how to get to Mozhaisk, because the first mention of it is found in chronicles of the beginning of the XIII century.  The city itself appeared in 1277, and initially it belonged to the Principality of Smolensk, after some time it was the capital of an independent state formation.  At the beginning of the XVI century, the city turned into a center of artisans and trade, this role he played for several centuries. </p>

    <p>  At one time, the city was one of the epicenters of battles with the army of Napoleon, after which it rebuilt for a very long time.  A new round of development in Mozhaisk began after the appearance of the railway here and continued until the October Revolution.  Over its rich history, Mozhaysk has accumulated a sufficient number of architectural monuments, which are definitely worth exploring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  Close economic flows connect these two settlements; at one time, active trade was taking place along the Mozhaisk ‚Äì Moscow route.  Mozhaysk still remains one of the capital‚Äôs leading suppliers of food, industrial equipment, and is also actively involved in the development and creation of high-quality building materials.  All this is delivered to Moscow daily by rail and <span>road.</span> </p><p>  The capital for many residents of Mozhaisk is the place of work, so they daily run between the two cities by electric trains.  In addition, in Moscow you can buy a large number of goods that are not in the suburbs.  Therefore, <span>buses, minibuses</span> and electric trains are in high demand among local residents, since the need to visit the capital is constant. </p>

    <h2>  Distance </h2><p>  The most important question is distance.  Moscow-Mozhaysk is a route that can be overcome in about two hours.  Two cities separate 108 kilometers from each other, and it‚Äôs hard to believe that in order to overcome this distance, the inhabitants of these settlements used to spend the whole day.  On the way, you will have to drive through a number of other settlements and get acquainted with the Russian village in all its glory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Mozhaisk and Moscow, you can easily find a place to relax, in both cities there are a large number of mini-hotels, the services of which can be used at very reasonable prices.  Please note that the distance that you need to cover by car can be very different from what you need to cover by rail, this is due to the difference in the routes that the vehicles travel. </p><h2>  Bus service </h2><p>  The Mozhaisk-Moscow bus runs daily; the very first flight leaves at 5 am from the local bus station.  Travel time is approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes, all flights arrive at the metro station "Victory Park".  The ticket cost is 190-200 rubles, it is best to check the price at the ticket office of the bus station, since it can vary depending on the time of year. </p>

    <p>  You can also use the services of passing routes that will take you to the Tushinskaya bus station.  They run at a frequency of approximately once every two hours and, together with Mozhaisk routes, significantly reduce the intervals between two cities.  Please note that some flights from Mozhaisk run only on certain days of the week, this is due to the amount of passenger traffic available. </p><h2>  Electric train </h2><p>  The most comfortable way to travel on the Moscow ‚Äì Mozhaysk route is by train, the average travel time is 1 hour 45 minutes, the ticket cost is 250-350 rubles, depending on the available traffic coefficient at the time of the trip.  Some flights run daily, some are assigned only on weekdays or weekends. </p>

    <p>  If you want to get there as fast as possible, pay your attention to the high-speed Lastochka electric train, which runs along the Moscow-Smolensk route.  With it, from the capital to Mozhaisk, and vice versa, you can get there in just an hour and 10 minutes.  However, the fare on it will be higher than usual, you can check it at any railway ticket offices of both settlements. </p><h2>  Or maybe by car? </h2><p>  You can overcome the Mozhaisk-Moscow route by your own car.  The advantages of such a trip are obvious - you can stop at any time or stop by somewhere on the way about your business.  But you have to pay for gasoline yourself, in addition, you will have to spend about two hours behind the wheel.  However, the decision in this case is made only by you. </p><p>  Along the way, you will find a sufficient number of gas stations, cafes and various campsites, so if necessary, you can relax at any time.  The quality of the track can be described as satisfactory, so be careful and careful while driving so as not to damage your vehicle.  The track is gradually being restored to normal, but it is still unknown when exactly its complete repair will be completed. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Mozhaysk-Moscow route is relatively small, so you will not have difficulties with overcoming it.  If you are traveling by car, you can always count on the help of fellow motorists, who will certainly stop when an emergency occurs on the road. </p><p>  Going to Moscow or Mozhaisk, be sure to visit local monuments and attractions, since it is from them that you can restore the general historical atmosphere of the Middle Ages and compare it with modernity.  It is best to go on a trip in the summer, then there is a chance that you will catch any of the local holidays and take an active part in it, having received a charge of positive emotions. </p>
