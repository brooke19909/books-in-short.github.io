    <h2>  History until 1819 </h2><p>  The first mention of the street that corresponded to the modern Kuznetsk Bridge is contained in the document "Census of Moscow Courts" from 1620.  It also mentions that there were courtyards of the patriarchal nobles and the archbishop of Tver.  Around the same period, a wooden bridge was built across Neglinka, called Kuznetskiy, next to which representatives of the most famous aristocratic families began to settle.  A century later, it was replaced by a white stone, and it became one of the four main structures of this kind in Moscow. </p><p>  After the decree of Catherine the Second on privileges to foreigners, the area where the modern street is located.  The Kuznetsk bridge began to turn into a place of compact residence of merchants from European countries, who began to open fashionable and haberdashery shops there.  Over time, many Russian aristocrats moved, and their mansions turned into passages and, as they would say today, shopping centers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During the fire of 1812, the street that the Kuznetsky bridge crossed did not suffer much thanks to the guardsmen of Napoleon, who took under guard the shops and houses of their compatriots.  After the end of World War II, foreigners returned there, and trade went with even greater success than before. </p><h2>  After 1819 </h2><p>  As part of a major restructuring of the capital in 1817, work began on the blocking of Neglinka with stone vaults.  As a result, the Kuznetsk bridge was filled up, the parapets were removed, and new houses were built along their lines.  Toponyms have also undergone changes.  In particular, Kuznetsky Most Street has now appeared. </p><p>  Moscow in those days in terms of trade even had a slight advantage over St. Petersburg, so shopping people from all over Russia gathered there.  In particular, until 1917, the Kuznetsk bridge, in modern terms, was the main shopping destination for fashionistas from all over the country, and in the newspapers of that time it was often called the “sanctuary of luxury and fashion”.  Over time, an atelier appeared on the street where, in 24 hours, customers sewed dresses and suits based on samples brought directly from Paris. </p><p>  Later, the Kuznetsk bridge became a kind of showcase of the welfare of the city, which was shown to foreigners with pleasure.  For this purpose, in 1886 they even conducted electric lighting, which was a novelty for Russia.  Large-scale construction on Kuznetsky <span>Most</span> Street <span>(Moscow)</span> began in the 20th century, when some dilapidated houses were demolished and new apartment buildings and passages, which today are its decoration, were demolished. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  After the October revolution </h2><p>  In the first years after the establishment of Soviet power, most of the buildings on the Kuznetsk bridge were confiscated and transferred to various state institutions and organizations.  The second life of the street began during the NEP, when enterprising citizens were again allowed to develop trade.  However, the title of the country's main fashion center was returned to this place when the All-Union House of Models, which the Kuznetsky Bridge is famous for, was opened in house No. 14. </p><p>  After this event, Moscow, thanks to the designers working there, became known in the world as a place where a special fashion with a Russian soul is created. </p>

    <h2>  In the post-Soviet period </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, in the early 90s, some buildings were demolished, and new ones were built in their place.  It is difficult to say whether they adorned the Kuznetsk bridge.  Moscow during this period generally suffered many architectural losses, mostly irreparable.  In order to prevent this from happening in the future, in 2011 the part of the street where ancient buildings were concentrated was assigned to the protected areas.  In addition, almost all of them have been given the status of monuments of federal significance. </p><h2>  Modern look </h2><p>  Today, in the vicinity and on the street Kuznetsk bridge (Moscow area, limited by Theater Passage and <span>Bolshaya Dmitrovka</span> and Rozhdestvenskaya Streets) there are many famous cultural and educational institutions, starting from the Bolshoi Theater and the Technical Library and ending with the school named after  Schepkina. </p><p>  At the same time, it continues to remain a place where the most famous shops of the capital are concentrated.  Among them are the completely renewed TSUM, the Svetlana Trading House, the 4-storey Podium store, etc. This ancient street is also known for its attractions that deserve a separate description. </p>

    <h2>  Tretyakov apartment building </h2><p>  The most convenient transport that allows you to get to Kuznetsky Most Street is the metro.  Not far from the station of the same name is the Tretyakov Apartment Building, built in 1892 in the <span>pseudo-Russian style by the</span> architect Kaminsky. </p><p>  At the moment, the owner of the building, which was thoroughly renovated in 2011, is Bank of Moscow. </p><h2>  Passage of Popov </h2><p>  This is one of the most remarkable buildings on the Kuznetsk bridge.  Initially, in its place was the mansion of Count Vederevsky.  The building repeatedly passed from hand to hand and survived several fires.  At the end of the XIX century, the house was bought by the merchant Popov, who demolished it to the base and built a passage where numerous shops were located. </p><p>  After the revolution, the building was confiscated, and it housed various government agencies, and later - the scientific and technical library.  At the moment, the building is being reconstructed, and it is supposed to open a large department store in it. </p>

    <h2>  Apartment building "Falcon" </h2><p>  Another attraction that you can see when you go to Kuznetsk bridge (the metro is within walking distance) is famous for its mosaic facade.

Above are only three well-known buildings, of several dozen architectural monuments that can be seen there.  So, all this is worth seeing with your own eyes! </p>
