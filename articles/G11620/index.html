    <h2>  Local Entrepreneur and Zadonsky Disneyland </h2><p>  The history of this safari park is unique.  A few years ago, it was founded at the expense of a local businessman Sergei Uvarkin.  Nobody can still understand why a person who knows how to count every penny created a project without relying on income from it.  Sergei himself explained this by the fact that he likes to see smiles, that they cost more than money.  Few people took this explanation seriously.  But the fact remains.  Even today, after the tragic death of the founder of the park, admission to it remains free. </p><p>  The park today is being watched by the son of Sergei Uvarkin.  Initially, this place of rest had no name.  However, people who loved the local Disneyland quickly gave it a name: safari park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safari park zadonsk working hours" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Zadonsk today can be proud of: only here people have a unique opportunity to visit on their own ... Kudykin Hill.  This is the official name of this recreation park, loved not only by local residents, but also by tourists specially coming here.  A unique opportunity to visit Kudykina Hill does not cost anything: you can walk here for free. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúCome both old and young‚Äù </h2><p>  An excursion to this park is like a journey in a time machine. </p><p>  One of the attractions of the park is the Scythian fortress.  It is located on a hill, so it can be seen from afar.  And from the hill the whole safari park, Zadonsk and its environs are perfectly visible.  Old-style buildings attract everyone.  Still: it‚Äôs easy to imagine here a real Scythian.  Excursions in the fortress have not yet begun; restoration is still underway.  But very soon, guests will be able to see firsthand the life of the ancient people. </p><p>  Younger children most like a green meadow with animals walking on it.  Here, cows are adjacent to kangaroos, yaks roam side by side with llamas, horses with camels, and <span>domestic geese</span> are not inferior in beauty to peacocks.  Tame animals all day are in a huge aviary with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã70 hectares, and at night they are placed in separate cages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Safari Park Zadonsk Directions" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744146.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only male ostriches are kept separately.  Severe and aggressive males with no one even want to temporarily territory, strive to pinch visitors.  But peaceful females walk quietly: their tourists are interested only as a source of goodies. </p><h2>  Children walk, parents relax </h2><p>  Especially for active kids, a modern children's town is built on the territory.  While the children have fun and compete in dexterity, parents can relax on the benches.  There are many of them. </p><p>  What else attracts a safari park (Zadonsk)?  Residents of this city tend to sit on the banks of the park pond.  Until recently, it was possible not only to relax here, but also to swim.  However, Rospotrebnadzor banned bathing for the time being.  But no one is forbidden to plunge into the font of the Holy Spring.  Located in the southern part of the park, it attracts children and adults with clear ice water.  If someone does not have the courage to swim in the snow-cold water, he can just pick it up for a drink.  They say that <span>holy water</span> from this source frees from sins and brings happiness. </p><p>  And in the park there are three heroes.  Considering them, two conclusions can be drawn. </p><ol><li>  Modern men are minced compared to them. </li><li>  The heroes look small against the background of a forgotten helmet, which probably belonged to an even more ancient hero. </li></ol><p>  Finish a tour of the park by visiting a huge, but completely real jug.  It lies not far from the ravine and is very popular not only for children. </p><h2>  Animators will help you </h2><p>  Of course, not all parents have such a supply of strength and energy as children.  That is why animators work in the park. </p><p>  Immediately upon entry, a "real" pirate ship meets guests.  When children run, climb, jump and make their way over it, the children get bored, the animators suggest that they find a treasure that was buried somewhere in the park by pirates.  Well, which of the children will refuse such an adventure?  It should be noted that animators carefully monitor the safety of treasure hunters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safari park zadonsk how to get there" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744043.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <p>  You can ride around the park in a cart drawn by unusually beautiful horses. </p><p>  Fans of selfies and family photos are waiting for Bagheera, Cheburashka, a huge horse, Matroskin and many heroes of other cartoons.  And if you are not interested in taking pictures with cartoon characters, you can wait a moment and arrange a photo shoot with any animal from the mini-zoo. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the animators in the park work for free, and the cost of riding animals, attending a performance at the Theater of Miracles and other entertainment does not exceed 150 rubles. </p><h2>  The road to Kudykina Gora </h2><p>  So, you still decided to visit the safari park (Zadonsk).  The location map demonstrates how you can get here. </p><p>  There are two ways to get to Kudykina Gora from Voronezh. </p><ol><li>  From Voronezh, take the M-4 by taxi or your own car to Moscow.  You can reduce the travel time by driving part of the journey on a toll road.  You need to go to the sign for the village of Kamenka. </li><li>  If you don‚Äôt want to spend 55 rubles on a toll road, then you will have to turn to Zadonsk before the bridge, then follow the Aurora sign to the left and along the landmarks get to the same village of Kamenka. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zadonsk safari park photo" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/744027.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ol><p>  In Kamenka you need to cross the bridge.  From this moment it is impossible to get lost: the giant figures of animals: a horse and a bull will serve as a guide.  They will show the way to the safari park (Zadonsk). </p><p>  How to get there if there is no car, no desire to take a taxi?  In Voronezh, you can catch a bus going to Zadonsk, and there you can already catch a flight to Kamenka. </p><h2>  A few warnings and recommendations </h2><p>  What you need to take with you, going on an excursion and leaving Voronezh or Zadonsk?  Safari Park (photo) occupies a vast territory.  It is worth thinking about comfortable shoes and clothes.  It does not interfere with taking water and hats.  You cannot bring animals with you.  Everything else will provide tourists with a safari park (Zadonsk).  The park is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. </p>
