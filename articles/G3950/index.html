  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Voronezh-Rostov - how to get there and what to visit?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The route from Voronezh to Rostov is quite interesting, it can be traveled both by regular transport, for example, by night train, or by private car to visit various attractions along the way. </p><h2>  Travel by road </h2><p>  Buses run from Voronezh to Rostov, they often represent transit flights from more northern cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg and others) that go to Adler, Krasnodar or immediately to Yerevan.  That is why the place of departure of the bus can be different, for example, passing buses pick up passengers on the highway near the city by agreement with the carrier.  In addition, the bus can depart from the railway station, from the bus station and from Moscow Avenue.  The trip will take from 7 to 10 hours.  The main and suburban bus stations, as well as the platform at the Mega shopping center or Aksaysky Prospekt, serve as the arrival point in Rostov-on-Don. </p><p>  The ticket price for different carriers differs from 950 to 1,500 rubles.  The most convenient flights depart between 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. </p><p>  There are no electric trains between Voronezh and Rostov, but there are enough long-distance trains.  They are often passing (from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Arkhangelsk), and depart both from the main station of Voronezh and from the Prydacha station. </p><p>  The fastest trains are branded trains departing at 01:55 and 15:18 - 8.5 hours, the rest are on the way from 10 to 15 hours.  The slowest are seasonal passenger trains.  It is difficult to say exactly how many trains will follow from Voronezh to Rostov on the day of departure, since there are more of them during the holiday season, and in February, for example, fewer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cost of a ticket to a reserved seat car is from 1200 rubles, in a compartment - from 1800, and the most expensive cars are sleeping, from 4500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panorama of Voronezh" class="if uuid-3119190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3119190.jpg"></div><h2>  Drive your car </h2><p>  It‚Äôs also a convenient option, because the cities are connected by a quite tolerable M-4 highway, the distance from Voronezh to Rostov is about 570 kilometers.  You need to go along the highway through the cities of Pavlovsk, Millerovo and Aksai.  The latter is just on the Don, and near it one of the options for turning to Rostov. </p><p>  If there is enough time, then during the trip it is worth dropping into the pretty city of Liski on the Don.  Near it is Divnogorye - a picturesque place with chalk pillars, a nature reserve and a monastery.  In the city of Liski, museums and parks deserve attention. </p><p>  Further south on the same highway is the city of Pavlovsk, where there is a museum, a large granite quarry and about 40 architectural monuments. </p><p>  Already near Rostov-on-Don, you can turn into the city of Mines to see its monuments, parks and examples of local architecture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscapes of the Voronezh region" class="if uuid-3119170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3119170.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Voronezh </h2><p>  An interesting city with a variety of attractions.  For example, a monument to the heroes of the funny cartoon "Kitten from Lizyukova Street" was erected in it.  The character sits on a tree next to a crow on the same street. </p><p>  Of the literary heroes in Voronezh, you can see a monument to the White Beam near the puppet theater.  At the end of the XVII century, the city was associated with one of the first shipyards in the history of Russia, which is why the monuments to Peter I and the famous ship "Goto-Predestination" were installed. </p><p>  The architecture is beautiful, it is worth visiting the Akatov Monastery, paying attention to the Opera and Ballet Theater and the Annunciation Cathedral. </p><p>  As in any major city, there is a zoo, local history and art museums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embankment of Rostov-on-Don" class="if uuid-3119180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3119180.jpg"></div><h2>  What to visit in Rostov and its environs? </h2><p>  Rostov differs from Voronezh by its location near the sea, there are so many interesting places in and around the city that it takes a week to fully get acquainted with the lower Don. </p><p>  Rostov has a beautiful embankment, and in the historical center there are many buildings of pre-revolutionary construction, for example, the Chernova mansion. </p><p>  Museums with a variety of subjects are interesting - from local history to rail transport and astronautics. </p><p>  From Rostov it is worth going to Taganrog, Azov, Aksay, Novocherkassk, Starocherkassk and to the village of Nedvigovka to the ruins of ancient Tanais. </p>
