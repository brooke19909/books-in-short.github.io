    <h2>  Controversial issues </h2><p>  Often there are misunderstandings between amateurs who are used to fishing with a motor boat and those who like to engage in fishing in the usual way.  Excessive noise scares away the fish and reduces the likelihood of a large catch.  Especially sensitively captures the noise vibrations of bream.  You can sail, but in no case use internal combustion engines.  They are banned, and rarely anyone knows about it.  However, disputes about this do not subside, everyone has different opinions.

Environmental raids are regularly conducted to prevent emergencies. </p><h2>  Vileika reservoir: rest </h2><p>  In addition to fishing, hunting, <span>water skiing</span> and <span>sailing</span> are especially popular <span>.</span>  In June, the <span>water surface is</span> covered with blue-green algae, covering the surface.
