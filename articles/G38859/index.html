  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of bourgeois revolutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The bourgeois revolution is a social phenomenon whose goal is the forcible removal of the feudal class from power, the transition to the capitalist system.  Once it was an advanced, significant event.  Having taken place in England, the Netherlands and France in the 17-18 centuries, the bourgeois revolution changed the course of world history. </p><p>  The revolution may also retain the remnants of the feudal regime.  In this case, it is called bourgeois-democratic.  It is to this type that the events that occurred in Germany in 1918-1919 belong.  The name "bourgeois" revolution owes to the Marxists.  But this term is not recognized by all researchers.  So, from the concept of "The Great French Bourgeois Revolution" the word "bourgeois" is usually excluded.  However, the meaning of this does not change.  What are its reasons?  What are the premises of the bourgeois revolution?  About it further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="platypus1917.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the bourgeois revolution" class="if uuid-2390649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390649.jpg"></div><h2>  The reasons for the bourgeois revolution </h2><p>  Conflict between certain forces is a prerequisite for any political upheaval.  The cause of the bourgeois revolution is also a contradiction.  This is a conflict between the productive forces, which are gaining momentum, and feudal foundations that impede the development of industry.  An important factor in its origin is the clash of the national economy and the dominance of foreign capital.  This can also be called the prerequisites of the bourgeois revolution. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Targets and goals </h2><p>  What determines the historical role of the bourgeois revolution?  The tasks that she solved.  The elimination of the barriers to the development of capitalism is the main goal of the bourgeois revolutions in Europe.  Private ownership of the means of production is the foundation of a new society.  In different countries, the causes of this phenomenon are different.  More details about the bourgeois revolution in France, England and the Netherlands are described below. </p><p>  In some countries, an urgent solution to the agrarian question was required.  In others, the problem of national independence, liberation from oppressed oppression, has become acute.  The ultimate goals: </p><ul><li>  the elimination of feudalism; </li><li>  creating an enabling environment for the prosperity of bourgeois property, the development of capitalism; </li><li>  the establishment of a bourgeois state; </li><li>  democratization of the social system. </li></ul><p>  This is the main feature of bourgeois revolutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecharnelhouse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Civil War" class="if uuid-2390654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390654.jpg"></div><h2>  driving forces </h2><p>  The main driving force, as you might guess from a historical term, was the bourgeoisie.  Artisans, peasants, workers, representatives of the nascent social stratum immediately joined her. </p><p>  The bourgeoisie, who led the struggle against the feudal lords, could not in any way abolish private land ownership.  The bourgeois themselves owned land plots.  The most rebellious and active force, of course, was the workers, moreover, from the lower strata of society.  As you know, the most violent revolutionaries are oppressed and rejected. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the era of imperialism in the developed <span>capitalist countries, the</span> bourgeoisie turned into a counter-revolutionary force.  She was afraid of the proletariat, threatening her domination.  Having ceased to be a leading force, she tried to turn the revolution on the path of change.  She was hindered by the working class, which had grown ideologically and organized into a political party.  Now he claims to be the hegemon of the revolution. </p><p>  In the colonial countries where the national struggle is unfolding, the bourgeoisie is still able to play the role of the vanguard in protecting national interests from foreign capital.  But the workers and peasants remain the most significant force.  The scale of its development depends on the participation of the broad masses in the revolution.  If the bourgeoisie succeeds in preventing the workers and peasants from resolving political issues and removing them from the struggle for their demands, then the revolution does not achieve its goals and does not solve the tasks it has set.  Examples of such revolutions: Turkey (1908), Portugal (1910). </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecharnelhouse.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prerequisites of the revolution" class="if uuid-2390662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390662.jpg"></div><h2>  Forms and Methods </h2><p>  The methods of warfare are diverse.  The liberal bourgeoisie chose the tactics of ideological and parliamentary confrontation, the military - conspiracies (recall the uprising of the Decembrists in 1825).  The peasants preferred uprisings against the feudal lords, the seizure of the lands of the nobles and their division.  The proletariat was most pleased with strikes, violent demonstrations, and, of course, armed uprisings.  The forms and methods of struggle depend not only on the leading role in the revolution, but also on the behavior of the ruling authorities, who respond with violence, unleashing a civil war. </p><h2>  Historical meaning </h2><p>  The main result of the bourgeois revolution is the transfer of power from the hands of the nobility to the bourgeoisie.  But this does not always happen.  The bourgeois-democratic revolution is carried out under the rule of the proletariat.  Its result is the dictatorship of the peasants and proletarians.  Often, after the bourgeois revolution, a series of reactions ensued, the reconstruction of the overthrown power.  However, the capitalist system, established during the political upheaval, continued to exist.  The social and economic gains of the bourgeois revolution were viable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brabant revolution" class="if uuid-2390681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390681.jpg"></div><h2>  Theory of Permanent Revolution </h2><p>  The theorists of Marxism, analyzing the development of bourgeois revolutions in Europe, put forward the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ongoing (permanent) revolution, which represented a consistent movement from the struggle against feudalism to anti-capitalist confrontation.  This idea was developed into the theory of Lenin, who explained under what conditions a bourgeois revolution would develop into an anti-capitalist one.  The main factor of the transition is the hegemony of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution.  This conclusion was confirmed by the outgrowth of the February Revolution in 1917 in Russia. </p><p>  The main bourgeois revolutions in Europe took place in the Netherlands, England, France, and Holland. </p><p>  The Netherlands is the first country in Western Europe to demonstrate that the capitalist system cannot exist along with the obsolete orders of feudalism.  The Spanish Inquisition also oppressed the country politically and hindered the development of the economy.  Economic and social problems led to mass discontent, which grew into a national liberation revolution in 1581. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="revolution in the netherlands" class="if uuid-2390674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390674.jpg"></div><h2>  England </h2><p>  In the XVII century, all trade routes crossed in England, which could not but affect its economic development.  Capitalism has gained a strong position in agriculture, industry, and trade.  Feudal relations hindered the development of these industries.  In addition, all the land belonged to the king. </p><p>  In the 17th century, two revolutions took place in England.  The first was called the Great Rebellion.  The second is the Glorious Revolution.  What are their features?  First of all, it is worth mentioning the characteristic feature of all bourgeois revolutions, namely, the opposition to the feudal monarchy and nobility.  The rebellious mood was fueled by dissatisfaction with the union of the Anglican Church and the new nobility.  But the main feature of the revolution is incompleteness.  Large landowners retained their inheritance.  The agrarian question was resolved without giving the peasants land, which can be called the main indicator of the incompleteness of the bourgeois revolution in the economy. </p><p>  In anticipation of the events, two political camps formed.  They represented different religious concepts and social interests.  Some advocated the old feudal nobility.  Others favor the ‚Äúpurification‚Äù of the Anglican Church and the creation of a new, independent of royal authority. </p><p>  Capitalism in England has become an active fighter against absolute royal power.  The revolution (1640) destroyed feudal ownership of land, new political forces gained access to power.  She cleared the way for the development of a new mode of production and production relations.  The economic recovery of England began, its power was strengthened on the seas and in the colonies. </p><h2>  France </h2><p>  The beginning of the bourgeois revolution in France was laid by the conflict between the feudal-absolutist form of government and capitalist production relations growing in the depths of feudalism.  The events of 1789-1799 radically changed the country.  And the whole world.  About the French revolution is worth telling more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="consequences of revolution" class="if uuid-2390688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390688.jpg"></div><h2>  Versailles </h2><p>  <span>Louis XVI</span> was too soft a monarch, perhaps this is one of the reasons for the revolution that took place at the end of the XVIII century.  The king did not accept the decree.  The situation in the French capital every day became more and more tense.  1789 was a fruitful year.  However, almost no bread was delivered to Paris.  Crowds of people gathered at the bakeries every day. </p><p>  Meanwhile, nobles, officers, and gentlemen of the Order of St. Louis flocked to Versailles.  They had a feast in honor of the Flanders regiment.  Some officers, intoxicated by wine and general merriment, tore off the three-colored cockades and tore them apart.  And in Paris, meanwhile, new unrest arose, caused by fear of another aristocratic conspiracy. </p><p>  But patience is not unlimited.  Once, crowds of people who stood in vain in line at the bakery rushed to <span>Grevskaya Square.</span>  For some reason, the people believed that if the king was in Paris, then food problems would be solved.  Shouts of ‚ÄúBread!  To Versailles! ‚Äù  handed out louder.  A few hours later, a raging crowd, consisting mainly of women, headed towards the palace in which the king was located. </p><p>  By evening, the king announced his agreement to approve the declaration.  Nevertheless, the rebels broke into the palace and killed several guards.  When Louis XVI, together with his wife and Dauphin, went out onto the balcony, there was a popular cry of "King to Paris!" </p><h2>  Reconstruction of the country </h2><p>  The revolution in France was the brightest event in Europe at the turn of the 17-18 centuries.  But its causes are not only in the conflict between the feudal lords and the bourgeoisie.  Louis XVI became the last representative of the so-called old order.  Before his overthrow, the country underwent reconstruction.  From now on, the king could rule the country only on the basis of the law.  The power now belonged to the National Assembly. </p><p>  The king had the right to appoint ministers; he could no longer use the state treasury as before.  The institute of hereditary nobility and all titles associated with it were canceled.  From now on, calling yourself a count or a marquise was forbidden.  All these changes have long been awaited by a people whose situation has become increasingly difficult every year.  The king, however, allowed his wife to use the treasury indefinitely the day before, did not limit her in anything, and at the same time he was little engaged in state affairs.  These are the premises of the bourgeois revolution that took place in France. </p><p>  From now on, there were no royal councils or staff of secretaries.  The administrative division system has also changed.  France was divided into 83 departments.  The old judicial institutions were also abolished.  In other words, France was gradually turning into another country.  Revolutionary events unfolded, as you know, for ten years. </p><p>  One of the most important events of the revolutionary years was the unsuccessful escape of the king.  On June 20, 1791, Louis, dressed in the clothes of a servant, tried to leave France.  However, he was detained at the border.  The king and his family were returned to the capital.  The people met him in silent silence.  Parisians took his escape as a declaration of war.  Moreover, the king in this war was on the other side of the barricades.  From this day began the radicalization of the revolution.  Its organizers no longer believed anyone, especially a king who turned out to be a traitor.  True, constitutional deputies took Louis under protection and stated that he allegedly did not run of his own free will, but was kidnapped.  This did not correct the situation. </p><p>  An emotional reaction was triggered by the escape of the French king in Europe.  The heads of other states feared that revolutionary sentiments could penetrate their lands.  In July 1789, the emigration of nobles began.  By the way, any revolutionary events always entail migration. </p><h2>  The fall of the monarchy </h2><p>  This event occurred seven years before the end of the revolution.  In June 1892, a wave of demonstrations swept across the country.  It was organized with the aim of putting pressure on Louis.  The king behaved rather strangely.  He did not adhere to any specific position, often changed points of view.  And this was his main mistake.  In the courtyard, which was filled with demonstrators, Louis drank to the health of the nation.  However, he immediately refused to approve decrees. </p><p>  After the uprising on August 10, the king was deposed and imprisoned.  Marie Antoinette, Dauphin and other royal children were arrested.  Louis was accused of double play and treason.  The trial of the king lasted three months.  He was declared guilty, called "a usurper alien to the body of the nation."  Louis was executed at the end of January.  A few months later, Maria Antoinette was on the block.  Paris events for a long time excited the minds of European revolutionaries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.historyhit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="execution of louis 16" class="if uuid-2390695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2390695.jpg"></div><p>  At the last stage of the bourgeois revolution in France, the archaic feudal survivals were eliminated, namely the privileges of the feudal lords and peasant duties.  And most importantly, freedom of trade was finally proclaimed. </p><p>  The revolution ensured the victory of capitalism over absolutism.  In a number of countries, feudal vestiges of the past have survived to this day.  This paves the way for the emergence of new democratic movements and revolutions. </p>
