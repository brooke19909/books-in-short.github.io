    <p>  Unfortunately, in its original form the church has not been preserved to this day.  In 1812, it was destroyed by French troops, and the monastery was looted.  The new building was erected in the 19th century.  During the design of the new church fragments of fresco paintings of the old building were used, which miraculously survived.  The main painting of the church was performed by the famous Greek icon painter Nicola Aspioti. </p><p>  Praskvitsa monastery was once assisted by Russian sovereigns.  Documents from the Russian Imperial Court are still preserved in the vaults. </p><p>  The monastery complex has one small temple - the church of the Holy Trinity.  Its creation dates back to the 17th century.  In addition, the monastery‚Äôs parish includes churches that are located outside the monastery walls - the church of St. Stephen, the church of St. Alexander Nevsky and the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Lord. </p><p>  In 1979, during the earthquake, the monastery complex was seriously damaged.  Some buildings were restored, others are being reconstructed today.  Construction work does not prevent Praskvitsa from remaining a working monastery. </p><h2>  Toplitz Palace </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the magnificent residence of Peter Karageorgievich, the son-in-law of the Montenegrin Tsar Nikola I, appeared in the New Bar. The magnificent palace complex was later named Toplitsa.  It includes the Big and Small palaces, two gardens - a winter and a botanical.  Around the palace is a park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Budva Riviera" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/979482.jpg" width="600"></div>

They sufficiently familiarize visitors with the <span>history of Montenegro.</span> </p><h2>  Castio Fortress </h2><p>  The Budva Riviera has very ancient historical monuments on its territory.  To see one of them, you need to go to the small town of Petrovac.  In its architecture, it resembles an amphitheater, since numerous villas, mini-hotels and cottages are built from the very top of the slope to the sea. </p><p>  Castio Fortress is located on the city beach, in its northern part.  At the top of the building today is a memorial.  In it you can see a commemorative plaque dedicated to the fallen soldiers of Montenegro and Petrovar during the Second World War. </p><h2>  St. Nicholas Island </h2><p>  The island received its name in honor of the small medieval church located here.  It was built in the 16th century.  Apart from this church and the ancient graves surrounding it, there is nothing on the island.  It is completely uninhabited.  Local researchers believe that in these graves rest the participants of the crusades, who died during the terrible plague epidemic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="budva riviera montenegro reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/978553.jpg" width="600"></div>
