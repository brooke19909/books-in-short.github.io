To look completely up to the mark, you also need to adequately receive the participants and guests of the song competition next year.  These are the rules of Eurovision.  The state, whose representative won first place this year, should become the host for the competition next year.  And when the duet Nigar Jamal and Eldar Gasimova won in Germany in 2011, Azerbaijan was supposed to host Eurovision 2012.  Well, let's say right away: the country did not hit in the mud in front of distinguished guests.  And Baku has got another attraction.  Tours come to take a look at it, as well as at the second highest flagpole with the state flag (162 meters) in the world.  But the Baku Crystal Hall, the photo of which is now decorated with all the guides in Azerbaijan, is much more amazing.  Well, let's get to know more closely this landmark of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku Crystal Hall" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2162021.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the Baku Crystal Hall </h2><p>  Baku acquired the State Flag Square relatively recently.  In 2007, a construction project was approved in the coastal Bailovo microdistrict, and on September 1, 2010, the banner of Azerbaijan was solemnly raised to 162-meter height.  At that time it was the highest flagpole in the world.  The laurels of the championship did not give rest to the <span>President of Turkmenistan</span> Gurbanguly <span>Berdimuhamedov</span> , who ordered the country‚Äôs flag to be hoisted three meters higher, for which he received a certificate from the Guinness Book of Records.  But here we are not talking about flagpoles.  Baku Crystal Hall stands on the famous square.  Therefore, the attraction has a landmark visible from all corners of the city - the National Flag flying high in the sky.  The crystal hall in Baku looks beautiful both day and evening.  It is located near the city promenade.  You can get to the sights by buses of routes No. 6, 5, 88, 53, 120 and 124. You should leave at the stop ‚ÄúMuseum of Stone Annals‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku Crystal Hall of Baku" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2162019.jpg"></div>

The design of the building was developed by the Swiss company Nussley International.  And the construction was carried out by the German company Alpin BAU Deutschland.  130 million euros were allocated from the state budget of Azerbaijan for the construction of the concert complex.  In January 2012, Germany solemnly handed over the key (Eurovision symbol) to the new host country.  Then it was officially announced that the next competition will be held in the building under construction.  Recent finishing work was completed in early April.  The official opening of the complex took place on May 7, 2012. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku Crystal Hall Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2162017.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Baku Crystal Hall: description </h2><p>  The German company Alpine paid attention not only to the functionality of the concert complex and its stunning beauty, but also to the safety of visitors.  Builders say that in the event of an emergency, all spectators can be evacuated within ten minutes.  But the Crystal Hall can accommodate 23 thousand people.  The Swiss company made sure that those who did not get inside could watch the participants ‚Äôperformances in real time.  Outside the building is equipped with giant monitor screens.  The builders also made sure that there was room for reporters and film crews covering events.  Near the complex was erected a media center with a capacity of 1,500 people.  The exterior facade of the Crystal Hall is equipped with thousands of LED panels, capable of giving 45 thousand shades of colors.  The new attraction of Baku also looks impressive during the day.  And in the evening, a color show of illumination makes the building simply magical. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Eurovision 2012 </h2><p>  Of course, the first event held in the Baku Crystal Hall was the popular song contest.  Due to the fact that the interior of the dome is equipped with many LED panels, it has become possible to demonstrate videos about the nature, cities, traditions and culture of Azerbaijan.  Before each participant speaks, the flag of the country he or she represents appears on the screens.  In general, the performances were held in the Crystal Hall for three days: May 22, 24 (semi-final) and May 26 (final final).  Representatives of 42 countries took part in Eurovision 2012. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku Crystal Hall photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2162023.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Concert and sports complex today </h2><p>  Of course, the Baku Crystal Hall was not built for the sake of an international music competition.  Eurovision-12 had barely died out, as the complex became a stage for Jennifer Lopez.  The singer arrived in Baku as part of her international tour in September 2012.  Next on the stage of the Crystal Hall were other celebrities - Shakira, Rihanna, Azerbaijani music groups.  The first sports competition held within the complex was the Red Bull King of the Rock basketball tournament, held on June 29, 2013.  Later, fencing, volleyball, boxing, karate and taekwondo competitions at the First European Games were organized in the Crystal Hall in Baku.  In 2016, the chess olympiad was held here. </p>
