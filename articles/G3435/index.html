Description and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will visit such a wonderful city as Novorossiysk.  The sights and entertainments of it are very diverse, despite the fact that they are not very famous.  Well, what do we know about this city?  Once upon a time it was promoted because of the book of the Secretary General of the Communist Party of the USSR Brezhnev's "Small Earth", and then as if sunk into oblivion.  But is this fair?  Of course not. </p><p>  <span>Novorossiysk, the sights</span> and entertainments of which we describe here, is not just an important seaport or a hero city.  They come here, of course, not for the sake of beaches or relaxation at sea.  Although the coast here is clean, comfortable and equipped, it is no worse than the neighboring villages that are experiencing the invasion of holidaymakers.  There is a decent infrastructure, as in any metropolis.  So, let's begin our journey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk attractions and entertainment" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How can I come here </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the city of Novorossiysk, the sights and entertainment of which we highly recommend you, does not have its own airport.  Closest to it is the hub of the resort city of Anapa.  But in the summer it’s difficult to get tickets there, and it’s also difficult to get to Novorossiysk.  You will either have to take a taxi, or go to the center of Anapa, and from there also transfer to a special bus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The easiest way to come here is by train.  The railway connection in this city is well established not only with Moscow, but with many cities and regions of Russia: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vladikavkaz, Vorkuta and so on. </p><p>  It’s even more interesting to get here by water.  Indeed, being one of the largest seaports in the country, Novorossiysk, the sights and entertainments of which will open to you upon arrival, receives cargo ships and luxury liners all year round.  For example, regular hydrofoil missile flights leave here from Sochi.  From there you can get in just three and a half hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk attractions and entertainment photo" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Novorossiysk: attractions and entertainment.  Description of the administrative division </h2><p>  To begin with, this city is very strange divided into districts.  Like Sochi, it represents the center and neighboring villages that have become part of its features.  By the way, one of them is the famous all over Russia Abrau-Durso with a winery.  There are five such areas.  Two of them lie to the west of the huge Tsemess Bay, and two to the east.  Abrau-Durso - the fifth district - as if kept aloof.  The bay itself is a mysterious, almost mystical place.  After all, it is there that the remains of the magnificent ship of Soviet times - “Admiral Nakhimov” rest.  No wonder when they ask the locals the question “What is your Novorossiysk?  Sightseeing and entertainment - what to see? ”, They answer that it is first of all worth visiting the <span>Tsemess bay.</span>  Divers will be rewarded in full.  Despite the dangers, they long for her to explore. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Eastern and Central areas </h2><p>  There are places in the city completely not for tourists.  If you really want to know what sights there are in Novorossiysk, and entertainment also attracts you, do not think to visit the Eastern region.  This is an industrial zone with cement plants and other noisy and smoky enterprises.  What is good for the economy is not always beneficial for the environment, and even less so for inspection.  But the Central District is a completely different matter.  It is worth wandering around to just admire the beautiful and clean streets, the sea station, and even visit the main city beach with the promising name "Neptune".  There is also a central market.  But if you want to keep in mind Novorossiysk sights and entertainment, photos of which can be shown to friends and relatives, be sure to walk along the promenade named after Admiral Serebryakov.  You'll like it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What sights are there in Novorossiysk and entertainment" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Novorossiysk attractions </h2><p>  From the breathtaking panorama of the sea to the modern water park - everything here attracts real travelers.  The embankment stretches along the coast for two whole kilometers, and it was named after the first governor of these places.  Almost all types of public transport stop here: buses, minibuses, trolleybuses ... A pedestrian zone has been created on the promenade, so you will not be bothered by the sound of cars.  When you walk along it, do not forget to inspect the monuments to the founding fathers of the city.  This is a memorial.  Indeed, thanks to these people, the former Turkish fortress Sujuk-Kale became a city named Novorossiysk.  Attractions and entertainment, reviews of which are of the highest rating, are located on this promenade.  There is a rather sad place called “Cape of Love”, where, as legend has it, several unhappy couples committed suicide.  And if you want to visit the historical museum, then it is located in a very interesting place - right on the cruiser Mikhail Kutuzov.  Next to him are several popular sculptures in the city: “The Fisherwoman Waiting for Her Husband”, “Giving Water” and “Dolphin and the Mermaid”.  There are many restaurants and cafes overlooking the sea on the promenade, beautiful fountains beat, in the summer you can visit the water park, and in the evening everything is lit up with lights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk the best attractions and entertainment" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Museums </h2><p>  The most famous monument of the city’s history is the cruiser “Kutuzov” already mentioned by us.  At one time, he was considered one of the ten best warships in the world, and now stands on a joke and entertains tourists.  Bristling with artillery pieces, this cruiser still makes a menacing impression; it has become a symbol of the Black Sea Fleet.  In Novorossiysk there is also a unique place that you will not find in the whole globe - this is the Museum of Cement.  Since Nikolai Ostrovsky, the author of the famous novel about how steel was tempered, lived and even married in this city, you can visit his apartment.  She also became a museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk attractions and entertainment reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  In addition to the sculptures on the waterfront, the city has many other statues.  Most of them are dedicated to the sea or in any way connected with it.  For example, a monument to the Unknown Sailor.  Attracts tourists and the stele of Marine Glory.  But one of the most popular memorials is the Exodus sculpture group dedicated to the evacuation of the White Army from Soviet Russia.  Her aesthetics are borrowed from the famous film “Two Comrades Served”.  But not only the memory of this tragic page in Russian history is interesting for Novorossiysk. </p><p>  Sights and entertainments, reviews of tourists about which are most often found, include a unique monument to Brezhnev.  Perhaps, such a monument is nowhere to be found.  This is not surprising, because it was the “dear Leonid Ilyich” who immortalized the city and made it popular by describing the events of the Second World War that took place here. </p><h2>  Memorial "Small Earth" </h2><p>  Although this monument was built during the Brezhnev era, it has nothing to do with stagnant times.  After all, it was created in order to talk about one of the heroic military operations of the Great Patriotic War.  "Small Earth" is the first thing that comes to mind for those who were born in the USSR when they hear the question "What are the sights in Novorossiysk?"  And entertainment in this city also exists, but first you should pay tribute to history.  First of all, the Malaya Zemlya memorial is a monument to the paratroopers who landed on this patch of land in February 1943 and heroically held it.  Inside the sculptural group itself is a very interesting interactive museum.  And at the top of the monument, where you can climb the stairs, there is a capsule with the names of those who died liberating the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk sights and entertainment reviews of tourists" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396996.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  What did they come up with for children </h2><p>  If you travel with a child, we assure you that he will like Novorossiysk.  Sights and entertainment, reviews of tourists about which tell about children's vacations, this is, first of all, the museum on the cruiser "Kutuzov".  One of the most attractive places popular with kids is also the city planetarium, where you can not only learn more about the starry sky with the help of a guide, but also thanks to a special “fly into space” simulator.  Do not forget about the water park on the waterfront!  In summer, the children here are simply happy.  And this “pleasure package” will be completed by a boat trip on the Tsemess Bay. </p><h2>  Where to swim </h2><p>  Local residents, as well as tourists, all will not decide where exactly in Novorossiysk it is better to spend time in the summer: in the South or Primorsky district.  The first one boasts such a landmark as the Sujuk Spit.  This is one of the TOP places for youth recreation.  Its length is about eight hundred meters.  The beach is located in the lagoon between the two "branches" of the spit.  Therefore, it is always warmer here than in other places in the city.  There is always clear water, clean, no waves.  The beach is equipped, there are sunshades, umbrellas, sunbeds.  Almost until the morning work cafes and restaurants, thundering discos. </p><p>  The Primorsky district of the city boasts two wonderful places for swimming, which are especially suitable for children, are Shirokaya Balka and Myskhako.  True, they are somewhat out of the way.  But since Novorossiysk is an industrial city, this is even for the best.  In Shirokoy Balka rooms for rent are available, there are hotels, pensions and motels, as well as restaurants, bars and nightclubs.  You can arrange a jeep safari, fly by parachute or even by helicopter.  Myskhako is a quieter area where you can enjoy nature and clean air on deserted beaches.  In addition, here is one of the best wineries in the country.  Its tasting room is especially popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novorossiysk sights and entertainment what to see" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1396984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Abrau-Durso </h2><p>  This is the most famous village that has turned into the area of ​​Novorossiysk.  It consists of two villages merged together.  Abrau, with its famous sparkling wine factory, is located in the mountains by the lake, and Durso - his resort "appendix" - is located by the sea.  Here lovers of wine tourism, as well as admirers of the “seal” holiday, strive here.  From the center of Novorossiysk you can get here by minibus or bus.  And you can relax here not only on the sea coast, but also on a freshwater estuary, which is very rare.  The bay of this area is good for diving.  And as a gift to relatives, you can bring good wine from Novorossiysk, to choose from Myskhako or from Abrau-Durso.  But on the advice of experienced tourists, take both.  Everywhere very decent, natural drinks. </p>
