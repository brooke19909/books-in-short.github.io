There are only three of them on our planet, and one of them is the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden Institute.  It is located in the Murmansk region, near the city of Apatity. </p><h2>  Foundation History </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="67.57589329999999" data-lng="33.41319969999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/0/1/3/6013.png"></div><p>  The initiator of the creation of such an unusual project was geobotanist Avrorin Nikolai Alexandrovich, who arrived in the Murmansk region for one summer, and stayed for a long 29 years. </p><p>  This happened back in 1931, and already in October, the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences approved the decision to create a unique Polar Alpine Botanical Garden Institute, without which no significant decision was made in the scientific world. </p><p>  The very first plant samples were issued by the Botanical Institute of the Academy of Sciences.  There were very few of them - only 26 species of shrubs and trees, a little more than fifty species of perennial grasses.  Yes, and they had to be planted on small cultivated areas of soil, with great difficulty conquered from the virgin forest-tundra. </p><p>  In those difficult years, only small plant nurseries were laid, scientists did not even dare to dream of any greenhouses and greenhouses. </p><p>  During the war, the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden Institute in Kirovsk continued its work, but it was aimed not at research, but at front-line needs.  It was here that innovative methods of processing berries without sugar were developed at that time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scientific challenges and achievements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="On the paths of the Polar Arctic Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2648727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2648727.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the territory of the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute has 1,670 hectares, most of which is a reserve, where the local flora and fauna are carefully preserved and research is being carried out.  On the remaining 80 hectares there is a park, nurseries for imported samples, greenhouses and office buildings. </p><p>  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork of the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute can be called the "relocation" of plants from different climatic zones and their adaptation to the conditions of polar latitudes.  Only here you can see tropical plants. </p><p>  Near the city of Apatity, the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute has another branch: the arboretum of northern and alpine species of vegetation.  Here, plants are placed on a geographical basis, depending on which region they were imported from. </p><p>  In the summer there is simply a huge number of flowers, it is impossible to believe that so many plants can grow in the north!  And in a huge greenhouse, which maintains a constant temperature of + 35 ¬∞ C, tropical greenery rages all year round.  The large palm tree is impressive, its huge leaves hanging down to the ground. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Blooming Cacti Beyond the Arctic Circle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ski.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tropical plants in the greenhouse" class="if uuid-2648734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2648734.jpg"></div><p>  Through the efforts of enthusiastic specialists of the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute of the Kola Science Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a huge collection of plants from the subtropics, tropics and even semi-desert flora has been collected here. </p><p>  A huge number of cactus species are grown here.  Some of them grow in pots, but most are planted directly in the ground.  Many specimens reach impressive size, and the aisles between landings are quite narrow. </p><p>  In spring and summer, when these prickly plants are covered with bright colors, the entire greenhouse is transformed.  Some specimens can also bloom in winter, then bright flowers seem artificially glued to the cactus stem, the difference is so great among them. </p><h2>  Walking along the ecological trail </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain river in the territory of the botanical garden" class="if uuid-2648779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2648779.jpg"></div><p>  You can familiarize yourself with the wonderful flora of the Arctic in the summer, when sightseeing tours of the ecological trail are held at the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden University. </p><p>  Thanks to the efforts of numerous employees of the botanical garden, more than 400 plant species feel great here.  On the alleys mixed trees and shrubs brought from central Russia and local tree species.  In the warm season there are a lot of flowering shrubs and perennial grasses.  It is impossible to believe that such a riot of colors, shapes and colors is not in the south, but beyond the Arctic Circle, where even in summer frost and snowfall are possible. </p><p>  A mountain river flows through the territory of the botanical garden; its banks are also densely covered with a green carpet.  If you can visit this unique place in the summer, you must definitely go on a tour of the ecological trail. </p><p>  It is even difficult to call it a guided tour; rather, it is a pleasant cognitive walk accompanied by an experienced employee.  Gradually rising higher along the path, you can see how vegetation changes depending on the altitude zones of the Khibiny mountains. </p><h2>  Tourists note </h2><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blooming flower beds in a botanical garden" class="if uuid-2648787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2648787.jpg"></div><p>  It is easy to get to the botanical garden, as there are regular buses from the city of Kirovsk towards PABSI, you will have to walk a little from the stop. </p><p>  The Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden Institute works daily, but it is advisable to book tours in advance.  The official website has contact numbers by which you can get advice on the time of the excursions. </p><p>  In winter, only a tropical greenhouse is available for inspection, the rest of the garden is covered with deep snowdrifts.  But the impressions of lush tropical vegetation among the snowdrifts and winter will remain for a long time! </p>
