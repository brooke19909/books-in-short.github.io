This can be a product from corrugated material, compressed paper, fabric, balloons.  We will also fantasize on this subject, teach you to cut according to the pattern and collect trees that can be placed in the middle of the room.  We also recommend how you can <span>decorate the walls</span> or game room at home or in kindergarten <span>with a</span> large tree. </p><p>  Children can decorate a large tree with leaves and flowers, plant them on twigs of birds and set birdhouses.  Let us show you how to arrange the <span>crown of a tree.</span>  There are still decorative patterns.  They can decorate the entrance or interior doors.  For such a do-it-yourself volumetric cardboard tree, you will need many additional elements. </p><h2>  Corrugated Sample </h2><p>  To create such a branchy tree, you will need a piece of corrugated cardboard, a simple pencil and large scissors or a sharp knife.  You need to divide the sheet into two equal parts.  On one side they draw a trunk, a wide stand from below and several branches.  On the contour all this is cut with scissors.  Then the cut out template should be attached to the second half and circled with a pencil.  The barrel and the stand must exactly match.  Branches may be different. </p>

    <p>  In order for the bulk tree made of <span>cardboard to</span> stand steadily <span>, with your own hands</span> you need to draw a line in the middle in one part.  On it the trunk is cut from top to center.  On the other side, on the contrary, along the drawn line, the section is made from the bottom to the center.  In order for the two parts to join together freely, the cut lines should be equal to the thickness of the cardboard, approximately 0.5 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It remains only to assemble the parts together, putting one part on top of the other.  From below, all supports should be at the same level so that the product stands firmly and does not stagger.  When the main part of the work is prepared, you can begin to decorate the branches.  The guys will do it. </p><h2>  Detailing </h2><p>  To decorate a volumetric tree from cardboard with your own hands, you need to cut a lot of leaves and stick them to the branches.  If the tree will be used in kindergarten or other institutions, and for different occasions, it is better if the decorative elements are removable.  Pay attention to the photo below.  All leaflets hang on threads, and the green lush crown is generally represented by satin wide ribbons that hang in turns from the ceiling tiles.  You can also string all the leaves on a long rope and hang them on branches like a garland. </p>

    <p>  Large items, such as a birdhouse or an owl sitting on a branch, can be attached to brackets or paper clips.  Then the elements are easy to remove and put in a box for the next holidays. </p><h2>  Christmas tree </h2><p>  For such a bulk wood made of cardboard with your own hands, the template that you see in the photo below is very simple to build.  The tree is made in the same way as the previous tree.  But the pattern shows the lines of the central sections to assemble the structure.  This is a general principle for making voluminous crafts.  Indeed, in this way you can make a whole forest of firs and deciduous trees, for example, for board games or for showing a puppet theater.  Children are very fond of such entertainment.  Small items can be made from thick cardboard.  Crohn can be represented in a simple circle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you made such a voluminous Christmas tree for the <span>New Year's holiday</span> decoration of a kindergarten group, then you need to glue it with green colored paper, each child can make a Christmas tree toy and hang it on a paper clip on branches.  This is a great replacement for shopping balls and a vibrant beauty.  Needles on the floor will be strewed, and children from childhood will learn to protect wildlife and not spoil the trees. </p><p>  To make the tree stand firmly on the surface of the floor, do not forget to add a stand from below in the template, expanding the trunk angle. </p><h2>  Decorative door </h2><p>  In the kindergarten or in an art studio where they are engaged in creativity with children, you can decorate the front door with such an interesting craft.  This is a voluminous flowering tree made of cardboard, on which bird nests are made of plastic or paper disposable plates.  This composition looks very interesting, but it is easy to make.  To make the tree stand out against the background of a white door, a blue background is first glued.  This is the sky.  Further, the trunk and branches are made of brown compressed paper.  The plates are cut in half, you can evenly, more beautiful with notches, as in the photo.  These are nests in which little chicks are waiting for their parents.  The picture is very symbolic for the premises of a kindergarten.  After all, there too, the kids are looking forward to their parents.  The chicks are made of plastic spoons painted black. </p>

    <p>  Eyes and beak can be made applique.  Children also make flowers with leaves and place them throughout the tree.  Grass is glued on the door below.  So that the lawn with flowers was also voluminous, the edges are cut and twisted a little with a pencil. </p><h2>  Twisted tree </h2><p>  Now, among hand-made masters, many are fond of quilling.  This is a curl of paper strips.  We also used this method to create such an unusual volumetric tree.  The master class of the craft is described below. </p><ol><li>  Compressed brown paper is sold in rolls.  It is long and suitable for making such an unusual barrel.  The roll needs to be unrolled and the paper curled in a roll in length.  Get a twisted "rope".  Several of these twisted parts are placed along the trunk line, expanding the part to the upper edge. </li><li>  From below, several layers of grass are glued.  This is a colored double-sided paper with a fringed edge. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn trees made of paper and cardboard" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2090908.jpg"></div></li><li>  Now the main work begins on the design of the crown.  It is performed in the quilling technique, only using wide thick paper.  The parts are not twisted tightly.  The edge is glued to the last turn.  Then, the end part of the roll is smeared with PVA glue and glued to the location in the picture with a light pressure of the palm on top. </li></ol><h2>  Balloons tree </h2><p>  Such a tree for jewelry, made of cardboard with your own hands, can be placed in the form of a picture on the wall.  First, they make a background and stick a simple, even tree trunk.  Below the tree grows grass.  It is cut into strips, decorating with large flowers.  The free space of the blue sky can be filled with flying birds or butterflies. </p>

    <p>  The volume of the tree itself is added by a crown made of balls of different colors.  If it is an autumn tree made of paper and cardboard, then a small amount of yellow or orange is added to the green balls. </p><h2>  Tree of twigs </h2><p>  You can decorate the room with a symbolic image of a tree made of branches attached to the wall.  They can be laid out with a ladder in increasing order, similar to a Christmas tree, or it can be done differently by making the shape of a deciduous tree.  The buttons cut onto the colored paper leaves on each branch.  We have yellow leaves in the photograph, it is clear that the autumn tree is depicted, which means that mushrooms can be placed under it. </p>
