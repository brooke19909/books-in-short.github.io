This is a great opportunity to combine relaxation with easy learning in a natural language environment. </p><h2>  Sunny island </h2><p>  Malta is a warm and sunny island, located somewhere between the shores of northern Africa and the southern points of the island of Sicily in the very center of the gentle Mediterranean Sea.  Malta is called one of the islands of the Maltese archipelago, which gave its name to the whole state.  The state, by our Russian standards, is very small, resembling rather some regional or regional center.  An amazing country with a temperate tropical climate, fantastically beautiful landscapes, sandy and rocky beaches, wild and well-maintained (for every taste), rugged rocky shores and a turquoise blue clear sea.  This island is the dream of any tourist, and annually fans of a quiet sea holiday from all over the world come here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maltalingua.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Islands of the Maltese Archipelago" class="if uuid-2571234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2571234.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The Maltese archipelago is also interesting for its history leading to the distant past.  Arriving here once, you should definitely go on the path of the past, discovering ancient monuments of architecture, visiting stone temples and sanctuaries, whose age exceeds the famous Egyptian pyramids.  A land that knew more than one generation of colonialists, and absorbed parts of their national culture - Greeks and Spaniards, French and British, Arabs and Phoenicians, and even in some small period of history, Russians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Second state language </h2><p>  This attractive territory for many, located at the intersection of the main sea routes from Europe to Asia and Africa, has long been an apple of discord.  And only in our times, already in the 20th century, the state gains the long-awaited independence.  Being a long time under the influence of the English-speaking culture, the Maltese logically made this language their second official language.  Such is this land of myths and legends, fairy tales and medieval knights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.groupon.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maltese bay" class="if uuid-2571251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93401/2571251.jpg"></div><h2>  World English Learning Center </h2><p>  But Malta is interesting not only as a tourist attraction.

In the capital of Malta, as well as in other relatively large cities, for many years there are numerous language schools that accept students from all over the world.
