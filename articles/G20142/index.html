    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, there is the Centara Seaview Resort Khao Lak 4 * in the resort town of Khao Kak.  He, in turn, is located on the western coast of the peninsula called Malacca.  It is about 100 kilometers from Phuket.  There are many interesting sights here.  The most famous are two waterfalls (Chon-Fah and Lampi), national parks Khao Sok and <span>Khao Lak Lam-Ru, Lake</span> Cheo-Lan and much more. </p><p>  Khao Lak is located far from Phuket Airport - 80 kilometers away.  And the railway station is 170 km away.  But from this hotel you can just a minute walk to the cleanest beach with the azure sea. </p><p>  This complex is impossible not to notice.  It consists of small cozy bungalows that are decorated in a traditional Thai style, under a tree.  Many people like the way this hotel is surrounded by greenery and numerous ponds.  An ideal setting for a relaxing break. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About sports and leisure </h2><p>  The Centara Seaview Resort Khao Lak 4 * has everything you need for entertainment.  Naturally, there is an outdoor swimming pool and a sun terrace - as in any good hotel. </p><p>  In addition, guests have the opportunity to go diving, play golf on a nearby golf course for this sport, devote time to tennis, and work out in the fitness center.  You can also enjoy a hot tub, massage and wellness treatments in the SPA center.  There is also the option of playing darts or billiards. </p><p>  By the way, if potential guests are planning to take a small child with them on vacation, then they can not worry that he will have nothing to do.  There is a children's playroom and a playground with a pool.  Incidentally, babysitting services are also provided. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  The Centara Seaview Resort Khao Lak 4 * has everything from free Wi-Fi to free parking (near the hotel).  Naturally, there is also a restaurant.  The dishes are varied and delicious.  True, in the restaurant there is a rule called One Eating: when guests go inside through the main entrance, the administrator writes down the room number.  That is, breakfast a second time will not work, and even a bite to eat until lunch.  But no one forbids entering the institution from the pool.  Many bypass this rule.  By the way, in addition to the restaurant there is a bar with a variety of drinks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Centara Seaview Resort Khao Lak (Thailand) also offers ticketing services.  The complex has a dry cleaning service, laundry service, a 24-hour reception desk, a currency exchange, a tour desk and even a large conference room. </p><p>  It is not surprising that guests leave only positive reviews about their stay at Centara Seaview Resort Khao Lak.  Indeed, there is really everything here!  Guests note the attention to the delivery of food, drinks and newspapers to the rooms, the availability of family rooms and facilities for people with disabilities, as well as other services.  I am glad the opportunity to rent a car, order a packed lunch with you, buy something directly in an on-site shop.  In general, top-level service is a fact. </p>

    <h2>  Villas </h2><p>  These are very popular apartments in this hotel.  The deluxe villa is 64 square meters.  m. Inside there is not only a private bathroom (in it, by the way, in addition to the shower there is also a bathtub), but also a living room with a bedroom.  A day here will cost 8.5-9.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  There is a large family residence of 107 square meters.  m. Inside there are two bedrooms and one living room.

Its area is 105 square meters.  m. 13-14 thousand rubles are a day in such richly decorated apartments. </p>

    <h2>  Upper class </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about those apartments, which are the most expensive here.  This is a premium villa.  As many as 119 square meters of free space!  In it a day will cost about 15,000 rubles for two. </p><p>  But there are even more spacious apartments.  They are called a luxurious villa overlooking the pool.  And this is truly magnificent in the flesh.  125 sqm  m of living space, refrigerator, private pool, as well as other amenities that are available for other categories of rooms.  The only thing missing here, as guests said, is their own kitchen.  However, the food is so delicious here that there is no need for a corner for cooking. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say that this hotel should definitely stay if you plan to fly to exotic Thailand.  Rest will be unforgettable. </p>
