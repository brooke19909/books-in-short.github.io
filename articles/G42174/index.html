    <h2>  Tunisia </h2><p>  Tunisia is Africa in French.  There are white sand beaches, healing thalassotherapy, the ruins of Carthage.  Tourists will be offered the best hotels from the Sahara to Hammamet, here you will always be accompanied by good weather and excellent mood.  Of course, it cannot be said that this country literally tears off the stars from the tourist horizon, however, it nevertheless receives its annual share of tourists stably.  Tunisia could well have become an ordinary and inconspicuous resort destination with a very good sea coast without special underwater beauties, so to speak, a middle class with not very modern hotels.  However, there is one thing that distinguishes it from the general mass - this is thalassotherapy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riadh club 3 hammamet" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455826.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Problems of tourist Tunisia </h2><p>  The country's leadership has successfully borrowed this technology from its former colonialists, but so far they have not bothered to bring their hotel fund to the world level.  And so it goes: the thalasso in Tunisia is at a high level, at very attractive prices, and the hotels, alas, are mostly old, with small territories and a few.  The fact that they offer the same services to vacationers here as in Europe, but at much lower prices, attracts a lot of fans of coating and wrapping.  Now, if Tunisia could improve its hotel infrastructure, then tourism would be even better here. </p><h2>  Nabeul </h2><p>  This beautiful seaside resort used to be called Neapolis.  Here, sandy beaches are replaced by picturesque grottoes, in which a huge number of crustaceans are found, and on the top of Cape Bon you can see the small fishing village of El Hawaria, which has not changed at all since the heyday of Carthage.  Modern Nabeul is the center of the pottery of the state of Tunisia.  Which is symbolized by a very large clay jug, which is installed in front of the railway station.  Numerous souvenir shops littered with ceramic vases, dishes, jugs, pots, some obscure vessels.  True, all these products are made from imported raw materials - kaolin clay from Krumiriya.  Nabel craftsmen cover their products with beautiful blue glaze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia riadh club 3" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455827.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Two resorts </h2><p>  Hammamet and Nabeul are the oldest resorts in Tunisia.  The construction of hotel infrastructure in this country began in the late fifties of the last century.  The very first Nabeul hotel was built in the 56th year, it was called "Neapolis" (the modern name is "Aquarius").  Today, two resorts - Nabeul and Hammamet - are connected through hotel complexes.  This region has the largest hotel fund in the country.  From here, Tunisia receives a third of all tourism business revenues.  The hotel considered by us is also located Riadh Club 3 *.  Consider what is interesting about this hotel. </p><h2>  Riadh Club 3 * (Hammamet) </h2><p>  This hotel belongs to the category of three stars.  Riadh Club 3 * (reviews of Russian tourists who visited it, confirm this) deserves them one hundred percent.  It is located directly on the seashore, so those who want to take sea baths do not have to get to the beach for a long time.  Near the hotel complex there are absolutely no usual trading shops, cafes, shops, fruit stalls and so on.  If you miss these elements of civilization, you can take a taxi to the city center (the trip will take only five minutes) or walk - 15-20 minutes, however, in the heat of such a walk will be somewhat tiring. </p>

    <p>  According to the advertisement, the Riadh Club 3 * hotel (Nabeul) has an all-inclusive system that is popular with Russian tourists, that is, breakfast, afternoon tea, lunch and dinner, sweets, national snacks, coffee / tea, barbecue, pastries, fruit by the pool - all this is included in the price, and there is no extra charge.  In addition, this includes dinners at <span>A la carte restaurants</span> (although by appointment), non-alcoholic and alcoholic snacks of imported and local production, and nightly snacks.  But premium drinks - wines, cognacs, whiskey - all this for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Entourage </h2><p>  Many tourists looking at brochures sometimes wonder: why does the Riadh Club 3 * hotel have only three stars?  According to the photographs, here, if not five, then four are true.  However, after arriving here, everything immediately falls into place.  The thing is the ability to present oneself from the best side and keep silent about the flaws.  The rooms in the Riadh Club 3 * hotel are very modest.  According to the hotel manager, the repair is carried out annually, but not major, but cosmetic.  The hotel consists of two parts: old, built in the last century;  and a new one, built several years ago.  Most of the rooms have sea views, so you can watch the sunsets sitting on a wide terrace or balcony with a glass of wine.  The furniture in the rooms is modest, far from new: a bed, a mirror, bedside tables, a table, a closet and a chest of drawers.  But everything was done with taste, the apartments are clean and tidy. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Cleaning at Riadh Club 3 * and changing towels is carried out daily.  On the bedside tables are always fresh bouquets of flowers.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner - buffet.  If you compare with the five-star hotels in Turkey, then everything is quite modest, but if with three-star hotels in India, then Tunisia (Riadh Club 3 *) compares favorably with the country of yogis. </p>

    <p>  Breakfast includes scrambled eggs, pancakes, rolls, croissants, salads, cereals, jams, tea, coffee, juices, water, cocoa.  There are no fruits in the morning.  But the lunches and dinners, as for a three-star hotel, are simply excellent.  There is always shrimp, fish and meat (chicken, beef).  You can choose seafood that is fried with vegetables right in front of your eyes.  The side dish always has spaghetti, rice, vegetables (fresh, steamed and fried), potatoes.  Many different fruits, including melons and watermelons.  But drinks for dinner for some reason are served for a fee, even for plain water and phantom / cola, not to mention wine, charge money.  True, prices are much lower than store prices. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Here the guys are annealing!  Performances are sincere, interesting, never repeated.  The animation begins at ten in the morning with morning exercises, and ends with an evening disco.  Vacationers are offered free tennis courts with all accessories.  If necessary, a trainer will deal with you, he will give you several lessons for beginners.  In addition, there are ping-pong tables, archery fields.  There are sections of oriental dance, aerobics, Arabic, water polo and others.  For those who want to spend time at sea, a number of free sports are offered.  But wherever there is motorized equipment (boats, <span>jet skis</span> , etc.), a fee is charged.  From eleven o‚Äôclock in the morning, the head of the animation team rides everyone on a <span>sailing boat</span> along the coast.  Children especially like this, although many adults also do not deny themselves such pleasure. </p>

    <p>  For the kids there is a trampoline, swings, slides and more.  The evening animation program is designed more for the European audience and local Arabs.  They are also trying to translate into Russian, but not everything has been adjusted yet, this is due to the fact that this hotel is open for Russian tourists quite recently, probably they have not had time to prepare everything yet.  The program includes skits performed by the animation team, cabaret, parodies, contests, fire shows, dances and more.  In the evening, the Bingo game takes place, however, it is not in great demand among our tourists.  Hookahs work here for everyone, where you can smoke or just drink a cup of mint tea. </p><h2>  Riadh Club 3 * (Tunisia): reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is a state sanatorium, for this reason there are many Tunisians vacationing here, including local athletes (these are football players, basketball players and others).  One gets the impression that he was in a pioneer camp, and not in the Riadh Club 3 * hotel (Hammamet).  Reviews of Russian tourists come down to the fact that the hotel staff does not communicate well in Russian, the main ones are French and English.  But, as mentioned above, the hotel has recently opened for our compatriots, so the <span>language barrier</span> will soon cease to be so.  And our tourists contribute to this.  So, local animators are already freely using a number of Russian words and expressions, including slang ones.  In addition, Russian girls from among the vacationers, who act as translators, are constantly invited to animation programs. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The positive side of this institution is the strong animation team, free Wi-Fi, a clean multi-level pool equipped with free sunbeds (it is very convenient for people with disabilities) and hearty dinners.  Among the shortcomings: the room does not have a minibar, <span>beach towels, beach</span> beds are paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel riadh club 3" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455834.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest outside the hotel </h2><p>  From Nabeul, regular two-day excursions to <span>the Sahara desert</span> are conducted <span>.</span>  The cost of such a ticket is $ 150 per person.  During the trip you will visit the Roman Colosseum, which is located in the city of El Jem.  In addition, you will visit the ancient mysterious city of Matmata, in which the Berber tribe of cavemen, or, as they are also called, troglodytes, lives.  By the way, even today they prefer to live in caves.  The trip also includes a visit to the place where some episodes of Star Wars by George Lucas were shot, the scenery for this film is here today.  You will visit the "Desert Gate" - this is the city of Douz.  Here you can ride a camel, seeing off the sunset, experience the Tunisian version of the "roller coaster" (in jeeps on the dunes of the Sahara).  You will visit the city of Shebek, where the films ‚ÄúOfficers-2‚Äù and ‚ÄúKandahar‚Äù were filmed.  The disadvantage of this excursion is the unbearable heat that spans Tunisia.  Riadh Club 3 * with its air conditioners will seem like a paradise to you later. </p><h2>  We are going to Nabeul </h2><p>  In order not to sit constantly in the hotel, you can make forays into the city center.  There are many shops, supermarkets, souvenir shops, cafes, pizzerias and other amenities of civilization.  Many tourists from Russia in Nabeul purchase large quantities of olive oil, the price of which is simply ridiculous compared to our stores.  There is a big bazaar here in the old city where you can buy everything that tourists usually buy: souvenirs, clay and leather products, spices and so on.  As in the eastern bazaars, it is simply necessary to bargain - the price can be brought down three, or even five times.  Smokers should be aware that tobacco prices in Tunisia are very high, so it is better to stock up on cigarettes in Russia.  Currency can be exchanged both at the hotel and in the city, the rate is the same everywhere.  Architecture lovers will be able to visit old mosques and amphitheaters.  A vacation spent in Tunisia will be unforgettable for you! </p>
