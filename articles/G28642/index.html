And now it is a fairly successful resort with a wonderfully developed infrastructure.  The village received its modern name thanks to the owner of the inn, which once built the first institution in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 greece crete heraklion" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1506725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  During the summer season, the complex has an excellent team of animators, the guys try to entertain tourists in every possible way, luring them into water aerobics classes.  Guests can also take part in recreational activities at the beach.  And in the evenings, a show with music and karaoke awaits guests. </p><h2>  Rest for children </h2><p>  Themis <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Crete,</span> Heraklion) is aimed at families with children of different ages.  Therefore, the presence of children's animation is a prerequisite.  The complex has a club with its own team of animators, there is a separate children's pool, a playground with swings and slides. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Themis Beach Hotel 4 * has its own beach.  The hotel complex is located on the coast.  But between it and the beach there is a road that runs into a dead end behind the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 greece crete heraklion reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1506749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, cars rarely appear here.  Crossing the road, you immediately find yourself on a sandy beach with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Entry into the water is very gentle and good for children, and the sea is always warm and clean.  Calmness is rare.  Most of the time there are small waves. </p><h2>  Trips and excursions </h2><p>  It makes sense for tourists to pre-determine the cultural program, that is, to think about what they want to see on the island of Crete.  It is full of interesting places.  The hotel always has a tour operator representative who can book trips, but they are quite expensive.  The cost of each excursion starts from 30 euros per person.  It is much simpler and more profitable to rent a car for a couple of days and travel around the whole island on it. </p><p>  It is not necessary to devote all the time to a beach vacation, it is imperative to allocate time for exploring local attractions.  In the vicinity of Kokkini Hani there are many interesting places.  Near the village there are stunning archaeological excavations in the territory of which the Minoan house with all the decoration was found, it is well preserved to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 greece crete" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1506739.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Not far from Kokkini Hann is the village of Anapolis.  In it you can visit the WaterCity water park, offering 34 interesting attractions.  In the southeast of Anapolis is the ancient monastery of St. John the Evangelist.  Outwardly, it resembles a fortress, not a monastery of monks.  Such a serious structure was built to protect against pirate raids.  In addition, next to Hokkini Hani is the Cretan Aquarium, which can show a rich collection of marine inhabitants of the Mediterranean. </p><p>  From Kokkini Hani, you can easily take a bus to Agios Nicholas and Heraklion to see local attractions there.  By renting a car, you can go around the whole of Crete in two to three days.  Among vacationers, trips to the Lassithi plateau, to the cave of Zeus, to the Knossos palace, Spinalonga, to the island of Gramvtsa and to the <span>bay of Balos are</span> very popular <span>.</span> </p><p>  Relaxing in the complex, you can order your individual tour.  Together with the guide, you will develop a travel plan and a list of all the attractions that you plan to see.  The guide will devote the whole day only to you, of course, such a trip is more expensive, but it is much more interesting than a group trip. </p><h2>  Themis Beach Hotel 4 * (Greece, Crete, Heraklion): reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the results of our conversation, I would like to discuss the reviews of vacationers.  Hotel reservations should be made in advance, especially if you intend to get apartments with sea views.  Getting to the hotel is very easy.  Check-in is quick, tourists do not need to expect an estimated time, even if they arrive earlier than the specified hour.  Vacationers note the friendliness and polite attitude of the staff.  In general, the inhabitants of Crete are incredibly responsive, always ready to help. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are completely small, but they have everything you need for relaxation, plumbing works well.  The complex, of course, is not new; it does not impress with the beauty and luxury of the halls.  But the prices for rest in it are more than acceptable.  The rooms need redecoration, but they are clean and suitable for living.  The apartments are cleaned every day.  According to guests, it makes no sense to leave a tip, this does not affect the quality of cleaning.  Towels are replaced frequently.  There are no slippers and bathrobes in the rooms, cosmetics are presented only with soap and shampoos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="themis beach hotel 4 heraklion" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1506733.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main restaurant serves delicious and varied dishes to vacationers.  The hotel chef prepares European as well as Italian dishes.  Near the complex there are many restaurants where you can always eat hearty and inexpensive food.  The hotel bars offer alcoholic and soft drinks, sliced, snacks and salads. </p><p>  The beach of the complex is really clean and good.  Only sunbeds on it are paid, their cost is two euros per day.  But our compatriots have found a way out.  They relax by the pool on free sun loungers, and then go swimming on the coast.  The hotel is located on the beach, so go to the sea very close.  In season, sea water is very warm. </p><p>  With all the advantages of the hotel, there is one significant drawback - Wi-Fi, which does not work in the rooms at all.  You can use it only in the lobby and then at a time when there are few people.  At peak times, the Internet simply does not draw as many users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel themis beach hotel 4" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1508913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Separate praise deserves children's animation.  It's hard for kids to get out of the club, it's fun and interesting there.  Animators work perfectly for the adult part of vacationers, luring people to daytime activities.  In the evenings, tourists can watch entertaining shows in the amphitheater. </p><p>  Kokkini Hani is a small village, but it has a good infrastructure.  It has two large supermarkets, cafes and restaurants.  In the evening you can walk along the boardwalk. </p><p>  According to tourists, you should definitely visit interesting places in the vicinity of the village, as well as go to Heraklion.  In Crete there is a large number of historical places, in order to have time to see everything, it is better to rent a car.  This will reduce time and expenses on excursions. </p><p>  You should definitely visit the water park and the aquarium, which delight visitors of all ages. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In our article, we examined the main advantages and disadvantages of Themis Beach Hotel 4 *.  Guest reviews allow us to conclude that it can be recommended for families to unassuming people who do not make excessive demands.  This budget institution will not please you with new flat-screen TVs or beautiful interiors, but you will have fun, relax on a wonderful beach, swim in the warm sea. </p>
