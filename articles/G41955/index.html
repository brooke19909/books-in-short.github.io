In this case, the easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel is by taxi.  For holidaymakers who have bought vouchers with accommodation at this hotel, a shuttle bus is usually provided.  The road to the hotel on it takes about 3 hours.  On the way, the bus calls at other hotels. </p>

    <p>  Hotel guests living on the upper floors can take the elevator.  There are two of them in the hotel.  Unfortunately, it often happens that only one elevator works in a hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel Olympic 3 * <span>(Ulcinj, Montenegro): service reviews</span> </h2><p>  Opinion about this hotel among its guests was quite good.  The staff at the hotel are polite and the guests are very friendly.  All hotel staff can speak English.  Reception workers also know some Russian phrases.  For domestic tourists it is certainly very convenient.  In any case, the Serbian language is a little similar to Russian, and the guests from Russia in terms of communication with hotel staff usually do not have problems. </p><p>  The pool at the hotel, according to tourists, is large enough and convenient for swimming.  The water in it is always clean.  The only thing is that the hotel staff spills too much bleach into the water.  The hotel pool is open from 11:00 to 18:00.  This, of course, is not too convenient for guests.  You can‚Äôt swim in the pool in the evening. </p><p>  The gym at the hotel operates on the same schedule.  However, none of the guests visited him.  There is a gym in the basement of the hotel and the equipment in it is installed, judging by the reviews of tourists, outdated and idle.  Thus, the availability of a gym is declared by the hotel administration, apparently, only for advertising.  Which, of course, can be attributed to the minuses of the hotel. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Rooms at <span>the Olympic Hotel 3 *</span> (Montenegro, Ulcinj) are rented with breakfast or half board.  Reviews about food in the hotel are mostly good.  According to most guests, the food in the hotel is pretty monotonous, but the dishes here are delicious.  In addition, portions are provided for guests quite large.  Breakfast and dinner are served at the hotel on a buffet basis.  Guests can take scrambled eggs, first and second courses, pastes, jams, toasts, sausages, etc. Vegetables are also served in the hotel's dining room.  The guests really praise the local ice cream and yoghurts. </p>

    <p>  The cooks of this hotel, as in many others in European countries, have not yet begun to use palm oil.  Therefore, all the food in the dining room is natural.  Most of all, the hotel restaurant serves fried dishes. </p><p>  Residents <span>of the Olympic Hotel</span> 3 * (Montenegro, Ulcinj) can dine in the cafes and restaurants located next to it.  Catering establishments in the city of Ulcinj also earned good reviews from tourists.  The food in the cafes and eateries of this resort is good.  But the dishes in the city's catering establishments are quite expensive. </p><h2>  Beach Hotels </h2><p>  The sea is not too far from the hotel.  Guests need to walk about 200 meters through the hotel itself, then about 100 meters through the park and a little more through the sand.  A total of approximately 500 meters of the path.  The length and width of the beach located next to the hotel is quite large.  However, the entire infrastructure on it is concentrated at about fifty meters. </p><p>  If desired, guests at the beach can use sun loungers and parasols for a fee.  They must be taken with a kit.  You cannot use your umbrella on this beach.  The coastline in this place is covered with soft fine sand. </p><p>  Of course, vacationers on the coastline opposite the hotel are offered various kinds of water activities.  Tourists can ride a banana, a tablet, a catamaran, or even fly with a parachute.  There is a toilet on this beach.  True, you must also pay for his visit.  There are usually quite a lot of people in this place on the shore. </p>
