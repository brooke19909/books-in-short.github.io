What is the difference between this form of agreement from others?  Where did she come from? </p><h2>  Ancient Rome </h2><p>  Information about the first triumvirate came to us from the biographies of Roman rulers.  The first triumvirate was created by the three most influential contemporaries.  Caesar, Crassus and Pompey - the first creators of the triumvirate, its direct participants and inspirers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="triumvirate is" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281077.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <h2>  When did the triumvirate come about? </h2><p>  This event in various sources dates differently.  Basically, historians tend to name about 60 BC.  e., but other ancient authors, including Plutarch, Livy, Dion Cassius, believe that such an agreement was prepared long before Caesar was elected to the consuls.  Most likely, the idea to conclude an alliance of the three arose at the beginning of 60 BC, and on the eve of the new, 59 year agreement was already considered formalized. </p><h2>  Why did the triumvirate come about? </h2><p>  This agreement is dictated by the coincidence of the goals of the participants.  Pompey agreed to take part in the triumvirate due to the pronounced conservatism of the Senate, which so eagerly opposed new ideas that even trampled on its own common sense.  Crassus sided with the agreement because of the position of the riders.  Due to the accumulated disagreements, the riders (the monetary aristocracy of Rome) almost broke with the Senate and could not lobby for their own interests in the government.  The Roman triumvirate could help restore the monetary aristocracy, which by nobility was second only to senators, the right to defend their own interests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first triumvirate" class="if" height="488" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281074.jpg" width="600"></div>

Some historians attribute to Julia an irresistible desire to be the sole ruler of Rome and argue that the triumvirate he created is only a step towards the goal.  But there were no serious grounds for believing that Caesar already had bold plans at that time.  Perhaps a favorable combination of circumstances prompted Caesar to a coup, but so far he has been struggling with the insoluble task: to pacify the opponents and drag his own agrarian law through the Senate. </p><h2>  Against whom was the union of the three directed? </h2><p>  For these three to come together, a special set of circumstances was required.  In this case, the reason for the rapprochement of three dissimilar people was a common enemy - the Senate.  Everyone saw in him an obstacle to the realization of their own plans.  And the only way to achieve their own aspirations for each participant could be only an alternative governing body - a triumvirate.  Rome mid-1st century BC  e.  exhausted itself in the role of the republic, and the creation of the agreement of the three was a turning point in the history of this state. </p><h2>  Start of action </h2><p>  First, 59 BC.  e.  both consuls - Bibulus and Caesar, accepted new posts.  At that time, it was Bibul who was known and respected: senator, patrician, permanent member of state councils - he seemed to be the driving force.  Caesar, as everyone thought, was only a shadow of Bibulus.  But Caesar had his own plans for consulate.  He came into politics to solve the agrarian question, and for this he gathered like-minded people wherever possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="triumvirate rome" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281075.jpg" width="506"></div>

The Senate was outraged that the land law introduced the consul, and not the stands - this was an unheard of violation of the procedure.  But Caesar did not give up.  To cover the project, he introduced the mandatory publication of Senate meeting reports so that everyone could familiarize themselves with the details of the discussion.  Caesar threatened to turn to the people.  References to the unfavorable signs that Bibulus poured did not help - Caesar scheduled a meeting, broke the resistance of Bibulus and Cato, and his agrarian law was adopted by a majority vote. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="triumvirate caesar" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281078.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <h2>  Recognition of the Triumvirate </h2><p>  In the process of struggle unfolding around the adoption of agrarian law, a secret alliance was discovered.  Crassus and Pompey supported the adoption of the law and attracted their own supporters, Pompey even threatened to use weapons.  The law was passed, Pompey strengthened his position, and Caesar attracted more than twenty thousand families to his side, who under the new law were given their own land plots.  In addition, Caesar helped coordinate with the Senate and approve the orders given by Pompey in the East, which significantly confirmed the authority of his ally among like-minded people. </p><p>  In the wake of success, Caesar was able to introduce two more bills regarding his closest supporters.  According to the first Ptolemy, Avlet, the closest friend of Pompey, was proclaimed "a friend of the Roman people."  For this honor, Avlet rolled off 6,000 talents of gold, which the triumvirate honestly divided among themselves.  Caesar fulfilled his obligations to his other ally, Crassus, who advocated accepting the demands of the farmers.  According to the second law, a third of the purchase amount was withdrawn from the riders, which greatly increased Caesar's popularity among the riders, whom many considered to be the "driving force of Rome." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman triumvirate" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1281076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Honesty is the best policy </h2><p>  This template phrase perfectly emphasizes the forces that for a long time restrained together three such dissimilar people.  Caesar fulfilled all the obligations that the triumvirate set before him.  This helped him gain popularity and a lot of supporters.  Having taken care of others, Caesar proceeded to fulfill his plans, and did so very successfully.  But this is a completely different story. </p>
