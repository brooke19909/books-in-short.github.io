You need to pay attention to those formalities that are necessary for tax.  The documentation for this service is created using a cash register.  In some cases, a check machine is used.  The article will figure out when it should be used, as well as which models are the most popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="printing machines" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984061.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is a check printing machine (CNC)? </h2><p>  This device is used for sales.  The machine prints checks, which subsequently help to fix the profit.  From the <span>cash register</span> does not differ either in function or in purpose.  There is only one caveat: in certain cases it is forbidden to use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mercury 115" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984062.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Differences </h2><p>  Although the functionality and purpose of both devices are considered similar, there are still differences between them.  Their knowledge will provide the most convenient work and will allow you to choose the right devices.  For example, a cash register, unlike a check, received fiscal storage.  All the received data is laid in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this case, the machine does not have to be registered in the tax.  Also, you do not need to bother with installing a special unit for protection.  If there is no desire to cooperate with a development company and be serviced by it, then you can freely not sign a contract. </p><p>  However, although the use of a check printing machine for private entrepreneurs is as convenient as possible, it is not used in all areas of business.  The legislation spells out cases when its work is not allowed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mercury 180" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984063.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Who can use it? </h2><p>  Any entrepreneur understands the fact that he needs to somehow monitor his income.  It will not be superfluous to calculate how much of the money will be used to pay taxes and other fees, and which can be used to pay for employees.  Consider the tax regimes that allow the use of a check machine.  We are talking about a patent and a single tax on income for a temporary period.  Only in such cases can the described machine be used.  Why is that so?  This is due to the fact that under such operating conditions, the tax that the employer must pay monthly does not depend on the number of services provided or goods sold.  Therefore, for many entrepreneurs it is much more profitable and cheaper to use a conventional check machine, which will quickly and quickly fix a purchase in a couple of clicks.  The buyer can use the issued document as a protection if the goods are of poor quality.  Only if he has a check in his hands will he be able to return the goods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If this machine is allowed only in the two modes described above, then it should be described when it is prohibited.  When working with a single tax on agriculture and with a simplified taxation system, a printing device cannot be used.  It is not allowed for the reason because it does not have fiscal memory.  It is needed in order to count the sales that the company makes.  These data directly affect the amount of taxes. </p><h2>  What information does it give out? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mercury check machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984064.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In order to have this device, the seller must be interested.  So he will be able to be fully aware of all sales, and it will also be easier to control personnel with him.  A check device will also help you make inventory a lot easier. </p><p>  The described device, like the cashier, is able to work with the z-report function.  Thanks to this, you can instantly receive all information about a particular purchase upon request. </p><h2>  What data does the device store? </h2><p>  The device indicates the date and time of the purchase, its amount, method of payment (using a bank card or cash), as well as the total for the day.  Thanks to these data, you can monitor any operations.  This is convenient and describes the machine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ip check machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984065.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose a car? </h2><p>  Many people wonder why <span>check machines are</span> so popular with many small companies or firms.  They are much cheaper than bulky cash registers.  Moreover, they do not need to be trained to use.  In addition, check machines are very similar to cash registers. </p><p>  At the factory, when creating the device, software is "embedded" in it, which controls the memorization of details.  They are needed for public services. </p><p>  It should also be noted that with a low price range, the device is completely small, so there will not be any problems with the movement.  Often, waiters and couriers use the check machine.  This solution is as convenient as possible for both buyers and employees. </p><p>  Many may wonder how to connect the machine to the computer.  This can be found in the instructions.  If we talk about this, then briefly - it is enough to have a special wire. </p><p>  A separate plus of cars is the speed of work.  Printing a check is much faster than a cash register. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cpm check machine" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1984066.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Popular models </h2><p>  There are a large number of machines on the market that print checks.  Among them, many are in demand.  The following are considered the most popular: Orion 100, Mercury 115/180, Alpha 400.  Model 180 from the second manufacturer is considered the most famous among entrepreneurs. </p><h2>  Important device settings </h2><p>  Most often, sellers use equipment from Mercury.  These check devices have special differences and multiple advantages.  For example, the ‚ÄúMercury 115‚Äù device can please with its reliability and service life (more than five years of stable operation), speed and ergonomics.  It should be noted that the machine withstands large volumes of tasks and has a good design.  The device is so simple that there is no need to use the instructions that come with the kit.  With many advantages, the series is completely inexpensive. </p><p>  Often, the "Mercury 180" model is used by small enterprises, but there are also large ones.  The latter pay more attention not to cost, but to the number of advantages.  This is due to the fact that many people just buy a cash register unprofitable.  Moreover, it‚Äôs more convenient to move the device.  Therefore, the Mercury 180 check printing machine also deserves attention. </p><h2>  Model "Orion 100" </h2><p>  This machine will instantly issue all receipts for payment.  The device prints them automatically.  It works both from the battery and from the network.  The battery allows you to use the device in rooms where there is no electricity, which is very convenient.  You can add about 1,500 products that are available in the database.  The device remembers not only the code and name, but also the quantity, cost.  If desired, you can establish protection against data changes, this will help to avoid the malfunction of employees.  The design of the device is convenient, and ergonomics is implemented as efficiently as possible. </p>
