    <p>  The <span>learning process is</span> understood as the contact between the teacher and the student, manifested in a purposeful and consistently changing interaction, during which the <span>tasks of upbringing,</span> education and general development are solved.  In simple terms, thanks to such a process, a person can grow and develop, achieve success, gain power over his weaknesses, make dreams and dreams come true. </p><p>  <strong>Learning Features</strong> </p><p>  Functions of the learning process are quite diverse, but nevertheless, among them there are three most important, namely: the educational function, educational and developing. </p><p>  Modern didactics (the science of learning) draws attention to the fact that all the tasks and functions of the learning process cannot be reduced only to the formation of skills, abilities and knowledge.  The educational process should have a comprehensive impact on the personality, even though the educational function is somewhat specific to this process.  It should be noted that these three functions of the learning process do not have strict boundaries between themselves.  So, for example, education can mean not only the assimilation of theoretical and factual knowledge, but also the formation of general educational skills and abilities.  At the same time, these <span>general educational skills</span> are often referred to as personality development. </p><p>  What are the above functions of the education process? </p><p>  The educational function is the formation of special skills and knowledge, the development of scientific knowledge.  Scientific knowledge is facts, laws, theories, concepts, laws, a generalized picture of the world.  Special abilities are practical skills that are specific only to the field of science and the educational process.  For example, in physics it will be solving problems, conducting research and laboratory work.  In addition to everything described above, during the learning process, students acquire general scientific skills and abilities that are relevant to all subjects, for example, it can be working with a book or writing and reading skills. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The educational function is the formation of students' worldview, beliefs, moral, aesthetic, labor and ethical ideas and views, ways of behavior and activities in society, attitude to the individual, etc. </p><p>  Developing function - here we mean special measures that will contribute not only to the formation of special skills and knowledge, but also to the general development of students.  It should be noted that education itself is developing, however, the range of developed qualities and teaching methods is somewhat reduced, due to the lack of focus on such content. </p><p>  <strong>Principles and patterns of the learning process</strong> </p><p>  Patterns of the learning process indicate significant and necessary connections between its outcome and conditions, and the principles resulting from them determine the main strategy for solving learning objectives.  Distinguish between external and internal patterns of learning.  External means the dependence of training on social conditions and <span>processes (political</span> and socio-economic situation, level of culture, etc.).  Internal patterns are the relationships that are established between the components of the learning process (for example, between the student, teacher and the meaning of the educational material, between methods, forms and <span>teaching aids).</span> </p><p>  The principles of the learning process are formed on the basis of patterns.  They represent the most general provisions that define the requirements for the organization, content, implementation and <span>management of the</span> learning <span>process</span> .  For example, such is the principle of the relationship between theory and practice, the independence and activity of students, the principle of nationality as an appeal to the history and traditions of previous generations, etc. </p>
