    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the hotel Soho Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) contain a number of criticisms.  So, it is worth noting such negative aspects of relaxation in this institution: </p><ul><li>  the hotel has a lot of noisy companies that violate public order, and employees do not react to this; </li><li>  a lot of insects both on the territory and in all rooms of the hotel; </li><li>  monotonous meager breakfasts, which are also repeated every day; </li><li>  Wireless Internet can be used only at the reception; </li><li>  old front doors with unreliable locks and broken door handles; </li><li>  the tile in the bathroom is covered with a large layer of mold, which can be considered a consequence of poor ventilation and unscrupulous cleaning; </li><li>  old worn furniture that has long been in need of replacement; </li><li>  the use of air conditioning is paid (7 euros), while it practically does not fulfill the declared functions; </li><li>  the road from the beach to the hotel is quite difficult, since you need to climb the mountain; </li><li>  during cleaning, maids absolutely do not pay attention to balconies; </li><li>  if you do not have your own adapter for sockets, you will have to pay 2 euros per day for using it (for long stays, it will be more profitable to buy the device in a supermarket); </li><li>  there are no cosmetic accessories in the bathroom (there is not even a bar of soap); </li><li>  too small and shallow pool; </li><li>  the bar is constantly closed, and if you want to buy something there, you must first ask the reception staff about it; </li><li>  the hotel is located next to the roadway; </li><li>  the description of the rooms presented on the official website does not correspond to reality (in reality, the room may not have a number of amenities); </li><li>  neither salt nor spices are provided in the kitchen area (you need to buy everything yourself); </li><li>  old mattresses on the beds creak, sag and prick the body with springs; </li><li>  ugly paintings in the rooms; </li><li>  to the city center is about 15 minutes on foot; </li><li>  in some rooms the balcony door does not close, and therefore, leaving the room, you will worry about the safety of your belongings; </li><li>  the restaurant constantly serves baked bread; </li><li>  cleaning is not daily; </li><li>  employees do not speak Russian (but there are no problems with English). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  <span>Soho Hotel Apartments 3 *</span> (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) can be considered quite a worthy economical accommodation option in Cyprus.  The relatively low prices for accommodation and other services can be explained by not the most advantageous location, as well as a very outdated number of rooms.  Thus, lovers to spend a lot of time on site this option will not work. </p><p>  The main advantage of this hotel is that the room has a full kitchen.  This makes it possible not to spend money on food in restaurants.  By the way, in this institution breakfasts are not of the highest quality and delicious, and therefore the opportunity to cook food yourself is especially valuable. </p><p>  The main drawback of this hotel is the careless attitude of employees to their work according to the guests of Soho Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa).  Reviews note that this is manifested not only in the quality of cleaning, but also in the work of catering establishments and other services.  It is also worth noting the dismissive attitude towards the peace of guests and connivance with respect to noisy companies. </p>
