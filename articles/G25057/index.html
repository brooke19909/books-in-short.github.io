This is not surprising: the Kingdom of Thailand is a country of smiles, one of the ten states with the largest number of holidays and weekends. </p><p>  Rest in the country does not imply a limitation of hotel infrastructure.  Therefore, most often the choice of accommodation stops at a three-star hotel with quality service at a reasonable price.  JP Villa Pattaya 3 * belongs to this category, which will be discussed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel jp villa pattaya" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/735561.jpg" width="500"></div>  Category 3 * for Thailand - these are spacious and comfortable rooms.  The "star" of the hotel is determined by the operator, so the same hotel can be offered in different evaluation options.

The theatrical show is very spectacular and gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe history, culture and traditions of the Thai people. </li></ol><h2>  Hotel guest reviews </h2><p>  According to visitors to the hotel <strong> </strong>  JP Villa Pattaya 3 *, this is a budget vacation option. <strong> </strong>  Guests note the hotel‚Äôs location is not very convenient due to its remoteness from the beach (two kilometers, requires an hour walk to the coast) and from the center of Pattaya. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the rating by reviews of visitors to the hotel is about 4 out of a possible 5 points, which indicates the compliance of the declared level of the hotel with the quality of service.  Visitors note the good service, spacious rooms and the friendliness of the staff.  This accommodation option is recommended by tourists for choosing both a budget and quality vacation. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><ol><li>  In Thailand, there is a ban on smoking in <span>public places.</span>  Violation of it is punishable by a fine of 2,000 baht.  For smoking, you need to find a dedicated area. </li><li>  Diving enthusiasts should choose an island for their stay.  Pattaya, Samui and Chang are suitable for beginner divers.  The best professional centers are in Phuket and Phi Phi </li><li>  Car rental should be in the famous centers - Avis, Budget.  To do this, you need a passport, international law, a credit card.  In these centers, cars are insured. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya island" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/735567.jpg" width="600"></div>  If you turn to private distributors, you can save on the service, but the risk of operating an uninsured vehicle can lead to serious losses. </li><li>  The traditions of Thailand do not allow excessive manifestation of relations between the sexes in public places.  You should also carefully consider clothing when visiting temples. </li></ol>
