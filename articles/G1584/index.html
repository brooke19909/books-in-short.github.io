Cyril (worldly name Constantine) was born in Macedonia.  Together with his brother Methodius, he made an invaluable contribution to the development of the Slavic language.  <span>This is a person</span> who was obliged to become canonized after her death.

    <h2>  Vision and extraordinary mind </h2><p>  The Slavic enlightener is from Byzantium.  Konstantin (Cyril) was born in 827 in modern Thessaloniki, and earlier the city of Soluni.  His father was a prominent man who held a high position in Soluni as an assistant military commander. </p><p>  There are written references to the fact that young Constantine once had a vision.  Sophia appeared to him with a glowing face.  Parents of the guy considered the wise woman Sofia in a ghostly woman.  They interpreted this incident as a significant event and were very happy about it. </p><p>  Young Konstantin (Slavic enlightener, a native of Byzantium) was immediately sent to school.  Then the teachers were able to discover the extraordinary giftedness of the boy: his sharp mind, memory and eccentricity of thinking.  The most favorite pastime for Konstantin was reading books. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Konstantin received higher education in Tsarygrad.  The role of his teachers was played by such famous personalities in science as Photius, Leo the Philosopher, and others.  The mind of the future creator of the alphabet struck everyone and everyone.  His mind cannot be described in words. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic enlightener" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/734739.jpg" width="304"></div>

    <h2>  Creating an ABC </h2><p>  The Slavic enlightener, the author of the first alphabet, Cyril began work on his brainchild on the orders of Emperor Michael.  First of all, Konstantin depicted the same sounds for the Greeks and Slavs.  He transmitted them using <span>Greek letters.</span>  He tried to transmit those sounds that were not in the Greek language so that they did not differ from ready-made letters.  When Constantine replaced the signs, they could have a very awkward appearance. </p><p>  The newly composed alphabet totaled 43 letters.  Thanks to them, it was possible to write down words such as, for example, boron, latitude, noise and others.  These terms could not be depicted in Greek letters, since in this language there are no letters to convey the following sounds: s, w, u, s, y, b, h, g.  For their image in the Slavic language there were letters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic enlightener author of the first alphabet" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/734738.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Fight and death </h2><p>  The Slavic peoples tried in every possible way to forbid having their own written language.  But Cyril, a Slavic enlightener from Byzantium, led an implacable struggle against this injustice.  He courageously performed services in the Church Slavonic language.  At that time, the doctrine that the Latin peoples were the chosen god and the Slavic nationality was barbarism prevailed in the West.  Cyril rejected all this. </p><p>  The beginning of 869 brought Cyril (a Slavic enlightener from Byzantium) a terrible disease, from which he died on February 14 of the same year.  The sage died at the age of 42. </p>
