Various hypotheses suggest that the Slavs descended from Ants, Wends and Sklaves in the 5th-6th centuries.  Over time, this large mass was divided into three groups: western, southern and eastern.  Representatives of the latter settled in the territory of modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tribal union of eastern slavs" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/998476.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>The Eastern Slavs</span> were not a single people.  This was not possible due to differences in climate and living conditions.  There were 15 tribal unions of the Eastern Slavs.  Despite the relative kinship and close proximity, their relationship was not always friendly. </p><p>  For the convenience of classification, researchers often group tribal unions of the Eastern Slavs.  The table will help to understand the numerous names of these prototypes of states.  In the IX-X centuries.  they all united in Russia under the leadership of the <span>Kiev princes.</span> </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  15 tribal unions of the eastern Slavs </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Northern tribal unions </td><td>  Slovenia, Krivichy, Polotsk </td></tr><tr><td>  Central tribal unions </td><td>  Dregovichi, Radimichi, Vyatichi </td></tr><tr><td>  Western tribal unions </td><td>  Volyn, white Croats, Buzhan </td></tr><tr><td>  Southern Tribal Unions </td><td>  Drevlyane, duleby, glade, northerners, streets, tivertsy </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Northern tribal unions </h2><p>  Slovene lived in the very north of this oecumene.  In historiography, the definition of "Ilmen" is also entrenched - according to the name of the lake around which they settled.  Later, a large city of Novgorod will appear here, which, along with Kiev, has become one of the two political centers of Russia.  This tribal union of the Eastern Slavs was one of the most developed due to trade with neighboring peoples and countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea.  Their frequent conflicts with the Vikings (Vikings) are known, because of which Prince Rurik was invited to reign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tribal unions of the eastern Slavs table" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/998475.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To the south settled another tribal union of the Eastern Slavs - Krivichi.  They settled in the headwaters of several large rivers: the Dnieper, <span>Western Dvina</span> and Volga.  Their main cities were Smolensk and Izborsk.  Polotsk residents lived in Polotsk and Vitebsk. </p><h2>  Central tribal unions </h2><p>  On the largest tributary of the Volga - Oka - lived Vyatichi.  It was the easternmost tribal union of the Eastern Slavs.  From Vyatichi remained archaeological sites of the Roman-Borschev culture.  They were mainly engaged in agriculture and trade with the Volga Bulgars. </p><p>  Radimichi lived west of the Vyatichi and south of the Krivichi.  They owned land in the interfluve of the Desna and the Dnieper in modern Belarus.  There are almost no written sources from this tribe - only references to more developed neighbors. </p><p>  Dregovichi lived even west of the Radimichi.  To the north of them began the possession of the wild people of Lithuania, with whom the Slavs had constant conflicts.  But even such an interconnection had a great influence on the Dregovics, who adopted many of the Baltic habits.  Even their language has changed and borrowed new words from their northern neighbors. </p><h2>  Western tribal unions </h2><p>  In the far west, Volhynians and white Croats lived.  They were even mentioned by the Byzantine emperor Konstantin Bagryanorody (in his book "On the management of the empire").  He believed that this tribal union of the Eastern Slavs was the ancestor of the Balkan Croats who lived on the borders with his state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of tribal unions of the eastern Slavs" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/998474.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Volynians are also known as Buzhanians, who got their name along the <span>Western Bug River.</span>  They were mentioned in the Tale of Bygone Years. </p><h2>  Southern Tribal Unions </h2><p>  The Black Sea steppes became a home for streets and tivertsy.  These tribal unions found themselves on the southern borders of the <span>settlement of the Eastern Slavs.</span>  They lived in the steppe and constantly fought with the local nomads of Turkic origin - the Pechenegs and Polovtsians.  The Slavs did not succeed in defeating this confrontation, and in the second half of the 10th century they finally left the Black Sea region, having settled in the lands of Volyn and mixed with them. </p><p>  In the southeast of the Slavic oikumens lived northerners.  They differed from other tribesmen in a narrow face shape.  They were greatly influenced by the steppe nomadic neighbors with whom the northerners mutually assimilated.  Until 882, these tribes were tributaries of the Khazars, until Oleg annexed them to his state. </p><h2>  Drevlyane </h2><p>  Drevlyans settled in the forests between the Dnieper and Pripyat.  Their capital was Iskorosten (now it remains a hillfort).  The drevlyans developed a system of relationships within the tribe.  In fact, this was an early form of state with its own prince. </p><p>  For some time the Drevlyans argued with their neighboring neighbors for leadership in the region, and the latter even paid tribute to them.  However, after Oleg united Novgorod and Kiev, he subjugated Iskorosten.  His successor, Prince Igor, died at the hands of the Drevlyans after demanding an excess of tribute from them.  His wife Olga brutally avenged the rebels, betraying Iskorosten to the fire, which they later never restored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="15 tribal unions of the eastern Slavs" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/998473.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <p>  The names of tribal unions of the Eastern Slavs often have analogues in different sources.  For example, Drevlyans are also described as a duleb tribal union, or duleb.  From them remained Zimnovsky settlement, which in the 7th century was destroyed by aggressive Avars. </p><h2>  Glade </h2><p>  The middle course of the Dnieper has chosen a glade.  It was the most powerful and influential tribal union.  Excellent natural conditions and fertile soil allowed them not only to feed themselves, but also to successfully trade with their neighbors - equip flotillas, etc. It was through their territory that the route ‚ÄúFrom the Varangians to the Greeks‚Äù passed, which gave them great profit. </p><p>  Kiev became the center of the meadow, located on the high bank of the Dnieper.  Its walls served as reliable protection from enemies.  Who were the neighbors of the tribal unions of the Eastern Slavs in these parts?  The Khazars, Pechenegs and other nomads who wished to impose tribute on the settled people.  In 882, <span>Prince</span> Novgorod of Novgorod captured Kiev and created a single East Slavic state, moving his capital here. </p>
