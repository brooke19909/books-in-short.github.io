At first, the thought of how much the Scholl roller file cost was shocking.  But fashionistas do prices stop?  So the nail files became residents of many houses where the girls hoped to get perfect heels.  But is this beauty tool so good?  What do experts say about him?  To begin with, we will understand the principle of its work and contraindications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="file scholl photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/1878316.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beauty Assistant </h2><p>  The Scholl power saw is a stylish helper that can remove coarse skin from the feet.  It is strictly forbidden to use on other parts of the body or household items. </p><p>  The design of the file is designed so that it fits comfortably in the hand.  Its rubberized handle will not allow the tool to slip out, no matter how uncomfortable your body is. </p><p>  The heels are polished with a replaceable roller, which is strewn with microbeads.  Many men with a smile call these rollers "sandpaper", and surprisingly, they are partly right.  Microbeads are sprayed onto a roller by a method similar to processing sandpaper of a large section. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can turn on the device by rotating the wheel, which we will talk about later.  Many are confused by the noise that this device emits during operation.  Some women compare it with the sound of a neighboring punch on a Sunday morning. </p><h2>  Terms of use </h2><p>  Some are panicky afraid of such devices.  Why?  There is an opinion that such rotating machines can injure the skin and only aggravate the situation with careless heels and coarsening of the skin.  In fact, if you read the instructions, and on the original packaging it is in Russian, then there should not be any problems. </p><p>  And there are only three operating rules for the device: </p><ol><li>  Drive the file all over your foot. </li><li>  Do not hold it in one place for more than four seconds. </li><li>  The skin should be completely dry. </li></ol><p>  However, not every girl should buy this assistant home.  Why? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scholl file reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1878834.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Contraindications </h2><p>  First of all, you can not use a file for those who do not like to read instructions.  On steamed skin injuries can not be avoided.  It will also be bad for those who decide to experiment with the device on other parts of their body, no matter how, in their opinion, they were coarsened. </p><p>  The instruction manual clearly states that the Scholl roller file is a terrible gift for those with diabetes, as it is prohibited for them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Running heels do not master the file.  The reason we will discuss later. </p><p>  The roller, on which almost no abrasive, has to be urgently replaced.  Those who are not going to follow this rule can expect a burn. </p><p>  The device hates water, and if you feel sorry for the money spent on it, it is strongly not recommended that you work in the bathroom and store it there.  Let it be in your closet in the room, closed with a special lid. </p><p>  There are no more contraindications.  The rest of the file can be used.  You can understand how good she is by comparing with her regular Singer foot file, which can be bought at almost any hardware store. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scholl roller file how much" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/1878313.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The first, for which the Scholl roller file received negative reviews, was its price.  At the time of 2017, you can buy this miracle in the online store for just over 1 thousand Russian rubles.  To the cost of the device you need to add the price of four finger batteries, from which it is powered, and replaceable rollers, supposedly with diamond coating.  The latter, by the way, cost about 600 Russian rubles.  Total - about two thousand rubles.  Is it worth it, we will analyze later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now consider a conventional metal file.  Its cost usually barely exceeds two hundred rubles.  She does not need any additional accessories.  At least when it comes to price, the good old Singer wins this round.  But winning a battle does not always mean winning a war. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Another of the minuses in the reviews about the Scholl roller file is the failure to fulfill all the promises that are in the advertising slogans.  It is clear that in the modern world there is no faith in advertisements, but when you buy, you hope at least half of what they promise.  In the case of the file this, alas, does not happen.  Even if you rub her heels for five minutes, they still remain rough and the next day again need care. </p><p>  The use of the classic Singer metal file gives completely different results.  After 30 seconds of working with this tool on slightly steamed legs, the result is pleasant and more durable.  Of course, the heels will not always remain smooth, but you need to update the result only once a month, and not every day. </p>

    <h2>  Weight </h2><p>  There will be no winner.  Almost all of the reviews received by the Scholl roller file insist on low weight, if you do not take into account the batteries.  Indeed, those who held this baby in their hands can note that, despite the rather powerful engine, the machine is not so heavy. </p><p>  So, in this battle between Singer and Scholl, there will definitely not be a winner, since there is already a question of personal preferences and the amount of personal cosmetic bag and bag.  By the way, the weight, according to reviews of the Scholl file, is about 23 grams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scholl roller file price reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/1878311.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Practicality </h2><p>  What else, regarding the Scholl roller file, the reviews are not silent, so it is about its convenience.  In order to put your heels in order, there is no need to steal the legs.  Everything is done dry and, according to the manufacturer, pretty quickly.  And everything seems to be fine, but an elegantly made video (you can‚Äôt call it a button) for inclusion often plays a cruel joke, since when you actively use this gadget it is too easy to turn it off. </p><p>  If we talk about practicality, then in a house where there are small children, mothers inspire beauty in moments when the child is sleeping.  The most annoying thing is that only in the photo the Scholl file is quiet. </p><p>  Moreover, this file, unfortunately, is absolutely unsuitable for removing old corns or for working with legs that have not seen salon pedicures for a long time.  Despite the reviews and the price, the Scholl roller file is just a way to polish the heels and feet.  This is a tool for maintaining the condition of the legs until the next trip to the pedicure master.  So for those who do pedicures on their own with a Singer-type nail file, with which we all compare, Scholl is not an option.  She will remove only the upper thin coating. </p><p>  If we talk about the file from the hardware store, then working with it is somewhat more difficult, since the legs must be steamed before that.  Not everyone has the time and opportunity to do pedicures for a long time. </p><p>  Of course, everyone knows where to buy the Scholl roller file at the best price - on the Internet.  But it is important to be careful and purchase only the original product.  Otherwise, even on the pedicure legs there will be no result. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scholl file Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/1878314.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tool care </h2><p>  Like any personal care product, that Scholl and Singer need care after the procedure.  If we talk about the latter - you just need to remove the abrasive part, rinse under running water and all. </p><p>  With Scholl, the situation is not much different, except that the care lasts a little longer.  First, the roller must be carefully removed and rinsed under running water.  After it should dry separately from the device itself.  And only in a completely dry state should the roller return to its place. </p><p>  You can understand all these precautions.  Like it or not, the fact that the device has no wires does not make it non-electric.  Of course, it will not shock you, but if water gets inside, the contacts and boards may oxidize.  Then the file can only be sent to the trash. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scholl roller file reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1878842.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This is not to say which is better: old foot care methods or more modern devices.  At the Scholl file, the price bites, and at the Singer, the laboriousness and the large amount of time spent when performing a pedicure. </p><p>  The Scholl electric saw is convenient to use.  It does not slip in the hand and does not take up much space on a shelf or in a purse.  One of her rollers is enough for a rather long period, while the result from her work is a maximum of a week. </p><p>  In any case, whatever method of foot care you prefer, remember that it is always important to use moisturizers, wear comfortable shoes, and regularly indulge yourself with trips to the beauty salon. </p>
