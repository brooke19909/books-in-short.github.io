He was born in the small Ural town of Lower Sergi, located in the Sverdlovsk region.  The town is small, but very beautiful and picturesque.  Locals even call it "Ural Switzerland."

As he himself admits, he could not keep up, so as not to disgrace his parents.  Favorite subjects were history and literature.  The class teacher Nina Vasilievna Malinina played a big role in his life, it was she who convinced him to go to Moscow State University, which was hard to imagine for the residents of this small town, where they tried to study at the Polytechnic Institute or, at best, at the Ural University in Sverdlovsk.

The remaining places were distributed among all the others.  As a result, the so-called interns were enrolled with triples, and ordinary students had to score 19 points out of 20.

    <p>  Her first congress was held in Ryazan in 1995.  Only 80 scientists came to the first congress, after 12 years there were already more than 700 of them, from all corners of the globe. </p><p>  For 7 months, Tishkov was Minister for Nationalities.  But when he left this service, he was only happy because the work did not bring pleasure, was not to his liking.  But it came to the realization that few in the political elite can imagine how to manage a multi-ethnic and multinational country in the modern conditions of democracy and liberalization. </p><p>  The first serious ethnic conflicts had already occurred, Russia was seriously threatened by separatism, Tishkov notes at that time.  Then he decided to focus on early warning of conflicts.  As a result, in 1994, a network of ethnological monitoring was created.  By the way, this term is still not found in foreign science. </p><p>  The project was entirely led by Russian scientists, its results were used by authorities and the expert community. </p>
