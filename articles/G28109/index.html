    <p>  In general, the procedure of interest to us can be conditionally divided into several stages. </p><p>  Stage number 1.  Choosing the right banking institution.  When a business owner begins to think about where <span>to open a current account,</span> he is primarily interested in reliable and financially stable organizations.  The second most important criterion is the cost of service.  If the city has at least two representative offices of different banks, you can be sure that the cost of the same service will be different for them.  In this case, the prominence of a financial institution in the market is of particular importance.  After all, the more famous and larger it is, the more expensive the service will be.  In addition, the following points should be considered: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="opening an account of an individual entrepreneur" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/69220.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ the level of development of the branch network - it is important in the event that in the course of its activity it is necessary to carry out settlements with counterparties located in other regions; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a bank in which business partners are serviced - using the services of the same financial institution allows for high settlement rates and a minimum fee for various operations. </p><p>  As for location, this is the least significant criterion.  The development of systems such as "Client-Bank" makes it possible to carry out banking operations without visiting a branch (branch).  Such systems are also interesting in that they are cheaper to use than in the case of personal trips to a serving financial institution. </p><p>  Stage No. 2 - direct opening of an individual entrepreneur's account with a bank.  In this case, IP is required to provide certain documents.  These include letters from statistics (with codes), a certificate of registration (issued by the tax authority), a certificate of state registration.  It is necessary to submit both the original and copies of the listed papers. </p><p>  Also, opening an account of an <span>individual entrepreneur</span> involves issuing a card with specimen signatures.  All other documents the banking institution will provide completely free.  Currently, authentication can be carried out either in the presence of a notary or by the bank manager.  The second, of course, is very convenient for the client.  Then the parties sign a service agreement, and we can assume that the main goal has been achieved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to open a current account" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/69218.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  However, the businessman should remember that opening an account of an individual entrepreneur in a bank implies a notification of this event to the tax inspectorate, Social Fund.  Insurance and Pension Fund.  This, incidentally, is the third stage.  There is no need to personally visit all of the listed organizations, as you can use the mail services.  Do not think that the notification of tax and other services is optional.  Rather, the opposite: the law clearly states that each businessman is given exactly 7 days for this. </p><p>  It would be naive to believe that opening an individual entrepreneur account in a bank would go unnoticed by the Federal Tax Service.  The fact is that financial organizations (banks) independently transfer to the latter all the necessary information.  Therefore, try to meet the week allotted by law. </p>
