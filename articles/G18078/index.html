  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Submarine "Tula": facts, history, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Tula submarine (project 667BDRM) is an atomic missile cruiser, in NATO terminology called Delta-IV.  She belongs to the project "Dolphin" and is a representative of the second generation of submarines.  Despite the fact that the release of boats began in 1975, they serve and are ready to compete with more modern submarines to this day. </p><h2>  Dolphin Project </h2><p>  The Soviet Dolphin project, of which the Tula missile submarine cruiser is a part, was launched in 1975.  In the future, the development of "Dolphin" were used to create the largest submarine in the world - the "Shark" project. </p><p>  All boats of the Dolphin project have an increased, in comparison with their predecessors, height of the rocket mine fencing and an elongated bow and stern hull.  Underwater launch of missiles in boats of this type can be carried out at a depth of up to 55 meters. </p><h2>  Military purpose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="armyman.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moored submarine Tula" class="if uuid-2760430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760430.jpg"></div><p>  The nuclear submarine Tula, like other cruisers of its type, regularly participates in campaigns and exercises.  Typically, missile training launches take place in the Barents Sea.  The target of the defeat is located at a special training ground in Kamchatka. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Peaceful application </h2><p>  The submarine "Tula" can also serve for peaceful purposes.  In 1998 and 2006, near-Earth satellites were launched from the sides of boats belonging to class 667BDRM.  The first launch was the first in the world to launch a satellite from an underwater position.  Currently, work is underway to create a marine launch vehicle with an increased allowable load mass. </p><h2>  Representatives </h2><p>  The Tula submarine, which received the tactical number K-114, is far from the only representative of the 667BDRM class.  Together with her, the boats Verkhoturye, Yekaterinburg, Moscow Region (converted into a carrier of small submarines), Bryansk, Karelia, and Novomoskovsk were launched. </p><h2>  Submarine construction </h2><p>  The submarine Tula was built in 1987.  She became the fourth boat, designed by project 667BDRM, which was implemented from 1984 to 1992. </p><p>  The project was developed by the Rubin Design Bureau under the guidance of General Designer S. N. Kovalev.  When developing the project, the latest technologies in the field of control and detection systems and weapons were applied.  Technologies for reducing hydroacoustic noise have gained widespread use; new insulating and sound-absorbing materials and devices have been applied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="defence.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Submarine Tula" class="if uuid-2760434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760434.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of February 1984, the future Tula was laid, and a year later it was added to the list of ships of the Russian Navy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ship was launched and a test launch of missiles was made in 1987.  Then the act of acceptance of the ship was signed, the first solemn raising of the flag took place. </p><h2>  The appearance of the name </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tula.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula delegation congratulates Tula on the completion of repairs" class="if uuid-2760447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760447.jpg"></div><p>  The cruiser received its name only in August 1995, before that it had only a code designation.  This happened after the signing of an agreement on patronage of the administration of the city of Tula over the cruiser. </p><h2>  The crew and command of "Tula" </h2><p>  November 5, 1987 declared the birthday of the submarine - it was then that the flag of the Navy was raised in a festive atmosphere.  The first captain of "Tula" was the captain of the 2nd rank (later - rear admiral) V. A. Handobin.  Second Admiral O.A. Tregubov became the commander of the second crew. </p><p>  This class of submarines was originally equipped with two crews.  This was done so that the crews could succeed each other during retraining and vacations.  To date, the commander of the submarine is <span>Captain 1st Rank</span> A. A. Khramov. </p><h2>  First upgrade </h2><div class="photo" data-original="valerikon01.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Blue ballistic missiles" class="if uuid-2760449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760449.jpg"></div><p>  In 2000, Tula arrived in Severodvinsk, at the Zvezdochka plant, for repairs and refurbishment.  Repair was completed by 2006.  The change in the Tula submarine in the photo is almost imperceptible: the first modernization mainly concerned internal technical equipment.  Detection and nuclear safety systems have been modified.  The submarine was also equipped with a Sineva ballistic missile launcher. </p><h2>  Second upgrade </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.korabli.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula comes out from the last repair" class="if uuid-2760439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760439.jpg"></div><p>  In 2014, the boat returned to Zvezdochka again to undergo a scheduled repair and extend its service life.  This time, the repair took only three years.  There was a scandal: in December 2017, the press secretary of the plant announced that the boat repair would be delayed due to lack of funding and the supply of defective equipment, but the problems were resolved, and the cruiser was sent to the place of service on time. </p><h2>  The role of the submarine in the modern fleet </h2><p>  According to information for 2018, boats of project 667BDRM represent the main marine nuclear power of Russia.  Despite the fact that they have been serving since the mid-70s, it is too early to write off boats in a museum or scrap.  They are constantly refitted and modernized at the plant in Severodvinsk, regularly re-equipped and undergo repairs.  All boats of this class are part of the 31st division of the Northern Fleet and are deployed in Yagelnaya Bay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tula.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula delegation congratulates Tula on the completion of repairs" class="if uuid-2760433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2760433.jpg"></div><p>  In 2012, the director of the Zvyozdochka plant announced plans for the technical restoration of Tula-class submarines and an extension of their service life by another 10 years.  Soon all of them were equipped with the Sineva combat missile system.  Thanks to this, the boat service was extended until 2025-2030. </p><p>  Despite the full combat effectiveness and modern technical equipment, these submarines are gradually being replaced by more modern Borey class. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  In November 2008, Russian President Dmitry A. Medvedev awarded the Order of Courage to Tula Commander Stepan Kelbas.  The award was awarded after successful training firing at maximum range from underwater. </p><p>  Captain Sergei Zabolotny, commander of the Tula missile warhead, became a holder of the Order of Military Merit </p><p>  Several commanders of the Tula underwater armchair have Ushakov‚Äôs medals for various achievements in service. </p>
