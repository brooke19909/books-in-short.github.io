  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Child allowance up to 16 years</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In accordance with the current law, one of the parents living in the Russian Federation is entitled to receive the state monthly allowance for each child under 16 years of age.  In cases stipulated by international agreements, citizens under the territory of a foreign state receive benefits up to 16 years old, but at the same time they must either perform military service under a contract or be civilian personnel of military units. <br><br>  Adoptors, guardians, trustees and even stateless foreigners, that is, refugees, if they live in Russia, also have the right to receive child allowance for each child.  If the child has reached 16 years of age, but continues to study at a general educational institution, the period for receiving benefits is extended to 18 years, but no more. <br><br>  But if the children of citizens of the Russian Federation are on state support or the parents are <span>deprived of the right</span> to raise their child, then a child allowance of up to 16 years old is not paid to them.  Deprived of this right are parents who have left permanently to live abroad. </p><p>  Of course, the amount of state payments for children is differentiated, it depends on the number of children in the family. <br><br>  Although every resident of Russia has the right to receive state <span>allowance for children,</span> not everyone can use this right.  Families with an average per capita income above the subsistence level do not receive such child allowance for children under 16 years of age in accordance with Russian law.  To determine whether you belong to this category of citizens, help in the bodies of social protection.  By contacting the OSZN at the place of residence with a statement and indicating income information for the last 3 months, you can find out the average per capita income of the family.  This value is determined as follows: the total amount of family income is divided into three months and the number of family members. <br><br>  Parents who are entitled to child benefits up to 16 years old, along with the application must bring: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - A copy of the birth certificate of each child; </p><p>  - a certificate that the child and parents live together; </p><p>  - a certificate from the child‚Äôs place of study if he is 16 years old; </p><p>  - passports of parents and children over 16 years old; </p><p>  - extract of the last place of work from the parents' work books. <br><br>  Please note that an income statement is not required. <br><br>  If you are bothering about the allowance for a child under guardianship, then you must additionally submit: </p><p>  - extract from the decision to establish <span>custody</span> or guardianship of the <span>child</span> ; </p><p>  - a certificate from the educational authorities that you do not receive any cash payments for the maintenance of this child. </p><p>  In addition, you need to indicate the number of the personal account opened in the Sberbank branch, where the monthly allowance up to 16 years will be transferred. <br><br>  A separate category of citizens of the Russian Federation receives an increased amount of benefits.  These include: </p><p>  - single mothers.  They increase the amount of benefits by 100%; </p><p>  - wives whose husbands serve on conscription.  They benefit increased by 50%.  The increased allowance for a child of a military serviceman is paid regardless of whether the marriage is registered between parents or whether they are divorced or not scheduled at all.  It is enough that the soldier recognizes the child and confirms this documented; </p><p>  - children whose parents or one of them pays alimony or in other cases stipulated by law.  This allowance is increased by 50%, and the basis for this is a court decision to recover from parents or one of them alimony. <br><br>  For social support of families of minors in various regions of the Russian Federation, allowances for the maintenance of children under 16 can be increased by additional targeted assistance.  For example, the Moscow government pays monthly additional <span>child allowance for children</span> under 16 years of age to <span>large families</span> with three or more children, single mothers, children of military personnel who are conscripted, and families where both parents are disabled and have a child up to one and a half years old. </p>
