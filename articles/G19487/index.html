    <h2>  Device niche </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 616 is focused on youth.  This is clearly indicated by the price of the smartphone, its design and technical parameters.  A device with a diagonal of 5 inches and an 8-core CPU is best suited for the most demanding users, which, in essence, are young people under the age of 25 years.  Moreover, their financial capabilities are very modest.  Hence the price of the device at $ 200.  Of course, there are certain drawbacks to this gadget, but all of them are offset by the low cost and technical parameters of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  This smart phone belongs to the economy class solutions.  As a result, the delivery package is equivalent to HTC Desire 616. The case, stereo headset, protective film and memory card are not included in it.  They will have to be bought separately for an additional fee.  The smartphone case is made of plastic, and it will be difficult to maintain it in its original condition without a case.  The situation is similar with the front panel (it is also made of plastic), and for its safety it will be necessary to purchase an additional protective film.  Without a stereo headset, the <span>radio</span> will not work on this device <span>: headphones</span> play the role of an antenna.  A memory card can significantly increase the amount of internal memory of the gadget.  The rest of the delivery list of this device is as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Smartphone with 2000 mAh battery. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Interface cord. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li><li>  Detailed and fully Russified user manual. </li></ul>

    <h2>  <span>Appearance</span> and controls </h2><p>  The case of this device is made of plastic.  There are three color versions: gray, black and white.  The first two versions are universal.  Smartphone HTC Desire 616 White most will appeal to the weak half of humanity.  In this design, he will emphasize the individuality of each woman. </p><p>  The front panel of the gadget is protected by a plastic panel, behind which a 5-inch display is hidden.  Below it is the manufacturer‚Äôs logo.  A typical <span>touchpad device</span> control is located at the bottom of the display.  At the top of the screen are the earpiece hidden behind a stylish grill, a proximity sensor hole and a <span>front camera.</span>  There are no controls or communication ports on the left side of HTC Desire 616. Overview <strong> </strong>  its right side indicates the presence of a volume swing and a device lock button.  The microUSB port is located on the bottom edge of the phone, and the audio port is on the top edge.  But on the back cover there is a loud speaker (its sound quality is not satisfactory), the main camera and a single LED backlight for it.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo is also located here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Processor solution </h2><p>  The processor is one of the main advantages of HTC Desire 616 Dual sim.  Reviews of the real owners of this device indicate this feature of it.  More specifically, the smartphone is based on MT6592.  It consists of 8 computing modules based on the Cortex A7 processor architecture, each of which can accelerate to 1.7 GHz in peak computing mode.  This chip is manufactured according to the 28 nm manufacturing process. </p><p>  The computing power of this CPU is quite enough even to solve the most demanding tasks.  For example, ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù or ‚ÄúReal Racing 3‚Äù on it will go exactly without problems.  But it‚Äôs not worth talking about all the other tasks: he will certainly cope with everything.  Also, it should be noted that the existing applications cannot fully load this processor.  Most of the software is optimized for 4 computing threads.  And in this processor there can be 8. Because of what, it will not be possible to use its capabilities to the maximum.  This CPU is 32 bit.  As a result, the upcoming upgrade to 64 bits will lead to the fact that new software on this device will not start. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget graphics </h2><p>  One of the main advantages is the screen in HTC Desire 616. The display has a resolution of 720x1280, that is, the picture on it is displayed in the format ‚ÄúHdi‚Äù.  At the same time, its diagonal is quite solid at the moment 5 inches.  It is based on the TFT matrix, and this is its main drawback.  As a result, the viewing angles are quite small, with a significant deviation the image is distorted.  The touchpad of this gadget is designed for 5 touches.  The display matrix itself is capable of displaying over 16 million different color shades. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The graphics adapter in HTC Desire 616 is pretty good in both performance and energy efficiency. Overview <strong> </strong>  The device‚Äôs technical specifications indicate the presence of a Mali 450MP4.  This video accelerator consists of 4 modules and operates at a <span>clock frequency</span> of 700 MHz.  Such computing capabilities are more than enough to solve any problem on this device. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 616 is equipped with a pretty good main camera.  It is based on a 8 megapixel sensor.  It also implements optical zoom and an autofocus system.  A single LED flash allows you to get a photo of mediocre quality in the dark.  The images obtained using this camera themselves are not entirely ideal.  With panoramic shooting, this is not critical, but when you try to photograph small text, it can be a serious obstacle, and the picture will be blurry.  As many experts note, in reality, the camera‚Äôs sensor in this phone is based on a 5 megapixel sensor, and the claimed 8 megapixels are obtained by digital interpolation.  Hence the corresponding level of photo quality. </p><p>  The video camera records in the format of 1080 r or with a resolution of 1080x1920.  That is, the quality of the video will be ‚Äúfull HD.‚Äù  At the same time, the maximum refresh rate of frames per second will be 30. A more modest 2 megapixel sensor is at the heart of the device‚Äôs front camera.  What is clearly not enough to get high-quality photos, but this is not required from her.  The main purpose of the front camera is video calls and selfies.  She does an excellent job with these two tasks. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is difficult to understand what the developers were guided by when choosing the number of gigabytes in RAM and in the internal drive.  If in the first case 1 GB of RAM does not limit the functionality of the device, then 4 GB of internal storage is clearly not enough for the owner to fully reveal the potential of this smart phone.  Moreover, about 2 GB of them are occupied by preinstalled software, and only the rest of the user can use to <span>install programs</span> and store personal information. </p><p>  The price of HTC Desire 616 at $ 200 compensates to some extent for the lack of memory.  You can also optionally purchase a flash card with a capacity of 32 GB.  The slot necessary for its installation is in this device.  That will solve the problem of lack of space on the built-in drive.  Another way to solve this problem is to use cloud services.  In this case, even if the smartphone breaks down, the most important information will be saved. </p><h2>  Battery features </h2><p>  The HTC Desire 616 is equipped with a 2000 mAh battery.  The diagonal of the display of this gadget is 5 inches, and the processor consists of 8 cores.  As a result, one charge of the battery with an average load is enough for 1-2 days.  If its resource is saved as much as possible, then you can count on 3 days of battery life.  But if you play the most demanding toys on your smartphone without recharging (as an example, ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù), the indicated value will be reduced to 4-5 hours.  And there's nothing to be done about it, charging the battery will melt just before our eyes. </p>

    <h2>  Communication kit </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 616 Dual sim is equipped with an impressive set of wired and wireless interfaces.  It includes the following: </p><ul><li>  The device has 2 slots for installing SIM cards.  In the first of them you can install a SIM card of standard sizes, and in the second - microsymbol.  The device has only one radio module, the cards work in alternate switching mode.  During a conversation on one of them, the second is out of range.  In order not to miss an important call, you have to properly reconfigure the call forwarding system.  The first SIM card allows you to work in cellular networks of the 2nd and 3rd generations.  As a result, the maximum data transfer rate in this case can be up to 20 Mbps.  But the second SIM card can only function in the GSM network, and <span>the data transfer rate</span> in this case can reach only a few hundred kilobits at best.  Accordingly, in the first situation, you can upload files of any size, but in the second you can only view simple Internet portals or communicate on social networks. </li><li>  Another important wireless way to get information is wifi.  In this case, the speed will increase to 100 Mbps.  This allows, as in the case of 1 SIM card, to upload information to a smartphone in any volume.  At the same time, even downloading a movie in good quality will take a matter of minutes.  Everything else will also be downloaded without problems (online video, serious Internet resources and large-sized toys). </li><li>  Also in the device there is a bluetooth transmitter.  This wireless technology is indispensable in cases where you need to connect to your smartphone, for example, wireless headphones with a microphone or share a small file with a similar gadget. </li><li>  The navigation subsystem in this device is implemented on the basis of GPS and A-GPS technologies.  In the first case, the location of the device is determined using the international satellite navigation system.  And in the second, the nearest mobile communication towers are used.  In both the first and second situations, you may need an Internet connection.  In any case, it is not so difficult to turn this 5-inch device into a full-fledged GPS navigator. </li><li>  Also, the device has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting an external wired speaker system. </li><li>  The last important wired interface is microUSB.  It allows you to connect to a PC or charge the battery. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 616 phone" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/820360.jpg" width="332"></div></h2><h2>  Software </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù with serial version 4.2 acts as the OS in HTC Desire 616. The firmware is supplemented by the proprietary shell Sense 5.5 from HTC.  All this without any problems allows you to run any software on this unit.  And the shell allows you to customize the device interface to the needs of the user in a matter of minutes.  Otherwise, the set of system software is typical for this version of the OS: social network clients, system mini-applications, and a set of software from Google. </p><h2>  Smartphone owners </h2><p>  A fairly balanced entry-level solution is the HTC Desire 616 Dual sim.  Reviews provide an excellent combination of price and hardware resources.  Certain complaints are only caused by the main camera, the autonomy of the smart phone and the amount of installed memory. </p><p>  In the first case, the photos correspond to the declared 8 megapixels, but you can not expect their perfect quality in the entry-level gadget.  Regarding autonomy, it can be noted that one certainly does not have to expect more from a smartphone with such a diagonal and a similar CPU.  Of course, it was possible to install a more capacious battery, but this solution would adversely affect the mass and dimensions of the device. </p><p>  The amount of RAM and the capacity of the built-in drive correspond to the minimum requirements that provide a normal level of performance, and you certainly can not expect more from a budget gadget.  Moreover, all these disadvantages are offset by the cost of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Initially, the price of HTC Desire 616 was $ 350.  At the time of the release of the device (July 2014), it was a normal price.  Now this smartphone can be purchased for $ 200.  Given the diagonal of the device‚Äôs display (5 inches) and a very productive processor (8 cores at 1.7 GHz), an excellent combination of price and technical capabilities is obtained. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  An excellent device both in terms of price and in terms of technical specifications is the HTC Desire 616 Dual sim smartphone.  Reviews on this once again indicate.  Buying a phone with a diagonal of 5 inches and an 8-core CPU for $ 200 is very difficult.  Therefore, it is not easy to find an analogue to this gadget in this price niche.  So it turns out that from the position of price and technical specifications, the considered device has practically no competitors. </p>
