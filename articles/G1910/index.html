    <h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The compact modern ten-story building of the hotel complex contains 52 comfortable rooms.  Guest rooms are not empty, tourists rather smartly book them on specialized sites of travel agencies.  And this is not surprising: a good vacation at an economical price is always in demand. </p><p>  Just 800 meters from the hotel are the largest shopping center Nha Trang in the city, where you can buy everything;  as well as the largest entertainment center in Southeast Asia, built by Australian designers, called the Sailing Club.  During the day, the Sailing Club operates in the style of a lounge beach, and in the evening and at night as a hybrid of an exotic restaurant and dance floor. </p><p>  Right next to the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * hotel (this photo displays), there is a highway and bus number 4 is located. Frequency of flights is a quarter of an hour.  From here you can get to the center of Nha Trang, as well as to the funicular on about.  Winperl.  The bus is quite comfortable, it is equipped with air conditioning.  However, it should be noted that the route runs until 18-00.  However, you can return to the hotel at a later time by taxi.  But in this case, trips from Nha Trang Center to the hotel will cost tourists more: about 100-120 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Communication with staff and not only </h2><p>  The hotel staff is helpful and tidy.  They clean well and efficiently daily, even without a tip.  In order to change the towels in the room, they should be left on the floor.  But the <span>language barrier is</span> relevant: the hotel does not understand Russian. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can contact the administrator at the reception in English (there are three of them, and they work during the day).  But the need for additional services for guests may arise during the day.  How to be then? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The communication of people who do not know the Vietnamese language requires additional comment.  After all, the hotel employee must first correctly interpret the request of the tourist. </p><p>  Resourceful tourists found a way out.  Useful Google translator on a tablet from Russian to Vietnamese.  The benefit of Wi-Fi works well throughout the hotel. </p><p>  The experience of tourists in their communication with taxi drivers taking them to the sights is also valuable.  To do this, just buy a map of Nha Trang with the sights on it and show the destination.  It works! </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  New arrivals are accommodated in the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * quickly enough, and it is convenient.  The rooms in it are different: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - superior (spacious, comfortable, large bathroom with bathtub, balcony, but expensive); </p><p>  - family (designed for a family of 3 people, apartments with a balcony), compact (a room of 15 square meters, a small corridor, a compact bathroom with a bathtub); </p><p>  - economy with no windows (in the bathroom - shower; the room is good for tourists who appear in the hotel only for sleep and breakfast, by the way it is quite spacious.). </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, it is still advisable to choose a temporary home with a balcony for yourself.  At the same time, the surcharge at the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * is very small and appropriate.  It is much more pleasant to see the picturesque coast from your home, every morning to admire the sunrise (the hotel windows face the east side), enjoy the sound of the sea. </p><h2>  Situation </h2><p>  Almost all the reviews of the hotel guests are marked by a good repair in the rooms.  A moderate European style is maintained with a predominance of pastel and white colors.  Gorgeous panoramic windows (of course, in the rooms where they are available).  Guest rooms are presentable, equipped with good new furniture and household appliances.  Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * guests are offered good wood furniture: a wardrobe, a spacious modern double bed, armchairs, chairs, a small dining table, a coffee table, bedside tables.  Also in each room there is a safe (free), blackout (in English style) curtains, table lamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 nha trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082183.jpg" width="600"></div>

The air conditioner and a small refrigerator, which works properly, save from the heat (its hotel staff daily fills with two half-liter bottles of water for free).  The TV is tuned to one (first) Russian channel.  The electric kettle in the room is also not forgotten by the staff (daily, 4 tea and coffee bags are placed next to it for free).  The room also has a hairdryer. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is good on site and free. </p><h2>  Food in the restaurant </h2><p>  Ocean View Hotel Restaurant is located on the tenth floor and has a chic design.  From its windows opens a picturesque seascape.  Dining at the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * (Vietnam) is multivariate: guesthouse, half board, breakfast only.  The restaurant's menu includes dishes of European, Vietnamese and Oriental cuisine. </p><p>  Moreover, judging by the reviews, most hotel guests choose the food option only with a daily breakfast.  The rest of the day they prefer to visit restaurants, shops, markets, attractions, without being tied to three meals a day hotel (guesthouse). </p><h2>  About breakfast </h2><p>  Vietnamese cuisine is famous for its first courses.  Fairy Bay Hotel 3's restaurant menu features Lau Soup, prepared with seafood and herbs in literally ten minutes.  Crab soup with mushrooms and tomato puree soup with crackers are also good.  Remarkable mushroom soup up from eel.  But the most famous one that you should definitely try is pho soup (fo-hai - with fish and seafood, fo-ha - with chicken, fo-bo - with beef.) </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082164.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The breakfast menu includes scrambled eggs, french fries, meatballs, cold cuts, sausages, sausages, biscuit rolls, pancakes.  Feature of nutrition in Vietnam is fruit abundance. </p><p>  Both near the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * <span>(Nha Trang, Vietnam),</span> and in the city center there are many inexpensive restaurants and cafes where you can eat delicious and profitable exotic sea dishes baked on a spit of crocodiles, grasshoppers.  The portions in them are unusually large (for example, one salad is more than enough for two Europeans).  You can, of course, have dinner in the hotel restaurant, while the surcharge for half board is approximately 300 rubles.  in a day. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the <span>full board</span> in Fairy Bay book a relatively small number of guests.  Most tourists eat in urban cafes. </p><h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  The beach, which represents the hotel Fairy Bay Hotel 3 *, is in fact public.  To get to it, hotel guests just cross the road.  It is relatively small, visually - a small strip of sand on the coast.  The bottom in its water area is rocky. </p><p>  However, the sea, according to hotel guests, is cleaner than on the beaches in the city center.  And although initially most tourists are going to sunbathe on commercial beaches, but for the most part they go to the hotel. </p><p>  It is compact, on it there are 16 sun loungers and umbrellas allocated by the hotel.  Near the beach there are many <span>cafes, restaurants</span> with affordable price tags.  The beach itself is open until 17-00. </p><p>  Those who wish to relax in comfort can visit <span>Nha Trang Beach,</span> which is awarded the blue flag.  It is only 1 km away from the hotel. </p><h2>  Near resort infrastructure </h2><p>  Near the hotel within walking distance are attractions: Thap Ba Tower, Hong Chong Rock Rock Garden.  To the left of the hotel, a hundred meters away, there is a wonderful fish restaurant.  Two blocks away is a fairly large market.  It‚Äôs only ten minutes to go to him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel fairy bay hotel 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082166.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the way to the market, there is the BBQ Cafe, which is praised by hotel guests.  If you go from here to the sea, then after twenty minutes you can go to the fishing mini-market, where the freshest outlandish seafood is sold right in the basins. </p><p>  Having bought seafood here for a small price, you can always agree with the owners of the cafe to prepare them.  If you find yourself on the market after 19-00, then buy the goods for 30% of the cost (the fishermen do not have refrigerators, and therefore they seek to sell their goods.) </p><p>  By the way, if you wish, seafood cooked in a cafe will be packed for you to bring to the hotel. </p><p>  In the center of Nha Trang, along Tran Phu Street, there are many good restaurants.  The best of these is the Booze Cruise Bar &amp; Grill.  However, besides him, the Indian restaurant "Bombay", vegetarian restaurant Bo De, Italian restaurant Carlos, Mexican bar El CoyoteMexican Resto Bar, as well as Gia - Vietnamese Restaurant - the best Vietnamese restaurant in the city, are of gastronomic interest. </p><p>  One of the oldest clubs in Nha Trang is the Red Apple, which is what Western publications recommend for visiting tourists.  A good alternative to him would be the newer modern club Michelle.  Divers traditionally hang out at Krazy Kim Bar. </p><p>  Fans of strong drinks and incendiary discos visit the Sailing Club. </p><h2>  Safety for tourists in the city </h2><p>  According to guest reviews, there is no theft at all in the hotel itself.  However, it may be faced by women who went out into the street with a handbag. </p><p>  This is a harsh reality!  Women in Vietnam do not wear handbags.  Sometimes a fleeing bully can grab them, but it's not so bad.  There were times when a motorcyclist grabbed a handbag and a woman was pulled along the asphalt behind a bike!  This kind of crime, especially in relation to tourists, is booming here. </p><p>  Therefore, we strongly recommend that ladies in Vietnam go out without a handbag. </p><h2>  Excursions.  Dalat </h2><p>  The majority of guests buy excursions at the reception of Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * <span>(Vietnam).</span>  <span>Responses of</span> tourists are positive in relation to visiting the city of Dalat, excursions to the Yangbey waterfall, to the islands, fishing, to Zoklet beach (the best beach in Vietnam). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 nha trang vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082158.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An excursion to the mountain Dalat is marked by a show of coffee plantations, a visit to industrial wine cellars.  This guarantees tasters a lot of sensations and impressions from natural expensive and really high-quality products.  However, oddly enough, coffee in Dalat is more expensive than in Nha Trang coffee shops.  Therefore, during the tour it is not worth buying. </p><h2>  Sailing to the islands </h2><p>  Beach lovers from the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) prefer to take excursions to the exotic South and North islands.  The local virgin nature surprises with its richness and exoticism: white sandy beaches, emerald water, waterfalls with natural mineral pools.  In addition to the natural beauties, the organization of these excursions, a rich diet, including brought restaurant dishes, fruits, juices, alcoholic drinks, is impressive. </p><h2>  Sailing Club (Winperl) </h2><p>  Nearly all visitors to the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * visit the water park of attractions and at the same time Winperl Island, the real pearl of Vietnam.  Their reviews indicate a significant tourist attraction of the dolphin show (takes place at 12-30, at 15-30) and the fountain show (at 18-30 and 19-30). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 vietnam reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082190.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, tourists recall their impressions of the cableway, marine aquarium, temple complex.  Guests are carried on electric cars. </p><p>  Sports enthusiasts have the opportunity here, in comfortable exotic conditions, to play mini-golf and tennis. </p><p>  Due to the time differences between the main shows, tourists visit Winperl twice.  The cost of one ticket is not at all high, it is only 510 thousand dongs.  Indeed, to admire the dolphin show, tourists should come in the morning, and in order to enjoy the fountain show, you should go in the evening.  And you will have to return to the hotel by taxi, because the bus route No. 4 at this time is no longer working. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A modern and comfortable hotel complex is Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang).  Mighty inexpensive three-star service is in demand by tourists who prefer outdoor activities.  The hotel is in demand due to its integration into the resort infrastructure of Nha Trang.  The average guest of the hotel complex is a lover of outdoor activities and a connoisseur of exoticism.  After breakfast, some tourists go to the beach, and the other, by bus and taxi, go on excursions and to the European tourist center of Nha Trang, where there are shops and markets, restaurants, clubs, spas, massage parlors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fairy bay hotel 3 nha trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1082182.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Guests at the Fairy Bay Hotel 3 * (Nha Trang) are usually families without small children.  Indeed, although the hotel is cozy, quiet, comfortable, but it is not equipped with the appropriate infrastructure.  There are no animators, playgrounds, a children's pool.  Therefore, it is recommended that people over 18 years old fly here. </p>
