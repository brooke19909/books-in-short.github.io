    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel complex </h2><p>  One of the main advantages inherent in the Woraburi Resort Spa Karon Beach 4 * hotel is its extremely favorable location for tourists.  Firstly, this place is only 45 minutes from the international airport.  Accordingly, transport links here are very well developed. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity are various interesting sights.  For example, the legendary Chalong Temple - it is only five kilometers away.  Anyway, it’s very picturesque here - there are lots of different interesting places that you should definitely visit.  No wonder this part of the city was recognized as the most beloved among tourists who have ever come here on vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel Room Categories </h2><p>  The complex Woraburi Resort Spa Karon Beach 4 * in total there are six categories of apartments.  All of them differ in cost, design, the availability of certain amenities and, in principle, conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the first and second categories include superior double rooms with one double bed or two separate (offers a view of the pool and the surrounding area).  There is also a deluxe apartment, designed for two guests.  There are rooms of the same category, but only an additional bonus is access to the pool. </p><p>  Still guests have the opportunity to reserve a junior suite or executive suite.  All of these numbers are popular, so I would like to talk about them in more detail and discuss issues of cost and proposed conditions. </p>
