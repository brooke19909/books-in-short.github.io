    <p>  A rangefinder camera is one of the subspecies of photography that uses a rangefinder to capture sharpness.  The latter is a device that is used to measure the distance from the shooter to the desired target.  Everything is extremely simple and clear. </p><p>  Rangefinder cameras have evolved over time: </p><ul><li>  The rangefinder is non-conjugate - with its help, the distance in one window is determined, and the frame looks in another. </li><li>  Rangefinder + viewfinder. </li><li>  Rangefinder connected to the lens. </li><li>  Rangefinder complete with parallax compensator. </li></ul><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  Having figured out what the rangefinders are, let's move on to the essence of the creation and history of this photographic technique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rangefinder cameras appeared in the distant revolutionary 1917.  The first such camera at the time was the product of the company "Kodak".  By the way, at the moment, this company as the founder of rangefinders continues to produce them. </p>

    <p>  In 1925, a new player appeared on the market for such photographic equipment - the Leika company.  A range finder for such devices was provided as an accessory. </p><p>  In 1932, the companies ‚ÄúLeika‚Äù and ‚ÄúKodak‚Äù released new cameras, which became much more compact and more efficient than their predecessors.  The range finder is already starting to combine with the video skater. </p><p>  Since the 1930s  rangefinders are becoming leaders in the camera market.  Only in the 60s of the twentieth century, SLR cameras will begin to displace them from the market. </p><p>  Currently, the Sony camera is the most progressive and high-quality rangefinder, which will suit a wide range of users. </p><p>  When it became clear what a rangefinder is, and what are its prospects in the market, firms began to expand the range of such goods.  Rangefinders were produced in different variations: small, medium and large format.  Since the 1950s, Nikon devices, which have occupied their niche in the photographic market abroad, began to be assigned to small format rangefinder cameras. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  It is time to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of the described devices.  What is a rangefinder?  This is a complex technique that has its positive and negative sides.  Having understood what rangefinders are, you can go to their positive sides. </p>

    <ul><li>  Unlike simple ‚Äúsoapboxes‚Äù, rangefinders have a less noisy shutter.  This allows the photographer not to pay such attention to himself. </li><li>  The rangefinder camera takes photos in motion much better than its competitors due to the short interval of pressing the shutter button. </li><li>  In the viewfinder, the picture does not overlap when shooting. </li><li>  The camera is very compact in contrast to bulky cameras.  In the rangefinder, you can use a folding lens.  This makes it even more compact. </li><li>  The modern rangefinder has a viewfinder.  It shows the frame in full, while the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù viewfinder displays only 90-93% of the necessary information.  In some rangefinders, the field of view is even wider than that of "DSLRs".  This makes it easier to crop the picture. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Unfortunately or fortunately, the disadvantages of rangefinder cameras are no less than the advantages.  Some points are considered negative because photographic equipment is leaping forward.  Much has already been changed technically. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <ul><li>  If the distance from you to the subject is about five meters, then focusing in this case will work poorly.  This is one of the main disadvantages of the rangefinder camera. </li><li>  It is not easy to work with a polarization filter.  He is very specific. </li><li>  It‚Äôs hard to make macro shots. </li><li>  Crop inaccuracy due to parallax is observed. </li><li>  Using the rangefinder, you can take pictures without removing the lens.  This is a typical mistake that is not intentionally corrected by manufacturers.  In SLR cameras, taking pictures with the lid closed is not possible. </li><li>  The rangefinder lens is inferior in characteristics to its direct competitors in the market. </li><li>  It is difficult to work with filters. </li></ul><h2>  Jupiter-9 - a high-quality rangefinder lens </h2><p>  It would be wrong if rangefinder cameras were used without additional accessories.  There are devices that make shooting more productive, high-quality and efficient. </p>

    <p>  The Jupiter-9 rangefinder is a long <span>focal lens that</span> is now used for both SLR and rangefinder cameras. </p><p>  It was originally called the "ZK-85."  This means that Zonnar Krasnogorsky had a <span>focal length</span> of 85 millimeters.  To be more precise, this value was 84.46 millimeters. </p><p>  Rangefinder lens was produced in Krasnogorsk.  Later he was collected in Lytkarino.  It was designed for rangefinder or SLR cameras that had an adapter ring ("Jupiter-9A"). </p><p>  In fact, there are several modifications of the Jupiter-9 device: </p><ul><li>  Rangefinder with mount M39. </li><li>  "Mirror" with mount M39. </li><li>  Nine ‚ÄúJupiter‚Äù with mount ‚ÄúContact‚Äù. </li><li>  "Mirror" with mount M42. </li></ul><h2>  <strong>The difference between rangefinder and mirror / mirrorless technology</strong> </h2><p>  The principle of the rangefinder is different from other cameras.  For example, to obtain maximum sharpness when aiming in a rangefinder camera, you need to rotate the lens ring.  In the "DSLR" this is not required. </p>

    <p>  The company "Watering can" today produces the best rangefinder cameras.  Consider the model "Watering can M9."  This is the best rangefinder camera of our time.  We list only the main advantages of this device: </p><ul><li>  M9 is a compact size camera.  Despite this, it is very practical and comfortable. </li><li>  The camera is smaller than any SLR lens. </li><li>  Great build quality. </li><li>  Simple and clear menu.  The settings are adapted for ordinary amateur photographer and everyone will cope with them. </li><li>  The M9 watering can is compatible even with lenses that were released in the 1950s. </li><li>  Resolution - more than 18 megapixels. </li><li>  No need to use large ISO values. </li></ul><h2>  Well, buy it! </h2><p>  Often, amateur photographers prefer precisely the rangefinder modern digital cameras.  They have the right to do so.  We will only try to briefly explain why you should buy these cameras and why not, starting with the unambiguous option - ‚Äúbuy!‚Äù. </p><ul><li>  Style and charm.  From these cameras, the spirit of history blows.  You will stand out from the rest of the photographers. </li><li>  Ease.  The device is lightweight and convenient.  This will allow you to take it with you wherever you go. </li><li>  The quality of the pictures.  It has been consistently high for a century. </li><li>  Easy operation.  The settings of the camera are very simple and not cause difficulties. </li><li>  Photos on the go.  At high speed, the rangefinder camera can please with its quality. </li><li>  In the modern market of rangefinding equipment, the Sony camera is an excellent choice for the photographer.  This company specializes in similar technology. </li></ul><h2>  Buy?  Well, I do not! </h2><p>  There are points to consider when buying a rangefinder.  And they are with a minus sign: </p><ul><li>  No macro shot.  An amateur will ask: ‚ÄúWhat is this all about?‚Äù  However, we know that without this option it is difficult to imagine a modern full-fledged camera. </li><li>  Inconsistency of price and quality.  It has long been proven that modern SLR cameras are better than modern rangefinder digital cameras.  However, the price of the rangefinder can be at or even higher than the ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù.  For example, for "Watering M9" will have to pay $ 6,500.  Given the growth of the dollar, this is a lot of money. </li><li>  "The trash of history."  It is proved that there are cameras that take photographs much better than rangefinders.  They lost their leadership in the market in the middle of the twentieth century.  From a technical and professional point of view, rangefinders fade into the background, remaining only an expensive toy in the hands of history buffs. </li></ul>
