Garland duralight</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the last decade, room decoration technologies have come to perfection.  This provides great opportunities for designers who can create quite interesting and attractive solutions at a low price.  Now duralight is widely used for these purposes.  What it is?  This is what will be discussed in this article. </p><p>  Lighting equipment is very popular today as the most convenient and efficient way to attract potential customers to various institutions.  However, this is not the only sphere of application of duralight.  They adorn residential buildings, both inside and out.  The backlight in this case is an original composition created from a light cable.  Duralight cord is characterized by bright saturated light and high stability.  But very few people know what a cable is, what it is called correctly and what its appearance is.  By itself, it is characterized by high endurance and flexibility, being at the same time a source of bright light.  By the type of lamps installed, such devices are of two types.  The first LED is economical and practical.  The second type is a tube type, somewhat inferior to the first in operational characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="duralight what is it" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996774.jpg" width="600"></div>

In Russian, the word "duralight" means "hard light."  This value fully characterizes the physical properties of both the light source and the material itself.  The cord is made in the form of a cable from a very flexible plastic, which is covered with a layer of polyvinyl chloride.  The latter serves as a protective coating.  This LED duralight is equipped with a core consisting of small <span>LED lamps.</span>  Thanks to them, it becomes possible to create a wide variety of lighting effects using all representatives of the color palette.  The main feature of LEDs is the economical <span>use of electricity,</span> and this in no way affects the quality of lighting.  The emitted light is very bright, but at the same time soft, it favorably affects the retina. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="duralight LED" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996776.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Types of modern garlands </h2><p>  High consumer demand has allowed manufacturers to increase the range of duralights.  Currently, in stores you can buy two types of garlands: </p><ol><li>  Round duralight (price from 85 rubles per 1 meter) is two- and three-core.  Diameter is about 13 mm.  The garland is covered with a special transparent material that performs a protective function.  The length of the coil is from 50 to 100 meters. </li><li>  Flat LED duralight.  Most often it is called duraflex.  Designed mainly for external use, for example, decoration of facades, signboards, etc. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="duralight Price" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996768.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Duralight: scope </h2><p>  The duralight LED used in fact has become a very worthy alternative to neon illumination with good performance.  Using this <span>type of lighting,</span> you can decorate the interior and exterior of the premises, the facades of various houses and buildings, even enterprises, create advertising signs and billboards.  In addition, with their help it is possible to form various compositions and figures used to attract the attention of people around. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Currently, <span>LED garlands</span> have become quite popular, as they can significantly save on electricity.  Also, their high level of security allows the device to work without supervision and control by humans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cord duralight" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Duralight - what is it and what characteristics does it possess?  This issue has recently become quite relevant.  In order to answer it, you need to understand the operational properties of this device. </p><p>  Street-type lighting equipment in its technical characteristics is always an order of magnitude higher than similar elements intended for indoor use in rooms and houses.  They must operate smoothly regardless of weather conditions and have a high level of safety, in particular, protection against fire.  Such light structures must also withstand human influence, that is, be as stable as possible in case of accidental damage.  Duralight under these conditions fully meets all the necessary requirements.  This material is moisture resistant and well resists shocks, which is of great importance for maintaining the integrity of the cable structure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led duralight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996763.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  Operating modes </h2><p>  Duralight LED has another indisputable advantage, which consists in a large number of different operating modes.  Basically, these data are indicated in the technical specifications.  Each manufactured model can work both continuously and dynamically.  The first way is marked in the documentation as fixing or nonstop.  The second is somewhat more complicated, it has four different modes, the operation of which is provided by a special device - the controller. </p><p>  Light dynamic types: </p><ol><li>  Chasing - a change in the intensity of the glow, allowing you to make spectacular light overflows. </li><li>  Flash - inclusion of a certain number of bulbs. </li><li>  Chameleon - change the color of light. </li><li>  Multichasing - the combination of flicker and color change modes. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garland duralight" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996756.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Modern garland </h2><p>  Dyuralight garland is often used to decorate rooms during the New Year holidays.  However, during its acquisition, it is necessary to study the instructions in detail, since some models are not intended for external use.  Thanks to the use of modern technology during production, garlands have a low level of heat dissipation.  It is this indicator that can significantly reduce the risk of fire. </p><p>  Duralight device - <span>what is it?</span>  <span>This is a</span> garland, which is a fairly rigid tube, but very flexible, which makes its use as convenient as possible.  In the off state, the duralight looks nondescript, but everything changes when it is turned on.  The garland glows very brightly, alternating effects: blinking, transfusion, color change, etc. The average service life is about five years. </p><p>  An important feature of this type of device is that when one bulb fails, the circuit does not stop working. </p><p>  During operation, it is necessary to accurately fulfill some of the nuances: </p><ul><li>  check wire insulation and tube integrity; </li><li>  can not be placed in closed containers; </li><li>  follow the recommended temperature regime exactly. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="round led duralight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/996754.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  The cost of the device "duralight" </h2><p>  The price of this device in comparison with other similar materials is much cheaper.  This is achieved through the use of small-sized electronic components.  And finally, the duralight has an ideal ratio of cost and quality, which is several times higher compared to standard incandescent lamps. </p>
