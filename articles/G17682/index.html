    <p>  Timiryazevsky Park has been conducting its glorious annals since the 16th century, when the village of Semchino, which was part of the estate of such famous families as Shuysky, Prozorovsky and Naryshkins, was located here.  It was with the latter clan, whose representative - Kirill Petrovich - was brought by his grandfather to Peter the Great himself, and the history of the construction of the temple here and the beginning of planting a variety of trees and shrubs is connected.  The future emperor himself, as shown by documents and numerous testimonies of his contemporaries, has repeatedly visited this park and planted several mighty oaks here with his own hand. </p>

    <p>  Already in the XVIII century, the future Timiryazevsky park became part of the estate of Count Razumovsky, who built a small dam on the abna river flowing here.  This made it possible to arrange several magnificent ponds in this area, which most Muscovites know as Academic.  It was under the column that this area began to acquire the features of a classic French park: several paths, terraces, a grotto and a pavilion appeared to review the surrounding nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, the future Timiryazevsky park, a map of which was already formed in basic outline, became the base for the Petrovsky Agricultural Academy.  The project of the building, executed in a somewhat unusual Baroque style for that era, was developed by the notorious architect N. Benoit.  The massif of the park itself was divided into 14 parts, in each of which certain trees were planted and certain experiments were carried out.  The famous scientist Timiryazev, as well as the writer Korolenko, lived here for several years. </p>

    <p>  Today it is difficult to find a better place of rest than Timiryazevsky <span>Park.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> should be grateful to its employees for the fact that, despite all kinds of cataclysms (military, political, economic), they and the leadership of the Agricultural Academy manage to defend it like a small green island in a smoky and choking city.  Muscovites love him for their primeval nature, for the lack of asphalt paths and many signs of civilization.  But here are enclosures with rare birds, you can find pheasants, nightingales, owls, squirrels. </p><p>  Timiryazevsky Park is a great vacation spot for the whole family.  It is easy enough to find a place for a picnic and barbecue.  For a small fee, you can take an exciting boat trip and feed ducks for free.  It can be very difficult to tear children away from unpretentious attractions at numerous playgrounds.  At the same time, every vacationer needs to be as careful as possible in order to prevent a fire. </p>
