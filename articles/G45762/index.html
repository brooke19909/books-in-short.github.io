    <p>  Lermontovo is characterized by the presence of a pleasant and calm relief of the sea day without significant drops, which could make it difficult to enter the water.  Even the children will be absolutely safe, so you can safely let them into the water amuse yourself with soft touches of the waves.  To get to a really great depth, you need to go a considerable distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  It often happens that people come for a long period to rest in Lermontovo.  The private sector has everything necessary to settle here and live comfortably.  The village has an elongated shape, due to its proximity to the sea coast.  The beach area is really large and stretched over 2 kilometers.  The plus is that the offers are so numerous that even during maximum tourist congestion vacant seats still remain, and many who will be happy to take you under their roof. </p><p>  Rest in Lermontovo is truly good and brings a lot of positive emotions.  If you move closer to the city, you can stumble upon the ‚ÄúGolden Coast‚Äù - the beach, which is called one of the best that the Black Sea has.  It spanned more than 10 kilometers.  If you are a true and selfless lover of beach vacations, it is likely that you will be able to find your paradise here. </p><p>  The most famous tourist bases in this sector are The Little Mermaid, a convenient campsite called Kubanets, and also an interesting place, the Mirage. </p>

    <h2>  What is important to consider </h2><p>  Having decided to spend your holidays in Lermontovo without intermediaries, you should know about the features of the local village, where resort lovers are usually located.  When planning a trip, you need to know a couple of details.  If you need a car camping, then it is much better to go to the part of the settlement located closer to the coast.  In this part, the rest in Lermontovo is distinguished by special democracy.  Prices are also more than reasonable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you like comfort and are more inclined to live in a hotel or hotel, here you will have a truly rich choice, because on this coast there are several dozen of these places ready to welcome visitors and accommodate them in their walls. </p>

    <h2>  No need to pay more </h2><p>  There is a direct correlation between the cost and the distance of the item from the beach.  The more you need to go to sea water, the less money you will pay directly for accommodation.  So in this way you can save a certain amount. </p><p>  In addition, another tangible plus can be called the fact that the lights and noise of discos held on the shore will in no way disturb you or disturb sleep at night.  And the service is slightly better. </p><p>  If you prefer accommodation at a recreation center, they are also abundant here.  You can send your child to shift to the camp, which operates in the warm season.  As a rule, in such institutions entertainment and recreational activities are held that can brighten up the holidays of any child. </p><p>  There are hotels with prices per day 400‚Äì2600 rubles. </p>
