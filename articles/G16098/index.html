  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sea Glory Square in St. Petersburg: history and modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Square of Sea Glory in St. Petersburg is located on Vasilyevsky Island, logically completing the composition of Bolshoi Prospect, and goes to the Big Neva.  The development of the island began during the reign of Emperor Peter I: channels are being digged that should become transport arteries, palaces of the nobility are being erected. </p><h2>  Place history </h2><p>  In former times, the <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVasilyevsky Island</span> adjacent to the current area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMarine Glory was called Harbor.  Here, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, it was convenient for ships to moor and unload goods, and it was possible to go further, because in the depths of the Big Neva there was a Galley channel, along which loaded ships went up to the Neva mouth for 10-15 km. </p><p>  In the middle of the XIX century.  for the convenience of cargo turnover between Kronstadt and the capital, a canal was dug in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current Square of Marine Glory, thanks to which more comfortable passenger traffic became possible. </p><p>  But the name Harbor has remained with this urban area so far. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visit-petersburg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Galernaya Harbor in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2732716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2732716.jpg"></div><p>  In 1972, the rebuilt harbor passages received new names related to the maritime theme.  <span>Skipper Channel,</span> Veselnaya and Havanskaya Streets appeared. </p><p>  The site, formerly called Primorskaya and limited to Nalichnaya streets and Bolshoi Prospekt VO, was also renamed.  She received a sonorous name - the Square of Sea Glory to remind of the glory of the domestic fleet.  A memorable event took place on December 29, 1972. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.92698420000001" data-lng="30.2370588" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/6/4/0/7640.png"></div><h2>  Marine Station </h2><p>  The real decoration of the Square of Sea Glory is the building of the Sea Station, built by arch.  V. Sokhin in 1973-1983.  The seven-story building resembles ship sails in shape and is lined with panels that add volume.  The spire of titanium that completes the composition is almost 80 m high and is decorated with the traditional Petersburg finial - a boat. </p><p>  The seaport is designed to accept commercial, freight and passenger ships, it has equipped places for inspection (border or customs), there is a hotel, a conference room, a restaurant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cityguide-spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The building of the Marine Station in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2732697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2732697.jpg"></div><p>  The complex of the Sea Terminal includes 5 berths, their total length is almost a kilometer. </p><p>  Nowadays, the <span>Maritime Station of St. Petersburg</span> meets modern international requirements and is capable of accepting large tonnage vessels; it occupies the 2nd place in the Baltic region in terms of passenger turnover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lenexpo </h2><p>  For five years, from 1963 to 1968, in the south-west of St. Petersburg, on the Square of Sea Glory, then Primorsky, a huge exhibition complex Lenexpo, one of the largest in the Russian Federation, was built.  Subsequently, Lenexpo was completed, and now it consists of 9 pavilions, customs terminals, 8 conference rooms, press centers, cafes and parking lots.  The exhibition complex covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 15 hectares, its uniqueness lies in the opportunity to demonstrate watercraft in the water area. </p><p>  75% of all events held in St. Petersburg are carried out at Lenexpo sites. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.totalexpo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenexpo building on the Square of Marine Glory" class="if uuid-2732711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2732711.jpg"></div><h2>  Naval library </h2><p>  The oldest book depository in Russia is located not far from the Square of Marine Glory - it is the Central Naval Library, created at the end of the 18th century.  In the walls of the new building on Kozhevennaya Street, specially equipped as a library complex, you can find unique rare books dedicated to the Russian fleet. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg, the Square of Sea Glory is close to historical sites. </p><p>  Opposite the square is a small but cozy Opochininsky garden.  It was laid in 1937, a small park surrounded by roses appeared on the site of the wasteland.  Since 2011, a new tradition has appeared in the garden: on the wedding day, newlyweds come to fasten their locks with names on a forged tree symbolizing the Heart of Love, and hide the keys in a forged chest at the foot of the tree.  Parents of babies who are brought here for a walk and elderly people also love this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Love heart in Opochinsky garden" class="if uuid-2732714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2732714.jpg"></div><p>  On the <span>Kozhevennaya line</span> , 700 meters from the Square of Sea Glory, there are such city attractions as the Logistics Museum and the Brusnitsyn Mansion. </p><p>  The Museum of Logistics, unique for Russia, was opened in St. Petersburg in 2011 and talks about how the goods get to the buyer from the manufacturer, how they are stored and delivered by various modes of transport presented in the city on the Neva </p><p>  The mansion, which for a century belonged to the richest merchant family of the Brusnitsyns, was rebuilt several times, combining features of Russian, Byzantine, Gothic, Saracen, Moorish in its appearance.  City legends claim that one of the mirrors in the mansion belonged to the famous Count Dracula and has special mystical properties. </p><p>  If you go in the opposite direction, then at 600 m there is an interesting naval museum - the Museum "Submarine D-2" (Skipper Channel, 10). </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The nearest metro station is Vasileostrovskaya and Primorskaya.  You can get to the Square of Marine Glory (St. Petersburg) by the following means of transport: </p><ul><li>  by buses - No. 128, 151, 152; </li><li>  trolleybuses - No. 10, 11; </li><li>  minibuses - K6k, K359. </li></ul>
