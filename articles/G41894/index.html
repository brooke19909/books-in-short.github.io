    <h2>  Rise and fall </h2><p>  Acting in this way, Alexander Balashov, whose biography is described in this article, actively fought against crimes, including political ones.  The crown of his career was the arrest of M. Speransky.  However, in 1819, the Ministry of Police was liquidated.  Alexander Balashov was already ready for this, because he was removed from the leadership of this department in 1812.  Now we know how his career ended.  But how did it start? </p>

    <h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Alexander Balashov, whose photo can be seen at the beginning of the article, comes from a noble family.  As was customary in those days, he was recorded as a non-commissioned officer of the Life Guard, as soon as he was 5 years old.  He began to command the company as lieutenant at the age of 21, having graduated from the Page Corps.  Alexander Balashov resigned in 1800, being a major general, but could not leave his military service and two months later he was appointed chief police officer of Moscow.  The acquired detective skills were very useful to him in further work.  It turned out that he has a predisposition to this kind of activity.  Although not all of his compatriots liked it.  No wonder spies do not like at all times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sociable character </h2><p>  However, Alexander Balashov did not pay attention to idle conversations and continued to work.  In 1807 he was appointed the chief quartermaster of the army, and a year later the chief police officer of St. Petersburg.  In February of the following year, Alexander Balashov became adjutant general of the emperor and took the post of military governor of St. Petersburg.  Adjutant General, and it was this title that Alexander Balashov began to wear at that time, was close to Alexander I. Thanks to this friendship, as well as his intelligence and education, he became a member of the Council of State in early 1810.  And in July, he was already appointed Minister of Police. </p>

    <h2>  Special Office </h2><p>  This department was only established and required to fully organize its work.  Alexander Dmitrievich could hardly cope alone with the duties entrusted to him.  Indeed, among them were supervision of prisons, libertines, buoys, prisoners, schismatics, stash holders and other similar people.  The police were also charged with following the order and suppressing all sorts of violations and disobedience.  The same department was supposed to provide recruitment kits, control drinking establishments, and ensure that the food supply was uninterrupted.  In addition to deal with the construction of bridges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, Alexander Dmitrievich Balashov organized the Special Chancellery.  This institution was engaged in particularly important cases, including monitoring foreigners, checking foreign passports, revising censorship, and fighting against anti-state activities.  In simple terms, employees of the Special Chancellery conducted espionage activities.  This institution was headed by Ya.I.  de Sanglen. </p><h2>  War with napoleon </h2><p>  Over time, the activities of Alexander Dmitrievich begins to dislike the emperor.  <span>M. Speransky</span> and J. Sanglen are also dissatisfied with it.  However, Balashov managed to convince the emperor and even achieve the arrest and exile of M. Speransky.  But, despite this, <span>Alexander I</span> no longer trusts him as before.  From 1812 to 1819, Alexander Balashov was in disfavor with the emperor.  However, the sovereign uses the diplomatic abilities of his subordinate during the war of 1812. </p><p>  On his orders, Balashov sent a letter to Napoleon.  However, he does not manage to persuade him to cease hostilities.  They say that Napoleon even asked him to point the way to Moscow.  However, the diplomat was not at a loss, and hinted to the emperor of France that one of the roads to Moscow goes through Poltava. </p>

    <h2>  Sunset career </h2><p>  Later Balashov writes a petition to the emperor about his departure from the army.  After that, he accompanies Alexander I on trips, collects a militia, participates in battles.  Alexander Dmitrievich also persuaded the king of Naples to change Napoleon.  After the victory in the Russian-French war, he agreed on a post-war arrangement with European courts. </p><p>  When the Ministry of Police merged with the Ministry of the Interior, Balashov was removed from his post and was appointed Governor-General of the central district.  In this field, he showed his best side.  Improved tax collection, paperwork.  Landscaped the province.  Thanks to his efforts, the house of industriousness was opened in Ryazan.  In Orel, organized a school of office workers, a military school. </p><p>  Alexander Dmitrievich petitioned for the opening of a monument to Dmitry Donskoy in the Kulikovo field.  He left the post of governor-general of the central district in 1828 in connection with its abolition, but continued to be a member of the State Council.  Six years later, he retired due to illness.  He died in Kronstadt in 1837. </p>
