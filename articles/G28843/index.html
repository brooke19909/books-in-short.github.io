Sights of Mongolia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mongolia is a country located in Central Asia.  Its northern neighbor is Russia, and on all other sides it borders on China.  Mongolia has no access to the sea.  Most of the country is occupied by plateaus and mountains.  The vast Gobi Desert is also located here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gobi Desert" class="if uuid-3266141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3266141.jpg"></div><p>  Mongolia has a very diverse natural environment.  Here you can find semi-deserts and deserts, steppes, forest-steppes, even taiga forests.  Among the large lakes, Khubsugul and Ubsu-Nur are especially well known.  In their fauna, flora and structure, they are similar to Baikal.  The largest rivers are the Selenga, Orkhon, Dzabhan, Kobdo and Kerulen.  The climate in this territory is sharply continental. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Anyone planning a trip to Mongolia should keep in mind that this is a rather unusual country.  In order to understand it, you should not study bright pictures in advertising brochures.  Best of all, only dry statistics will tell about this state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.economist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mongols ride camels" class="if uuid-3266131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3266131.jpg"></div><p>  So, a trip to Mongolia is a trip to a country where the population density is 1.7 people per 1 sq. Km.  km  Moreover, 40% of the population lives in the capital of the state - Ulan Bator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also known that there are thirteen horses per inhabitant of Mongolia, and also that during the year you can observe 260 sunny days when there is not a single cloud in the sky.  Many may be surprised by the significant difference between winter and summer air temperatures.  In the cold season, the thermometer column often drops to -40 degrees, and in the hot period it rises to +40. </p><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mongolian yurt" class="if uuid-3266142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3266142.jpg"></div><p>  To all of the above, it is worth adding the commitment of the local population to the traditions of their ancestors.  Yurts in this territory are not considered a relic of the past.  They are full-fledged and often the only possible houses.  But at the same time, in Mongolia, one can observe openness to the civilized world.  Here, local shepherds talk on cell phones and, as is known from the same statistics, Mongolian youth often go to study at universities in Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elviajero.elpais.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mongolian lake" class="if uuid-3266133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3266133.jpg"></div><p>  As it might seem at first glance, tourism and this Asian country are simply incompatible things.  And yet, those who decide to travel to Mongolia will find clear blue lakes, endless steppes of amazing beauty, the hot Gobi desert, snow-capped peaks of Altai, Buddhism monuments, the history of Genghis Khan, vibrant festivals, incredible hospitality of the local population and generous cuisine.  Tourism in this country is up to standard.  That is why many foreigners travel to Mongolia.  At the same time, travelers have the opportunity to go fishing, hunting, sightseeing, as well as take part in caravan or car tours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Air travel </h2><p>  How to get to Mongolia by plane?

No other permits are required to travel to this country. </p><p>  About a dozen border crossings operate here on the border with the Russian Federation.  The main one is Kyakhta.  This post works round the clock, passing only motorists.  Crossing the border is prohibited here. </p><p>  The distance from Kyakhta to Ulaanbaatar is 350 km.  However, tourists should keep in mind that there are practically no roads in Mongolia.  So for those who value their car, they are faced with the journey, not rushing to weigh the pros and cons </p><h2>  Visa </h2><p>  What documents other than a passport will be needed to visit the edge of blue lakes and blue sky?  Do I need a visa to Mongolia?  This question often worries those Russians who decided to visit this country.  When traveling for a period not exceeding 30 days, this permission is not required.  A visa-free regime between Mongolia and Russia was introduced in November 2014. </p><p>  No additional documents are needed if the traveler plans to get acquainted with the country, wants to visit friends or relatives, and also intends to make a business trip. </p><p>  Do I need a visa to Mongolia if the period of stay of a Russian citizen has exceeded a month period?  A person who has been in the country for more than 90 days for 6 months should contact the Consulate of this state located in the Russian Federation.  Here, when applying for the necessary package of documents, study, work and private visas are issued for longer periods. </p><h2>  Crossing the border </h2><p>  The passage of the Mongolian border posts, judging by the reviews of experienced tourists, is a simple and troublesome business.  It is enough to present a valid passport and, if there are products and goods requiring a customs declaration, fill out this document. </p><h2>  National currency </h2><p>  To date, Tugriks are in circulation in Mongolia.  They are its national currency.  There are both coins and banknotes in the country.  The minimum banknote in this case is 10 tugriks.

Despite its unofficial popularity, the calculations in them are allowed by the state. </p><p>  They accept Russian rubles and euros in Mongolia.  However, sellers do this not so willingly, and even then only in some stores. </p><p>  Those tourists who plan their trip to Mongolia should keep in mind that there are exchange points for money conversion in the country.  You can make such an operation in banks, as well as in large stores.  But this only applies to cities.  Having gone beyond their borders, you cannot meet exchange offices on your way. </p><h2>  Tongue </h2><p>  What kind of speech can be heard in this country?  The official language of Mongolia is Mongolian.  Most of the country's population speaks it. </p><p>  However, in addition to Mongolian, languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as the Buryat, Oirat, Kramigansk, Tuvan, Kazakh and Tsaatan-Soyot dialects also gained their distribution here. </p><h2>  Time </h2><p>  The traveler should keep in mind that Ulan Bator and the capital of Russia are located in different time zones.
