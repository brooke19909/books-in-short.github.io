For the first time, its generator was presented to the general public in 1981 in Toronto, where at that time a congress was held dedicated to the energy of the <span>gravitational field.</span>  Then it was reported that it works due to the presence of a magnetic field near the Earth.  It follows from this that its location and the orientation with respect to the south and north poles play an important role.

    <p>  The inventor himself - Lestor Hendershot - did not live to see Congress.  He died in 1961 (officially committed suicide). </p><h2>  General information on creation and related processes </h2><p>  The first mention of this device belongs to the range of 1927-1930.  According to available records, Hendershot received a usable <span>device,</span> whose <span>power</span> was 200-300 watts.  Then, for a short time, Leicester is honored by the American press as a national hero.  But soon the praise in his direction is replaced by accusations of quackery and fraud. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, the inventor himself is injured by electric current and no longer speaks with his developments.  According to his son, Mark Hendershot, his father received 25 thousand dollars for not disclosing information about the generator. </p><p>  That's all.  And let's go directly to the device.  Are you interested in the Hendershot generator?  Component exclusion scheme?

Transformers were used from radios.  The coils were tuned for mutual resonance.  This model worked only when it was oriented south from the north.  According to Hendershot himself, the amount of energy received was enough to ensure the operation of a small engine, which was confirmed by an experiment with a toy airplane. </p><h2>  Start assembly </h2>

A do-it-yourself scheme can be implemented without problems, but for this you must adhere to the instructions.  To get started, take the panel.  Draw two circles on it, the diameter of which will be 100 millimeters.  The distance between their centers should be 50 centimeters.  If you do not understand how and what to implement, look at the diagram.  In its upper right corner these parameters are indicated.

    <p>  On circles, mark the points at equal intervals.  Then they need to be drilled with a 3 mm drill.  Insert wooden rods into them.  They should rise by 70 millimeters.  If there is an excess of this parameter, it must be cut off.  Then gently straighten the wooden sticks after trimming. </p><p>  Take a wire whose cross section is 1.5 millimeters by 2, and begin to lay it between them.  It is necessary to make 12 turns for each coil.  Then we take a wire of 2.5 millimeters by 2. It is already necessary to lay it, too, 12 turns per coil. </p><p>  We have two types with different color designations.  Each type of wire should be wound 6 times.  Remember that the coils should have the same number of turns.  Also, do not forget to leave 50-60 millimeters on top so that you can connect to them.  During assembly, it is advisable to lightly press the turns with a wooden ruler so that they lie down as they should. </p><h2>  Making coils for controlling a magnetic resonator </h2><p>  To do this, wrap two cylindrical rods with a layer of <span>wax paper.</span>  Then 40 turns of wire are superimposed on it, the cross-section of which is 1.5 millimeters.  Using furniture fittings, plastic or cardboard, we produce a movable mechanism.  We fix two previously made coils on it with <span>epoxy glue</span> .  But they must move without significant effort and distortions.  The length of the guide elements should not exceed 250 millimeters. </p><h2>  Place capacitors </h2>

Glue a double-sided adhesive tape to their bottom.  It is necessary to place the capacitors in the center of the coils made.  After the devices are placed at 500 microfarads, the same should be done with devices for 1000 microfarads.  Two capacitors are placed on the panel on the outside of the coils.  The devices are non-electrolytic, therefore, have a significant size.  Therefore, it will not be superfluous to think about their compact placement.  Install the remaining components of the circuit.  Transformers must be fixed to the panel.

    <h2>  Installation of construction </h2><p>  So we are approaching the end of creation, and soon it will be possible to check the Hendershot generator.  Free energy, do-it-yourself instructions, a diagram - all this can be obtained and done by devoting several hours to the production process.  All elements are connected thanks to soldering.  Also pay particular attention to assembly accuracy.  Try to adhere to the specified scheme as much as possible. </p><p>  Also, be careful not to mix the end and the beginning of the winding when connecting the coils and capacitors.  Also check for tight mounting.  Then you can already connect the outlet.  To do this, it must be installed on the panel in a convenient place for you.  All open cores must be wrapped with insulating tape.  A heat shrink tube can be used for this purpose.  In this case, security must be put in the first place, because the price for breaking it is your health and even life.  Therefore, do not spare insulating material. </p><h2>  Adjustable </h2>

Let's work with the magnetic resonator block.  As a load, you can choose a lamp.  We connect it to the device and begin to move the coils to the magnet in order to get maximum work efficiency.  This can be judged by the strength of the lamp.  Once the maximum effect is obtained, stop the adjustment.  During this process, do not touch the iron rods on which the coils are wound.  If you need to work with them, use dielectric material.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If everything was done correctly, then you can observe a very good level of power.  So, some craftsmen even boast of 4-5 kilowatt designs.  This is more than enough to ensure the work of a fairly large amount of equipment.  Although it should be noted that the design in such cases is being seriously improved.  And what do they say about such a considered Hendershot generator?  The scheme, reviews about it deserve attention.  It is suitable for those who begin to practice the study of fuel-free energy sources.
