Unique handmade jewelry can be made of different materials, from wood to metal, including precious.  There is also a huge number of ideas for making your own ring - it can be either a classic ring or some unique ring, it all depends on the imagination and skill of the master.  In today's article, we will talk about several ways of how you can make a ring at home and from what.  It will be interesting! </p><h2>  What can you make a ring with your own hands </h2><p>  Before moving on to the very essence of today's article, I would like to devote some time to the topic of the material, that is, to what the ring can be made of.  In general, there are no restrictions on the material for the ring.  Decoration is most often made of metal, a little less often of wood.  There are also craftsmen who make rings with their own hands from the most ordinary newspaper.  No, this is not a joke, but the most true truth.  Rings can also be made from newspapers, but this process is not fast at all and takes several days, plus you need acrylic paint and varnish to make it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.linesacross.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what can a ring be made of" class="if uuid-2776290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776290.jpg"></div><p>  In our material we will talk about how rings are made from coins and wood.  Casting methods will not be affected, since they are more complex, take a lot of time and require additional tools, including a torch, to melt the metal, and, alas, not everyone has it.  Actually, let us now turn to the consideration of manufacturing methods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coin ring </h2><p>  The first thing I would like to talk about is how to make a ring out of a coin with your own hands.  There are 2 ways to make a ring from a coin, and we will look at both of them, but one at a time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin ring" class="if uuid-2776297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776297.jpg"></div><p>  So what you need: </p><ul><li>  A coin, and absolutely any, the main thing is that then the finished ring fit onto your finger. </li><li>  A tablespoon or small shoe hammer. </li><li>  Anvil or just any solid, flat metal surface. </li><li>  Drill with a drill of suitable diameter for the size of a finger or jigsaw. </li><li>  Round file. </li><li>  Fine-grained <span>sandpaper of</span> three types (600, 800, 1000), or if there is an engraving machine of the Dremel type with grinding nozzles at home, you can use it. </li><li>  Goya paste or any other polish, as well as a piece of soft cloth for final polishing. </li></ul><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  Now directly about the workflow.  It‚Äôs worth saying right away that everything will go well decently, so you need to be patient, otherwise it may not work.  Additionally, a video will be posted at the end, in which the entire manufacturing process will be shown. </p><p>  The coin must be put on the anvil, holding with two fingers.  We start to knock on it with a spoon, but not very much.  The coin itself must be constantly rotated so that it is flattened evenly.  As soon as the coin rotates a full revolution, it must be turned on the other side and continue to flatten.  Such a procedure has to be done more than once, until the coin faces are flattened to the desired width.  On average, this procedure takes one and a half to two hours.  If you want the ring to be wide, then you still have to flatten a coin for some time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making a ring from a coin" class="if uuid-2776296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776296.jpg"></div><p>  The next step after flattening is to cut out the middle.  If at hand there is a drill with a mill, then this will be a quick process, if not, then a good old jigsaw will come to the rescue.  It will only be necessary to punch a hole in the coin with something, so that you can stick the canvas of the jigsaw.  The middle is cut out or drilled almost completely.  Do not leave excess metal, since in the future, when worn, it can cause discomfort. </p><p>  Once all the excess is removed, you can begin to clean and remove burrs from the metal.  A round file will help in this.  This process is also lengthy, so you have to be patient. </p><p>  The penultimate step on the way to the finish is sanding with sandpaper or an engraver with nozzles.  The first grinding step must be done with 600 grit. At the second step, 800 grit is already used, and at the very end you can already use sandpaper with 1000 grit. Processing must be carried out both from the outside, from the inside and from the sides.  Also, if there is a desire, after treatment with a thousandth grain, you can perform grinding on sandpaper 1400, 1800 and 2000 to achieve the most mirror-like and smooth surface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself coin ring" class="if uuid-2776291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776291.jpg"></div><p>  And now, the very last step is polishing.  For polishing, you can use any paste that is available at home.  The most common type of polish is goy paste, a time-tested product.  If there is no such paste at home, then you can buy in the store any polish in a tube or jar. </p><p>  We put a little paste on the ring, after which we start rubbing it well with a soft cloth, thereby polishing.  Those who have an engraver at home can use a special polishing nozzle, which will significantly speed up the process.  Polishing should be carried out until the entire ring has found an ideal mirror surface.  And here is the promised video for making the ring. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="XiTKo1xS2sw" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTKo1xS2sw" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/2/9/0/8290.jpg"></div><h2>  Ring made of coins (Method 2) </h2><p>  The next way to make a ring with your own hands at home is also devoted to a ring from a coin.  The production technology here is slightly different.  Here's what you need to make: </p><ul><li>  coin; </li><li>  hammer; </li><li>  core; </li><li>  drill; </li><li>  crossbar or conical metal rod, Morse taper drill; </li><li>  piece of PVC pipe; </li><li>  calipers; </li><li>  vise; </li><li>  fine-grained sandpaper; </li><li>  polishing paste and fabric. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="changeyoucanwear.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="double-sided coin ring" class="if uuid-2776294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776294.jpg"></div><h2>  Ring making </h2><p>  Making a ring from a coin by this method is rather complicated.  In words, everything looks simple: you need to drill a hole of a small diameter, then turn the workpiece through the cone to the desired size and polish at the end.  In practice, everything turns out to be somewhat more complicated. </p><p>  In order not to describe the whole process of making a ring with your own hands, a video will be attached below, in which everything is shown in great detail. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="IpKqOGr5mY0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpKqOGr5mY0" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/2/8/9/8289.jpg"></div><h2>  Wood ring </h2><p>  Now it would be nice to talk about how to make a ring of wood with your own hands.  As a material, you can use any wood, even MDF and fiberboard will do.  Also, to obtain a more interesting variant of the workpiece, several pieces of wood of different colors can be glued together.  In this case, the output ring will turn out multi-colored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bojtstudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself wood ring making" class="if uuid-2776292" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776292.jpg"></div><h2>  The process of making a ring from wood </h2><p>  First you need to prepare a small piece of the workpiece from which the ring will be made.  It is important not to forget about the thickness of the workpiece so that the ring does not turn out too thin.  Next, you need to drill a hole equal to the size of your finger.  It is advisable to drill with a special drill on wood and at the same time try to maintain a clear vertical so that the hole does not move. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood ring" class="if uuid-2776295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776295.jpg"></div><p>  The next step in the manufacture of the ring with your own hands is the marking of the outer diameter.  The outer diameter will allow you to determine the thickness of the ring and at the same time show how long you need to "remove" excess wood.  To determine the outer diameter, it is best to use curly rulers or a compass. </p><p>  After marking, remove all excess wood to the line of the outer diameter.  It is best to use a grinder for this, but if it is not at hand, then a grinder with grinding wheels of different grain sizes will fit for this purpose. </p><p>  As soon as all the excess is removed, the almost finished ring needs to be sanded on sandpaper, starting from 80 grains and ending with 400. At the end, it is advisable to finish 800 or 1000 with a sandpaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wood ring" class="if uuid-2776293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2776293.jpg"></div><p>  Well, the last step, when everything is ready, is to grease the ring with oil and let it dry.  This is necessary so that the wood does not deteriorate and lasts as long as possible.  A video on making a ring from wood is also included. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="gyxKkl7r7yM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gyxKkl7r7yM" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/8/2/9/1/8291.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  That, in fact, is all that relates to how to make a ring with your own hands from a coin or a tree.  There are no particular difficulties in the manufacturing process, the main thing is not to rush anywhere, because rushing does not bring anything good.  Well, that's all, all the best! </p>
