    <h2>  Smart Watch Features </h2><p>  The independence of young children brings great joy to their parents, but it often borders on emotions and anxiety.  Today, many devices have been invented that help maintain communication between parents and the child.  These include smart <span>watches for children,</span> reviews of which are different.

The opinion of other parents, of course, is important, but because if some child liked this model, this does not mean that it is perfect and others will like it.  Before choosing the right model, you should understand the capabilities of these gadgets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Smart watches</span> are a real find for caring and loving parents.  In some models, the functions may differ, but absolutely all of them allow you to do such things: </p><ul><li>  track the location of their owner; </li><li>  Receive notifications when the watch is removed from the hand; </li><li>  find out the route of movement of the baby; </li><li>  mark several points on the map (school, section, house) and receive alerts when a child leaves the borders of these places; </li><li>  make a secret call, during which a microphone is automatically connected to the device, and parents can hear what is happening around it. </li></ul><p>  Gadgets are beneficial not only to mothers and fathers, but also to the children themselves.  For example, the owner of such a watch can at any time find out information about the time, see and answer incoming messages, make and receive calls, and also press the alarm button in case of danger.  Thanks to this, positive reviews about smart watches for children come not only from parents, but also from kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch phone for kids reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2017499.jpg" width="529"></div>

    <h2>  Why are they better than a smartphone? </h2><p>  Any modern phone can handle more than just calls.  And even the cheapest device has a GPS module.  Therefore, you can turn a gadget into a tracker in a matter of minutes.  Many reviews of smart watches for children suggest that they have several advantages over modern smartphones.  The main ones are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the watch is harder to lose, because it is firmly fixed on the hand, but the phone always accidentally disappears from the pocket of your trousers or backpack; </li><li>  on the watch, the charge lasts much longer than on a smartphone, and you will need to charge them no more than once every 5 days; </li><li>  the creators of the device did not foresee the presence of games in them, so the child will spend less time in the virtual world. </li></ul><p>  All these advantages do not mean at all that smart watches can completely replace the phone.  Although it should be noted that for a child of primary school age they will be a more profitable option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch smart watch for kids reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/2017497.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Reviews of smart watches for children with GPS are often received about their work.  In fact, they function quite simply.  In a small case, there is a board, a battery for power, as well as a GPS module, which is responsible for determining the location through communication with satellites.  There are models on the market that catch the signals of GLONASS satellites or specify the location via Wi-Fi networks and data from mobile communication towers.  In addition, the watch provides a slot for a SIM card, which is the main means of transmitting information to a computer or smartphone of parents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to get the maximum benefit and leave only positive reviews about smart watches for children, you should pay attention to the following points when choosing: </p><ul><li>  Accuracy of determination of coordinates.  It is advisable to choose the tracker with the highest rate.  Advanced devices can determine location with an accuracy of only 3-5 meters.  Some models show the location of the baby with an accuracy of 15 meters. </li><li>  The quality of signal reception from satellites.  This parameter is very important, since anything can block the transmission.  Of course, the manufacturer himself does not indicate this in the description, but customer reviews of smart watches for children will help to understand better. </li><li>  The presence of a panic button.  This feature is necessary for hyper-caring parents.  When a button is pressed, a notification is sent to their device indicating the location coordinates of the child. </li><li>  Record the route of movement.  Many models automatically fill out the "walk log".  This feature allows parents to check if they have missed something during the day. </li><li>  The speed of the sensor.  Its definition is far from necessary in all cases, although sometimes it can even become indispensable. </li><li>  The presence of a microphone and speakers.  They help make and receive calls from strictly defined numbers. </li><li>  Impact resistance and moisture resistance.  A significant advantage of the watch is especially necessary for overly active children who can easily fall from any height or catch on their hands, damaging the device. </li><li>  Battery capacity.  This nuance determines the frequency of charging the device. </li></ul>
