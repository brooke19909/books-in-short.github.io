A stone walkway leads from the hotel to the coast.  The beach is fenced and equipped with stationary straw umbrellas and sunbeds.  The entire coast has a shallow sand cover, the entry into the sea is gentle and very convenient.  There is a freshwater shower on the beach.  In the morning, the coast is cleaned, and there are even ashtrays near the sunbeds. </p><p>  Horseback patrol runs daily along the coast.  Merchants scurry along the beach, but they are not intrusive.  On the shore it is never hot thanks to the breeze. </p><h2>  Regency Hotel <span>Hammamet 4 * (Hammamet,</span> Tunisia): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who rested here.  The complex was built on the shore, which ensures a constant stay at the sea during the whole vacation.  The hotel is surrounded by a tropical garden with flowering plants.  It is interesting to walk along its alleys in the evening. </p>

    <p>  Hotel <span>Regency 4 * (Regency 4 *, Hammamet)</span> can arrange a transfer, thanks to which the road to the complex from the airport will take about fifty minutes.  Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in occurs immediately, even if you arrive earlier than the appointed time.  Some tourists say that one of the shifts at the reception hints at a cash reward in order to make the registration faster. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel rooms are quite spacious, with good furniture, but, according to vacationers, there is a noticeable need for fresh repairs and replacing furniture with more modern ones.  In general, you can relax normally in the apartments.  5 towels are allocated for each room (for two people) (based on 2 pieces in hand, and one for legs).  Cleaning is done daily, however, regarding its quality, opinions of vacationers differ.  Some consider it quite tolerable in the presence of a tip, while others - very bad.  Generally speaking, the Regency 4 * hotel is one of those places about which tourists leave rather conflicting reviews. </p><p>  Maids change towels every day, but at the same time they pick them up in the morning, and bring new ones only at 16.00.  If at this time you want to swim in the room, then there is simply nothing to wipe off.  In this regard, the system is somehow incorrectly built. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  I would also like to dwell on the food offered by the Regency Hammamet 4 * hotel in Hammamet (Tunisia).  As a rule, it is food that causes a lot of controversy among tourists.  And our hotel in this respect is no exception. </p><p>  The hotel has a main restaurant with a spacious open-air terrace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartline regency hotel hammamet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533145.jpg"></div>  There is also a cafe and beach bar.  Breakfast in the complex is quite standard, as in many hotels.  It serves: fried eggs and boiled eggs, sausage (boiled), olives, tomatoes, onions, <span>cucumbers, stewed</span> vegetables, coffee, tea, rice cereals, croissants, jams, juices, chopped melons and watermelons, cottage cheese, sometimes camembert cheese is locally made .

    <p>  For lunch and dinner on the tables a noticeably greater variety of dishes.  There are meat dishes, fish, fried in batter, potatoes, pasta, pizza, several types of mashed soups, chicken and beef.  Twice a day, guests are pleased with several kinds of ice cream and cakes.  From fruits you can enjoy melons, watermelons, plums and apples.  On the open terrace of the restaurant on each table there is an ashtray.  For dinner, drinks are paid even for guests who have All Inclusive.  But in the morning tea and coffee are served for absolutely everyone. </p><p>  There are always a lot of cats on the terrace who actively beg for food, so tourists are advised not to leave their plate unattended. </p><p>  In season, there is a cafe on the beach, you can also have lunch there, but only for a fee.  Not far from the complex is a street where there are many establishments with cafes and restaurants.  You can always eat in them.  However, vacationers should remember that in Ramadan all organizations and institutions in the country work according to a special schedule.  Drinking alcohol at such a time is only possible in a hotel.  Nowhere else will you find him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hammamet regency 4 tunisia hammamet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533146.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the food in the hotel is normal, but not too varied, which upsets tourists. </p><h2>  Animation and Entertainment Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a team of animators who organize water aerobics classes right on the beach.  And in the evening, various shows and children's discos are organized on the terrace near the bar.  There is a mini club for kids.  On the beach, vacationers are offered all kinds of water activities: jet skiing, parasailing, camel riding.  The animation team works well, inviting all vacationers, but at the same time does it unobtrusively. </p><p>  According to tourists, all animation programs take place only during the high season, after its end all entertainment shows just stop, which is typical for almost all hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="regency 4 regency 4 hammamet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1533147.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The complex has a beautiful beach, where everyone has enough space.  There is a sufficient number of sunbeds, so there is no need at six in the morning to take their place.  Tunisia has a wonderful climate for a beach holiday, it is warm here even after the end of the high season.  The weather is not too bad, and therefore you can always swim and sunbathe.  As soon as the wind changes direction and begins to blow from the Sahara, it becomes more warm and comfortable.  Despite the fact that it is not cold even in winter, there is no intense heat in summer.  Resting on the coast is always comfortable and the heat is not felt, thanks to the breeze.  The water in the sea is clean and clear, and the entire coast is covered with the finest white sand.  A gentle shallow entry into the sea makes the resort popular among families with kids.  After sea disturbance, sometimes algae and any garbage appear under the shore, but hotel workers try to deal with such a nuisance, quickly removing everything. </p><p>  As for the service in the complex, the whole staff is nice and friendly.  Tunisians are generally quite kind people and are good to all visitors regardless of nationality.  The youth in the hotel has a little rest.  The main contingent is European pensioners and our married couples with children.  Very few people know the Russian language from the staff, but everyone speaks French, German, and English.  There is no language barrier, one can always explain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel regency hammamet 4 in hammamet tunisia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1533194.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Beach vacations here can always be combined with trips on excursions.  Nearby there are a considerable number of interesting sights.  Shopping enthusiasts can visit bazaars and shops.  At the bazaars you should definitely bargain before making any purchase.  But in stores there are fixed prices.  The largest shopping center is Joyce, where you can purchase everything you need. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  According to tourists, the complex is a great place for families.  It is located away from the city and from unnecessary noise, which is very convenient.  Night sounds of noisy discos do not reach here.  And at the same time, the beach and the sea are so close that people spend their entire vacation right on the coast.  Of course, the hotel has minor flaws in terms of food, cleaning and maintenance, but they all more than overlap with a great location and beautiful sea.  Since the complex belongs to budgetary institutions, it fully corresponds to the golden ratio ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù.  This hotel can be recommended as a holiday destination for the picky and spoiled tourists who prefer to live on the coast and appreciate sea vacation above all else. </p>
