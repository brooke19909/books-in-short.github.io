A trip to Prague by train</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Prague is one of the most popular tourist cities in Europe.  And this is understandable, because the city is incredibly beautiful, there are quite low prices and it is very convenient to get there.  Therefore, sightseeing <span>tours to Prague,</span> especially during the Christmas holidays, diverge very quickly.  But Prague can not only be the final destination of the trip, but also a convenient place for transplantation.  After all, the city is very conveniently located and from here you can go to many cities of the country and Europe.  Going to the Czech Republic by train, the tourist wonders how to get there and how not to get lost there.  Since the station is most often the beginning of the journey, we will talk about the Prague station.  You will also learn its history, understand how and where you can buy a ticket, get an answer to the question, how many train stations are in Prague, and much more useful and interesting information. </p><h2>  Geographical location of Prague </h2><p>  The capital of the Czech Republic is in many ways a unique city, including a special location in Europe.  The heart of the continent is Prague, and the main station is the very center of the city.  Thus, the distance from the railway station in Prague is approximately the same, even to the Adriatic coast, even to the coast of the North or Baltic Sea.  And the uniqueness of this place is that extremely interesting cities are located around it at affordable distances: Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest, Munich, Berlin.  Therefore, a lot of travelers come to the Czech Republic every day by train.  And coming here from Russia is very simple.  After all, there is a direct train Moscow-Prague and the price at the Russian Railways for this transfer is quite affordable.  And after 28 hours you can stand in the center of Europe and think about where to go first? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zemefilmu.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many train stations in Prague" class="if uuid-2979243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979243.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourism potential of Prague </h2><p>  Every year, 5 million people come to the Czech capital, Prague.  The main station receives passengers around the clock and becomes for them the gateway to this marvelous city.  Why is the Czech capital so attractive? </p><ol><li>  Prague is a city of many attractions.  After all, the Czech capital managed to maintain its appearance from the most ancient times.  Here is the medieval heart of the city.  Even two!  After all, Prague combines two medieval settlements on different banks of the Vltava River.  These settlements have a different character and atmosphere, Stare Mesto is a more aristocratic, ceremonial part and Mala Strana is more chamber, democratic, comfortable.  Each of them even has its own Cathedral of St. Nicholas, as evidence that they are equal and were once independent of each other.  Both of these areas can be explored for a very long time, you will certainly get lost in them, then you will find and feel the real Middle Ages.  The appearance of some houses remains unchanged from 9-11 centuries.  This is enough to fall in love with Prague!  But there is still an incredible Prague Castle with the tall St. Vitus Cathedral and the pretty Golden Street.  There are whole blocks of houses in art nouveau style (modern in our opinion) and they are simply magnificent.  There are several interesting bridges here, including the famous Karlov, there is its own ‚Äúlittle Venice‚Äù ... The sights of Prague will be enough for a full 7-day trip. </li><li>  Beer and food in Prague quite successfully compete with architectural and historical sights.  Czech beer is a world-class brand, and in addition to being very tasty, it is also quite affordable in price.  Not surprisingly, even German residents often come to Prague for a weekend to spend time in local pubs.  And there are a lot of them.  Food in Prague is perhaps simple, but hearty, tasty and, again, inexpensive.  For these pleasures, it is best to go to the Prague area of ‚Äã‚ÄãZizkov. </li><li>  Transport accessibility.  As already noted, Prague is conveniently located in relation to many cities in Europe.  In addition, transport in the city is also very convenient, although in the center it is not needed at all - the center of the Czech capital is quite compact. </li><li>  The cheapness of life in Prague is another reason why prudent Europeans tend to come here.  Hotels, food and travel around the city cost less than in expensive Scandinavia and even than in Western Europe. </li></ol><p>  And this is only the most general overview of the merits of Prague, each traveler will find something of his own in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mmcite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague main railway station" class="if uuid-2979245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979245.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Railways in the Czech Republic </h2><p>  The first railways came to the Czech Republic in 1837, as part of a program to connect the cities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by rail.  The first line, passing through Prague, connected the capital of the empire, Vienna and Krakow.  Railways have always belonged to the state.  After the declaration of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the railways were transformed into a national company - ƒåSD.  And after the Second World War, railways became the property of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.  After the next independence and the proclamation of the state of the Czech Republic in 1992, the railways were renamed the "Czech Railways".  Together with all the infrastructure, the state also owns the station. </p><h2>  Features of train travel in the Czech Republic </h2><p>  Rail transport is one of the most convenient and safe means of transportation.  Traveling by train in the Czech Republic has its own characteristics, which are useful to know about.  The train schedule is stable and does not change, at times, for years.  There are no summer and winter options, as is the case with buses, for example.  The lack of train tickets is not about the Czech Republic.  There is always the opportunity to buy a ticket from the conductor, already directly in the car.  True, this does not guarantee a place, but this is another topic.  Tickets are valid for all trains on the paid route, this allows, for example, getting to a station, getting off, taking a walk, and then taking the next train and moving on.  The trains are modern, comfortable, almost all have electronic displays that make it easy to track the progress of the train along the route.  There is always a restaurant car and even a playroom for children on long-distance trains; in the first class there is a TV.  Upon learning how convenient it is to travel with Czech trains, any traveler will have only one thought: where is the train station in Prague? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.likealocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague main station building description" class="if uuid-2979241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979241.jpg"></div><h2>  Prague Stations </h2><p>  We must say right away that there are seven stations in Prague and there are still several small stations.  But one of the most beautiful train stations in Europe is the main train station in Prague.  The address Hlavn√≠ N√°dra≈æ√≠ is Wilsonova Street 8. The metro station, bus and tram stops are also called Hlavn√≠ N√°dra≈æ√≠ (Main Station in Russian).  But this station is not the very first, from the point of view of history.  In 1842, a small Masarykovo n√°dra≈æ√≠ appeared in Prague, now it serves only the eastern suburbs of Prague. </p><p>  There are also stations in the Czech capital, Hole≈°ovice, Sm√≠chov, Vr≈°ovice, Libe≈à and Vysoƒçany, from where trains leave for different regions of the Czech Republic and international trains stop.  In Prague there are two stations where only freight trains serve.  In addition to stationary stations in the Czech capital and its agglomeration, there are 30 railway stops, which greatly reduce the load of public transport in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="de is the train station in Prague" class="if uuid-2979250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979250.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture of Prague Main Station </h2><p>  In many European cities, railway stations are real architectural masterpieces, genuine sights.  Many railway stations are worthy examples of the Art Nouveau style, such is the main station of Prague.  The description of the building can take its rightful place in the reference book on architecture of the secession.  The first station building was not so luxurious; it was built in 1871.  Initially, he was given the name of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph the First, later he bore the name of US President Wilson, an active supporter of Czech independence.  In 1953, this name also went into oblivion.  The original station building was small and soon it no longer met the requirements for servicing the ever-growing traffic of passengers.  Therefore, at the beginning of the 20th century, it was decided to expand the station.  The construction project was developed by the famous architect Joseph Fant.  And in 1901 - 1909, he created the corps in the style of the Austrian Secession or Art Nouveau, which today causes universal admiration.  The building is decorated with numerous sculptures and stucco molding, expressive mascarons symbolizing different countries are placed on the facade.  The interior of the station is also magnificent: paintings, wooden carvings, large windows of spectacular shape, all this makes an unforgettable impression. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague main station building description" class="if uuid-2979248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979248.jpg"></div><p>  In 1971, the station was undergoing reconstruction again, this time a huge underground part was being built in it and another building was being built, for which it was necessary to cut down part of the beautiful park, laid out on the forecourt.  But the station has become much more spacious and more convenient, now it is connected to the metro, additional facilities for the development of infrastructure have appeared.  At the beginning of the 21st century, the historic station building was restored, and today it can be seen in all its splendor. </p><h2>  Directions of transportation </h2><p>  Since Prague is located in the very center of Europe, from its central station you can go anywhere in the continent.  All trains can be divided into Czech and international.  In the country there are trains like electric trains, in turn they are also of two types.  High-speed commuter trains (SP) travel at medium distances, but with transfers allow you to get to any city in the Czech Republic, do not stop at small stations.  Ordinary electric trains (OS) travel short distances, they make quite a few stops and rarely have first-class cars.  Outside the Czech Republic you can leave on two types of trains.  The regional express train (EX) will take you to the big cities of the country, as well as beyond its borders: to Poland, Germany, Slovakia.  The international fast train (R) runs between the big cities of Europe, stops only at large stations.  These trains offer a wider range of services.  In addition to Czech trains, the station also serves trains of foreign railway companies, for example, there is a direct train Moscow-Prague (RZD), and the price of tickets for it makes such trips affordable.  The most popular travel destinations from Prague Station are German cities: Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Hamburg.  There are also trains to Amsterdam, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Paris. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-guide.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague main railway station" class="if uuid-2979251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979251.jpg"></div><h2>  Ticket selling </h2><p>  At the station you can buy tickets in any direction.  Cash desks and vending machines work for this.  You need to immediately warn that finding a ticket office at the Prague train station is not easy.  This method of buying tickets is far from the most popular, so ticket offices are not the main place.  And they do not work around the clock, so early in the morning you can‚Äôt find a single functioning ticket office.  Instead, ticket vending machines are everywhere, unfortunately they don‚Äôt ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in Russian, but they speak English.  In order not to get confused with the machine, it is easier to buy a ticket at home, via the Internet.  The purchased ticket does not even need to be printed, just show the conductor a receipt on the phone.  When buying tickets in advance, and this can be done in 62 days, you can get some privileges and discounts, there are group and family ticket options.  This allows you to make sightseeing tours to Prague on your own for quite little money.  Please note that the departure platform number is not written on the ticket, information about this can be found only at the station before departure.  The numbers are displayed on the scoreboard.  Since the complex is very large, it will take some time to go to the platform, so it‚Äôs better to arrive at the central station, unlike small stations, in advance. </p><h2>  Station infrastructure </h2><p>  Like any train station in Europe, the main station in Prague offers a variety of services.  There is a luggage room, you can leave your luggage and go for a walk around the city, since the station is located near the center of Prague.  Passengers can exchange currency, which is very important for the Czech Republic, because the national currency is preserved here - the kroon, although the rate at the station is not very profitable.  The station complex also has several cafes, including a 24-hour cafe, a supermarket, toilets, showers, car rental points, pharmacies, and a tourist information center.  A very convenient navigation system is built at the station, so it is impossible to get lost in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-guide.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sightseeing tours to prague" class="if uuid-2979252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2979252.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Prague train station has very good transport accessibility.  Buses, a tram stop near it and there is a metro station (line C) integrated directly into the station building.  Transport in the Czech capital is very punctual and runs literally on schedule.  Tourists are often interested in the question of how to get to the main station of Prague from the airport.  There are several ways to do this.  The easiest and most expensive way is a taxi.  But there are more budget options.  An aeroexpress will deliver directly to the main station of Prague from the airport, a ticket for it is bought in the same way as for a regular bus.  A ticket costs 60 CZK, you can buy it in the machine or from the driver.  Cheaper, but longer and with a change you can get by public transport.  To do this, you need to take a bus 100 or 119 at the airport, get to the metro station, and there you can already get to the station.  A bus ticket (cost 32 CZK) allows you to transfer to the metro within 90 minutes.  This time is enough to get to the station. </p>
