They are not only externally very close to real models of cars, airplanes, helicopters and trains, but also inside they have an equally sophisticated arrangement of the engine, chassis and much more.  The game with such models is so addictive that even adults can not resist it.  Particularly attracting attention are radio-controlled drift cars.  They are exact copies of real-life models, they just do not require you to have a driver‚Äôs license, but special remote control skills will, of course, be needed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drift machine" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/334929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stunning skid </h2><p>  It will not be easy for a beginner to immediately master the drift technique - receiving passage of sharp turns at an outrageous speed, thanks to which the car goes into a controlled drift.  By the way, the first mention of the use of this style of driving dates back to the middle of the last century.  However, only in 1988 the world spoke about this spectacular form of racing, as it entered the international level.  An interesting technique almost immediately fell in love with both professionals and car racing enthusiasts.  He began to gather multimillion-dollar crowds of fans who were just stunned by the carnivorous sloping silhouettes of cars, literally flying into turns in a desperate drift.  No less delight was caused by puffs of smoke creeping from the order of shabby rubber.  The drift has become a kind of inspiration for the authors of action films and computer games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drift on typewriters on the control panel" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/334927.jpg?1392285385568" width="500"></div>

And already in 1991 the first drift machine was released.  Actually, it was from this that the successful history of radio-controlled cars began for a beautiful and at the same time very aggressive ride.  Today, dozens of world famous companies are engaged in their creation.  These include monsters such as Traxxas and HSP.  In their model range there can be either a standard drift machine on the remote control, designed for beginners, or incredibly powerful professional cars that repeat real cars to the smallest detail.  Vehicles are manufactured on a scale of 1: 10. It is he who is considered the world standard for this type of racing and competition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radio drift cars" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13127/334928.jpg?1392285422776" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Drift on typewriters on the control panel is a real passion! </h2><p>  This hobby is so addictive that, having only tried once to become a pilot of a miniature version of a sports car, you will forever become a fan of this business.  A drift machine is perhaps the most coveted gift for any child.  Yes there is a child!  It can be just a terrific surprise for an adult who is fond of radio-controlled models of sports cars.  Having a predatory sporting grace and just a non-childish power reserve under a small hood, they are designed for high-speed racing on a flat surface and making fascinating turns in a controlled drift.  The drift machine is very similar to cars for the usual races only externally.  This class of cars is distinguished by the special composition of special tires, which provides them with perfect grip, they are also distinguished by the design features of the suspension and permanent all-wheel drive.  Such toys are expensive.  The simplest models will cost 2-3 thousand rubles, but the top-end versions in a complete set can cost tens of thousands. </p>
