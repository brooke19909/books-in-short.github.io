His work is the accounting and synthesis of financial data for the analysis of the economic life of the enterprise.  Conditionally, there are 3 points here: </p><ol><li>  Determination of financial indicators of economic activity (cash flows, income, expenses, assets, liabilities and others); </li><li>  Measurement of these characteristics and their display in monetary terms; </li><li>  Providing prepared financial information in the form of reports. </li></ol><h2>  About basic concepts </h2>

The principle of double recording plays an important role here.  In essence, this is a work plan that provides that each business transaction is always displayed twice: the first time on debit, the second on credit.  If non-automated accounting is conducted, then journal-order and memorial approaches are used.

From this follows such a logical moment of accounting, as the simultaneous change in the indicators of the two sides of the balance sheet.  What is he like?  The balance sheet is a <span>way of grouping</span> financial indicators of existing assets and liabilities to display the financial condition of the organization on a specific date.  These two parts represent the main source of data for the subsequent analysis of economic and financial activities.  What is included in them?  Here is a short answer: </p><ol><li>  Asset - property, receivables, cash; </li><li>  Liability - a set of all obligations of the organization, as well as sources of formation of its funds; </li></ol><p>  Depending on the chosen legal form of organization, its balance sheets can be presented in different ways.  So, for internal use, it can be built to display confidential information.  Reporting to government bodies is based on pre-approved forms and data transfer formats. </p><h2>  Accounting </h2>

In this case, attention should be paid to users of this information.  So, if it will be needed for the enterprise, then in this case an internal accounting instruction will help, which indicates what data should be transferred to senior management, what to analysts, etc.

    <p>  With external services, for example, tax, things are not so simple.  The peculiarity of working with them is that priority over form takes precedence.  In order to learn how to work with them without problems, you can take accounting courses for beginners or you should gain experience from seasoned specialists. </p><p>  Consider a small example.  Suppose a company has a 1C: Warehouse program.  It displays the receipts of materials and raw materials.  This information is of interest to the management of the company, since it shows the current state of affairs.  But the tax service "1C: Warehouse" is of little interest.  They need general declarations, invoices for individual consignments of goods that have been shipped to other economic entities and so on.  Of course, during the verification, the sent experts will get acquainted with all the data, but the viewing will be more superficial. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>
