There is nothing surprising in this - many of the tasks that the smartphone previously performed (watching videos, listening to music, working with various applications, games) were transferred to tablet devices.  After all, doing all this with their help is much more convenient.  Due to the large colorful screen, each element of virtual graphics seems even more realistic. </p>

    <h2>  Online access </h2><p>  Over time, more and more entertainment goes online.  For example, it‚Äôs more convenient to watch a video directly from the video hosting service, without additional saving to your device.  The same goes for online games with which we compete with real players, not with a computer.  And then - we are used to being able to instantly find any information of interest using, again, the same Google.  You can do this, as you know, only with a smartphone or tablet connected to the network. </p><p>  Mobile operators pay a lot of attention to tariffs aimed at mobile online access, developing Internet tariffs for a tablet.  That is why in this article we will consider which of them are the most profitable.  It will be about options that are offered to us by the leader of the Russian telecom market - Beeline company.  We will take information that will help us determine the best package of services from the official website, as well as from resources on which you can find the opinions of other subscribers.  You can read the results of our analysis further on the same page. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  It's no secret that every mobile operator cares about the presence in its portfolio of a sufficiently large number of tariff plans that can ensure the interests of many users.  Simply put, the greater the range of services provided by the company, the better for its subscribers.  Therefore, all players in this market are constantly updating and introducing new options for their customers.  Beeline is no exception.  Tariffs for tablets, as well as service packages for smartphones, are presented here in a wide variety of combinations.  The choice is so large that the client, making his choice, can easily get confused.  In order to help avoid this, we are writing this article.  In it, we will try to cover all the tariffs for tablets provided by Beeline. </p>

    <h2>  Difference </h2><p>  I would like to start right away with one important theoretical point.  It is about what features a plan for a tablet computer has, which distinguishes it from tariffs for mobile devices.  So what can you say about Beeline?  Tariffs for tablets are no different from plans for phones, with the exception of the volume of services provided.  This is due to the needs experienced by tablet owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, if a person with the ‚Äúfor smartphone‚Äù option most often wants to receive free calls, the maximum number of SMS and a certain amount of traffic, then those who purchase Internet tariffs for a tablet, as a rule, are looking for only megabytes of data.  The more there are, the better the service, and the higher its cost.  A person with a tablet does not need minutes for calls on the network and abroad - this is obvious. </p>

    <h2>  Special rates </h2><p>  Therefore, those who are looking for a profitable tariff for a tablet (Beeline) are invited to switch to the ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù option. It costs only 400 rubles per month. For this money, the user is given about 4 GB of traffic and the ability to connect TV to their gadget. the service is all over Russia, and it should be recognized that it is the most optimal in terms of the ratio of cost and benefit received by the user, and it is not for nothing that this tariff is considered one of the most popular. </p><p>  Other more expensive service packages are also considered specialized for tablet devices.  They include 3 more tariff plans that are different from each other, again, in terms of data volume and price.  We are talking about ‚ÄúHighway 8 GB‚Äù, ‚ÄúHighway 12 GB‚Äù, ‚ÄúHighway 20 GB‚Äù.  These three plans make it possible to receive 8 GB, 12 GB and 20 GB of Internet traffic for your device per month, respectively.  The cost is 600, 700 and 1200 rubles per month. </p><p>  It should be noted that in conjunction with each of the described tariffs, the ‚ÄúInternet Forever‚Äù tariff (for tablet) promoted by Beeline is proposed.  As part of it, the user is given 200 megabytes per month for free testing of connection speed. </p>

    <h2>  Packet of traffic ‚Äúon trial‚Äù </h2><p>  In order to get acquainted with the connection speed provided by the operator, Beeline offers its customers to connect a ‚Äútrial‚Äù packet of traffic with a capacity of 200 megabytes free of charge. </p><p>  It is called "The Internet Forever."  This is a specially designed ‚Äúfamiliarization" (provided by Beeline) tariff for the tablet.  Unlimited traffic for working with mail goes with it - it is very convenient if you do not plan to buy a more expensive Highway. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  The objective of our article is to help determine the choice of the most optimal (for various key parameters) options.  These include the cost and volume of services that the subscriber will receive.  You can compare the first and second with the help of a banal analysis of your needs. </p><p>  So, decide what exactly interests you - the ability to sit on social networks, watch TV shows or play multiplayer ‚Äútoys‚Äù.  Depending on what you do with your tablet, you can predict how much traffic will suit you. </p>

    <p>  For example, in most cases, subscribers prefer the minimum 4 GB ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù package or the next one, giving 8 GB of traffic.  As a rule, this amount of data is enough to perform the bulk of the tasks.  You can spend more only if you really spend most of your time on the tablet, downloading bulky files or watching videos that are large in volume. </p><p>  If a package for 4 or 8 GB does not suit you, and you are looking for some unlimited solution, we are forced to upset you.  The largest package provided is the Highway 20 GB.  It is characterized as the most expensive tariff (Beeline) for a tablet in Russia.  You can actually spend this data packet only if you constantly and regularly download some large files. </p>

    <h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  There are several ways to activate the package of your choice on your device.  The first and easiest is to contact a specialist in a communication salon.  Bring your tablet with a pre-installed ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù card, and the consultant will help you set up communication on your device.  It takes 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  Another way is to activate the package using the operator.  Call 1188 (Beeline hotline), and they will certainly help you switch to the selected tariff. </p><p>  The third and fourth methods (respectively) are connecting the service using the Internet account, as well as activating the option by a short digital request.  The latter service makes it possible to switch to the tariff as quickly as possible.  To do this, just dial the number indicated on the option page (on the official website).  To go to ‚ÄúHighway 20 GB‚Äù, for example, this number is 06740999. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, we have listed all the tariffs presented on the operator‚Äôs official website that are available to the subscriber.  As you can see, they assume the existence of a whole grid, which includes the tariffs developed by Beeline for tablets, built on the principle of ‚Äúsmaller to larger‚Äù, where the simplest is a package that gives 4 GB of traffic at a price of 400 rubles, and the most ‚Äútricked out ‚Äù- 20 GB for 1200 rubles per month.  Thus, the client is given the opportunity to make a choice as to which plan is optimal for him. </p>
