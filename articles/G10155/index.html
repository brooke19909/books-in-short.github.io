    <p>  The hotel is old, but recently renovated in all rooms of the 2nd building.  Cleaning is done daily.  Double-glazed windows perfectly protect against all external noise.  Even in the rooms located above the stage, almost nothing is heard.  But inside, the audibility is wonderful.  The walls are thin, so everything that happens in the corridor or in the next room is audible.  For those who go to bed early, it is better to choose rooms with windows to the backyard.  Near the pool in the evenings they conduct animation, the music plays very loudly until the very night. </p><p>  Air conditioners are working, work well.  The only drawback is the lack of a hairdryer.  Plumbing is working properly.  Bed linen and towels are changed daily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The safe in the room can be used for 1 euro + a deposit for keys, which is returned upon eviction. </p><p>  Internet can be used at the reception for free, in the rooms - for money. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The work of the staff is commendable.  The Spaniards are very friendly and responsive to any requests.  At the reception several Russian administrators work.  The rest speak English.  There should not be problems with explanation. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The food at the hotel is very good.  In large quantities there is always fruit.  The assortment includes apples, bananas, melon, oranges, peaches, nectarines, pineapples, plums, cherries, pears and strawberries.  The breakfast menu is monotonous, but the dishes are very tasty and hearty.  The downside is the quality of sausages and juices, which are more like diluted drinks.  But there is always something to replace these products and at the same time not to remain hungry.  Many tourists recommend taking breakfast only at the hotel.  There are many restaurants in the district with reasonable prices and good food.  But you can eat in the hotel restaurant.  On Friday, a real feast of the stomach is organized here, and even all visitors receive free champagne.  You can take food with you.  Meals are served until the close of the restaurant.  It does not matter when you arrive for breakfast or dinner, all dishes will be available. </p><p>  There are queues in the restaurant in the evenings, but they do not apply to hotel customers. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  After only 10 minutes, you will find yourself on a wonderful small beach "Copelance".  The large beach is a little longer to go, and it is not so cozy.  The sea is above all praise.  The water is warm and crystal clear.  The sand contains quartz, which quickly settles to the bottom, so even with a storm the water remains clear.  The beach is sandy, equipped with everything necessary.  There are shops and cafes along the way.  There are several options for how to get to the beach: go down a steep staircase or go around it on the right, turn left and go up a gentle hill. </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  Reviews of the hotel Calypso Hotel 3 * (Costa Daurada) indicate its favorable location.  The complex occupies the largest territory of all the hotels nearby.  Own space is a huge advantage.  Other hotels are located right on the road.  Very close is the stop.  You can take the bus to Terragona and other nearby cities. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2>

    <p>  Entertainment programs are held daily, but only in Spanish.  Animators organize interesting contests, conduct sports, water aerobics and activities with children.  In the evening, interesting shows are organized near the pool. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Excursions are more profitable to book on site.  This is several times cheaper than taking from domestic tour operators.  Many Spanish agents understand Russian very well, and some even speak it.  Near the hotel there is a tour desk with good prices and service. </p><p>  Tourists recommend visiting Mount Montserrat, go on a sightseeing tour of Valencia.  You can go to Barcelona.  Local agencies have the opportunity to purchase tickets to PortAventura Park, and they cost less than in the park itself.  After the first tour, discounts are available for all subsequent ones. </p><p>  For independent trips, it is more profitable to purchase a mini-pass for 10 trips.  If necessary, it can be replenished.  A card costs about 10 euros, and one bus ride costs 2 euros. </p><p>  A map showing all local attractions is available at the hotel. </p><h2>  Holiday Tips </h2><ol><li>  To be always in touch, it is recommended to purchase a local SIM card worth 10 euros.  This money will be in your account.  The card is drawn up according to the passport, a copy of which can be made at the reception. </li><li>  Those who smoke should take cigarettes with them.  Here they cost 4 times more expensive. </li><li>  Spain is famous for its sangria wine.  It is better to buy it in plastic bottles.  Near the hotel there is a small Rex store with cheap goods.  There you can buy good quality sangria and at the lowest price. </li><li>  Experienced travelers recommend visiting the restaurant "Wok", located near the city park.  For 12 euros, you can order a huge number of sea delicacies that are prepared before your eyes. </li></ol><h2>  Compliments of the hotel Medplaya Hotel Calypso </h2><p>  Regular guests of the hotel can participate in the bonus program and get an Amigo Card accumulative card for free.  Accumulated points can be calculated for the services provided by the hotel.  The card can be issued on site by sending a request by e-mail to the hotel. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Medplaya Hotel Calypso 3 * (Spain, Costa Dorada) deserves a lot of positive reviews for several reasons.  Firstly, it is extremely favorably located and has its own territory.  Secondly, friendly staff who have a good understanding of the Russian language work here.  Nearby is a beautiful beach and many shops and cafes.  The hotel has well thought out leisure travelers.  Here you can eat and play games.  But the main plus of the Medplaya Hotel Calypso 3 * hotel is the prices.  Spain is not a cheap country, but a person with average income can afford a trip to this complex.  The cost of living per person per day is approximately 5000 rubles.  Good discounts are available during low season, especially if you book your accommodation in advance.  In Spain, even in winter, you can relax, especially for residents of the post-Soviet space. </p>
