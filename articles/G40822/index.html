    <p>  Where exactly to look for the <span>Highland Beach Resort 3 *</span> hotel <span>?</span>  Candolim (Candolim) is a cozy resort village in the northern part of Goa, which is located right on the beach.  It was here, among the greenery of palm trees, that the small but incredibly beautiful and comfortable Highland Hotel was built.  The <span>international airport</span> is about 50 km away.  Naturally, the hotel provides its guests with transportation, but it is still worth preparing for the move.  By the way, about 22 km is a railway station. </p><p>  The hotel is located away from the bustling main street.  Nevertheless, there are many shops, cafes, restaurants and even two large supermarkets nearby, which is very convenient.  The hotel itself consists of small four-story buildings built in the <span>colonial style.</span>  Almost the entire courtyard is reserved for gardens and small pools.  Reviews say that the territory here is beautiful, well-groomed and very clean, which is important for India. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Highland Beach Resort 3 * (Goa): what do the living rooms look like? </h2>
