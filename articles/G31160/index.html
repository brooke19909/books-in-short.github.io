    <h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  In order to have the most complete picture of the hotel, you should familiarize yourself with the opinions of former guests.  So, we are studying the reviews.  Bravo Garden attracts many tourists thanks to the excellent work of the staff.  People praise the hotel infrastructure and service.  There is a fun nightlife at the hotel.  All guests write that it is possible to have a great time without going beyond Bravo Garden (Hammamet).  Former residents like the proposed kitchen and several establishments located on the territory of the hotel, which allow you to change the usual atmosphere and spend free time.  Families devote their feedback to animation, which helps diversify leisure activities not only for adults, but also for small tourists.  Also, special attention is paid to the clean beach with a shallow approach, which ensures safety for swimming with children. </p><h2>  tour cost </h2><p>  Agents offer several accommodation options for those who are interested in holidays in Tunisia (all inclusive), but most tourists choose Bravo Garden.  The price of the tour varies from 1,500 to 5,000 rubles per day.  The cost depends on the availability of the "All Inclusive" system, the number of days spent in the hotel, room category and flight distance.  The hotel website always has more detailed information.  There, if you wish, you can independently book your favorite room.  If we talk about travel agencies, it should be borne in mind that last minute trips always cost an order of magnitude cheaper than the initial offer, but sometimes the date of departure does not coincide with the potential guest.  This option is relevant for people with a large vacation or part-time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Tunisia all inclusive" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21909/475592.jpg" width="600"></div>
