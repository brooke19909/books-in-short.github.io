But still her activity is much lower than in the warm season.  There are even times when the predator does not bite at all, but experienced anglers know how to catch pike in the winter, and always be with the catch. </p><p>  In spring, pikes emerge from the depths to the edge of the ice in search of food and attack every little thing.  In summer, the pike goes deeper and looks for prey for itself from reeds, pitfalls and other similar shelters.  In winter, she prowls everywhere in search of food.  During the first ice, all spinning lures that are used in the summer can be the pike bait during the first ice, but catching the pike in the winter with the balancer is the most common option for hunting such large and <span>predatory fish.</span>  These gears are used with the arrival of the first ice. </p><p>  It is best to catch a pike in the morning, during the day, even in the late evening, but only not at night, at night it is not caught on such tackle.  The balancer allows you to fish, both in shallow water and in depth.  In order not to ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúHow to catch a pike in winter?‚Äù, It makes sense to acquire such universal gear.  Experienced fishermen know <span>how to catch pike;</span> in winter, the best bait for this insidious predator is the balancer.  It is for this reason that it is very popular, in good demand and, one might say, one of the very first leaders as a bait.  The most versatile balancer for pike can reach 7 cm, its coloring should be green, yellow, and silver tones.  There is one drawback with the balancers, although not significant, they are often with poor setup.  To catch pike, you need the bait to play, measured, monotonously - this attracts a curious predator and makes it act.  The color of the bait is also very important, it is advisable to choose it for the color of roach, if okushka, then for okushka and so on. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not all novice fishermen know how to catch a pike in the winter on swaying lures.  This version of tackle brings excellent results, they allow you to catch pike in open water and also when fishing during ice.  The best time to flash pike is the first, but lasting ice.  Some anglers use artificial baits, the disadvantages are the following: you need to adapt to each artificially made bait, but if you use high-quality baits, there will be no such problems.  If, when fishing for <span>oscillating baits,</span> gatherings went, you can add another triplet to the upper bobbin ring, and thereby reduce the number of gatherings. </p><p>  <span>In the winter, pike fishing is the</span> most common occurrence.  There are a lot of ways and options for luring a predator, but the most successful is laying the spinners on the bottom.  After the baits are laid, you need to loosen the fishing line, after which we make a strong jerk and again all over again.  With this method of fishing, you must try to make a jerk higher, do not forget to give complete slack after the bait is at the bottom.  A pike takes a lure only when it falls, and after it has fallen a pike does not touch it. </p><p>  Lighter spinners are best because they smoothly drop in this game.  There are days when a pike is caught only in this way, in the form of a game.  The lure must be put back after each stroke, the fish takes it only when it drowns.  Pike is very fond of heavy narrow baits, made of silver and <span>stainless steel,</span> connected by solder, and carefully polished, such, you can say, home-made baits during testing should play a little bit in different directions.  To catch pike, the fishing line must be strong, it is hooked to a metal leash with a length of at least 15 cm. </p><p>  Some people think that it‚Äôs difficult to catch pike in winter, but it‚Äôs completely wrong, everything remains as before: baits can also be used in summer, you just need to check the lure in winter, it should play well with a vertical fish offer.  This is an important point, it must be taken into account so as not to be left without a catch and not to wonder: ‚ÄúHow to catch a pike in winter?‚Äù </p>
