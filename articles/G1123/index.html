According to statistics, the troops of the USSR became a direct participant in about 30 local wars both on the territory of the state and beyond its territorial limits.  Moreover, the form of participation was both indirect and direct. </p><h2>  What is a local war </h2><p>  Foreign and domestic policy of the state can be implemented by various methods.  Someone resorts to a peaceful settlement of controversial issues, someone to an armed confrontation.  Speaking about the military conflict, it should be noted that this is a policy that is conducted using modern weapons.  Armed conflict includes all the confrontations: large-scale clashes, interstate, regional, local wars, etc. Let us consider the latter in more detail. </p>

    <p>  Local wars take place between a limited circle of participants.  In the standard classification, this type of confrontation implies the participation of two states that pursue certain political or economic goals in this confrontation.  At the same time, a military conflict is unfolding in the territory of only these entities, affecting and violating their interests.  Thus, local wars and armed conflicts are a particular and general of a single concept. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 608px; height: 598px;"><caption>  Local wars with the participation of the Soviet army </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Name of armed conflict </td><td>  date </td></tr><tr><td>  <span>Chinese Civil War</span> </td><td>  1946-1950 </td></tr><tr><td>  War in korea </td><td>  1950-1953 </td></tr><tr><td>  Hungarian crisis </td><td>  1956 </td></tr><tr><td>  War in laos </td><td>  1960-1970 </td></tr><tr><td>  Mine clearance in Algeria </td><td>  1962-1964 </td></tr><tr><td>  Caribbean crisis </td><td>  1962-1963 </td></tr><tr><td>  Yemen Civil War </td><td>  1962-1969 </td></tr><tr><td>  War in vietnam </td><td>  1965-1974 </td></tr><tr><td>  Middle East Conflicts </td><td>  1967-1973 </td></tr><tr><td>  Czechoslovak crisis </td><td>  1968 </td></tr><tr><td>  Civil war in mozambique </td><td>  1967, 1969, 1975-79. </td></tr><tr><td>  War in Afghanistan </td><td>  1979-1989 </td></tr><tr><td>  Chadian-Libyan conflict </td><td>  1987 year </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  The role of the USSR in the war in Korea </h2><p>  Local conflicts of the Cold War The table of historical dates includes the most diverse.  However, this list opens with the <span>war in Korea</span> from 1950 to 1953.  This war is a confrontation between South Korea and the DPRK.  The main ally of South Korea was the <span>United States of America,</span> providing the army with the latest technology.  In addition, the United States was to form 4 offensive divisions, which supported its Korean ally. </p><p>  The USSR initially took a passive part in the armed conflict, but after the secret plans of the United States became available, the phase of the war moved into a more active direction.  The USSR not only supported the DPRK, but also planned to transfer its own contingent to the territory of the ally. </p>

    <p>  According to official figures, the losses of the Soviet military in this conflict reached from 200 to 500 thousand personnel.  Veterans of local wars, in particular, in Korea received the honorary title of Hero of the USSR.  The most famous personalities of the <span>Korean War</span> include Pepeliaev Evgeny Georgievich, Kramarenko Sergey Makarovich, who showed boundless courage and courage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The role of the USSR in the Vietnam War </h2><p>  Speaking about the Russian war, we should not forget about the role of the Soviet state in the war in Vietnam.  The military conflict of 1959-1975 is dated.  The determinant of the conflict was the claim of the Republic of Vietnam to the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.  With the help of the United States, which supplied equipment and financial resources, the southerners began punitive operations in the territory of a neighboring state. </p><p>  In 1964, the United States began to actively participate in armed conflict.  A colossal American contingent was deployed to Vietnam, which used prohibited weapons in the fight against the enemy.  When using napalm, biological and <span>chemical weapons</span> , shelling of residential areas was carried out, which caused numerous casualties among the civilian population. </p>

    <p>  Despite the efforts of the patriotic forces, the air battle against the United States was lost.  The situation was corrected by strategic and military assistance to the USSR.  Thanks to the support, air defense was launched, which allowed the local wars in Vietnam to be converted to a more passive form.  As a result of the war, a single state was recreated, called the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The final date for the end of the confrontation is April 30, 1975. </p><p>  Kolesnik Nikolai Nikolaevich, a sergeant of the Soviet army, as well as senior lieutenants Bulgakov Vladimir Leonidovich and Harin Valentin Nikolaevich distinguished themselves in the Vietnam conflict.  The soldiers were presented to the Order of the Red Banner. </p><h2>  The role of the USSR in the Middle East conflict </h2><p>  Arab-Israeli confrontations are the longest running Cold War local conflicts.  The table of dates indicates that the confrontation is not completed until today, periodically appearing in fierce battles between states. </p><p>  The beginning of the conflict dates back to 1948, after a new state was formed - Israel.  On May 15, an armed clash took place between Israel, the US of which was an ally, and Arab countries supported by the USSR.  The main conflict was accompanied by the transition of territories from one state to another.  Thus, in particular, Israel was able to capture the religiously important province of Jordan for the Palestinians. </p>

    <p>  The USSR played the most active role in this conflict.  Thus, at the request of senior Arab officials, the Soviet Union provided substantial military assistance to the allied countries.  An air defense division was deployed on the territory of states, thanks to which it was possible to contain the onslaught of Israel and the United States.  As a result, Popov K.I.  and Kutintsev N.M. were presented for valor and courage to the title of <span>Hero of the Soviet Union.</span> </p><h2>  The role of the USSR in the war in Afghanistan </h2><p>  1978 was marked by a coup in Afghanistan.  The Democratic Party came to power, which was strongly supported by the Soviet Union.  The main course was taken to build socialism in the image of the USSR.  However, such a <span>radical turn of</span> events caused a negative response among the local population and the Muslim clergy. </p><p>  The US acted as a counterweight to the new government.  It was with the help of America that the National Front for the Liberation of Afghanistan was created.  Under their auspices, numerous coups were carried out in the largest cities of the state.  This fact caused a new war of Russia in Afghanistan. </p>

    <p>  According to evidence, in the Afghan war, the Soviet Union lost more than 14 thousand people.  300 soldiers are missing.  About 35 thousand people were seriously injured in fierce battles. </p><h2>  Features of local conflicts during the Cold War </h2><p>  Summing up, we can draw some conclusions. </p><p>  First, all armed confrontations were coalitional in nature.  In other words, the warring parties found allies in the person of two large hegemons - the USSR and the USA. </p><p>  Secondly, during local conflicts, more modern methods of warfare and unique weapons began to be used, which confirmed the policy of the ‚Äúarms race‚Äù. </p><p>  Thirdly, all wars, despite their local character, brought significant economic, cultural and human losses.  States parties to conflicts have been slowed down for a long time in their political and economic development. </p>
