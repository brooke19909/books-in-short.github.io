It is located in Thailand, on the largest island of the country - Phuket.  The facade and sign of the hotel are decorated with five stars.  But is it worth counting on a chic vacation in the Lagoon Holiday Club?  In our assessment of the hotel, we were not only guided by the information taken from the brochures, but also took into account the reviews of those tourists who have already visited this hotel. </p><p>  What can be said instead of entry?  The fact that this hotel is one of the constituent parts of the hotel complex “Laguna Phuket”.  In addition to the “Clab”, there are also no less chic “Banyan Tree”, “Sheraton Grand Laguna”, “Dusit Thani”, “Laguna Beach Resort”, “Allamanda” and a group of private villas and cottages Laguna Phuket Holiday Residence.  The whole complex occupies a vast territory, stylized as a tropical garden.  Hotel guests are free to walk around all the Phuket Lagoon hotels.  This is not only forbidden, but encouraged.  The complex is adjacent to a turquoise lagoon and emerald golf courses.  You can walk to the sea in eight minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Laguna Holiday Club Phuket Resort 5 * is in the center of the hotel complex.  And he, in turn, is located on the western tip of the island of Phuket.  “Laguna Holiday Club 5 *” is a second-line hotel.  The wonderful <span>Bang Tao</span> Bay <span>Beach is</span> five hundred meters away.  This, as it may seem to some, a fair amount of distance can be overcome at one of the hotel’s free electric cars, which run there constantly from morning to evening.  Near the complex is a golf club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And <span>Phuket</span> International <span>Airport</span> is located just thirty kilometers away.  This is the ideal distance to quickly get to the place after a tiring flight, but at the same time not hear the roar of the starting and landing airliners. </p><p>  Bang Tao resort itself is very peculiar.  Only wealthy people, eager for impeccable service, have a rest here.  And most of them live in the Laguna Phuket complex.  If you want to plunge into the bustling nightlife of Bangla Road, then get to Patong no more than twenty minutes by taxi. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  At the Laguna Holiday Club 5 * hotel you can rent bicycles for free to sweep through the vast territory of the complex.  What a vacation in Thailand without a quality massage?  And, of course, there is one in the hotel.  Reviews say that it is very diverse: with aromatic oils, and medicinal (for medical reasons), and faces, and for feet, with fish. </p><p>  At the Laguna Phuket complex you can play golf and ride a horse.  For those who monitor their tonus, a fitness room with free exercise machines is open. </p><p>  The hotel has a tour desk where you can book fascinating trips around the island.  There are also parties in the evenings and entertainment programs. </p><p>  The administration of the hotel provided gifts and compliments for the newlyweds and birthday people. </p><h2>  Excursions and travels in the surroundings </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Laguna hotel complex looks like a small town, reviews strongly recommend sometimes leaving the Laguna Holiday Club 5 *.  Phuket is too interesting an island to devote the entire vacation on it to the beach.  Excursions can be ordered both at the hotel and in street travel agencies (which is cheaper).  The most popular are day trips.  It can be diving, freshwater and sea fishing.  Tourists praised excursions to the <span>Similan Islands,</span> James Bond Rock, Khao Lak, Khao Sok safari and Lake Cheolan.  For those who are especially brave, rafting on rafts or a trip through the jungle on ATVs are suitable.  But if you want to see the islands of Phi Phi, then tourists are advised to look for a two-day excursion.  But the cheapest thing is to see the sights on your own, especially if you know how to drive a motobike. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Laguna Holiday Club Phuket Resort 5 stars on the facade is quite deserved.  Service at the hotel is impeccable, cleanliness, beauty, nothing to complain about.  And this despite the fact that the “Laguna Holiday Club” is the most modest in the constellation of the brilliant and luxurious hotels of the complex.  But for relatively little money, tourists can use the services and infrastructure of more expensive boutique hotels. </p>
