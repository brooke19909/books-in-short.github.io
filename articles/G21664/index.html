    <h2>  Why is it worth visiting this marvelous place? </h2><p>  So, the dolphinarium in Sevastopol ... By the way, he is not even there, there are two of them at once.  Why is it worth coming there?  There are not one, but several reasons.  Firstly, Sevastopol is located on the sea, and the dolphins that live there, grew up in their natural marine environment, so they feel more familiar and more relaxed.  Secondly, this is a good reason to visit a beautiful city on the sea coast.  And for locals, the dolphinarium in Sevastopol (the one that is in Artbuht) even offers a 50% discount! </p><p>  Perhaps the best service for such unusual pools is dolphin therapy.  Its essence lies in communication with dolphins, which is clear from the name.  Such a pastime is useful because during a therapy session a person experiences positive emotions that help him recover from a variety of diseases.  Dolphins are very friendly and sympathetic towards people.  They are glad to communicate, because they need it no less than a person.  Ultrasound waves that help mammals communicate with each other are beneficial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Dolphinarium in Cossack Bay </h2><p>  Such a service is offered not by one dolphinarium in Sevastopol, but by two at once.  One is located in the Art Bay, and the second - in the Cossack Bay.  Each of them would be worth dwelling in more detail.  In principle, both in one and in the second they offer to <span>swim with dolphins.</span>  However, in Artbuh you can also watch the performance of animals, while the second dolphinarium does not offer these services.  Cossack Bay (Sevastopol) - the location of the State Oceanarium of Ukraine.  There for more than 15 years there have been studies in the field of dolphin therapy.  And not unsuccessfully.  Since the beginning of research, numerous confirmations of the improvements that this type of treatment brings have already been received. </p><p>  Dolphinarium in Sevastopol, which is located in Cossack Bay, offers various programs aimed at improving.  The benefits of being in salted, saline seawater, as well as swimming and socializing with animals will be irreplaceable and immediate.  Sessions are held under the strict guidance of doctors, psychologists and animal trainers. </p><p>  In the summer season, which lasts from June to September, the dolphinarium is open-air.  And since October, the action is transferred to the pool under the roof.  But what is remarkable is that it also has sea water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The dolphinarium is equipped with the latest technology, thanks to which the pool temperature is constantly maintained at around 25 degrees.  In addition, water is constantly being purified using a special new system. </p>

    <h2>  Dolphinarium in Artbuht </h2><p>  However, it is impossible to look at the performances of dolphins in Cossack Bay.  To do this, you will have to go to Artbukhta.  There, the inhabitants of the sea will happily demonstrate their art.  Professional trainers are engaged with them.  In total, the staff of the dolphinarium has more than 30 people. </p><p>  By the way, dolphins are kept there in completely safe conditions for them.  So, they do not live in ordinary sea water.  In the pool where they live, a special filter is installed that maintains the purity of water and the necessary content of trace elements in it. </p><p>  By the way, dolphin therapy services in Artbuht also provide.  There you can swim with animals in the pool, the depth of which is 5 meters.  Therefore, the ability to swim is a prerequisite for visiting the dolphinarium.  And children are allowed there only from the age of five.  On the basis of the complex there is a research institute, as well as a center in which assistance is provided to sick whales and dolphins. </p><h2>  Ticket price </h2><p>  If you still decide to visit the dolphinarium in Sevastopol, the prices may pleasantly surprise you.  The entrance ticket to the performance will cost 400 rubles for an adult and 200 rubles for a child.  But swimming with a dolphin will cost a little more, for 5 minutes you will have to pay 2 thousand rubles. </p><p>  This applies to the dolphinarium in Artbuhte.  If we talk about the second, located in Cossack Bay, then the prices here are slightly different.  For 8 minutes in the pool with a dolphin you will need to give a thousand rubles. </p>
