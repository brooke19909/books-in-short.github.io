    <p>  In order to become a psychoanalyst, it is not enough to get only the appropriate education, you need to replenish your knowledge in this area for a long time, have experience in a variety of training work.  The professional activity of a psychoanalyst can begin even <span>during the training process,</span> but under the guidance of an experienced certified analyst and supervisor who will correctly guide the course of activities, it will help to resolve complex situations in working with clients in a timely manner. </p><p>  A novice analyst with the observance of all ethical standards can submit the essence of his work to a discussion by a supervisor group led by a practical teacher. </p><p>  A psychoanalyst in Russia can receive the following forms of certificates: specialist, training analyst, supervisor.  All these types of professional activities have strictly regulated requirements.  So, the status of a specialist in the field of psychoanalysis can be assigned to those who: </p><p>  - has a higher <span>humanitarian education</span> with a volume of at least 1800 hours (psychological, pedagogical, medical, etc.); </p><p>  - mastered theoretical training or advanced training in the field of psychoanalysis (500 hours) with the study of disciplines on the history of psychoanalysis, theories and techniques of analysis, on the practical use of transference and countertransference, resistance and <span>psychological defense</span> ; </p><p>  - 250 hours of personal analysis passed in order to eliminate personal problems and gain experience in participating in the psychoanalytic process with the development of resistances and transfers (in contrast to conventional psychoanalysis, the training option can take place in double hours with a discussion of the techniques of the work with the analyzer); </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Received 150 hours of supervisor support from experienced and certified psychoanalysts in the process of starting <span>work with clients.</span> </p><p>  Professional activity in the status of a specialist involves the annual update of knowledge at international seminars, participation in congresses in related specialties, as well as social work in psychoanalytic societies and associations.  Each training and professional development must be confirmed by an appropriate document. </p><p>  The structure of the psychoanalyst‚Äôs professional activity in the status of a training analyst is similar to the <span>structure of a</span> specialist‚Äôs <span>activity</span> , but to obtain a certificate, you must have at least 5 years of practical work in this area.  To be able to generalize their knowledge, and conduct at least 2 years of teaching work (lectures, seminars) at the Institute for the Training of Psychologists-Psychoanalysts or in psychoanalytic regional or federal centers.  A training analyst must have at least 300 hours of supervision, which are recorded in the form of reports of supervisors and provided to a parent organization. </p><p>  The professional activity of the applicant for supervisor status is complemented by the fact that the psychoanalyst has been conducting supervision (individual or group) for 2 years in one of the higher educational institutions or training centers.  The presence of scientific work and publications in peer-reviewed and journalistic journals is encouraged and taken into account. </p><p>  If there are no certified specialists in the region where psychoanalysis training is conducted, you can receive supervision from specialists from other regions by phone, via Skype or during on-site seminars.  The professional activity of a psychoanalyst constantly requires the development and control of other specialists who are united by the Russian community in associations or societies.  Young specialists are constantly supported by experienced both in the learning process and at the beginning of professional activity. </p>
