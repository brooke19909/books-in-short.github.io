    <p>  The wallet allows you to store available types of cryptocurrencies, as well as invest them in managing traders.  Dividends are paid every week.  The main advantage of the project is its openness and transparency.  Service management is well-known and public people.  The name of the CEO will become known a little later.  It will be kept secret until the launch of the final testing of the site. </p><p>  In reviews of Alfa Cache, a lot of software errors are noted that visitors to the resource encounter.  All defects are corrected as they are identified.  The technical support team is actively working to improve usability and functional leaving service.  Beginners praised the abundance of instructions set forth in an understandable and accessible language for the average person.  You can find them in your project account.  The design of the site is concise.  It is not annoying and does not interfere with navigation. </p><p>  In early August 2017, the platform became available to users from Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  Registration in the system is performed by a special code, which is an invitation.  For several months, authoritative individuals and experts <span>in the cryptocurrency market have</span> joined the project <span>.</span>  Service offices are based in Almaty, Yekaterinburg.

    <p>  To become an investor, you need to go through the authorization procedure.  Users are advised to enter real information when entering the email address and contact phone number.  For the system to accept the application, you need to enter the code that the registrar issued in the special field.  Judging by the reviews of the Alfa Cash project, no one has problems at this stage.  If all actions are performed correctly, then the name of the registrar that issued the code will appear under the digital number. </p><p>  To send an application, you need to check the boxes in all windows.  Users note that it takes several minutes to receive a text message that contains a verification PIN.  The cipher is sent to the phone number which was specified during registration.  After confirming the identity, the site visitor gets access to your personal account.  To get started, you need to replenish your personal account.  If you believe the numerous reviews on the Alfa Cash project, the amount should be minimal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Recently (an abundance of complaints confirms this), money has been delayed.  It can be several hours.  Therefore, do not panic.  After the funds arrive at the balance of the system, you should proceed to the formation of the portfolio.  Users praised the ability to automatically renew investment.  This option allows them to earn income every week.  And they do not take any action for this. </p><p>  Speaking about the service, inexperienced investors confuse it with the Cash Back program from Alfa Bank.  Card reviews have nothing to do with cryptocurrency transactions.  As part of this offer, the credit institution returns part of the purchase price to the client‚Äôs account.  Other financial projects have similar options.  At the moment, Russian banks do not provide cryptocurrency services to individuals.  That is why the Alfa Cash project is unique and in demand. </p><h2>  Creating a contribution </h2>

    <p>  Real reviews of Alfa Cash are full of enthusiastic comments from customers who have received their first profit.  If you believe the forecasts of experienced investors, then at the end of the month even a beginner will increase his starting capital by fifteen percent.  You can also add to this amount the income that the service of automatic placement and extension of investments brings.  In their comments, customers of the site clearly demonstrate the profit received for a certain period of use of the resource. </p><p>  Even in the shortest possible time, people managed to earn about eight percent.  This means that the amount of their monthly profit will exceed 10%.  Having accumulated virtual funds in a personal account, money can be withdrawn in three months.  An operation is a sale of a portfolio.  In cryptocurrency reviews and Alfa Cash, we strongly recommend choosing ETH or bitcoins.  Their yield, according to recent data, exceeds the promised 15%.  The cost of these units is growing steadily.  The price is expected to reach 200%. </p><h2>  Partnership programs </h2>

    <p>  Users describe the statuses that are available to customers of the service after registration.  Everyone starts with Novice.  It allows you to make a profit of 2 to 5%.  True, it implies a number of limits.  You can withdraw from the system no more than 500 USD.  It is only allowed to deposit USD 1500 to the account balance.  The status "Promoter" is assigned to those users who have contributed 2500 USD. </p><p>  When comparing interest rates, do not confuse the profitability of the Alpha Cash service with the accruals made by Alfa Bank.  Reviews about the cache are often misleading to those who are taking their first steps in investing in cryptocurrency portfolios.  The fault is the consonance of the names of these projects.  Returning to the status of the virtual system, it should be recalled that in their comments, investors insist that not everybody receives a bonus of 300 USD.  It is issued only after working capital exceeds 10 000 USD. </p><p>  Customers discuss restrictions that many consider unfair.  Having the status of "Promoter", you can enter only 2000 USD, and get on hand - 750 USD.  As soon as the capital exceeds USD 30,000, the participants of the system become ‚ÄúProtector‚Äù.  Bonus bonus is 1000 USD.  In this case, the limits will be increased.  Users of the site say that it will be possible to withdraw 1000 USD, and transfer to the balance - 3000 USD. </p><p>  The most valuable are the status of ‚ÄúPremier‚Äù and ‚ÄúCo-Founder‚Äù.  They suggest several levels of profitability with the least stringent limits on deposit and withdrawal of funds.  In reviews of the Alpha Cash platform, investors report their desire to achieve the highest rating.  This is a mentor bonus.  It allows you to receive ten percent of the total income of all the lower members of the partnership. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2>

    <p>  The main advantage of the service, according to Internet users, is the ability to open deposits in various electronic currencies.  A public team of developers and project management is an additional guarantee of transparency and honesty of the business.  The absence of referral links helps to minimize the artificial growth of affiliate networks. </p><p>  People‚Äôs reviews of Alfa Cash include information that the company, which is the founder of the project, has a physical address that is registered in Hong Kong.  The process of opening additional branches and representative offices is carried out at the expense of the parent organization.  The absence of additional conversion reduces costs and increases investor profit. </p><p>  You can earn in the system not only on the Bitcoin course, but also on ether fluctuations.  Judging by the reviews of reputable experts, today Alpha Cash is the only project of this type.  The limits of some users are annoying, while others praised the restrictions imposed by the administration.  They are able to extend the term return on investment. </p><h2>  We speak correctly </h2><p>  In the search for comprehensive information about earning on the Web, some are faced with a substitution of concepts.  The services of the Alpha Cash service are often confused with the Alfa Cash Ultra banking product.  Reviews confirm this.  The latter is designed for individual entrepreneurs and merchants. </p><p>  As part of this proposal, entrepreneurs and representatives of legal entities have the opportunity to cash out amounts that do not exceed 10 million rubles.  The commission does not tax payments up to 2,000,000 rubles.  This program has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.  She does not offer the exchange or opening of virtual wallets.  It is impossible to form a portfolio and invest in bitcoins in it. </p><h2>  Negative experience </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of advantages, the Alpha Cash service is not without drawbacks.  Customers complain about the delay of transactions, which are ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and are not displayed.  When replenishing the deposit, the balance increases after a few hours, which is unacceptable for a virtual service.  The Alpha Cash company, reviews of which contain statements about the imperfection of the system, promises to correct all errors and shortcomings identified during testing. </p><p>  There were dissatisfied with the lack of a referral system that excludes quick earnings.  The affiliate program provides for substantial payments that jeopardize the existence of the service.  True, so far this problem has been solved by introducing tight limits on replenishing the balance and withdrawing money.  To become part of the community, you need to request a registration code. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Despite the presence of pessimistic comments, the service has earned a lot of positive ratings.  Today, investors see it as the main and most progressive tool for Internet earnings.  When an affiliate code is published in open sources, the system allows its owner to be blacklisted.  An exception is the placement of the code on the pages of a personal resource. </p><p>  The maximum waiting period for incoming funds to the account in the system does not exceed two days.  The possibility of replenishing the balance with bank cards is not provided.  Experienced users recommend using special exchange points.  It is allowed to deposit to the account bitcoins, ethers and other types of cryptocurrencies.  In their reviews and reviews about Alfa Cash, service customers claim that for the week in November of this year they received a profit of 8.4 and 9.8 USD. </p><p>  At the end of November, according to official information, the project staff carried out a large-scale modernization of the system.  All innovations received positive feedback and were welcomed with gratitude.  Customers hope for further development of the project.  In their comments, they ask management to launch a feature that will allow them to display investment portfolios. </p><h2>  Nuances and comments </h2><p>  System participants note problems with the withdrawal of funds and fixing of payment details.  Investors report the successful withdrawal of funds earned in a week.  Rumor has it that Alfa Cash will enter the financial market in Latin America and Europe very soon.  In the first half of 2018, the service will be presented in Chile and Argentina, and later will appear in Mexico and Brazil. </p><p>  The Internet is actively discussing the estimated lifetime of the project.  Some give him no more than a year.  Others believe that Alpha Cash has a successful future.  If the administration‚Äôs plans are implemented, the project will be able to attract a huge number of new investors.  This will give an impetus to the development of the service at a qualitatively different level.  It will become a global system that exchanges all existing cryptocurrencies in the world. </p><h2>  Receiving a profit </h2><p>  At the moment, funds are transferred to the personal accounts of clients in manual mode, which explains the numerous failures and delays.  To request a payment, you need to use the settings menu.  After specifying the currency, click on the output button.  After receiving a system message that the transaction will be completed, it remains to be patient and wait for its turn. </p>
