  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Short biography. Lomonosov as a multilateral personality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1711, November 19, in the village of Denisovka, located in the Arkhangelsk province, the famous Russian scientist Mikhail Vasilievich Lomonosov was born.  According to a brief biography, Lomonosov was a chemist, poet, physicist and artist. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="short biography of clematis" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17451/318592.jpg" width="396"></div></h2><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The future poet spends his childhood with his father Vasily Dorofeevich and stepmother, from whom he never felt love.  They didn‚Äôt live well, like ordinary working peasants, Mikhail was the only son in the family.  Basically, all the people of that village, including Vasily, were engaged in marine fishing.  In order to inherit all the affairs that his father was engaged in, he needed to get an education.  Therefore, the boy is sent to the parish church to study literacy. </p><p>  According to a brief <span>biography, Lomonosov</span> was a very purposeful child, at an early age he learned to read and write.  After young Mikhail found out about his father‚Äôs intentions to marry him, he stole his passport and fled.  The craving for knowledge of the boy was so great that he went on foot to Moscow at the end of 1730. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="short biography of Mikhail Lomonosov" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17451/318593.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  School years </h2><p>  In the capital, he studies for five years (instead of the prescribed twelve) at the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy, which he enters, hiding his peasant origin.  Mikhail at that time turned 19 years old, and his classmates only left because of the school desk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a brief biography of Mikhail Lomonosov tells us, he lived in the capital very poorly, the scholarship was 3 kopecks a day, of course, this money was not enough for anything. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Lomonosov short biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17451/318594.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><p>  Michael‚Äôs perseverance helped him become the best student, who was sent to Germany with three more successful students, where they later learned mining. </p><p>  Life abroad was very eventful.  The first year of the student passes in three, he masters the Greek language and Latin (at that time a large number of scientific books were written in Latin, which he managed to read an impressive amount of at one time). </p><p>  Mikhail Vasilievich manages to study well and at the same time compose his own poems in different languages, gets acquainted with ancient Russian and Latin poetry.  Unfortunately, with the natural sciences at the first stage of the study, as a brief biography describes, Lomonosov does not cope easily, which causes him even more interest in them.  In the future, this will be a serious impetus to his professorship. </p><h2>  Return to Russia </h2><p>  The scientist arrives in St. Petersburg in 1741, where he falls into the scientific academy as an associate physicist.  Mikhail Lomonosov, whose brief biography tells about the enormous contribution of this unique person to many sciences, helped in the development of astronomy, geology, geography, meteorology, cartography, soil science, and geodesy. </p><p>  In 1754, Mikhail worked on his own project, hereinafter referred to as Lomonosov University.  The law on the conservation of matter, narrated by a brief biography, Lomonosov personally wrote.  He also investigated a large number of <span>optical instruments</span> and worked on color theories. </p>
