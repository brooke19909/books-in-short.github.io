It helps not only to have a good time on the road, but also is a good addition for mobile devices, whether smartphones, tablets or navigators.  One of such universal radio tape recorders is Alpine iDE-178BT.  Thanks to well-thought-out functionality, it is able to perform a large number of tasks, and not just be a "barrel organ" for playing a pair of radio stations.  Let us consider in more detail what exactly this radio can do and why many drivers love it so much. </p><h2>  Briefly about the model </h2><p>  Although this speaker system was launched on the market in 2013, it has not lost its relevance even now, after 5 years.  Already at that time, the manufacturer tried to maximize its functionality.  One of the most outstanding features at that time was the synchronization with mobile devices on the operating systems iOS and Android.  This function made it possible to make a full-fledged multimedia center out of a simple radio, which became an assistant for the driver while driving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alpinecaraudio.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine ide 178bt review" class="if uuid-2780641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780641.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The radio is installed in a standard DIN-connector, and is quite compact, which makes it possible to rationally use the space on the car panel.  The output power of the amplifier is 50 watts per channel, of which there are only 4. Thus, two front and two rear speakers can be connected to the radio, assembling a classic quadraphonic acoustic circuit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When developing the design, the manufacturer focused on left-hand drive cars, placing all the main controls on the left side of the radio panel.  Thus, controlling playback while driving should be easier since you don‚Äôt need to reach the far corner.  The right side of the Alpine iDE-178BT is occupied by a monochrome display with sufficient information to display all the necessary information, whether it is the name of the track, data on parameter settings or the name of the selected radio station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alpinecaraudio.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car radio alpine ide 178bt" class="if uuid-2780644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780644.jpg"></div><h2>  Audio inputs </h2><p>  As signal sources, 4 different inputs can be used.  The first and most common is the radio.  With an antenna connected, it is able to detect and store in memory up to 30 local radio stations.  Scanning and saving takes place automatically.  To improve the sound quality, an advanced noise removal system is used, due to which, even with uncertain reception, the user will not hear annoying crackling or hissing. </p><p>  The second input is a classic linear AUX.  You can connect any device to it, from an old player to a tablet or laptop.  With this assembly, the radio works as a simple amplifier, and all sound parameters are set directly on the connected device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third source is the integrated Bluetooth module.  Here, the functionality of the Alpine iDE-178BT radio tape recorder is fully disclosed, since not only high-quality digital stereo sound can be transmitted through it, but also messages from common messengers with the radio output to the display.  Also, while the smartphone is connected to the radio in this way, the speaker system can be used for telephone calls over the speakerphone. </p><p>  The last, fourth option is to play music from a Flash drive.  Here in this matter, the manufacturer miscalculated a bit, since the radio tape recorder only supports USB flash drives with a capacity of no more than 8 gigabytes.  Therefore, uploading your entire collection of your favorite music is unlikely to succeed.  As a result, you need to either carry a few small flash drives with you, or do with a small number of tracks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alpine.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine ide 178bt reviews" class="if uuid-2780643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780643.jpg"></div><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  Thanks to the detailed instructions for the Alpine iDE-178BT, its initial setup does not take much time.  Among the main parameters that affect the sound quality, you can select an equalizer with presets and surround sound system.  It is recommended to make personal settings that will appeal to both the user and suit the specific speakers installed in his car. </p><p>  As for the appearance parameters, the color of the display remains unchanged, but the backlight value of the controls can be changed to taste.  Colors such as amber, red, blue and green are available to the user.  You can choose the color that is best suited to the surrounding interior and will not interfere with night trips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toyprevia.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine ide 178bt instruction" class="if uuid-2780645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780645.jpg"></div><h2>  IOS sync </h2><p>  Of particular note is the ability to connect new devices from Apple using a standard Lighting cable.  After the connection is established, the user will have access to the entire library of audio recordings stored in the memory of the smartphone or tablet, and they can be controlled directly through the radio. </p><p>  With this connection, you can search for tracks by alphabetical and percentage indexes, as well as create your own playlists.  If you install the vTuner application on your iPhone, if you have broadband Internet access, you can listen to online radio stations, controlling them also through the radio system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toyprevia.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio alpine ide 178bt" class="if uuid-2780642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780642.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  In order to fully assess the quality of the car audio system in question, you should analyze the reviews of those who have been using it for a long time.  Drivers in their reviews of the Alpine iDE-178BT most often noted the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  High quality sound.  The purity of sound and its processing at the program level make it possible to completely immerse yourself in the world of your favorite music without interference and distortion. </li><li>  The ability to connect a steering wheel.  The Alpine iDE-178BT car radio has an interface for steering from the steering wheel, which makes it more convenient for the driver. </li><li>  The presence of modern communication protocols.  Working with many phones and smartphones via Bluetooth facilitates the use of the radio and expands its functionality. </li><li>  Sync with Apple devices.  Now, car acoustics is becoming a full-fledged continuation of the mobile ecosystem, making it easier to use an iOS mobile phone while driving, without breaking the rules. </li><li>  Built-in audio input.  The ability to work as a simple amplifier allows you to connect absolutely any sound device. </li><li>  Separate subwoofer output.  You can connect <span>an active subwoofer</span> without unnecessary difficulties by simply removing the signal from the corresponding connector on the rear panel. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the Alpine iDE-178BT has received an impressive list of accolades.  However, there is something to blame for it.  It is worth familiarizing yourself with the shortcomings before the purchase, so that subsequently they do not cause disappointment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photobucket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine ide 178bt in the dashboard" class="if uuid-2780640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2780640.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative points in reviews </h2><p>  Among the minuses there are no critical points.  They are mainly related to the fact that, in some parameters, it would be possible to add convenience in using the radio.  So, she does not know how to memorize the track on which the playback stopped, and every time she starts, she starts to play the playlist from scratch.  In order to synchronize Alpine iDE-178BT via Bluetooth with another phone, you need to go into its settings and delete the previous synchronization.  Some users complain that the price is a little too high, as a result of which they expected to see the steering wheel in the kit, rather than buying it separately for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This radio tape recorder is a good solution for lovers of high-quality sound in a car.  It is equipped with a processor that processes sound at a digital level, outputting a crystal-clear signal to the amplifier.  It is a bit expensive, but at the same time, as the Alpine iDE-178BT review shows, the functionality fully justifies its cost.  If there is a need to use a smartphone with a radio, then this is not a problem, since it is able to work with most Android and iOS devices. </p>
