    <p>  Noginsk is not a resort city visited by thousands of tourists.  Nevertheless, the townspeople are proud of its history and carefully preserve numerous attractions.  Noginsk has numerous historical, cultural and natural monuments.  We will familiarize you with some of them in this article. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The current Noginsk is first mentioned in chronicles dating back to 1389.  Then the settlement located on this place was called the village of Rogozhi.  It got its name from the river of the same name. </p><p>  In 1781, the village received official city status and was renamed Bogorodsk.  During the war with the French (1812), he was ravaged by Napoleonic troops.  In 1876, on the spot where the temple was almost destroyed, a monumental Epiphany Cathedral was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, a large textile production appeared in the city - the Mother of God-Glukhovskaya manufactory.  In the second half of the XIX century, the city became one of the centers of the Old Believers in the suburbs.  Under the Old Believer community there was a large choir, which was known for public speaking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of noginsk" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276552.jpg" width="204"></div>

    <p>  During the years of Soviet power, the city became famous for the fact that on its territory the first monument to V.I. Lenin was erected in the world according to the project of the decorator of the Glukhov manufactory F. Kuznetsov.  This monument is also unique in that it began to be created during the life of the leader, and its opening was to take place on January 22, 1924.  In the morning, the head of the city received a telegram about the death of Ilyich, so the opening of the monument was tragic.  In Noginsk, the city was renamed in honor of the Bolshevik Viktor Nogin in 1930. </p><h2>  Sights - Epiphany Cathedral </h2><p>  From this cathedral, as a rule, all visitors begin to explore local attractions.  Noginsk, or rather its inhabitants, are very proud of this monumental building, designed by N. D. Strukov in 1767.  The building is made in the style of late classicism and is located in the historical center of the city, on the right bank of the Klyazma.  This is the main church in the Bogorodsk deanery of the Moscow diocese. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of noginsk" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276545.jpg" width="600"></div>  The cross-domed church has a four-tier bell tower.  It is crowned by a cylindrical drum with a dome-shaped head.  The facade of the temple is decorated with a pediment and pilasters, and its eastern part ends with an altar apse.  The dome of the belfry is decorated with columns, a mechanical clock is installed above them.  The belfry consists of ten bells of various sizes. <br><br>  Superb and the interior of the temple.  Here you can see a four-tier carved iconostasis, and under the dome, visitors can see a unique seven-tier chandelier with images.  The parishioners consider the icon of the Kazan Mother of God, the icon of the Ushakov warrior with particles of relics, the image of the Mother of God ‚ÄúInexhaustible Chalice‚Äù to be the most revered shrines.

Noginsk is known to the Orthodox far beyond its borders thanks to this man‚Äôs monastery. </p><p>  The first mention of it dates back to 1606.  In those ancient times, hieromonk Varlaam lived on the land now occupied by the monastery.  He built a wooden chapel in the name of Nicholas the Wonderworker.  The monastery was founded in 1701.  She became the compound of the Chudov Monastery (Moscow).  A magnificent stone temple was erected here, consecrated in honor of Nicholas the Wonderworker. </p><p>  Since 1719, it became the main temple of the desert.  Since 1779, the monastery received a new name Nikolaev Nikolaev Berlukovskaya deserts.  Its founder was Metropolitan Plato.  A very rare ancient icon is kept in the desert, which depicts Judas kissing the Savior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolaev berlyukovskaya deserts" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1920, many of the monastery's buildings were transferred to the home of the disabled.  At the very beginning of 1930, the last Divine Liturgy was held here, after which the monastery was closed.  He was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in 2002.  The abbot of the monastery was hegumen Eumenius. </p><h2>  Monument to Pimen </h2><p>  In 2010, at the intersection of Rabochaya and Dekabristov streets, the Monument to Patriarch Pimen was unveiled.  This event was dedicated to the 100th anniversary of his birth.  The sculpture was created by I.V.  Komochkin, a member of the Union of Artists of the Russian Federation.  The figure of the patriarch is cast in bronze and mounted on a pedestal of light granite.  The height of the composition is 6.8 meters. <br><br>  <span>Patriarch Pimen</span> was the fourteenth head of the Russian Orthodox Church.  He led the Orthodox of Russia from 1971 to 1990.  You need to know that this is the only Russian patriarch who happened to defend his country during the Second World War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to patriarch pimen" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276550.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This amazing man, before his intronization, has come a long and complicated way.  To testify to the greatness of the patriarch, to perpetuate his blessed memory, the city leadership decided to install this monument in the city. </p><h2>  Fountain Square </h2><p>  Not all tourists like to visit churches, temples and other places of worship.  Noginsk can offer this category of guests more <span>romantic places.</span>  For example, Fountain Square.  It is always crowded here - the townspeople walk, take pictures, drink coffee in small cozy cafes. <br>  In the daytime, the fountains make a great impression, and at night they are simply magnificent, because at this time the color lights come on, which adorns the entire area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fountain square" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276549.jpg" width="600"></div>  Newlyweds love to come to Fontannaya Ploshchad, who organize wedding photo sessions here, capturing their happiest day in life on film.

    <h2>  Bridge lovers </h2><p>  Such an unofficial name was given to the pedestrian bridge connecting the two banks of Klyazma.  This small structure is a prominent city attraction.  According to the existing tradition, couples in love <span>decorate the Bridge of</span> lovers in Noginsk (more precisely, its railing) with locks that symbolize their eternal love. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge of lovers in noginsk" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1276548.jpg" width="600"></div>  Such bridges exist in many countries of the world, and hardly anyone can say where this tradition originated.  Today, the Bridge of Lovers is one of the most romantic places in the city.  Here they make appointments, newlyweds come in who snap the locks on the railing of the bridge, and throw the keys to them into the river.  An atmosphere of endless celebration reigns on this bridge, which is impossible not to feel.
