Features of "wild" rest</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Well, which of us (especially the inhabitants of the northern part of Russia) would not want to spend a vacation on the sea?  One of the excellent settlements is the resort village located near Sochi, but in fact the suburb is Dagomys.  The private sector, hotels and holiday homes await beach tourists.  Housing and food prices are lower than in the center, and fewer people.  But in this article we will tell you about how the so-called "savages" relax.  That is, to those who came here and settled not on vouchers - in a hotel, but in the possessions of private individuals.  The level of convenience and comfort here is very different, so we will try to recommend you the most popular places, based on reviews from tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dagomys private sector" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1900837.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Dagomys </h2><p>  Visitors often choose the private sector for their cheapness and simplicity.  However, the layout of the resort is such that there are not too many such houses and apartments.  Therefore, you need to think about such a vacation in advance.  You can get here by train from Sochi.  And it’s only a quarter of an hour to go.  Minibus will have to get about forty minutes, but she arrives in the center of the village.  Dagomys has been known since Soviet times as the birthplace of Russian tea.  Still carried here on excursions to the plantation.  And here once was the estate of Nicholas II.  In a word, if you do not want to relax in big cities, but want to visit an interesting place, then visit Dagomys.  To rent a room, room, or even a house in the private sector is quite possible, but it is advisable to do this after considering various proposals, including on the Internet.  There are very budget options, but there may not be too comfortable conditions, and cheapness will attract noisy companies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Remove the private sector of Dagomys" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1900839.jpg" width="424"></div>

As a rule, they are not located in noisy streets, but at the same time close to the entire infrastructure.  Accommodation prices vary greatly - from 200 rubles per day per person at the beginning of the season to 700-800 in its midst.  But the private sector is good because here you can bargain with the owners, and since the owners are interested in attracting as many people as possible, they often make concessions.  You can live in specially constructed rooms, in rooms, in separate outbuildings or cottages with their entrances and tables.  Showers and toilets can be shared in the courtyard or on the floor.  Suites are most often equipped with amenities.  There are refrigerators and televisions in the rooms or on the premises, as well as air conditioning or at least fans.  Guest houses are usually two-story.  They have verandas, a large green area with barbecue facilities where you can make an outdoor barbecue, and a playground.  Typical housing of this kind, for example, is the guest house Veronika.  It is located 300 meters from the beach, there are standard and economy rooms (with partial and full amenities).  The house is new, renovated.  Many owners are trying to attract customers with some zest.  The mini-hotel Alice has wood interiors.  On the territory of the "Scarlet Rose" luxurious magnolias grow.  Recently, such proposals have become the most popular in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in dagomys private sector" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1900842.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you are tired of cooking yourself, then cafes and restaurants will offer you Caucasian cuisine at a very reasonable price.  Most of them are located in the area of ​​the beach, but tourists are advised to have a snack away from the sea.  Then lunch or dinner will cost you 500-1000 rubles per person.  The owners of guest houses and private estates are often connoisseurs of their land, and if they do not arrange excursions in the surroundings themselves, they can tell you about the most interesting routes.  As a rule, parking is included in the price.  It is often located in the courtyard of the house or nearby.  Many guest houses on the territory catch Wi-Fi, and the owners meet tourists at the station.  Some mini-hotels, such as Solomon, located next to the sanatoriums, offer tourists health-improving courses. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Private housing on Dagomys can be found near the sea and away.  Of course, basically the first line is built up with camp sites and sanatoriums.  But, for example, such guest houses as “Comfortable cabins”, “Baltic” or “Summer” are located literally one or two minutes walk from the beach.  But wherever you stay, you can always find a free spot on the beach.  The coast here is everywhere sandy and pebble, many canopies.  The entrance to the water is quite gentle, so it’s good to go here with children.  The beach is comfortable, you can rent sunbeds with umbrellas.  It is constantly being cleaned.  And on the waterfront - a cafe for every taste.  There is a wild beach near the dam.  There is no infrastructure, but you will not find noisy crowds either.  And the best beach in the village is located on the territory of the health complex, but the entrance to it is paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dagomys private sector reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1900846.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Private sector, Dagomys: reviews </h2><p>  Most of the tourists in their responses assure that they most often choose this way of living in order to feel like at home on vacation.  The new guest houses are comfortable, clean.  The hosts are friendly.  Often carried on excursions to interesting places on their own transport.  The climate in Dagomys is ideal for wellness.  Warm, but not as stuffy as in Sochi.  The sea is shallow, clean, children are comfortable learning to swim.  If you agree in advance with the owners about discounts, as well as make an advance payment, then it comes out cheaply, although under the conditions it is no less comfortable than in a boarding house or sanatorium. </p>
