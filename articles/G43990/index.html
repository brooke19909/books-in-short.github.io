What is his story?  This will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  What is a uniform? </h2><p>  The word "uniform" is originally derived from French monture, which translates as "equipment", from the Latin mundus, meaning "outfit."  Currently, the uniform is uniform, the main reflection of <span>departmental affiliation</span> and the status of its owner.  This type of uniform has always been an important element of national culture, contrasting with the "civilian dress."  In the old days, quite often determining for himself the option of starting a military career, the young man paid great attention to the external attractiveness of one or another variety of clothing.  Handing a newcomer to a uniform was recognized as one of the most important events in the life of an employee.  In some cases, it provided a real reason for writing a ceremonial portrait, in which the owner was depicted in full growth and with a detailed display of all the necessary attributes.  Gold embroidery of the order and other award distinctions transformed the uniform into a work of applied art. </p>

    <h2>  Uniform Requirements </h2><p>  What is a uniform, and what are the requirements for it?  Basic requirements: </p><ul><li>  uniformity; </li><li>  appearance appeal; </li><li>  comfortable to wear. </li></ul><p>  It was quite rare to combine these requirements in one sample.  Such uniforms should indicate an attitude to a certain type of troops or department, inform about the rank and position of its owner.  In most cases, she could accompany the owner all his life, starting from the school and ending with retirement.  The uniform could well be regarded as a kind of reward, it saw a symbol of departmental solidarity and a clear reason for pride. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of domestic military uniforms </h2><p>  A fairly large period of time in Russia was not as such a uniform and legalized military uniform.  This fact is explained by the fact that then there were virtually no permanent troops.  <span>The Russian military uniform</span> originates from the time of Tsar Peter I. Instead of the disbanded Streltsy regiments, the future emperor formed a regular army.  At the same time, he took foreign analogues as the basis for most positions, including in uniform and equipment.  It should be noted that during the Petrine period of the reign, the functionality of the army uniform did not, by and large, concern anyone.  In the future, cardinal changes were periodically introduced, both in the appearance of the form and in the rules for wearing it, making it either overly catchy and refined, or, conversely, somewhat simplified. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  After the revolution, a completely new stage in the history of army uniforms began in our country.  At its beginning, the Red Army, due to objective reasons available at that time, did not have the possibility of creating a uniform uniform.  But certain changes are ripe.  For example, as a relic of the past, epaulettes were abolished, replaced by rhombs and sleepers on buttonholes indicating military affiliations and military ranks.  They returned to shoulder straps only in the difficult year of 1943.  It was in this year that a <span>radical change</span> occurred during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  Therefore, not only the epaulettes were returned in an opportune way, but a certain restoration of other traditions of wearing the uniform of the Russian army also began.  A full dress uniform was developed and introduced for wearing for all categories of military personnel. </p><p>  Following this, even in the post-war years, innovations in the form of military personnel, although they took place, were quite rare and not large-scale.  Such changes occurred in the late seventies and early eighties of the last century. </p><p>  After the events in Afghanistan, a unified all-weather field suit appeared in the army, called the ‚ÄúAfghan‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Russian military uniform: development </h2><p>  The cessation of the existence of the Soviet Union was fully reflected in the army, and then, as a result, in the <span>uniform of</span> servicemen.  Almost immediately, the Soviet military uniform was almost eliminated.  Significant changes have taken place in its modern design and style.  The dominant color of both the ceremonial and everyday uniforms of the military has become olive.  Winter coats were introduced to replace the overcoats, patch pockets appeared on the tunic.  Belonging to a specific type of army or military unit was determined by chevrons and stripes. </p><p>  Later, the change continued.  The foundation of the army uniform in our time is the principle of several layers, as well as providing the military with the opportunity to personally combine the various components of the uniform kit, depending on the tasks they face and the weather conditions in which they are carried out.  When creating complete sets of molds for various purposes, the most advanced materials and technologies have been successfully applied, which have repeatedly proven their ability to keep heat insulators, quick-drying and well-permeable fabrics.  The military uniform was originally considered a full attribute of the parade.  This type of form also did not pass a wave of changes.  He became tauter, and a double-headed eagle appeared on a high cap. </p>

    <p>  The equipment modernized in such a way passed severe tests in various conditions and was demandingly evaluated by its future carriers.  So in this particular case, the dilemma of "beauty or comfort" has decreased to almost a minimum level.  And in the future, this issue will completely lose its relevance. </p>
