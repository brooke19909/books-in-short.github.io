    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Of the negative comments about the Kalimera hotel, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the hotel has constant interruptions in the supply of water (in summer it is a particularly acute problem, because you really want to swim after the beach or a long walk); </li><li>  ventilation in the bathroom does not work well, and therefore it not only smells of damp, but also mold develops; </li><li>  administrators behave unfriendly and even a little rude to guests (there is no desire to make requests or comments). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Such a variant of accommodation as Kalimera (3 * hotel) is quite popular. Gelendzhik is a resort city, and therefore accommodation prices here are sometimes sky-high. As for this hotel, the price is quite consistent with the quality of service. Here you are offered Accommodation in one of the rooms of a small cottage, where you will find a well-groomed shady area, decorated with greenery and decorative elements. </p><p>  As for the rooms of the resort complex, here you will not find original design solutions.  The rooms are decorated very simply (we can say that at home).  But this can not be called a disadvantage.  The situation in the rooms is very comfortable, and therefore it is very pleasant to be in them.  Nevertheless, the impression can spoil the pronounced smell of dampness in the bathroom, as well as a large amount of mold.  In addition, the frequent shutdown of water can become an unpleasant surprise, and therefore be prepared that you will have to pay for some inconvenience for cheap accommodation. </p><p>  In any vacation, food plays a significant role.  As for this institution, there is a wonderful cafe with traditional Russian cuisine.  Here, for relatively little money, you can get a comprehensive meal, which will be much tastier and cheaper than in neighboring institutions.  Nevertheless, you should be prepared for the fact that in the restaurant you will expect the atmosphere of an ordinary dining room, and not a luxurious restaurant setting. </p><p>  One of the most significant shortcomings of the Kalimera hotel is its staff.  Already during registration you will notice a cool and unfriendly attitude of the reception staff.  This greatly complicates communication.  In addition, in the process of living, any problems and questions may arise, the solution of which I would like to feel interest and attention from the staff. </p><p>  We can say that the Kalimera hotel is a budget vacation option for unpretentious tourists. </p>
