And their price category is also different: from too expensive to quite budget ones.  Against the background of all this diversity, the product of the Chinese (and do not be afraid of this word) company ZTE - Blade S6, which review is presented here, is especially notable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 review" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005590.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows the popular modern saying that the whole world is made in China.  Therefore, you should not be afraid that the box with this or that product has the inscription made in China.  Moreover, industrial branded China is significantly different from artisanal products assembled ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù.  So the company ZTE, whose motto was the phrase "Tomorrow never waits", rapidly breaking into the Russian market, is a company producing branded smartphones.  And in Russia it is gaining more and more popularity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005591.jpg"></div>

And in this regard, the ZTE Blade S6 features very, very decent.  Rather powerful and solid components are hidden under the plastic, painted under the metal non-removable body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 specifications" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005592.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  For those who are just about to purchase their first smartphone, the name of the processor, as well as its capabilities, is just a set of beeches and words.  But for an experienced user, rather, it‚Äôs something like a code word, by which you can determine how solid the device is in front of him.  And here the ZTE Blade S6 smartphone does not disappoint.  He has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor installed. It is worth noting that this, according to the manufacturer, is the first eight-core processor of a 64-bit system.  And, believe me, this is really a solid "iron."  With 2 GB of RAM, the smartphone turns into a real gaming center that can handle any advanced and modern game.  Not to mention the fact that the concepts of "freezing", "plugging" generally disappear from the lexicon of the owner in relation to his gadget.  The ZTE Blade S6 (which is under review) does a really good job of multitasking and heavy games. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone zte blade s6" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005593.jpg" width="600"></div>

Of these, only 13 GB with a small available to the user, since the operating system still takes on a lot.  For those who lack this space, there is a slot for a memory card.  Naturally, microSD.  It supports up to 64 GB.  That is, with some effort, a smartphone can replace a full-fledged personal computer.  Not to mention the tablet, by the way.  What is nice, all applications can be transferred to a memory card, so as not to keep them on the "native".  And this makes the use of the device even more rosy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 case" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005594.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Perhaps this is also an important criterion when choosing a smartphone.  Especially for modern young people and girls who want not just a productive device, but also beautiful in appearance.  The ZTE Blade S6, reviews of which will be somewhat lower, does not disappoint.  Outwardly, the device resembles the iPhone 6 gadget to many people, but they don‚Äôt have much in common.  Yes, and those who were holding a real Apple iPhone 6 will not confuse him with anything.  So, ZTE Blade S6 compares favorably with protective glass from its Android counterparts.  It does not rest on the side faces of the smartphone, like many models, which makes the operation of the touch screen more pleasant and comfortable - the finger does not touch the sidewalls.  A monolithic (non-removable) body is made of plastic, but of very high quality, which does not creak or slide in the hand.  And there are no prints left on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 silver" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Many modern phones are equipped with a camera.  Even the most budget ones.  And in many fairly expensive smartphones, by the way, very mediocre cameras are built in.  But not in the Blade S6.  There really is something to be proud of.  The ZTE Blade S6, which we are currently reviewing, is equipped with two cameras of very decent quality.  The front-facing with a resolution of 5 megapixels is ideal for high-quality selfies and video calls.  And she really gives out the claimed 5 megapixels, which pleases.  The front camera of 13 megapixels will give odds to a budget camera!  Yes, it didn‚Äôt do without flaws, sometimes autofocus does not work correctly, macro photography also does not always work smoothly.  But in general, it depends more on how skillful hands use the camera, and not on herself.  If we compare it with some flagship famous model, then the same Samsung Galaxy S4 with the same 13 megapixel camera works more clearly.  But the price category at the start of sales for models is very different, so you should not wait for a super-incredibly fabulous result.  The camera at ZTE fulfills its money completely.  Yes, and all the ‚Äúlotions‚Äù for shooting the model is enough, an additional application for processing is not required. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  It can‚Äôt be a complaint.  It is very standard: a smartphone, a charger (it's a USB cable), instructions, a clip for SIM cards.  The back panel of the device is quite boring: brand name, place of production.  Therefore, it is also often compared with the iPhone 6. But still, these are fundamentally different devices, which should not be forgotten.  The headset, like other ZTE models, is not provided in the kit.  And frankly, standard headphones always leave much to be desired.  The exception, perhaps, is all the same Apple, where the headset is presented at a decent level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte blade s6 plus" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/1005596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary and Review: Everything About Everything </h2><p>  So, what about the ZTE Blade S6, which took so long to review?  This is a very decent model with a five-inch screen.  The coating, by the way, is oleophlobic - there are no fingerprints left on it.  Although the film is still required, because it protects against scratches with very active use.  In addition to the five-inch screen that has already become familiar, the smartphone has two very good cameras, a fairly powerful hardware, and a nice design.  And, despite the fact that the candy bar is made of plastic, it looks very nice and stylish.  In the hand, the device lies very conveniently, both in the right and in the left.  He does not try to slip out with careless movement, so you can use it without fear before buying a cover. </p><p>  Equipped with a smartphone is not the most powerful battery at 2400 mAh.  It will still be not enough for full use, although it will be enough for daylight hours.  And, of course, a fresh Android!  Version 5.0 allows the device to "fly" when working without any lags and freezes.  ZTE Blade S6 Silver (a beautiful silver shade) is a truly worthy model to use, especially since after the start of sales the price slightly decreased, approaching the digestible bar of 11-12 thousand rubles.  And, of course, you can‚Äôt compare a smartphone with a well-known ‚Äúapple‚Äù brand, because among the common things they have only size and color, which is fundamentally different. </p><h2>  Accessories </h2><p>  What else worries smartphone owners?  The presence of fashion accessories to them.  And here the ZTE Blade S6 does not disappoint.  It is not difficult to pick up a cover for it on the popular Chinese trading platform.  As well as the fashionable bumper, lining and rear silicone tab.  By the way, tempered glass can also be purchased for this model, so that in case of an unexpected fall, it is not the screen and the plastic case of the device that was damaged, but only this glass.  By the way, the "apple" gadgets also have this protection system, which again is not supplied.  You don‚Äôt even have to talk about headphones - a 3.5 mm jack allows you to choose any suitable in shape, color and size. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Owners of ZTE Blade S6 reviews about their smartphone leave a wide variety.  Someone likes all the available functions and "chips", someone is not too happy with certain moments.  In general, buyers remain satisfied - for their money, the device functions perfectly.  Two SIM cards work clearly, the sound is acceptable, the cameras are decent, the operating system without lags.  What else is needed in a modern device?  ZTE Blade S6 Silver, reviews of experts about which also remain on top, deserves attention when choosing a reliable and faithful smartphone for daily use.  The only thing that needs improvement, both in the opinion of professionals and in the opinion of users, is a battery, which is still not enough for full use. </p><h2>  Light version </h2><p>  Not every manufacturer, after the release of a more or less successful model, decides to create a budget and ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù analogue.  But ZTE did it anyway.  Perhaps not in vain, but, as sales practice has shown, still the Russians did not really like the light version.  So, what did the ZTE Blade S6 Lite lose in comparison with its more "experienced" brother?  Firstly, the camera.  If the frontal one remained at 5 megapixels for cool and clear selfies, as well as acceptable video communications, then the main one lost those 5 megapixels, becoming instead of 13 megapixels only 8 megapixels.  On the one hand, this does not interfere much, on the other hand, the difference in shots is striking. </p><p>  Secondly, the device lost its powerful processor and eight cores.  Instead, there are four, but still fully functioning cores and a <span>Snapdragon 410 processor.</span> Not the newest, but time-tested.  This, of course, affected the performance, but not so much - the smartphone does not fail, it works without critical errors and crashes, although it sometimes freezes on heavy and demanding games.  So the settings of the latter will have to be removed from the maximum. </p><p>  Thirdly, memory is also trimmed.  Instead of 2 GB of operational, it‚Äôs already 1, and instead of 16 GB of internal, it‚Äôs only 8. MicroSD cards are also supported only up to 32 GB instead of 64. </p><p>  Fourth, the screen cover has remained oleoflobic, but it‚Äôs already something else.  Fingerprints are more clearly visible, worse and worse.  But the screen size has remained unchanged - five inches. </p><h2>  Is a light worth the money? </h2><p>  The cost of S6 Lite today is only a couple of thousand rubles less than the full, not stripped-down version.  Therefore, choosing between these two models, you shouldn‚Äôt be stingy.  If we compare the ZTE Blade S6 Lite with other budget models, then it is definitely no worse.  It‚Äôs not difficult to pick up accessories for it; a smartphone works out its money to the fullest.  You can safely recommend it for purchase.  Although it is worth remembering that the ‚Äútruncated‚Äù in functionality the device will not be so productive and nimble.  However, many buyers now do not need this. </p><h2>  Plus version </h2><p>  In 2015, almost every smartphone manufacturer considered it necessary to release not just a successful model, but also its analogue marked with a plus.  ZTE is no exception.  Perhaps they did not fail, because more and more people began to require not just good smartphones, but also large ones, so that it was more convenient to use them.  So the light came out ZTE Blade S6 Plus with a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  Large, beautiful, powerful, with a 3000 mAh battery!  Yes, it was a very successful move - to increase the battery capacity so that it does not rush from one outlet to another, so that you can normally surf on the Internet or play games.  In general, they say about the S6 Plus version like this: like S6, only more.  And indeed: the filling is the same as the original model.  But due to the larger screen and battery, using a smartphone is much more comfortable and more enjoyable.  The cost, by the way, is not much more - 2-3 thousand rubles more expensive than the Blade S6, active SIM cards remain in place - they work without complaints and failures. </p>
