    <p>  Those who stayed at the Villa Neno 3 Hotel also have many positive reviews. Many are satisfied with the lack of a swimming pool and noisy animation.  In a calm environment, you can stroll through the garden, take walks in the Old Town. </p><p>  At a hotel, Russians are satisfied primarily with the price-quality ratio of services.  The cost of the tour in July for two with departure from Moscow and accommodation in a double room with meals only “continental breakfast” - from forty-seven and a half thousand rubles.  The price may be changed depending on the charter flight. </p><p>  The only drawback, according to some, is the slightly small rooms in Villa Neno 3. Nevertheless, the vast majority of Russians believe that in this three-star hotel you can relax normally, and on a budget, enjoying the sea and the gentle rays of the sun. </p>
