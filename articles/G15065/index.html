This happened for several reasons: in some lands the dialect itself (Great Britain) was born, in others it was recorded by immigrants (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand).  The language penetrated into other of them along with the colonialists and remained state, because these powers are still under the influence of Great Britain or the USA (Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica).  There are also such English-speaking countries where the local dialect has almost died out over the years of centuries of occupation and the majority of the population no longer remembers what their ancestors said (Ireland). </p>

    <p>  The territories of some states are inhabited by different nationalities, whose representatives simply cannot understand each other without the presence of one common dialect.  Therefore, such English-speaking countries as India and Singapore have made British speech official along with Hindi (in India) or Tamil, Malay and Chinese (in Singapore), but also outside the above states, the language originating from the British Isles is gaining more and more popularity.  You must admit that in the modern world a more or less educated person is simply obliged to speak English. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  One may wonder how “universal” Esperanto failed, and young people from different countries, dreaming of making a career, cram “English”.  Perhaps it was a skillful policy of British colonization.  While France, Belgium, Holland and Germany conquered countries in Africa, but the influx of population from the monopoly there was minimal, Britain tried to populate the conquered territories with its settlers.  The English-speaking countries of the American continent - the United States and Canada, as well as Australia and New Zealand, simply squeezed the indigenous population into margins - along with their dialects and dialects. </p><p>  An interesting situation has developed with Ireland and Malta.  These English-speaking countries of Europe have rather complicated local dialects.  Gaelic was gradually crowded out on the "Green Island", especially after the Holodomor, when most of its carriers - the villagers - died.  Dublin is currently running a multi-year program to revive native language, but <span>English is</span> officially used <span>.</span> </p>

Until the year 1800, Italian was the “learned” speech (when the island was owned by the Knights of John), and after that date, when Britain seized power, English.  In the 1920s, residents through a referendum decided which dialect to leave as the second official (after Maltese).  The choice was not in favor of Italian, and thus Malta was accepted into the English-speaking countries of the world.

    <p>  Why is the dialect of a rather small island - Britain - conquering the planet?  Experts believe that the <span>scientific and technological revolution</span> began with the United States.  There, immigrants from all over the Old World flocked to undeveloped lands.  These were enterprising people, not afraid to take risks.  They were inventive, thought outside the box.  The European bureaucracy and feudal survivals did not tie their hands to new entrepreneurs as much as in Europe.  And since the majority of the population were from Great Britain, the USA and Canada, who accepted a motley wave of emigrants, preserved the speech of their former historical homeland.  Now these two English-speaking countries are leaders in high-tech technologies. </p>
