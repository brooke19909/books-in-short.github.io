There are several ways to make this request.  True, not everyone knows how to act.  Some users generally use the Internet to implement this idea.  In principle, such an opportunity exists.  But it is worth resorting to with great caution.  Why?  We have yet to talk about this.  And how does the money transfer from Beeline to Beeline?  What methods are available and considered safe? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer from beeline to beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119562.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  But first, it‚Äôs worth knowing the conditions of this opportunity.  After all, each mobile operator has its own inquiries to subscribers.  And without following the rules, it will not work to realize the idea. </p><p>  In our case, in order to <span>transfer money from Beeline to Beeline,</span> the sender must have enough funds <span>on the</span> balance sheet.  And when you write off these remain a positive balance.  In addition, please note that the minimum sending amount is 10 rubles.  The maximum is 150. </p><p>  With all this, you can make several transfers per day to the same number.  Only each request is allowed to be done every 2 minutes.  The maximum amount that you are able to transfer to your interlocutor per day is 300 rubles.  If your transfers exceed the limit, then it will be impossible to make them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline to Beeline money transfer team" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119561.jpg"></div>

Now it‚Äôs worth learning how to put the task before us into reality.  The first option that can only be offered is a team transferring money from Beeline to Beeline.  That is, you are sending some kind of USSD request that is being processed.  During which there is a money transfer. </p><p>  What is worth typing?  * 145 * subscriber number * amount of money for transfer #.  If everything went right, then the money will be transferred within 2 minutes to your friend‚Äôs account.  But there‚Äôs something else to do.  One command is not enough to complete an action. </p><h2>  the confirmation </h2><p>  After the USSD request, you will have to confirm your decision.  As soon as you dial the indicated combination with a phone number and the amount to be credited to the balance of another subscriber, you will receive a message in response.  Do not be alarmed, this is normal. </p><p>  If the requirements put forward by the operator are met, a verification code will be displayed in the message text.  It is needed to confirm the request.  How to do it?  Dial * 145 * verification code # on the phone.  That's all.  Now you can study other options for the development of events. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a combination of transferring money from beeline to beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119560.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Messages </h2><p>  There is such an approach <span>as transferring money from Beeline to Beeline</span> via SMS.  In truth, this method is not as popular as the previous one.  Implement it longer.  Yes, and SMS requests are processed more slowly.  If time is running out, you can use this approach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are limitations too.  Firstly, you will be charged a fee of 3% of the transfer for the service.  Secondly, at a time you have the right to transfer no more than 5,000 rubles, and per day - no more than 15 thousand.  For a month, there are also restrictions on transfers via SMS.  No more than 30,000. Otherwise, everything remains exactly the same as in the past case. </p><p>  What is the combination of transferring money from Beeline to Beeline using a text message?  Form the text of the following form: "bee [subscriber number] [payment amount]".  The amount of money and the subscriber should be indicated only through a space.  No commas.  The number is indicated without the number 8, immediately from 9-ki.  Now a message should be sent to a special service at 7878. Wait until the request is processed.  In response, you should receive a message about the successful completion of the operation.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this. </p><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  There is another rather interesting option that helps to transfer money from Beeline to Beeline.  It's about calling a telephone operator.  This option was once in great demand.  But now his popularity is falling.  After all, getting through to a live operator is quite difficult.  We have to have a conversation with a robot voice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer from beeline to beeline via SMS" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119559.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In any case, dial 0611 on your mobile, and then click on the call button.  Now wait for the answer.  If the operator answers you immediately, tell him that you would like to transfer money to another subscriber from your number.  What is the amount you want to give back.  It is also worth saying the number to which you are transferring.  If you have enough funds, the operator will inform you that the request has been received and processed. </p><p>  True, often users fall into the voice of a robot.  In this case, following the navigation, you will have to get through to the live operator.  Or select "Money Transfer" in the list of services.  The first option, to be honest, is easier.  Indeed, in the second scenario, you will eventually have to use an SMS request.  And the robot will simply tell you the terms of the promotion and the desired number for the operation. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Also very popular is the transfer of money from "Beeline" to "Beeline" via the Internet.  Honestly, there are several ways of development of events.  The first one is completely safe.  True, they will charge you a commission: 3% of the transfer amount + another 10 rubles.  It is about using the Beeline.Money service. </p><p>  To bring the idea to life, visit this service.  Now select "Other translations" there, and in the "Mobile Communications" section, click on "Beeline".  You will see a window in which you will have to fill in all the fields.  Indicate the transfer amount, your number (if necessary), as well as the phone number of the subscriber who needs money.  Confirm your actions.  Done. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer from beeline to beeline via the Internet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1119558.jpg"></div>

    <p>  True, there is a place to be and such a transfer of money from Beeline to Beeline, as the use of third-party hosting.  They promise not to charge a commission for the operation.  In truth, it‚Äôs best to avoid this kind of suggestion.  Indeed, often all this is the most common deception.  No one will transfer money from one number to another for free.  In the best case, the result will be zero.  In the worst case, money will be debited from the SIM card, but it won‚Äôt reach the recipient.  You will simply be "divorced."  Remember this.  Try not to use dubious services that promise unlimited and free money transfers from one phone to another.  Use only official offers of mobile operators. </p>
