  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychology Teaching Methodology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The interest in psychology as a <span>science about a person,</span> his inner world, personal characteristics and problems of interconnection with the external environment prompted this discipline to be included in all educational programs not only in higher education institutions, but also in specialized secondary ones, as well as in school practice, in continuing education programs etc.  Of course, the scope and content of the course ‚ÄúPsychology‚Äù in universities, courses and schools are fundamentally different, but in any case, it is important for the teacher to master the didactic methods of presenting the material.  The methodology of teaching psychology is the science of how to most comprehensively present psychology as a subject for study, on the laws of the learning process, on the methods and means used in effective teaching of groups that differ in age and basic education. </p><p>  What is the subject of teaching as a science?  This is a training of psychological activity.  Moreover, the learning process is understood in different ways.  It is considered as a form of interaction between teacher and students, as a process of mastering actions, or as one of the forms of <span>cognitive activity.</span> </p><p>  The methodology of teaching psychology solves the following problems.  First of all, it determines the purpose of training.  Without a clear and precise goal, it is impossible to solve other didactic tasks.  If until recently, the goal of teaching any discipline was considered to be the possession of the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge and skills by students, recently, in connection with the development of sciences and an increase in the required amount of knowledge, it has become more important to give students the right direction, theoretical basis for independent study of the subject.  And here the question arises: how much knowledge should be given to the student for his further independent immersion in the subject of psychology at different stages of preparation? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Psychology Teaching Methods </p><p>  In modern teaching practice, there are three main <span>methods of teaching</span> psychology: programmed, problematic, and interactive teaching. </p><p>  Programmed training is the most traditional way where, in accordance with the subject of study, a program is created, goals, tasks and didactic methods of knowledge flow are established or adjusted, as well as forms of their control. </p><p>  Problem-based learning involves modeling various problematic situations in which the learner's identity may be.  Here, the comprehension of knowledge occurs through a slice of this problem, from the inside, while searching for ways to solve it. </p><p>  Teaching psychology using the interactive method allows you to immerse yourself in the subject and build the process of assimilation of knowledge through the creation of <span>interpersonal communication</span> and interaction in the group. </p><p>  Human psychology is a complex and multifaceted subject.  Many scientific theories and views on the many problems identified in it are very contradictory in interpretation and explained by different scientific schools and directions.  In addition, interest in psychology as a science is caused by the desire of students to know themselves, to be able to use their knowledge to design their behavior, their successful interaction in society.  This, no doubt, should be taken into account when teaching this subject.  Thus, the methodology of teaching psychology, focused on improving the professional training of specialist teachers, in accordance with the requirements of the time, chooses modern teaching methods.  At the same time, verbal techniques (lectures) are combined with visual methods - watching videos, using Internet resources.  But first of all, the methodology of teaching psychology should be based on practical innovative <span>teaching methods,</span> when students become not only active actors in the educational process, but shape the process taking into account their interests. </p>
