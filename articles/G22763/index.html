It involves the use of several separate pictures, letters and decorative elements, which are assembled into one whole.

Place the pictures on the background as they should look in the final version.  Glue them.  You can also decorate the card with ribbons or various decorative elements.

    <h2>  <span>Congratulations</span> to the kindergarten teacher </h2><p>  It will be very pleasant for the teacher of preschool children to receive a congratulatory card made by their pupils.  As a basis, you can borrow the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfinger painting.  First prepare the base of the postcard.  To do this, take cardboard or kraft paper, fold in half.  Then part paint and cover its sponges.  Make a few shades - so the picture will be brighter. </p><p>  Now let each child dip his finger in the sponge and put an imprint on the front of the card.  You can combine them by drawing <span>wavy lines</span> below <span>,</span> which depart from the lower points.  Thus, you get a bunch of balls.  On the side of the plastic, you can write "Congratulations!"  Thus, the greeting card for the <span>day of the educator,</span> created with your own hands, is ready! </p><h2>  Another cute baby card </h2><p>  The presented personal greeting card to the educator will bring a lot of positive emotions.  With your own hands you can make it from the most ordinary colored paper.  And of the additional things you need only scissors and a handle.  Fold the paper in half and place the child‚Äôs pen on it so that its thumb and forefinger touch the fold line.  Circle it and gently cut the card.  As a result, you will get a cute postcard, which in its shape resembles a baby‚Äôs palm.  Upon disclosure, they already become two.  It remains only to fill out a card and present it to the teacher. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Simple postcard </h2><p>  To get such a card, you need to take cardboard for paper, thin double-sided tape, several varieties of kraft paper or ordinary color pictures with a picture, as well as sheets of yellow.  First prepare the base of the greeting card by folding the sheet in half.  Then cut several strips of different paper.  Try to make them the same in width but different in length.  Now cut out shapes resembling drops from yellow sheets.  There should be as many as strips. </p><p>  When all the details are ready, you can proceed to the design of the front side.  To do this, lay the strips on the card.  It will turn out prettier if they are not parallel.  Spread them slightly obliquely.  Then take one strip and glue a piece of double-sided tape to its back side.  Replace the rectangle.  Similarly, glue all the strips on the tape.  Finally, attach the drops over the paper candles. </p><p>  Such a greeting card at school with your own hands is done very quickly.  Therefore, it is ideal for a lesson or classroom theme.  As a result, each student will have his own greeting card, which he can then give to someone for his birthday. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  New Year paper greetings </h2><p>  DIY greeting cards for the New Year are made even easier.  For example, to create such a card, you need red cardboard or kraft paper of the same color.  Take also a narrow and wide ribbon of beige or gold shade, the same tone of a drop-bead or rhinestone. </p><p>  Fold the paper in half.  Take a special gun or Moment glue, attach a small piece of a narrow ribbon on top.  It should be centered.  Outline a circle under it with a flick of a pencil.  Lay out bead drops inside it so that most of the space is filled.  Then glue all the elements.  It is most convenient to use tweezers.  It remains to make a bow from a wide ribbon and stick it over the ball.  Sign the card. </p><h2>  Volumetric card with balls </h2><p>  You can make very beautiful greeting cards with your own hands using thick double-sided tape.  Also, for example, to create a card with balloons, you will need several types of kraft paper or cardboard with drawings, a small piece of a thin ribbon and beautiful threads (floss, woolen, decorative twine and so on). </p><p>  First, make a blank for the card, folding the cardboard in half.  Then take decorative paper and draw circles, hearts or ovals on the back.  These are the shapes of our future balloons.  Then take the scissors and carefully cut the shapes along the contour.  Now cut the threads.  You need as many balls as possible.  Connect the thread to the cardboard figure using double-sided tape.  Lay out the balls on the front of the card, and then glue them. </p><p>  Tie all the ends into one bundle using a thin ribbon.  Glue its back to the card.  Trim the ends of the threads.  Volumetric postcard is ready!  By this principle, you can make many different greeting cards.  Just prepare the elements and stick them on a thick double-sided tape. </p>

    <h2>  Blank scrapbooking postcards </h2><p>  You can make original greeting cards from paper with your own hands in the style of scrapbooking.  To do this, you need to take several types of beautiful cardboard, a thin ribbon and PVA glue.  To get started, prepare the foundation.  It can be either cardboard folded in half, or just a square or rectangular sheet.  Then take the red paper and cut out exactly the same shape as the card itself, only a centimeter less on each side.  Cut another exact same slice, only white or beige.  In addition, it should be less by a few millimeters of the previous one.  Stick on the front side of the card, first a red sheet, and then a light one. </p><h2>  New Year's decor of a card </h2><p>  Now cut three rectangles from different paper.  They should differ in length by 1 centimeter.  Glue a medium-sized rectangle horizontally in the middle.  Cut a piece of tape and glue one end to the back of a long rectangle.  Put the figure under the center piece and also stick it.  Lift the tape up.  Glue the last rectangle on top, having previously wrapped the second piece of ribbon under it.  Make a bow from the remnants of the ribbon and stick it on top of our gifts. </p><p>  Under the picture, make the inscription "Happy New Year!", "Happy Holidays!"  or "Congratulations!"  It is noteworthy that depending on what color paper you will use, the content of the postcard also changes.  If you take a cardboard of neutral colors with a pattern of hearts or circles, then the card can be presented for your birthday. </p>
