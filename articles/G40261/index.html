Many parents note that a decent rest and recovery of children in the sanatorium was accompanied by the friendly attitude of the staff and the professional performance of their duties.  The professionalism of the treatment and maintenance staff is also noted by adults who spent their holidays in this sanatorium.  The quality of the services provided is of a sufficiently high level, while the prices for leisure and additional paid services are affordable.  Some of the disadvantages noted in the reviews mainly boil down to the fact that the dance floor is too close to the guest houses, which is why the noise from the disco in the evenings interferes with the early relaxation of the clients of the sanatorium.  Food in this health institution, according to reviews, suits all categories of vacationers.  A well-equipped beach is noted by all participants in the discussion on the forum, and the pure nature of the coast is added to this.
