    <p>  BQ 5059 Strike Power is available in three colors: black, gold and silver.  The last two options will look most profitable.  The reason is simple: the back cover of the smartphone is made of aluminum.  But not polished or matte, but polished in such a way that at a certain angle you can consider the unique texture of the metal.  And the back cover anodized in silver or golden color will look very beautiful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The phone, although it looks massive, but lies comfortably in the hand, does not slip out and does not cause discomfort during long-term use.  In terms of dimensions, the BQ Strike Power features the following: </p><ul><li>  length - 143 mm; </li><li>  width - 73 mm; </li><li>  thickness - 9.9 mm; </li><li>  weight - 177 grams. </li></ul><p>  This device has support for two SIM cards and a third-party data storage device in the form of a Micro-SD card. </p><p>  As for all the necessary control components, they are located in approximately the standard way: the volume and on / off buttons of the device are located on the top of the right side, on the top side - the port under the ‚ÄúJack‚Äù for connecting the headset and the Micro-USB port for charging and connecting the phone to third-party devices.  In the upper right corner of the rear panel is a camera and LED flash.  In its lower part is a rectangular thin speaker. </p><h2>  Front display </h2><p>  On the front side of the smartphone is a decent-sized screen, at the bottom there are three touch buttons, which, fortunately for many users, did not transfer to the menu, as is fashionable at the present time.  Above, as usual, the earpiece and front camera are installed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As for the screen, the BQ 5059 Strike Power has a five-inch work surface with support for Full HD quality and an impressive overview from many angles in relation to the screen.  But get ready for the fact that in the sun it will fade due to insufficient brightness. </p><h2>  Power supply </h2><p>  BQ Strike Power Max is part of the Power line of phones.  Based on the name, many people already understand how this line differs from most phones on the market.  A non-removable battery of five thousand mA / hour is built into it.  It is non-removable to minimize the thickness of the device.  Five thousand mA is enough for a whole day of active use, and for everyday needs, for example, to call, send a message, check mail, more than enough for a longer period of time. </p>

    <h2>  Insides </h2><p>  <span>BQ Strike Power, the review of</span> which is now presented to your attention, is positioned as a phone, the main advantage of which is the capacity of its battery.  However, the filling of this device also deserves attention.  So, the BQ Strike Power 4G has a <span>MediaTek MT6580</span> quad-core microprocessor with a clock speed of up to 1.3 GHz under its cover.  Unfortunately, this chipset does not support working with 4G networks, which is not good for the user.  The ARM Mali-400 MP2 video processor is rather weak in terms of parameters and is hardly suitable for games.  1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of the main one with the ability to add Micro-SD up to 128 gigabytes is an excellent indicator, but today it will not surprise anyone. </p><p>  RAM with active use, when you need to quickly switch applications, is not enough, and noticeable glitches appear.  There are no complaints about the main memory, if there is not enough, you can insert a USB flash drive or use cloud storage.  As a result, the BQ Strike Power specifications are very meager, when compared with the analogues of this year. </p>

    <h2>  Camera, sound and operating system </h2><p>  Yes, as it was said, the BQ Strike Power features iron is mediocre, but about the installed main and front cameras you can only praise the developers.  Thirteen megapixels on the main camera and eight on the front camera are an excellent level.  Moreover, the cameras work very well: there is autofocus, there is no imbalance in the color scheme, as is often the case with many.  However, do not think that a telephone camera can be put on a par with a full-fledged digital one.  They didn‚Äôt praise it, but all the same, in poor lighting, the focus will fail, hence the photos will be blurry.  But, like for a $ 120 phone, the BQ Strike Power 4G shows itself in an excellent way. </p><p>  <span>As for the sound, it is difficult to say something specific.</span>  <span>There is a speaker, it works, and it is loud enough to hear incoming calls while in another room.</span>  <span>But if you cover the speaker, for example, with a blanket or pillow, then you can no longer hear it.</span>  <span>Accordingly, if your guest house is full and music plays, you need to have very good hearing so as not to miss an important call.</span>  <span>The speaker and microphone work well, but they do not shine with perfect quality.</span>  <span>The same goes for the headset.</span>  <span>Music lovers with a sensitive ear, it is not quite suitable.</span> </p><p>  But with the Android 7 operating system, there is one interesting incident.  Yes, this OS has a number of amenities, ranging from an updated display to a new energy-saving system and other chips of various degrees of need.  The developers tried, the OS came out quite demanding, but, given the rather low characteristics of the smartphone, this translates into micro-delays and minor glitches. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that when choosing mobile devices, the main attention is paid to their multifunctionality.  Indeed, today it is not just a means of communication, but also such a mini-PC. </p><p>  The BQ Strike Power smartphone, whose characteristics are not the best, feels great in its price segment.  This phone will not surprise you with something new, but it is definitely worth the money.  Moreover, in the Russian market it has quite successfully consolidated its position, and sales are in full swing, which means that he has found his audience.  In other words, such a demand speaks volumes.  This means that users are willing to buy it, turning a blind eye to some shortcomings.  And there are few negative reviews about the smartphone, and in general they relate to petty things that many buyers simply will not pay attention to. </p>
