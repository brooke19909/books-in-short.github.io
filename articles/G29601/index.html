  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The First Japanese Emperor - Jimmu</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Japan, the emperor is perceived as a symbol of national unity and a figure who formally is the head of state.  Although these functions, according to the constitution, are predominantly representative. </p><p>  However, the institution of the emperor for Japan is sacred, and the title itself means "heavenly master."  The first emperor Jimmu enjoys special respect, who is in second place in the Shinto pantheon of the gods. </p><h2>  Viceroy of the Gods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikidata.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Jimmu" class="if uuid-2578155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2578155.jpg"></div><p>  To date, the official imperial title in the world is available only to the head of Japan, Akihito.  This country is the oldest hereditary monarchy.  According to legends, her story dates back to 660 BC.  e. </p><p>  There is an opinion that the founder of both the monarchy and the state itself in Japan was Emperor Jimmu.  He is considered a descendant of <span>Amaterasu Omiki</span> herself - the great goddess who illuminates the heavens.  In Shintoism, she personifies the sun, is the inventor of the loom, the technology of silk production and rice cultivation. </p><h2>  Relics of Amaterasu </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mother-god.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goddess Amaterasu" class="if uuid-2578142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2578142.jpg"></div><p>  How did the descendants of the sun goddess appear in our world?  According to legend, Amaterasu sent her grandson named Nininga to the islands where Japan is today.  He was to become the ruler here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The goddess supplied her grandson with three important relics: a sword, a bronze mirror, and jewelry with precious stones.  But these were not just things, but symbols of what a conscientious ruler needs.  These are necessary attributes such as wisdom, prosperity and courage. </p><h2>  Explorer Yatagarasu </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Before the trip" class="if uuid-2578149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2578149.jpg"></div><p>  The grandson of the goddess Nininga over time passed these artifacts to his grandson, who was Jimmu - the first emperor of Japan.  The new ruler, armed with the sword he received, went on a campaign from <span>Kyushu Island,</span> where his grandfather descended from heaven, east, to Honshu Island. </p><p>  Moreover, he had a guide - a three-toed raven Yatagarasu.  This mythical creature in Japanese mythology symbolized the expression of the will of the gods. </p><p>  That is, thereby emphasizing that the establishment of imperial power on the islands was accomplished not just at the request of the people, but at the will of the gods.  According to legend, this campaign took place in 667-660.  BC  e.  Thus, Jimmu is considered in Japan as the founder of the state. </p><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  According to researchers, ancient legends about the Jimmu campaign are a reflection of the migration processes of Japanese tribes, as well as the formation of their alliances.  Although modern science relates this process to a later period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An analysis of archaeological excavations shows that the emergence of the Yamato state dates back to the turn of the 3rd-4th centuries.  n  e.  Whereas in the VII century BC  e.  nowhere in Japan was the rudiment of statehood observed, primitive relations existed everywhere.  Nevertheless, it is with the emperor Jimmu that the Day of the founding of the state is directly connected, which will be discussed in more detail below. </p><h2>  Resourceful ruler </h2><p>  According to legend, Jimmu was an unusually resourceful person.  When for a long time he was unable to attach the province of Iso to his possessions, in a dream the gods told him one recipe.  It was necessary to make several jugs of clay from the sacred mountain, which miraculously lead to victory. </p><p>  The problem was that the mountain was on enemy territory, so it was very difficult to get clay from it.  And then the emperor Jimmu was offered a way out: to dress two warriors as beggars, so that they would penetrate enemy possessions in this form.  As a result, pitchers were made, and victory was won. </p><h2>  Worship of the people </h2><div class="photo" data-original="everipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kashihara Temple dedicated to Jimmk" class="if uuid-2578145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2578145.jpg"></div><p>  Emperor of Japan, Jimmu, as a descendant of the goddess Amaterasu, is worshiped by Shinto supporters.  He is revered as one of the supreme deities, immediately following the sun goddess.  Several temples were erected in honor of him, and his mausoleum is also a sacred place for all Japanese. </p><p>  An interesting fact: for a long period the mausoleum was considered lost.  But thanks to information gathered from the epic "Kojiki" (the largest monument of ancient Japanese literature), its location still managed to be discovered.  Anyone can visit the surroundings of this building, but they won‚Äôt be able to get inside, as this is strictly prohibited. </p><p>  It should be noted that the divine Jimmu has other titles: </p><ul><li>  The first ruler of the Middle Kingdom. </li><li>  Young ruler of sacred dishes. </li><li>  A prince of rice coming down from heaven. </li></ul><p>  The very name Jimmu translates as "divine warrior."  And in childhood, the emperor was called Sano. </p><h2>  Kigensetsu holiday </h2><p>  This is one of the most famous Japanese holidays associated with the accession to the throne of Emperor Jimmu.  Its date was calculated on the basis of data contained in ancient legends.  The feast of the founding of the state was established in 1872. </p><p>  When after Jimmu‚Äôs accession to the throne, 2600 years old, that is, in 1940, the Japanese government signed an agreement with Germany and Italy, called the Triple (Berlin Pact).  He envisaged the delimitation of territories between these countries and the accession of a new world order, where Japan had the leading role in Asia. </p><p>  The celebration of the round date was used by official propaganda as a justification for aggression against the peoples of Asia. </p>
