Kazan is the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan, a multicultural and business center, a city with a population of more than a million inhabitants. </p><h2>  Why are hotel chains being created? </h2><p>  There are such well-known global brands as the Marriott, Kempinski, Hilton, Sofitel networks.  These are hotels in which service is carried out according to certain standards of service.  A person who appreciates certain qualities of one of these chains can easily book a hotel anywhere in the world and be sure that he will find the range of services that he needs.  As a rule, these are high enough standards that are sold at the appropriate price.  There is a pleasant exception - the only chain of economy class hotels of world scale.  These are the ibis hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief description of the ibis hotel chain </h2><p>  The service standards for this chain are distinguished by the following features: </p><ul><li>  Reasonable price with good service. </li><li>  A wide selection of restaurants. </li><li>  The combination of two qualities: the central part of the city, near transport interchanges. </li><li>  Modern rooms with good soundproofing. </li><li>  Quality certification according to the standard SO 9001, according to the environmental standard ISO 14001. </li></ul><p>  We can agree that this is a fairly indicative set of services for economy hotels.  The Ibis hotel (Kazan) belongs to this chain. <strong> </strong>  If you plan a trip to Tatarstan, then you should pay attention to this hotel. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  Ibis in Kazan: a brief description </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the historical center of the capital of Tatarstan, within walking distance of transport interchanges and cultural sites.
