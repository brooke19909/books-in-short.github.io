    <h2>  How is the term determined? </h2><p>  Compared to other financial institutions, Sberbank of Russia checks credit customers in order to minimize risks.  It takes some time.  How long is a loan application considered at Sberbank?  It all depends on the duration of this procedure.  Usually a check occurs: </p><ol><li>  Customer personal data, authenticity of documents. </li><li>  Solvency and income. </li><li>  Labor employment. </li><li>  Credit history. </li><li>  Collateral estimates. </li><li>  Solvency of borrowers and guarantors. </li></ol><p>  First of all, the documents are considered by the bank manager, and then they are transferred to the Credit Committee, which makes the decision.  An application for a consumer <span>loan at Sberbank is</span> usually considered quickly. </p><h2>  The timing </h2><p>  At the time of receiving the application, the employee usually says how much the loan application is being considered at Sberbank.  But one should not expect that the creditor will keep within such a period, since difficulties may arise at any stage.  Therefore, in each case, the timing can be individual. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's find out how much a loan application is being considered at Sberbank.  This usually takes 2-7 days, with only business days being taken into account.  For payroll clients, terms can be shortened.
