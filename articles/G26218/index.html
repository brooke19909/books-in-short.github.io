To make a picture in this technique, you need to cut out various shapes from the same material and attach them to the base, which is the background.  For work, you can use paper, fabric, cereals and many other available tools.  Let us examine in more detail what types of applications are and what are the features of their creation. </p><p>  Bonding flowers in this way is called floristry.  To make a beautiful bud, it is enough to collect a few dried leaves, fruits, straw, poplar fluff.  Different types of shells, cones, seeds, seeds, grass and more are also useful.  Whatever material you choose, you will need to take into account the features of its texture during operation.  It should keep well on the basis and harmoniously fit into the composition of the work. </p><h2>  Standard classification </h2>

    <p>  There are many types of this handmade, among which there are three main: </p><p>  - decorative applique (created by the principle of combining various elements of decoration among themselves); </p><p>  - subject (pictures made in this technique consist of independent images - birds, trees, butterflies, etc.); </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - storyline (depicts a specific action or event - snowfall, a family walk, a dog playing with a ball). </p><p>  This is the standard classification of this needlework.  In addition to the items listed above, there are many other types of such crafts.  Unconventional application can be performed in the following techniques. </p><h2>  Ribbons and fabric </h2><p>  <em>Tape</em> .  Using this method, it is realistic to create not one or two identical figures, but any number of them.  They can be interconnected into a long garland or separated from each other.  To make such a craft, you need a large sheet of paper.  Fold it according to the accordion principle, draw a contour of the future part on the top layer and cut it, capturing all levels of the material. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself volume application" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811104.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  <em>Tissue</em> .  This applique belongs to the types of embroidery.  The process of working on it consists in attaching elements of a similar material on a fabric basis.  Parts are fixed by sewing or gluing.  Knitted applications are made on the same base material.  To create such a craft, you must have some skills and dexterity.  In particular, it is necessary to be able to carefully cut out the details (the fact is that it is more difficult to work with fabric than with paper).  It should also be borne in mind that the edges of parts can delaminate and crumble, which complicates the creative process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We use napkins </h2><p>  <em>Tissue paper</em> .  This decorative applique may interest even the smallest children.  Working with this material will not only bring a lot of pleasure, but will also make a contribution to the development of the child.  Figures do not need to be cut with scissors, so the baby will not be able to get injured. </p><p>  Types of applications using this material perfectly develop <span>fine motor skills</span> and tactile perception (it is especially useful to use materials with different textures).  And, of course, your child will develop a fantasy and translate ideas into reality. </p><h2>  We are looking for materials in the kitchen </h2><p>  <em>From cereals</em> .  Many types of applications involve the use of non-standard materials.  For example, cereals and pasta belong to such.  Work on the craft is extremely useful for fine motor skills of the child.  After all, during sorting out small particles, he develops his fingers and learns to make pinch movements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unconventional application" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811098.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  In addition, if the baby is already over one year old, it is very important for him to see the visual result of his labors.  Therefore, children really like to collect pictures from cereals.  The most universal materials for this type of creativity are semolina, rice and millet.  They can be painted with gouache to make the details brighter and more attractive.  Unusual composition will also give pasta in the form of spirals, bows, shells. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We turn to nature for help </h2><p>  <em>Decorative applique made of straw</em> .  Such crafts look very stylish: the rays of the sun play in their lines, cast in gold.  The fact is that the surface of this material is glossy and perfectly flat, thanks to the longitudinal fibers of which it consists.  These microscopic strips are able to reflect light to the maximum if they are placed in the correct position relative to the sun. </p><p>  Compose the shapes of your composition from parts that lie at different angles with respect to the light source.  In this case, you can ensure that each element will beautifully shine and shimmer.  In this technique, you can make whole pictures, as well as decorate bookmarks, various caskets and frames. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="types of application" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <em>From the herbarium.</em>  Dried flowers, grass, and leaves are a very popular craft material.  These parts are readily available for schoolchildren and young children.  Application schemes are very simple to implement and do not require much labor.  But, before proceeding directly to the process of creating crafts, you need to take a walk and collect the necessary materials.  This is not only an interesting and fascinating activity, it also instills in children a love and <span>respect for nature.</span>  In addition, such walks are very useful, because they take place in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Create from scraps </h2><p>  Another interesting type of creativity is clipping application.  It is created by laying out the mosaic.  Cardboard is the best choice as a basis, and sheets of colored paper of different shades will become the material for work.  They need to be torn into many small pieces, from which the picture will be formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="break application" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811110.jpg" width="461"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  You can attach the resulting "puzzles" with glue or <span>double-sided tape.</span>  The second option is ideal for small and creative preschoolers.  Children may not even tear pieces of paper in advance.  Let the child attach the necessary part of the sheet to the adhesive tape and press it with the blunt part of the pencil.  In this way, the entire surface of the future picture is filled and its color scheme is formed. </p><p>  Discontinuous applique exists not only in its classical form described above.  It evolved, due to which its branch, such as handigyrim, appeared.  When working in this technique, the Koreans created a special paper - handi, it is made by hand.  And when it comes time to use this material, its pieces are moistened and torn off in shape from the sheet.  Working with handi, you can create paintings that seem to be painted in watercolor or oil. </p><h2>  Create 3D </h2><p>  <span>Do-it-yourself volume application</span> is the best option for making crafts with convex colors.  You can not only make a variety of buds, but also decorate with them anything - postcards, panels or interior elements.  Therefore, every person who is fond of paper handmade should be able to make such applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted appliques" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811102.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Types of applications aimed at creating voluminous crafts are quite diverse according to the principle of work.  The manufacture of each flower has its own specific features and level of complexity. </p><h2>  We make a camomile: a master class </h2><p>  To create a classic daisy, it will take you a maximum of half an hour.  Start by sketching the future petals on white paper.  They should have an elongated oval shape.  Leave some space around the edges so that you can bend every part later.  In this flower, the petals are placed in several tiers.  For work, you will also need green paper on the background and a little yellow on the core. </p><p>  First cut 16 large petals, and then 12 a little smaller.  Stick them on the background with their bases to form a circle.  Spread the lower tier with larger ovals, and the upper tier with those that are smaller.  The final touch is gluing in the center of the circle, which will serve as the core. </p><p>  You can try a more interesting option by tearing the yellow sheet into small pieces.  Lubricate the middle of the flower with glue and sprinkle this area with the resulting scraps.  Make sure that they form an even circle.  This method will help you make a fluffy core for the flower. </p><h2>  Learning Shapes </h2><p>  Another creative option is an applique of figures.  Such work develops well the imagination and thinking of children.  In addition, they begin to study and memorize forms that have various subjects.  These crafts can be very simple or more complex in structure and number of parts.  But they are always based on the principle of using simple <span>geometric shapes.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="application patterns" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/811101.jpg" width="237"></div>

    <p>  For example, a house can be made of a square that goes to the wall, a triangle to the roof, and rectangles to the window and door.  To create a flower, butterfly or caterpillar, you need circles.  Any animal can be made up of ovals of different sizes.  A simple and cute postcard application created using this technique can be a wonderful gift from a child for one of the parents or friends for any occasion. </p>
