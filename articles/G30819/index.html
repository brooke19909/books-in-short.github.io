For example, in Thailand, in Turkey or in Egypt.  Rest with a child is always interesting and informative.  The main thing is to prepare for it in advance, trying to provide for all the so-called underwater pebbles.  For example, a vacation <span>in Egypt in May</span> with a child is fraught with a lack of sea bathing.  Why?  The fact is that the water, especially at the beginning of the month, is still slightly warmed up, and in combination with the cold wind at this time of the year it makes beach vacations practically impossible.  That is why it is worth considering this fact, going to the resort in the last spring month. </p><h2>  Holidays in Egypt with a small child </h2>

    <p>  As you know, Egypt is a very exotic warm country where a huge number of people from all over the world dream of spending their holidays.  It seems that there is everything you need: the sea coast, wonderful beaches, amazingly beautiful coral reefs, breathtaking excursions along the Nile and the ancient Egyptian pyramids.  And this is not a complete list of what the country of the pharaohs and deserts can offer. </p><p>  The incredible flora and diverse fauna of the underwater depths contribute to the popularity of diving.  Although those who plan a family vacation in Egypt with children, you still need to choose a resort that offers not a coral, but a sandy entrance to the sea.  Otherwise, kids or adults who cannot swim will be forced to spend time only by the pool. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reviews of many travelers claim that the most popular resort for relaxing with your family is Hurghada.  There is a relatively shallow depth of the sea, which is ideal for swimming and children's games.  And you can admire bizarre coral reefs and textures a little further than the sandy beach. </p><p>  In addition, from here there is the opportunity to go with the children on an unforgettable <span>cruise on the Nile.</span>  For a few (usually 2-3) days of excursion, tourists will see many Egyptian wonders: the pyramids of Cheops, famous temples, Luxor with the Valley of the Kings and the mystical city of Edfu. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go? </h2>

    <p>  If you still gathered in the summer to Egypt, vacation with a child should be planned especially carefully.  It should be noted that, starting in June, the average air temperature in the daytime is at least 32 ¬∞ C, and the maximum temperature rises to an unbelievable mark of + 50 ¬∞ C by August.  From the first summer month, the sea will become very warm, which means it will not bring the desired freshness. </p><p>  That is why many Egyptian families lead nightlife and sleep during the day.  People begin to go out only at 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening.  Children play all night, and in the morning they leave to rest again.  Severe heat during the day does not allow you to leave the air-conditioned room. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Agree, in such conditions, going on vacation with a baby is quite problematic.  At the above temperatures, an inexpensive vacation in Egypt with children is generally impossible.  If the hotel does not have air conditioning or a good centralized cooling system, spending time there will simply be impossible.  Experienced travelers also warn about this. </p><p>  Although, despite all this, vacationers, apparently due to their short stay and relaxed lifestyle, can tolerate the heat more easily, claiming that it is almost not felt under umbrellas by the sea.  Experts also recommend hiding indoors during the intense heat of the day, and go to the beach only early in the morning or in the evening.  It is quite possible to buy oneself and get a tan during this period, but not to harm one's health. </p><p>  Holidays in Egypt in July with a child will also give a luxurious selection of fresh fruits.  The most common are watermelons, grapes, apricots, peaches, apples and mangoes. </p><p>  By the way, reviews of vacationers say that the best holidays with children in Egypt can also be organized in the winter.  However, for this you need to choose a protected area from the winds.  It will be warm, comfortable, and the water temperature in the sea is suitable even for swimming.  But still, on cool days, warm clothing (for example, an autumn jacket or sleeveless jacket) will be needed. </p><p>  What about spring?  Should I go to Egypt at this time of year?  Rest with a child will most likely be uncomfortable.  Why?  The thing is that after the winter it‚Äôs still pretty cool here - the temperature of both water and air is uncomfortable for relaxation. </p><p>  Experienced travelers note that autumn is considered the most successful time allotted for a vacation in Egypt with a child.  The best hotels in both Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh this season are usually crowded.  The heat subsides, and the sea brings a long-awaited relaxation, meeting travelers with warm and gentle water. </p><h2>  How to choose a beach? </h2><p>  It is permissible to rest in Egypt with a one-year-old child.  Reviews from numerous travelers will not let you lie.  Of course, there is nothing surprising in the fact that you will certainly want to bathe your child in the sea.  However, it should be borne in mind that the main part of the coast of this country still consists of coral reefs, which means that without special shoes the baby can hurt his legs. </p><p>  The available sandy beaches are very modest in size and go into the sea for only a couple of meters.  Then corals follow, on which it is very dangerous to walk both adults and children.  In such places it is allowed to enter the sea only by pontoon. </p><p>  When arranging a vacation with a child <span>in Egypt in June</span> and counting on abundant water procedures in the open water, try to choose beaches without coral.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, they are there, albeit small in number.  Otherwise, as many parents say, you will have to be content only with the pool. </p><h2>  Hotels in Egypt for families with children.  Food choices and how to avoid trouble </h2>

    <p>  We would not advise you to rejoice and relax in advance if your hotel offers all inclusive meals.  The thing is that in reality it turns out that hotels in Egypt provide burgers, hot dogs and other fast food of very dubious quality for children to relax.  Not the best option, right?  What to do?  Experienced travelers offer to pay close attention to the main restaurants of the hotel. </p><p>  Most Egyptian catering venues are nevertheless European-style, so in the morning you can order omelets, cereals, milk, cereal and yogurt without any problems.  For lunch, fish, steamed vegetables, meat and pasta are great, and you can buy a lot of fresh fruit at the local market. </p><p>  According to experienced travelers, Sea Gull, Albatros Resort, Four Seasons, Palm Beach Resort, Sharm Plaza and Hilton Long Beach Resort are considered the best hotels for families with kids. </p><h2>  What to eat on a walk? </h2>

    <p>  Whenever you go on vacation with your child in Egypt - in June, July, August or any other month of the year, you should remember that in this country you can only drink bottled water, only it is completely suitable for consumption. </p><p>  If a child wants to drink juice, it is recommended to purchase a high-quality drink (without the addition of sugar) of local production Juhayna Pure.  Local herbal teas, which are presented in a huge assortment here, are also very good at quenching thirst.  Experienced mothers argue that it is absolutely safe to give them a drink. </p><p>  For children in Egypt, you can choose yogurt with any flavor or pasteurized milk in soft bags or plastic bottles. </p><p>  But when choosing chicken, you should be very careful, especially in supermarkets.  It is better to replace it with frozen red fish. </p><p>  For baby food, a local Egyptian dish reminiscent of rice with milk is perfect.  It is sold refrigerated in plastic containers with plastic spoons. </p><p>  Egyptian milk mixes and cereals are presented in a meager assortment, and those that are have such taste properties that our children, as a rule, do not want to eat them. </p><h2>  About medicines in Egypt.  How to be </h2><p>  The situation with medicines in this country is much better than with baby food.  They are cheap and, by the way, genuine. </p><p>  In this state there are many analogues to our medicines, but they cost, which is nice to note, much less. </p><p>  However, if you are going to Egypt, a vacation with a child will be more comfortable if you are not too lazy to bring all the necessary medicines with you so as not to look for them later throughout the resort.  Doing so recommend not only experienced parents, but also doctors. </p><h2>  What to do with mosquitoes? </h2>

    <p>  Blood-sucking insects, of course, can spoil the rest for unprepared guests both in our country and in Egypt. </p><p>  Although here, at the resort, the situation is very predictable - mosquitoes are only in the place where plantings or lawns are watered. </p><p>  As soon as the heat subsides and the weather is fine, these insects immediately make themselves felt.  They appear in the evening and can disrupt the whole night's sleep, especially for children. </p><p>  Protecting yourself from them is almost impossible, since our domestic anti-mosquito repellents do not help.  Therefore, to combat the bloodsuckers, you must immediately purchase local pills that at least calm insects and prevent the child from being bitten on the very first night. </p><h2>  Should I bring diapers with me? </h2>

    <p>  Diapers in Egypt have their own characteristics.  Even the products of the most famous brands have an external polyethylene shell.  Thus, putting a diaper on a child, you pack it in a kind of plastic bag with an absorbent layer inside.  Of course, there are breathers here, but in order to find them or explain to the sellers what exactly you want, you will have to work hard. </p><p>  But even diapers of excellent quality in Egypt can not be compared with products of the same brand in Russia.  Therefore, if the child is allergic and sensitive to the quality of various brands of diapers, it is best to bring them with you.  Experienced parents do just that. </p><h2>  Are there any children's stores in the country? </h2><p>  It should be noted that throughout Egypt, quite a lot of different shops with children's goods are scattered quite evenly.  But the assortment here, unfortunately, is not very rich. </p><p>  European goods, although present, but they are available in very limited quantities, and very expensive.  It should also be borne in mind that there are no online stores where you could choose and order any children's accessories. </p><p>  Nevertheless, very interesting children's things are made in Egypt on their own, among which wonderful and ecological wooden toys and handmade metal cars stand out. </p><h2>  How do local staff treat children? </h2>

    <p>  Holidays in Egypt with a child hotels (reviews about them are often positive) provide excellent. </p><p>  All locals are very fond of children.  In Egypt, it is considered normal if a stranger begins to rub the child on the cheeks or kiss.  Another question is whether such parents will like this kind of friendliness. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very attentive and friendly to children.  Mom with a child, buying something in the store, can just get a small gift from the seller.  Such a cute attitude towards the kids, of course, is pleasant and significantly improves their comfort on vacation. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Going on any vacation, especially with children, you must adhere to special precautions. </p><p>  In Egypt, first of all, one should not forget about dirty tap water.  By consuming such water, you can get severe <span>food poisoning</span> and an adult.  What then to speak about the kid? </p><p>  This water can only be rinsed after the sea or pool or washed dishes.  But for cooking and eating, you need to buy exclusively bottled water. </p><p>  Egypt is a very hot country, especially in the summer, so the main rule here is the need to use sunscreen.  They need to be smeared before leaving the premises and after bathing, and go to the beach no later than 11 am and only after 16 pm. </p><p>  The third main problem in Egypt, according to many, is mosquitoes, which can infect a child, like an adult, with dangerous diseases.  In general, mosquito bites are very disturbing for children.  Therefore, immediately upon arrival in the country you need to buy a mosquito repellent, and at the hotel insert a fumigator with a tablet into the outlet. </p><p>  In general, I would like to note that comfortable and high-quality hotels in Egypt for families with children exist, but their choice must be approached responsibly.  You may need to seek the help of more experienced travelers for help and advice. </p>
