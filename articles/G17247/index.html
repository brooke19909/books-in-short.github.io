With a huge number of options available, it seems that finding the right one is impossible.  Even professional photographers change the lens kit several times before settling on an acceptable option.  The ideal rule for those who choose which optics to purchase does not exist.  But the tips in this article can shed light on some aspects that you need to consider regardless of whether you choose a lens for a Canon, Nikon, Sony or a camera from another manufacturer. </p><h2>  Why do I have to update a set of optics? </h2><p>  On the one hand, even if the user is satisfied with their lenses, there is a high probability that they will have to be replaced.  New models appear on the market every year, and old equipment fails after some time.  In addition, the interests of the photographer are changing.  If he hadn‚Äôt shot wildlife before, he will need to replace his equipment if he intends to take this path. </p><p>  Of course, there are professionals who have successfully used one kit for a long period of time.  Perhaps the most famous such photographer is Henri Cartier-Bresson.  For most of his life, he remained faithful to 50 mm (although sometimes he used 35 mm and 90 mm).  Many would like to be in a similar position - to feel so comfortable that there is no need to buy something new, assuming that the lens technology remains relatively constant.  This is where optics selection tips can help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon Lens Selection" class="if uuid-2261127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261127.jpg"></div><h2>  Identification of needs </h2><p>  In the field of photography, everyone pursues their own interests, so there are so many lenses in the world.  Wildlife imaging equipment will rarely match the design of a specialist in architecture.  As you specialize, the choice of lens depends more on the photographed objects.  For example, for macro photography, optics are used that no one else uses. </p><p>  The following is a list of the most important parameters that should be considered when selecting a lens. </p><h2>  Weight </h2><p>  The lightweight kit is more convenient to carry, which is desirable in almost every genre of photography. </p><p>  Those who often go camping for landscape photography will need a light kit.  If you wear a set of lenses in a backpack, then a difference of several tens of grams will not make much difference.  For example, a set of 20 mm, 35 mm and 70-200 mm optics weighs a total of 1.5 kg, which is reasonable for the focal lengths that they cover.  At the same time, a 105 mm lens can be left at home, since it simply duplicates a 70-200 mm lens.  A mirrorless kit would be lighter, although perhaps not as much as it might seem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lumix gx7" class="if uuid-2261129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261129.jpg"></div><h2>  Focal length </h2><p>  Ideally, all the focal lengths that you plan to use should be covered.  To save weight, it is better to avoid lenses that perform similar functions.  For example, few people really need to have both 24 mm f / 1.8 and 28 mm f / 1.8 optics at the same time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A good selection of both portrait and landscape lenses is provided by a set of 20 mm, 35 mm and 70-200 mm.  Focal lengths of 70-200 mm cover almost all landscape photography options.  Choosing a wide-angle lens allows you to visually increase the distance and place the entire subject in the frame, whether it be a building, a large group of people or a landscape.  The gap between 35 and 70 mm should not bother, since these focal lengths are rarely used.  Ideally, of course, it is better to have more wide-angle coverage without sacrificing weight or image quality. </p><h2>  Image quality </h2><p>  All photographers prefer high quality images.  Fixed focal length lenses tend to provide better shots in low light conditions than zooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony lens selection" class="if uuid-2261130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261130.jpg"></div><h2>  Maximum aperture </h2><p>  Optics with a wide relative aperture are ideal for shooting in dark conditions or for obtaining a shallow depth of field.  Photographers taking landscapes and macro scenes recommend choosing a lens with an aperture of f / 8 or less.  However, f / 1.8 aperture is very welcome for night shooting. </p><h2>  Filter thread </h2><p>  If you plan to use filters, it is best to purchase optics with a thread of the same size as other lenses.  However, most models allow you to work with filters if you purchase additional holders for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is important for a landscape photographer to be able to easily change filters.  According to reviews, the Nikon 14-24mm f / 2.8 lens, which does not have a corresponding thread, allows you to install smaller and less expensive filters.  Nevertheless, this does not matter much, since almost all optics allow them to be used. </p><h2>  Autofocus speed </h2><p>  For motion photography, focus speed and accuracy are two of the most important parameters.  Other photographers in general may be indifferent to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samyang Lens" class="if uuid-2261141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261141.jpg"></div><h2>  Special features </h2><p>  If you need optics for macro photography, with a tilt shift or even just with a vibration reduction system, then you need to look for lenses with the appropriate functionality. </p><p>  For example, landscape painters need equipment for night and telephoto shooting.  Vibration control and other features are not so important if you constantly use a tripod, but the rotation and shift function of the optical axis, although expensive, is worth it. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  Environmental protection, body material, smoothness of the focus ring, even the brand of the lens can contribute to aspects of build quality and ergonomics.  Cases of some models are made of metal, while others are made of high-quality plastic.  According to reviews, all modern manufacturers provide a sufficient level of assembly, so that it was not crucial for photographers.  Although protection against water and dust they are welcome.  You should pay attention to the performance of the focusing ring - some prefer its smoother shape.  In general, the more expensive the lens, the higher the quality of its assembly. </p><h2>  Compatibility </h2><p>  It‚Äôs bad when the optics do not work with the existing camera.  Photographers using state-of-the-art full-frame DSLRs do not need to worry about compatibility issues.  However, the choice of a Nikon lens for owners of cameras with a smaller sensor should be limited to FX models, as far as possible, since they will come in handy after switching to a full-frame camera.  The same is true for other manufacturers.  Sony lens selection should be limited to the FE format for a 35mm sensor.  It should be borne in mind that when installed on cameras with an APS-C sensor 1.5x, the focal length also increases one and a half times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tanron Lens" class="if uuid-2261136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261136.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of optics is perhaps the most important factor.  Lenses are expensive, but to varying degrees.  For example, f / 2.8 zooms and optics with a fixed focal length f / 1.4 will cost more.  Landscape photographers can save money because they rarely need wide-aperture lenses or fast focus.  If there is little money, then even complete optics (including 18-55 and 55-200 mm zooms) are suitable for shooting the landscape.  Lenses of all price ranges are available, and you can always go for the best, having accumulated a sufficient amount. </p><h2>  Decision-making </h2><p>  No optical kit is final.  Even with the exact choice of the focal lengths of the lenses, they will still have to be changed.  Photography is inseparable from constant experimentation. </p><p>  First you need to determine the degree of importance of each of the 10 factors listed.  If weight is the most significant component, then a mirrorless camera or a camera with a trimmed sensor may be the best choice.  If weight does not play a big role, but you need reliable and fast autofocus, you should purchase a DSLR.  Of course, if you have a camera of a certain type, the number of options will be limited. </p><p>  A photographer who specializes in shooting landscapes must decide in advance how much money he is willing to spend before deciding on a lens for Nikon.  In this case, optics are selected with the coverage of the necessary focal lengths.  The presence of a full-frame SLR camera Nikon narrows the search even more, although it leaves a certain number of possible options for comparison.  The final decision is the result of a long but not insurmountable process.  Online resources, such as the Photography Life lens database, help you search.  It allows you to see a list of all the optics that are suitable for a particular camera mount.  Of course, this is not a quick process, but it is an integral part of finding the right set. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sigma Lens" class="if uuid-2261140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261140.jpg"></div><h2>  Focal length gap </h2><p>  A large gap between the focal lengths (for example, between 35 mm and 70-200 mm) is not a problem.  Of course, in this case, some pictures are more difficult to make, but an analysis of the use of focal lengths will help to decide which values ‚Äã‚Äãare rarely used.  In addition, there are ways to achieve, for example, a 50 mm focal length without using a 50 mm lens. </p><p>  Some photographers go crazy due to the lack of optics with certain parameters.  If you want to have a set of 14-24 mm, 24-70 mm, 70-200 mm and 200-400 mm, then do not be shy about this.  Recruitment should work for the one who uses it, and only that matters.  There are also photographers who prefer to have overlapping focal lengths, for example, 16-35 mm in combination with 24-120 mm and 70-200 mm.  This kit is quite acceptable, although you will have to pay for extra millimeters (by weight, price or optics). </p><p>  But many professional photographers do not interfere with the ‚Äúomissions‚Äù of several focal lengths.  A small gap or even a relatively large gap is not the end of the world.  For example, Henri Cartier-Bresson used a kit with 35 mm, 50 mm and 90 mm lenses.  And he was hardly bothered by the lack of focal lengths. </p><h2>  Personal preferences </h2><p>  How important the features of the lens - from weight to focal lengths - depends on the particular photographer.  Someone is likely to prefer the Zeiss 50 mm over the cheaper Nikon.  This is normal and should be considered when choosing a lens.  Even a landscape photographer can hate ultra-wide-angle optics.  And you can stop at a range of 24-70 mm, and not 11-24, even if many do not agree with this. </p><p>  For example, when choosing a landscape lens for a Canon DSLR, there are always several competing third-party options, many of which are cheaper than the optics of a Japanese company, not inferior to it in image quality.  However, photographers tend to choose the Canon model for reasons (such as bokeh and protection against moisture and dust) that do not really matter much.  This is not an obvious solution, especially for those who are trying to save on everything, but in the end it justifies itself.  Such a choice of lens for Canon makes it possible to take the best photo that requires accuracy from every bit of the pixel.  Can I get it with third-party optics?  Probably yes, but you can‚Äôt say for sure.  Therefore, it is better to follow your feelings. </p><p>  On a more rational level, the photographer may have different preferences for what you like and dislike about the lens.  A focal length of 50 mm can be loved more than any other, even without a specific reason.  This is enough to add it to your kit.  Or perhaps lenses with a fixed focal length are preferred rather than zooms.  This choice is also absolutely correct. </p><p>  Of course, personal preferences will change over time.  For example, you can love ultra-wide-angle lenses (16 mm and wider), and then find them difficult to use and not particularly useful.  And it is absolutely certain that at some point, preferences will change again, and wide angles will again become absolute favorites.  And an unclaimed lens can always be returned or resold. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon lens selection" class="if uuid-2261120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2261120.jpg"></div><h2>  Improving dialing over time </h2><p>  It is very unlikely that the first lenses are ideal for the needs of the photographer.  However, each of them will tell something new and valuable about personal preferences.  For example, after working for more than a year with 50 mm optics, you can understand that this focal length is rarely used.  And using lenses with a fixed focal length will make it clear that you can do without zoom. </p><p>  A set of optics is good in that it makes it easy to change its components.  Although resale only compensates for a fraction of the cost, it is better to think of unavoidable costs as long-term rental fees.  You can lose some money in this process, but it's cheaper than renting lenses.  In addition, the photographer gets an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe optics that best suits his personal style. </p><p>  According to professionals, during their career they completely changed their sets 4 or more times, all the while striving to improve the quality of pictures.  A set of optics is a developing and constantly changing part of your photographic equipment, which will continue to improve as the user realizes his needs. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Choosing a lens is not an easy decision.  The number of options is too large, especially considering all the old models and third-party products.  It is likely that the first attempt to find the best kit will fail, and even with the second and third.  But as you study your preferences in photography, choosing the right lens for the Canon, Nikon, Sony, and other <span>brands of cameras</span> will make it easier. </p><p>  Reviews of professionals confirm this.  For example, upon returning from an expedition, a photographer can understand that the pictures taken with a 105 mm telephoto lens always go slightly beyond the required focal length.  They either have to be cut off more than usual, or they require a larger increase.  Thus, the need naturally arises to acquire a relatively fast and incredibly sharp telephoto lens of 70-200 mm f / 4.  The search for the required model takes no more than a few minutes, and its long-term use confirms the correctness of the decision. </p><p>  It is likely that the choice will not always be so clear and successful.  In most cases, it will take several attempts before you feel confident in your lens.  And some never find the perfect solution, and this is also good - if the photographer likes to change his optics often, then this is a great way to enjoy the shooting process.  The only thing that really matters is the pleasure of the work you are doing.  If the kit is a joy, then this is more important than any technical considerations. </p>
