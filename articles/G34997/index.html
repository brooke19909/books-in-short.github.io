    <p>  The political system of <span>society, the concept</span> and structure of which, according to some authors, is rather vague and controversial, is characterized as a complex of different elements interacting with each other, within which <span>power relations</span> are implemented <span>.</span> </p><p>  Allocate the main components included in this complex.  The political system of society primarily includes an institutional component.  It represents the state, public organizations, parties, authorities, other formations.  Without the above entities, the political system of society is impossible, since it is they who enter into power relations. </p><p>  The second element of the complex is the substantial component.  It reflects the essence of the entire political system.  The substantial element is a relationship that is formed about the exercise, retention or seizure of power in the state. </p><p>  The political system of society includes a normative component.  This element represents the norms, customs, traditions and other <span>social norms that</span> contribute to the regulation of power relations in the state.  It is designed to regulate the <span>political processes</span> in society.  As a rule, regulation is carried out using the rule of law.  At the same time, the political system of society is a complex complex.  Therefore, the traditional, well-established rules of social behavior are so important. </p><p>  The political system of society contains a subjective element.  It is a reflection of people's attitudes to power in the state.  The subjective element contains political consciousness, which, in turn, is represented by psychological and ideological components.  Political consciousness is an integral complex of feelings, assessments, ideas, views, relationships, emotions.  It reflects the subjective attitude of <span>communities, social</span> groups, individuals to the existing (existing) or proposed (desired) leadership of the country, the behavior of government officials, other phenomena of state reality.  Political consciousness can be influenced by various factors, including the behavior of leaders, charisma of leaders and others. </p><p>  Another element of the complex is objective.  It includes objective national, social, economic, historical and other determinants that influence the course of political processes in the state.  They do not depend on the consciousness or will of the people. </p><p>  All these components that make up the political system of society are considered significant, have a mutually penetrating effect and, therefore, are indivisible. </p><p>  The complex functions are called its main directions of influence on the people.  They are determined by national, social, economic and other conditions under which a political system exists. </p><p>  The following main functions are available: </p><p>  1. The implementation of political leadership of society. </p><p>  2. Definition of landmarks.  In conditions of political regulation, during the struggle for power, the ruling class, parties and other entities (in accordance with one or another <span>political regime</span> in the state) form a further development path, goals that should be sought.  Thus, the orientation of the masses towards one or another variant of behavior is ensured. </p><p>  3. The function of politicization is the involvement of the maximum number of citizens and their groups in the political processes taking place in the country. </p><p>  4. The structure has a regulatory function.  It represents the development and installation of social norms in the sphere of power. </p>
