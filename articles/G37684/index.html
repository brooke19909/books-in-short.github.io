    <p>  <strong>Three easy steps</strong> </p><p>  Instead of touting any model and presenting it as the best smartphone of 2013, we just recommend where to start your choice.  So, first you need to decide on the type of your future gadget.  Some people are most interested in the presence of a protected case, others - the ability to use two SIM cards, and others - the quality of music playback.  If you like taking pictures, choose a smartphone with a good camera, if you have a lot of friends and you often communicate - a device with a powerful battery.  Creative people will surely like the gadget with the original design.  If a smartphone is chosen for a gift to a girl, then we advise you to pay attention to female models with delicate drawings or inlay.  To each, as they say, his own.  That is why it is so difficult to answer the question of which smartphones are better.  After all, everything is relative, and the answer ultimately depends on the importance for a person of certain characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best smartphone of the year" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/226217.jpg" width="600"></div>  The second step is to choose the shape of the apparatus.  It can be a candy bar, a device with a touch screen or QWERTY.  Classic models that do not have moving parts have high reliability and are time-tested.  On the other hand, if we talk about which smartphones are better for reading books, SMS correspondence and surfing the network, then in this case it is much preferable to devices with touch screens.  The lack of buttons allows you to equip such gadgets with a really large display, which will surely appeal to those who often watch videos or photos.  Which smartphones are better for hackers?  Of course, those that have a keyboard (QWERTY).  Even if you turn off the light or you are on the road, with such a phone, nothing will prevent you from conducting active activities on the network.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The third step: we determine the operating system.  Without it, you will not be able to use many popular applications and games.  You will be surprised, but now there are models on sale in which there is neither the Android OS, nor Blackberry, nor Symbian, nor Bada.  In other words, there are devices that do not use the operating system at all.  Therefore, we advise you to be vigilant so as not to fall for a trick with a low price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which smartphones are better" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/226215.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  <strong>How to determine the best smartphone of the year?</strong> </p><p>  The next point worth paying attention to is the type of screen.  The most affordable, of course, is TFT.  At the same time, IPS (RETINA), PLS and SuperAmoled can boast of clarity in displaying all the nuances and details of a picture with richness of color and depth of shades.  Actual <span>screen size</span> and resolution are also important.  And, of course, all necessary wireless technologies (3G, GPS, 4G / LTE, Wi-fi, NFC) and expanding functionality in the form of HDMI, USB, DLNA, etc. must be implemented in the device.  The performance of the smartphone depends on the processor power and internal memory.  It is best to choose an apparatus with a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù frequency of more than 1 GHz and two cores on board.  There must be at least 256 megabytes of memory.  The significance of other characteristics, such as multimedia, camera resolution, device dimensions, assembly material, weight, completely depends on the preferences of a particular person.  To facilitate the selection, we recommend that you pay attention primarily to those models that for a long time occupy the top places in the ratings of the most famous online stores. </p>
