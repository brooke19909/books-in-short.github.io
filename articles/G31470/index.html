    <p>  On the top of the Castle Hill, a memorial block has been established that reports that it was here that Braslav began.  Nearby is the grave of a local doctor and philanthropist Stanislav Narbut, indicated by a high obelisk.

    <p>  Another interesting building you can see in the city is the Narbut hospital, which was already discussed above.  A talented doctor Stanislav Narbut built a hospital in Braslav that meets all the requirements of European medicine.  Within its walls, he conducted dozens of complex operations, saving the lives of both adults and children.  The red hospital building is located directly under Castle Hill and is characterized by a restrained, but rather refined brick wall decor.  Now this building houses an Orthodox monastery. </p><h2>  Pristine purity and idyll of Braslav lakes </h2><p>  In the story about the tourist sites of the Belarusian city, one cannot fail to mention the reservoirs that surround it.  Braslav Lakes is a group of reservoirs and a national park with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã130 square kilometers.  A great place to relax and observe wildlife.  In total, there are 70 reservoirs of various sizes.  The largest of them are Drivyaty, Snudy, Tsno, as well as Lake Strusto.  On the shore of the latter, by the way, is located the Okmenitsa spring with healing mineral water. </p>
