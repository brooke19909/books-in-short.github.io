The question of how to create a homunculus always worried the ancient alchemists.  Some of them even claimed that they had succeeded.  Arguing about this, alchemists often turned to the dark forces for help.  This gave rise to a lot of myths and legends. </p><h2>  How to make a homunculus: is it possible or not? </h2><p>  The peak of the popularity of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãartificial humans came in the era of sperm discovery.  It was about four hundred years ago.  At that time, science was less developed than it is now, and sperm cells were endowed by scientists with all sorts of properties that were not inherent to them.  For example, according to one theory, it was believed that inside the sperm are other sperm, and in those - more.  That they are something like fractals.  Medieval scholars thought that if you feed sperm with blood, then a person will grow out of them. </p><p>  The figure below shows how medieval scholars represented people inside sperm. </p>

    <p>  When alchemists promulgated such ideas, this created fear and hatred of scientists among the common people. </p><p>  To this day, it has not been possible to grow a person from a sperm outside the female body.  The fact is that to recreate the conditions of the mother‚Äôs womb is artificially unusually difficult.  Despite the fact that science has stepped far forward, there remain people who believe in the success of creating an artificial person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Homunculus Experiments </h2><p>  Modern curious people are still searching in ancient books for information about who such a homunculus is, reading the texts of descriptions of experiments by alchemists.  There is a lot of conflicting information on the Internet about this.  Now, having learned what a homunculus is, we will consider the experiments with which our ancestors tried to create it. </p><p>  One of the Spanish scientists who lived in the 13th century, judging by the records, managed to produce such a creature into the world.  Many then scientists tried to repeat his experiment.  It was believed that the secret to success is the correct selection of starting materials, which then need to be heated to the optimum temperature.  Subject to all conditions, life was born in the flask.  There were legends that homunculi can live only in certain specific conditions, and they feed on human blood.  When all the recommendations are fulfilled, a homunculus growth of up to 30 cm in length over a period of 40 days was predicted.  Many experiments of those days required magnets and horse manure as starting materials and tools. </p>

    <h2>  Paracelsus </h2><p>  An alchemist and doctor from Switzerland, Paracelsus, who lived at the beginning of the 16th century, was a recognized specialist in creating artificial people.  He made notes about who the homunculus is and how to conduct an experiment on its creation, however, so that the records did not go to those who should not, he encrypted them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It was still possible to decipher his recipe: </p><ol><li>  First you need to place sperm in a glass flask.  The flask is clogged and buried in manure for 40 days. </li><li>  After the allotted time, the flask is removed and magnetized.  How exactly magnetization occurs is not known for certain.  The homunculus at this time acquires the characteristics of a person. </li><li>  At the third stage, when the magical rite was performed, the bulb opened and the birth of an artificial person took place. </li><li>  From that moment, they began to feed him with human blood.  All this time the flask had to be heated to the temperature of the human body. </li><li>  After 40 weeks, if everything was done correctly, a real baby of a small size was obtained from a demonic creature. </li></ol><p>  Paracelsus and his colleagues believed that since childhood, homunculi have known the secrets of creating the world, and they share these secrets with those who created them. </p><h2>  We make a homunculus at home </h2><p>  To conduct an experiment on growing a homunculus, we need sperm and a bird's egg.  The egg will replace the nutrient medium of the female egg, there are enough different substances in it for the development of the body. </p><p>  Before making a homunculus, in addition to the indicated ingredients, take: </p><ul><li>  Syringe. </li><li>  Thick fabric. </li><li>  Alcohol for disinfection. </li></ul><p>  The order of the experiment: </p><ol><li>  We collect sperm in a syringe. </li><li>  In the egg shell, gently make a hole with a needle and inject sperm with a syringe. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to create a homunculus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45994/1550654.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  We seal the hole in the shell with adhesive tape or tape. </li><li>  We put the egg in a tightly closed jar, for example, from under the coffee, and leave it in a warm place.  As a warm place, you can use a heating radiator. </li><li>  We leave the bank for a period of 5 to 14 days. </li><li>  Now it remains to wait and hope that you can personally see who such a homunculus is. </li></ol><h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  Some believe that homunculi do not have a specific gender.  This is not true.  These creatures have gender characteristics. </p><p>  These artificially obtained organisms have an underdeveloped nervous system and muscles. </p><p>  Homunculi are not susceptible to light. </p><p>  The first known homunculus was born in 1534. </p><p>  Tales in which homunculi are possibly mentioned: "Thumbelina", "Boy with a finger", "Kotigoroshko". </p><p>  In Goethe's famous Faust, Mephistopheles creates a homunculus in the laboratory. </p><p>  Whether to repeat these eccentric experiments is up to you. </p>
