It was organized in 1237 from the <span>Order of the Swordsmen,</span> defeated by the Zemgale and Lithuanians at the Battle of Saul.  The Livonian Order was considered the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order.  It broke up in 1561, when in the <span>Livonian War</span> it was defeated by Lithuanian and Russian troops. </p>

    <p>  The head of the order was the master.  True, he was forced to submit to the supreme master of the Teutonic Order.  The first chapter was Hermann Balk.  After the master was followed by a land marshal - the commander of the army.  The lands of the Order consisted of komtursts (castle districts), which had fortified castles that served as the residence of the komtur (manager).  Komtur took care of food, clothing and weapons.  He also was in charge of the warehousing and finance.  It was Komtur who commanded the troops of the castle district during the war.  However, most of the important issues were discussed at the order meeting (convention). </p><p>  The highest body of the Order was the general meeting of Komtours - the chapter, which was held 2 times a year.  Only with the permission of the chapter could the master give the land in flax possession, conclude agreements, establish laws for local residents and share the income of the commissions.  The chapter elected an order of council, consisting of a master, a land marshal and 5 advisers.  This advice had a huge impact on the decisions of the master. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Members of the Order were divided into ministers of worship and knights.  A distinctive feature of the knights was a white cloak with a <span>black cross.</span>  There were half-brothers, who were distinguished by a gray cloak.  The heavily armed cavalry was considered the main combat skeleton of the Order.  The troops included hired warriors.  In addition to the permanent members, the army of the Order was replenished at the expense of various knights who were looking for adventure. </p>

    <p>  Only Germans who are members of the old noble families could enter the Livonian Order.  Each new member vowed to devote his life to the spread of Christianity. </p><p>  Entering the Livonian Order, the knights stopped wearing the <span>family coat of arms.</span>  It was replaced by a sword common to all and a red cross on a cloak. </p><p>  In addition, the Livonian knights could not marry and own property.  According to the charter, knights had to live together, sleep on hard lodges, eat scarce food, and could not go anywhere, receive or write letters without higher permission. </p><p>  Also, the brothers did not have the right to keep anything under lock and key and could not talk to women. </p><p>  The whole life of the members of the Order was regulated by the charter.  Each castle had a book of chivalry, which was read at least 3 times a year.  Each day a member of the Order began with a liturgy. </p><p>  Fasted for almost a year.  Mostly ate porridge, bread and vegetables.  The weapons and clothes were monotonous. </p><p>  The property of the Livonian knight was limited to a pair of shirts, a pair of breeches, 2 pairs of shoes, one cloak, a sheet, a prayer book and a knife.  Members of the Order were banned from any entertainment except hunting. </p>

    <p>  But the charter was a relief, leading to the secularization of the organization that the Livonian Order created: the knights could trade in favor of relatives.  At first, the knights changed their feats of arms to commercial and political activities, and soon they completely converted to Protestantism, turning into secular persons. </p>
