Can't decide on a place to stay and stay?  Ripples in the eyes of all kinds of <span>hotels, hotels</span> and campsites? </p><p>  Pay attention to the <span>Hilton Long Beach Hurghada</span> Hotel, which has been waiting for its guests since 2003. The complex consists of three parts: a 3-storey main building, a 3-storey family complex and a complex of 2-storey villas located closer to the sea.  There is a bus to the center of Hurghada (scheduled). </p><p>  Arriving at the Hilton Long Beach Hotel Hurghada, which is an international-class hotel for the most demanding tastes, you will be pleasantly surprised by the high quality of service and maintenance, and comfortable rooms will not leave indifferent even the most demanding tourist. </p><p>  In each room, in addition to such standard things as a sink, toilet and shower room, there are also means of additional comfort - so that having arrived even thousands of kilometers away, a person does not feel divorced from civilization.  This is a TV, telephone, and there is also a minibar to arrange, say, a romantic evening for two, without leaving the apartment.  In addition, there is access to a balcony or even a terrace.  Just imagine!  You will be able to observe such an incomparable sight as sunrise and sunset! </p><p>  Fans of water procedures will find in the hotel an outdoor pool, <span>a diving</span> center <span>,</span> and other water activities;  if you are hungry, a bar or cafe is at your service, and if your companion wishes a social evening and interesting conversations, you should go to a restaurant.  We can not say about such forms of entertainment as billiards and bowling - they are also in great demand among vacationers.  Volleyball, minigolf, table <span>tennis, tennis court,</span> gym - Hilton Long Beach Hotel Hurghada will provide all this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can send your children to the kids club so that they are there under the supervision of professional nannies or leave to play on the playground;  while you yourself can go for a massage, a sauna, a medical office or a health center.  The hotel also has a car rental center - you can rent any car you like for an hour and enjoy a ride;  the necessary currency exchange points are located directly in the hotel, so that you can easily change money;  various shops and shopping centers.  If you have a favorite pet, which you cannot leave alone, feel free to take it with you - Hilton Long Beach Hurghada Hotel provides pet-friendly accommodation!  The hotel also provides laundry and dry cleaning services. </p><p>  Of course, a different entertainment program is presented at Hilton Long Beach - animation, discos, in other words, everything you need for a bright leisure.  Those who wish are offered various excursions. </p><p>  On the beach, the vacationer and his family will undoubtedly be pleased with the abundance of free umbrellas, sun loungers and towels - all this is provided to visitors absolutely free.  Hilton Long Beach has its own stretch of coastal strip.  It is about a kilometer long - a whole kilometer of fine, clean, warm sand!  There is also a plot with corals on it.  You need to walk about two hundred meters to a depth, a very smooth and gently sloping bottom, which, of course, is a plus for children.  From the hotel to the sea is only six hundred meters. </p><p>  The location <span>of the Hilton</span> Long Beach <span>Hotel</span> in Hurghada is very convenient - only 20 km from the city, and the international airport is a 15-20 minute drive from the hotel, so you will be transferred from the airport to the hotel in a record short time. </p><p>  Only positive, vibrant, full of impressions reviews about the Hilton Long Beach Hotel in Hurghada are left by people who visited it.  Having been in it at least once, I want to return here again and again to enjoy a wonderful vacation that remains in my memory for a long time. </p>
