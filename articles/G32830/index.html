But with them, various malfunctions can also occur.  Rebooting is a useful feature that is present on all smartphones and tablets.  Of course, the iPhone is no exception.  There are many reasons why you need to reboot the device.  These include: </p><ul><li>  freezing </li><li>  slow work; </li><li>  memory clearing; </li><li>  decrease in stability. </li></ul><p>  In this article we will tell you how to restart an iPhone, and in what situations it is necessary to do. </p><h2>  Ways </h2><p>  Sometimes users are faced with circumstances when applications spontaneously close or freeze in an iPhone, the phone stops responding to keystrokes or touching the touch screen.  In such cases, rebooting the device is an effective way to solve problems.  How to restart an iPhone?  There are several ways to restart the device, for example: </p><ul><li>  soft reboot; </li><li>  hard reset </li></ul><p>  Also, in addition to this, it may be necessary to reset data and restore factory settings. </p><h2>  Normal reboot </h2><p>  According to the developers, the iPhone does not need a periodic reboot.  However, in various situations, for example, when the gadget began to respond poorly to finger touches on the sensor, or running applications began to work slowly, the device must be restarted.  During this process, the memory is cleaned up and data that is not needed is deleted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone off" class="if uuid-2948494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948494.jpg"></div><p>  How to restart an iPhone if it freezes?  To do this, press and hold the Power button at the top of the phone until a red slider appears on the screen.  Next, you need to move it to the right.  After these steps, the iPhone will turn off.  Then turn on the phone while also holding the Power button.  It is worth noting that the iPhone 7 and 7s key off / lock the device is located in the upper right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hard Reset </h2><p>  In cases when the phone suddenly turns off, freezes and does not respond to pressing the power button, a regular reboot will not help.  In such situations, a hard reset is required.  It is worth noting that if your smartphone is turned off, it is recommended that you first check to see if it is dead, and then carry out further actions.  Forced reboot is worth starting when the smartphone freezes or stops responding to user actions.  Usually banal shutdown and subsequent switching on the device is enough. </p><h2>  Hard reset on older models </h2><p>  All iPhones up to version 7 inclusive can be forcibly reloaded using the same key combination. </p><p>  Step-by-step instructions on how to restart iPhone 4s and other similar models. </p><ol><li><p>  Press the Home and Power keys at the same time. </p></li><li><p>  Hold them (usually about 10 seconds) until the Apple logo appears (apple on a white or black background). </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reboot iPhone 4s" class="if uuid-2948515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948515.jpg"></div><p>  A forced restart will in no way affect user data (for example, messages, contacts, photos, etc.) stored on the device. </p><h2>  Hard reset iPhone 7 </h2><p>  It is important to know that before proceeding to the steps described below, it is recommended that you back up all files whenever possible.  This is necessary to reduce the risk of losing any important data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to restart iPhone 7?  Follow these steps: </p><p>  Step 1. Press and hold the Power button on the right. </p><p>  Step 2. Press and hold the volume down key on the left side. </p><p>  Step 3. Hold both buttons until the screen goes blank. </p><p>  Step 4. After the logo with the apple appears, the keys can be released. </p><p>  Thus, the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus should reboot and return to the lock screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restart iPhone 7?" class="if uuid-2948442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948442.jpg"></div><h2>  Force restart iPhone 8, X or R </h2><p>  The Home button has always been an integral part of the iPhone.  It allowed users to perform some of the most commonly used functions, such as waking up a smartphone, returning to the main screen, forcing a restart, and recognizing Touch ID fingerprints. </p><p>  Starting with the iPhone 7, Apple has changed the Home key.  Now the click action is modeled by a tactile reaction.  As a result of the new procedure, the forced reboot process has also changed.  How to restart iPhone 10?  Now in the X version smartphone, pressing and holding the power and volume buttons activates Apple's new emergency mode.  To hard reset, force restart, or reboot iPhone X, you must complete the following steps: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restart iPhone X?" class="if uuid-2948469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948469.jpg"></div><ol><li><p>  Press the volume up button on your iPhone and quickly release it. </p></li><li><p>  Then press the volume down key and also release it quickly. </p></li><li><p>  Finally, press and hold the power button until you see the Apple logo that appears on the iPhone screen. </p></li></ol><p>  You can clearly see how to restart iPhone 10 in this video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="5ATIDQv_FWY" data-url="https://youtu.be/5ATIDQv_FWY" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/1/3/2/3/11323.jpg"></div><h2>  Factory settings </h2><p>  Despite the development and release of new models of Apple's gadgets, the process of returning devices to factory settings has remained virtually unchanged.  How to restart an iPhone?  To reset smartphone data, go to "Settings" - "Basic" - "Reset".  In this menu you will find various options for rebooting the device.  These include the items "Reset all settings", "Erase content and settings", "Reset network settings" and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Data reset" class="if uuid-2948541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948541.jpg"></div><p>  If you choose to reset all smartphone settings, during the process all user settings will be deleted, including Wi-Fi data, information about the cards used to pay via Apple Pay.  Other data, such as photos, sounds or contacts, will remain unchanged.  The item "Erase content" will delete all user information and return the smartphone to its original factory form. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  All gadgets are man-made.  It is possible that someday on any of their devices a malfunction may occur.  In such situations, Apple developers primarily recommend turning the smartphone or tablet off and on.  Also, in addition to rebooting, you must check whether there is enough charge for the device to work.  In other situations, when the iPhone stops responding to keystrokes, freezes or does not turn on, it is recommended to resort to a hard reset. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forced reboot" class="if uuid-2948439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77376/2948439.jpg"></div><p>  With the release of the iPhone iOS 11 operating system update, users now have the opportunity to turn off the device in the settings.  This is a great feature, because now anyone can restart their iPhone even when the buttons do not work.  Most people simply set a shortcut on the device screen for these purposes. </p><p>  With each significant new iPhone integration, device reboot methods have also changed.  In iPhone 5, you just needed to hold the lock button and the Home button.  For iPhone 6 or 7, you must simultaneously press the volume down and lock buttons until a black screen and the Apple symbol appear.  In newer versions of smartphones, the sequence and key combinations have changed.  After reviewing the above information, now you know how to restart iPhone 6 or 7, as well as newer (or already outdated) Apple phone models. </p>
