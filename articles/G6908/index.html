    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first settlements on the site of the city arose in the 1st century BC.  However, in those days, the region had an exclusively agricultural direction and supplied the Roman Empire with olive oil, wheat and grapes.  Until 1925, Calella was considered a fishing village, and only later acquired the status of a city.  Tourism development here took place in the second half of the twentieth century.  Currently, the city has become a modern and very popular resort, attracting tourists from all over the country. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  Aeroflot Airlines regularly flies direct to Barcelona from Moscow.  And during the high season, additional charter flights are introduced.  You can get from Barcelona to Calella on a comfortable modern train.  The train station is near the Calella Park Hotel.  A round-trip ticket from Calella to Barcelona will cost an adult passenger 6-8 EUR and 4-6 EUR for children.  By the way, the railway tracks on the resort's coast are completely invisible and train sounds are not heard, and therefore do not interfere with vacationers in hotels.  The fact is that they are in a tunnel inside the rock. </p><p>  Active tourists who wish to travel around the country and see the sights should rent a car.  To do this, it is enough to have a passport, international license and driving experience of more than one year.  Rental prices are very different.  But on average, it is about thirty dollars a day. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  The resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain is influenced by the Mediterranean subtropical climate with sunny hot summers and fairly mild winters.  In summer, the average temperature ranges from + 28 degrees, and in winter does not drop below +15 degrees.  The tourist season lasts from the beginning of April to the end of October. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The resort gained popularity due to its sandy beaches, which are limited on the promenade by a shady walkway.  The pedestrian zone stretches along the entire city for more than three kilometers and gradually turns into a beautiful rocky coast.  Local landscapes, consisting of secluded bays and cliffs, resemble the Costa Brava.  Calella Park Hotel is located next to one of the city's municipal beaches.  The entire coast of the resort has a coating of golden sand and clear sea water, as a result of which each year it receives such a badge of honor as the Blue Flag for its environmental condition and cleanliness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calella beach" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1555830.jpg" width="514"></div>

    <p>  It should be understood that the coast is far from one beach.  The central part, for example, is always crowded with tourists and very noisy.  For proponents of a more relaxing holiday, the area around Sant Polu will be to their heart.  The local beach is not crowded, but at the same time very comfortable. </p><p>  The most remote stretch of coast - Roca Grossa - is a favorite place for divers.  The colorful underwater world and beautiful corals in clear clear water make trips on glass-bottom boats with speedboats very popular. </p><p>  Calella Park (Spain) does not have its own beach, like all other hotels in Europe.  On any coast, there are only municipal beaches.  Therefore, tourists can visit absolutely any part of the coast, even near the most expensive hotels.  Sun loungers and umbrellas during the high season, usually cost 4-6 EUR. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  Calella is an unusual resort, here modern hotels are adjacent to the historic neighborhoods, which belly are a simple life.  Local excursions include a visit to the Iglesias de Santa Maria church, built in the neoclassical style in the 16-18 centuries, as well as visiting palaces of different eras and the Dalmau Municipal Park, which is a beautiful array of tropical plants.  A rare plant grows in it - purple acacia, which is a symbol of the city. </p><p>  Callella has many hiking trails.  They cover the entire historical central part of the town.  All tourists just love to walk along the shady alley (along the promenade) Passy Maritim.  In the shade of palm trees and plane trees vacationers expect numerous entertainments.  And in the late evening clubs and discos begin to work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calella park costa brava" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1555882.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The city is also known as a major cultural center due to numerous sports, folklore and cultural events.  Their theme is designed for absolutely any age, so Calella is a great place for families. </p><p>  Each vacationer will be able to find an interesting activity for himself: visiting a cabaret, excursions to medieval castles, water parks, trips to thermal springs and the Spanish Disneyland. </p><h2>  Calella Park (Spain): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  If you plan to spend your vacation in Spain, then you should pay attention to a resort such as Calella.  Calella Park can be a good place for a budget holiday for those tourists who do not consider it necessary to overpay for any additional amenities.  Three-star hotel, according to vacationers, has a significant plus - this is its location.  The complex is located near the promenade.  The adjacent (parallel) street is central.  There are numerous cafes and restaurants, a supermarket and entertainment venues.  An important factor is the proximity of the railway station.  The transport connection between the cities is well established, and therefore by train you can independently get to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãGirona and other cities, which have many attractions.  Near the hotel there is a grocery market.  Very close to the park, which has many beautiful places for picnics. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has fairly spacious rooms.  There is no particular choice, absolutely all apartments belong to the standard category.  Inside the rooms have the usual design, it is clear that they are not new, but are kept clean and tidy.  The rooms have bedside tables, a double bed, a wardrobe.  The balcony is equipped with plastic furniture.  In the bathroom, all plumbing works properly, no special problems arise during operation. </p><p>  The rooms include daily cleaning, which is carried out efficiently and according to the schedule.  Towels are also not a problem.  Bed linen is changed once a week.  There is a minimal set of detergents.  Every day, maids leave bottled water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calella park hotel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1555813.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the rooms are in very good condition.  The only drawback is the lack of air conditioning.  At the reception you can rent only a fan.  However, according to most tourists, this is not necessary.  At night it is quite possible to sleep with open balcony doors; the street is cool.  Extraneous noises are sometimes possible, but they don‚Äôt interfere so much.  In principle, the complex is located in a fairly quiet place and there are no loud nightclubs nearby. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Nutrition is always one of the most controversial issues.  As a rule, opinions of people very often differ.  As for the Calella Park Hotel, the situation here is a bit different.  The price includes breakfast.  According to vacationers, food in the morning is incredibly meager and monotonous.  Every day there is the same assortment of dishes: scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, toasts, jams, cheese, sausages and incredibly small servings of tea. </p><p>  Some guests get half board, and therefore, in addition to breakfast, they are also entitled to dinner.  In the evening there is a greater variety, but it is better to come to the restaurant strictly on time, since later you can not catch the tastiest.  For dinner, usually served pasta, french fries, boiled beans, salads, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, olives, cheese.  From sweets guests are invited to jelly, pies, pastries.  But in the evenings, guests sort the fruit with incredible speed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel calella park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1555808.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, vacationers recommend coming to dinner on time so as not to crowd in lines and catch good dishes.  The food organized is not very convenient, and the waiters work extremely slowly.  Near the hotel there is a sufficient number of cafes and restaurants that can have those who are not satisfied with the food at the hotel or want to try a more varied local food and seafood. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  Only Russian tourists relax at the hotel.  Moreover, almost all the staff understands Russian, so you can always explain.  All employees of the complex (maids and at the reception) are very welcoming.  They are always happy to see guests and try to help in everything.  Internet in the hotel works in all public places, including around the pool.  Even some rooms also have Wi-Fi of good quality. </p><p>  The beach is a five minute walk from the hotel.  On the way, you can look into souvenir shops, cafes and shops.  The entire <span>coast of Spain</span> is municipal.  Which beach to choose is up to vacationers to decide.  You can visit several of them and then make a choice.  All coastal areas are clean and well maintained, they are equipped with showers, bars and sunbeds, but the number of vacationers on them is different.  The cost of sun loungers and umbrellas on them is almost the same - 3 EUR per day.  If you go to a cafe and order a beer or a cocktail, then you can use the lounge chairs for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="free wifi access" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1555890.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Experienced tourists will certainly recommend to visit Barcelona on their own and see all its wonderful sights.  Generally speaking, the district has enough interesting places worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Calella Park is a budget hotel for an economical vacation.  It is suitable for picky tourists who are not spoiled by All Inclusive in Turkish performance.  The complex offers spacious rooms and a convenient location relative to the sea coast and transport interchange.  And what else is needed for a good vacation, especially if there are certain financial restrictions or there is no desire to overpay for additional benefits. </p>
