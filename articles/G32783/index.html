The Kemerovo region is rich in water bodies, but it is recommended that both locals and visitors go to this lake to relax.  Previously, clay was mined here, so a quarry turned out, which eventually flooded with water.  The uniqueness of the lake is in its shores.  Their component is colored clay, which has healing properties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="April Kemerovo region" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151429.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical location and natural differences </h2><p>  The affectionate lake Aprelka is located in the village of the same name, which is part of the Ur settlement of the Guryevsky district of the Kemerovo region.  This is an artificial pond.  It was formed due to underground sources and rainfall at the site of an abandoned clay mining. </p><p>  The pond is small, only 470 meters long and 220 wide, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout one kilometer square.  Lake Aprelyka in the Kemerovo region has a stretched oval shape and is located from the southeast to northwest. </p><p>  The depth of the reservoir is not exactly known, since hydrologists (scientists involved in the study of water resources) did not systematize and did not study it.  According to local residents, there is almost an abyss - from 70 to 100 meters.  Given the location, this could very well be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bottom of the reservoir is clayey with a small admixture of sand, uneven, with sharp drops.  The shores from almost all sides of the lake are steep, covered with trees and shrubs to the very edge of the water, and in the rain it is also very slippery.  During spring and autumn floods, the coastal forest belt is partially flooded. </p><p>  Aprelka Lake (Kemerovo Region) is very clear, the water is clear, without algae, amazing sky-blue or even turquoise color.  The coloration persists in cloudy and sunny weather. </p><h2>  The world </h2><p>  Lakeside territory is buried in the greenery of birches, bird cherry trees, willows, Christmas trees, pines and is famous for its rich harvest of mushrooms.  In the depths of Aprelka live crucians and perches. </p><h2>  Some facts </h2><p>  The name <span>Aprelka Lake</span> (Kemerovo Region) owes its location on the outskirts of a small settlement of the same name.  Local old-timers say that earlier gold was excavated at the site of the reservoir, the low content of which makes the water healing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="April lake in the Kemerovo region" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151427.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hiking trails </h2><p>  The terrain of Aprilki is truly amazing!  But tourists from all over the world come here not only to admire nature.  The main value of the lake is clay, used for various "medical" purposes.  <span>Red clay</span> improves blood circulation and improves immunity, blue - rejuvenates, softens and whitens the skin, yellow - anesthetizes, white - strengthens hair and eliminates acne, green - invigorates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Half of the travelers arrive at Lake Aprelyka (Kemerovo region) for several hours, the rest set up tents and stayed for a couple of days to go fishing a bit, buy their fill in healing waters and improve their health. </p><p>  Fishing here does not pamper with a rich catch, but if it is not the main goal, then it is quite possible to sit with fishing rods on the shore. </p><p>  There are few places where you can put up a tent because of the steep slopes, and a lot of people who want to.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to correctly calculate the travel time in order to arrive here early. <br>  There are no beaches as such on April, decent approaches to water are only two or three, but this does not bother those seeking to plunge into the blue waters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="April Kemerovo region how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1151428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aprelka Lake (Kemerovo Region) - how to get there? </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to the lake is by direct bus from the district center of Guryevo.  Transport runs 3 times a day every other day.  Schedule can be clarified by phone. </p><p>  The second way is a car with a navigator.  It is only necessary to enter the coordinates - N 54 ¬∞ 31,339 ';  E85 ¬∞ 20.261 ', and a modern gadget will offer the most convenient option. </p><p>  If GPS help is not available, then the road signs along the R-384 highway will become a guideline: Kemerovo - Leninsk-Kuznetsk - Chkalovsky - Krasnoye (here we are leaving the highway!) - Kokuy - Khrestinovsky - April. </p><p>  If you need to lose a couple of kilograms or years, to heal your back and shaky nervous system, or just admire the beauty of the Kuzbass Territory, then Lake Aprelyka is ready to accept all those in need and give healing and peace! </p>
