    <h2>  What does the mail notification testify to? </h2><p>  Notification is sent to the recipient by the postal service in order to inform him that the parcel is waiting for him in the corresponding department.  The formation of such a notice is made the maximum the next day by the employees of the company after the corresponding shipment has appeared on the shelves of the post office.  On the front side of the form are recorded the recipient's data and information about the parcel itself (value declared by the sender and other parameters of the dispatch, for example, delivery cost).  What to do with the information form? </p><h2>  Recipient's actions after receiving a notification </h2><p>  After a person receives a notice of parcel, he needs to perform the following steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Make sure that the notice is really intended for him - on the front side of the form there is information about the recipient (name and address). </li><li>  Fill in the form - the fields for the recipient are located on the back of the sheet;  You can perform this simple task at home, or, directly, in the post office where you should receive a shipment (how to fill out a notice of the Russian post will be described later). </li><li>  Go to the post office - the address and the period of work are indicated on the form itself, taking with you a passport (of the person whose name the parcel arrived in) and the form. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to fill out a mail notification? </h2><p>  The process of entering the recipient's data into the unified notification form (form No. 22) about the shipment is quite simple, however, it causes a number of difficulties.  Therefore, it is necessary to talk in more detail about how to fill out a mail notice in such a way that there are no complaints from postal service employees. </p><ul><li>  Only those fields are located that are located under the sentence ‚ÄúFilled by the recipient‚Äù.  This block with fields for filling is located at the very top of the back of the notification. </li><li>  It is mandatory that only two lines are filled in, the rest is recorded only in some cases.  We are talking about the information specified in the recipient's identity card - the first two lines must be filled with data in any case: the name of the document, its unique identifiers (series, number, date of issue), as well as the name of the agency that issued the passport (for departments should be indicated, although this is not indicated on the form). </li><li>  The ‚Äúregistered‚Äù field is filled in with data only if it is a money transfer or sending a notification about the need to receive a parcel at the place of work or study. </li><li>  Also at the bottom of the form should indicate the date when the parcel was accepted.  This field does not need to be filled in advance - if the mail officer notices that the date is not relevant, questions may arise with the delivery of the parcel.  Therefore, it is better to put down a date before going to the post office if you are really sure that you will get there, or directly at the office.  Signature of receipt should be put together with the date. </li><li>  Fill in the blank with blue ink, by hand.  Letters should be as legible as possible.  Otherwise, difficulties may arise. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mail notification number" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/1648631.jpg" width="432"></div></h2><h2>  Is it obligatory to receive a parcel? </h2><p>  To receive a shipment or not is decided by the person to whom it is intended.  After receiving the mail notification, you can simply ignore it.  At the same time, you should not be scared when a few days later a new form with the name ‚ÄúSecondary Notification‚Äù appears in the mailbox.  It is identical in content: it contains the name ‚ÄúPostal Notification‚Äù, number, information about the recipient, etc. If the second attempt to deliver the box intended for him to the recipient is unsuccessful, then the postal service initiates the return sending of the parcel to its sender for its own money.  That, in turn, can also refuse the returned box.  Then the fate of the parcel is decided - it will be sent to a special repository. </p>

    <p>  In addition, if the person whose name is written in the notice of departure is not going to receive it and the question of how to fill out a mail notification does not concern him, then you can also contact the office where this box is located and officially refuse to receive it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we examined a very popular question about how to fill out a notice of the Russian post.  Every day, many people in our country have to deal with it.  In order to freely receive the long-awaited parcel in the mail, it is enough to follow the simple recommendations listed in the current article. </p>
