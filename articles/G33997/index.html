And this is not surprising, because in the resort area there is everything that a vacationer‚Äôs soul can wish for: clubs with relevant music, karaoke, cafes, many restaurants and much more.  As for history, Budva was founded more than 2500 years ago.  Based on this, it can be argued that this resort place is the oldest of those located on the Adriatic coast.  Historical evidence suggests that, at different intervals, this territory was subordinate to the Romans, Greeks, Slavs, Venetians and Turks. </p><h2>  Historical sights </h2>
