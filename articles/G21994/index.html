Now it seems that they have existed for a very long time.  But, strangely enough, the restaurant business originates only in the 18th century, and it is only about 250 years old.  What was the starting point for its development?  The history of restaurants is very saturated, despite such a short time. </p><h2>  Development background </h2><p>  People have always loved to eat well and tasty, but not everyone shows culinary talents, and it takes a lot of time to prepare culinary delights.  In the old days, there were establishments where you could have a bite to eat and drink.  Although it was impossible to call them restaurants.  Basically it was taverns where simple food was served, and the interior left much to be desired. </p>

This is not to say that the food was tasteless, but the contingent that visited them was very interesting.

    <p>  The history of the restaurant begins in 1765.  It was at this time that the first institution was opened, which became the prototype of the restaurant.  The initiator of this was the Frenchman Boulanger.  The first restaurant appeared in Paris.  It could not be otherwise.  The inhabitants of this country have always had a passion for everything exquisite.  But not immediately, he began to be popular. </p><p>  The history of restaurants has only been developed, and this institution has yet to go a difficult path to excellence.  The purpose of the creation was to do something more sophisticated than a tavern.  What was the <span>restaurant menu?</span>  History shows that the list of dishes was poor.  Basically it was food from various types of meat and poultry.  The menu also included a rich broth. </p><h2>  Restaurant Development </h2><p>  Over time, new similar institutions began to appear.  Every day the interior and menu of the restaurants changed.  Here, competition has contributed.  The history of restaurants has continued, and this business has been put on stream.  They began to pay special attention to the appearance of institutions.  They began to be furnished with luxurious furniture and decorated with crystal chandeliers.  The restaurant menu has also changed.  Hundreds of dishes appeared in it that met the tastes of the most demanding aristocrats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Particular attention was paid to the wine cellars.  In the most luxurious establishments, magnificent stocks were collected, which impressed with their assortment.  In 1786, the French government officially extended the restaurants to 23 hours.

    <h2>  Restaurant business strides around the world </h2><p>  Gradually restaurateurs realized the full benefit of such establishments.  Basically, they were created with the focus on noble people, travelers and visitors.  But the history of restaurants has begun a new chapter.  The experience of the French was adopted by many Europeans.  In each country, establishments acquired their own unique flavor and offered a cuisine traditional for the area. </p>

    <p>  Comfort and coziness have become an integral part of the restaurant.  The assortment of dishes and the choice made restaurants very popular.  The oldest restaurants, the Grand Tavern de Londre in France and the Sobrino de Botin in Spain, became the founders of this business.  The history of the development of restaurants contains many interesting facts. </p><h2>  Restaurants in Russia </h2><p>  In our country, everything happened a little differently.  The history of restaurants in Russia dates back to the 19th century.  At that time, taverns, taverns and taverns existed in the country.  The level of these institutions left much to be desired.  These were simple drinking eateries in which you could eat simple food in a very diverse society.  Despite the fact that in <span>Europe the restaurant</span> business has already reached a high level, in Russia this business has not yet been developed. </p>

These were the tsarist taverns, and they brought good profit.  Then these institutions became known as drinking houses.  It happened in the 19th century.  The right to organize them appeared not only among the state, but also among private individuals.  Naturally, a good snack should be served with any alcoholic beverage.  Therefore, in drinking houses began to cook various dishes.  Basically, these were pies and several hot culinary creations, not particularly sophisticated.  Then the drinking houses were replaced by taverns.  The purpose of creating these institutions was the sale of food and drink, which were traditional for Russian cuisine.  At the end of the 19th century, many coffee houses, taverns and tea houses appeared, but their class remained at a not very high level.  The concept of a restaurant was still very far away.

    <h2>  The first restaurant in Moscow </h2><p>  The first institution of the elite class can be considered the restaurant "Slavic Bazaar", opened at the end of the 19th century.

The kitchen seemed even more surprising for those times.  It was no longer a few simple dishes. </p>
