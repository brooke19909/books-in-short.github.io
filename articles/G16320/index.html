Therefore, this product is so popular.  But in order for it to fully fulfill the functions assigned to it, it is required to take the choice of device very seriously. </p><p>  It is considered that among all the characteristics that an LED strip has, power is one of the primary indicators.  It and a number of other features determine the scope of the lighting device.  Therefore, when choosing the presented products, you need to know what parameters you need to pay attention to first. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The LED tape, the power of which must be selected very carefully, has a special design.  This is a flexible board on which the necessary contacts are printed.  On this basis, diodes are evenly distributed.  They are the light source of this product. </p><p>  The thickness of this tape does not exceed 2-3 mm.  Its width is 8 or 10 mm.  To limit the current passing through the diodes, resistors are mounted on the tape.  The popularity of this illuminator is due to its durability and cost-effectiveness.  On average, the presented devices work from 50 to 100 thousand hours.  At the same time, they consume a minimum amount of energy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED power strip" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464705.jpg" width="600"></div>

Indoors, the tape is also involved in creating a wide variety of interior design effects.  The range of application of these products is very large. </p><h2>  Types of Diodes </h2><p>  First of all, it should be said that today there are two types of tapes.  They are labeled as RGB and SMD devices.  The first variety provides its owner with the opportunity to create a variety of shades of illumination.  Each individual element consists of 3 diodes.  From here comes the name of the device.  Diodes glow in red, green and blue (Red, Green, Blue - RGB). </p><p>  For such a tape, you need to purchase a special control panel called a controller.  <span>The power consumption of the</span> LED strip affects the choice of this control unit.  He will control not only the color emitted by the device, but also its brightness, intensity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED strip power" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464706.jpg" width="465"></div>

    <p>  The second type of tape is the SMD device - Surface Mounted Device, which means ‚Äúsurface mounted device‚Äù.  The diodes of this product are solid.  They are white, blue, green, red or yellow.  This is a cheaper device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LED size </h2><p>  The power of an <span>LED strip</span> directly depends on the size and quantity of its individual elements.  They allow you to create the desired glow intensity.  First of all, it is necessary to consider the size of the diodes.  Product marking allows you to understand what type of illuminator is on sale. </p><p>  This designation first indicates the type of product (RGB or SMD).  Further marking contains 4 digits.  This is the size of the diodes.  If, for example, it is written in the marking SMD3528, this means that its lighting elements have a length and width of 3.5 x 2.8 mm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED strip power per meter" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Larger diodes exist - 5050 or 5630. The brightness of the SMD3528 is 5 lumens.  This is a certain measure of the glow of the ribbon.  The power of <span>LED strip 5050</span> and 5630 will be more.  The luminous flux emitted by these diodes, respectively, will be equal to 15 and 18 lumens.  Thanks to these qualities, an LED strip can replace a conventional energy-saving light bulb in terms of brightness. </p><h2>  The number of diodes on the tape </h2><p>  Another important factor determining the power of an LED strip per meter is the number of diodes.  Their frequency differs in different devices.  Products with a quantity of elements per 1 m equal to 60 pieces are standardly produced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation of the power of LED strip" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464704.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To increase the brightness and power of the tape, the number of diodes is increased.  For SMD3528 tape, it is possible to increase the concentration of lighting elements to 120 and even 240 pcs.  by 1 m. But such a large number of diodes is unacceptable for tapes with large diodes.  Therefore, for SMD5050 and SMD5630, the concentration of these elements is 30, 60 or 120 pcs.  on 1 m </p><p>  It should also be noted that the brightness of the glow sometimes depends not on the concentration or size of the diodes, but on the type of radiation or light temperature.  It ranges from 3000 K to 7000 K. The most striking are the ribbons, whose glow range is in the range of 5500-7000 K. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  The calculation of the power of the LED strip is based on the size and number of its elements per linear meter.  This indicator is measured in watts.  The SMD3528 tape is characterized by a luminous power for 60 diodes - 4.8 W, 120 diodes - 9.6 W, and for 240 diodes - 16.8 W.  All manufacturers of the presented products adhere to these characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to calculate the power of LED strip" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464703.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <p>  Most often, SMD5050 tapes are on sale.  For them, a certain power per linear meter is also installed.  If the tape contains 30 diodes, this figure is 7.2 watts.  60 diodes give the product a power of 14.4 watts, and 120 diodes - 28.8 watts. </p><p>  These characteristics must be taken into account when choosing.  The type of power supply depends on this.  If this option is selected incorrectly, the device will not work for a long time.  His power supply will overheat, or the tape will not work at all.  Therefore, the <span>calculation of power</span> is required. </p><h2>  Power calculation </h2><p>  In order to choose the right power supply and make a high-quality connection, you need to learn how to calculate the power of an LED strip.  This is a simple technology.  First, it is determined how much power the presented equipment will have by 1 m. This technology was given above. </p><p>  Then the found value is multiplied by the number of meters of tape.  For example, there is a device whose length is 5 m. Its power per linear meter is 4.6 watts.  It follows that the power of the entire tape is calculated as follows: </p><ul><li>  5 mx 4.6 W / m = 23 W. </li></ul><p>  For the adapter to work correctly, it needs to provide some power reserve.  If the tape is characterized by an indicator of 23 watts, then the control unit requires a little more power.  A device rated at 28 watts is suitable.  The power reserve is 20%. </p><h2>  Adapter selection </h2><p>  The power of the LED strip helps you choose the right control unit.  The diode devices on sale today are powered by direct current.  At the same time, they need to provide a voltage of 12 or 24 V. For sale, there are still tapes that work with the presented indicator of 36 V, but they are very rare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Strip Power Consumption" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464702.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Finding the right adapter is easy.  First you need to study the marking of the lighting device.  It must indicate voltage.  Most often, 12 V tapes are presented to the consumer. The power supply must necessarily correspond to this indicator. </p><p>  Do not select adapters with a large margin of power.  The higher this characteristic, the more the device costs.  Experts say that a 20% power margin will be enough.  This will allow the tape to work correctly. </p><h2>  Protection class </h2><p>  The power of the LED strip per meter is an important characteristic for the presented product.  But this is not the only parameter that they rely on when choosing.  Depending on the application, there are different classes of tape protection. </p><p>  For dry rooms with normal environmental conditions, the absence of significant dust, open varieties of devices are used.  Their marking contains an indicator of IP20. </p><p>  If the room is quite humid, epoxy protected devices can be used.  This material protects the surface of the tape, but not the LEDs.  Therefore, for outdoor installation, this option is not suitable.  The protection class of such a tape is marked IP65. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Strip Power 5050" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1464707.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For street installation, monolithic silicone tapes are used.  It protects all structural elements from negative environmental influences.  Their protection class is IP68. </p><h2>  Expert Advice </h2><p>  The LED tape, the power of which is selected in accordance with all the rules, will work for a long time.  But this is true only in the case of the acquisition of products of well-known and trusted brands.  Experts advise against buying cheap and low-quality tapes. </p><p>  Long-lasting products cannot have uneven tape edges or crookedly glued LEDs.  Therefore, before making a purchase, you must inspect the lighting device.  From inexpensive, but high-quality brands, experts distinguish Feron, Maxus.  According to reviews by ordinary users, such LED strips will last at least 5 years. </p><p>  A special approach when choosing requires an LED strip.  The power and special characteristics of this device allow you to purchase and properly connect the most suitable variety of products. </p>
