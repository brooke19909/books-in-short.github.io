Skyscrapers of Yekaterinburg</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  High-rises in Yekaterinburg are a priority area of ​​modern construction.  Vysotsky, Yekaterinburg City - these buildings are known not only in the Ural capital, but also far beyond its borders.  No less interesting is the history of high-rise construction in this city. </p><h2>  What is a skyscraper </h2><p>  Skyscraper (eng. <em>Skyscraper</em> - "scratch the sky") is a high-rise building designed both for people to live, and for working in organizations inside it.  But the question of which building has the right to be called a skyscraper is rather controversial.  Some people think that these are buildings that affect clouds, however, depending on the terrain, the lower cloud masses can swim at absolutely different heights.  Somewhere they think that this building is higher than 100, 120, 150, 200 m. If the skyscraper is more than 300 m in height, it is already called ultra-high, and if it has reached 600 m, then it is super-high.  The tallest building in the UAE is the Burj Khalifa, whose height is 829.8 m! </p>

    <p>  Thus, in Russia and the world, if we take into account the average values, a building above 150 m will be called a skyscraper. From 35 to 150 m, these are skyscrapers, <span>high-rise buildings.</span>  The height of the skyscraper is considered in two categories - the location of the roof of the last floor and the highest point (spire, turret, etc.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the skyscrapers of Yekaterinburg, photos of which you will see here, their construction for today is due to the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  the high cost of land within the city; </li><li>  image of the Ural capital - for taking international events, the city needs to gain the appearance of a world-class business center; </li><li>  the presence of developers capable of erecting reliable high-rise buildings. </li></ul><p>  And now we’ll smoothly move on to retrospective - the history of high-rise construction in Yekaterinburg-Sverdlovsk. </p><h2>  XVIII century  - 1920s: the tallest buildings in the city </h2><p>  Before the revolution, Yekaterinburg was a completely "stunted" city - it was mainly characterized by houses on 1-2 floors, even three-story buildings were rare - they amounted to only 0.91% of the total.  The five-story mill Borchaninova-Pervushina (1906-1908) was considered the largest civilian building in all these years. </p>

    <p>  As in many other cities, religious buildings were a kind of “skyscraper” in Yekaterinburg at that time.  Prior to 1774 the championship was occupied by Catherine’s Cathedral (58 m), until 1886 the Epiphany Cathedral (66.2 m) was the highest, and until 1930 the <span>Great Chrysostom Cathedral</span> (77.2 m). </p><h2>  1930-1960: the beginning of high-rise construction in Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  In the 1920s  The direction was taken to build taller houses in the Ural capital.  The first such buildings were communal houses, the Central Hotel, the building of the Sverdlovsk Railway Administration.  The high-rise pioneer of the city was the 11-story residential building of the House of Soviets (1930-1932).  This building in a constructivist spirit was erected on the street.  March 8, 2. In 1933, a 10-storey building of the former Sport hostel was also built on the territory of the Chekist town (today it is the Iset Hotel). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Few people know, but in 1931 it was in Sverdlovsk that the construction of a 150-meter skyscraper as part of the House of Industry complex began.  But an accident prevented a grandiose undertaking - the first five floors at the construction stage were destroyed by fire in 1935. The construction was suspended, and after that it was completely canceled. </p><p>  From 1940 to 1960, the Rubin combine building was built, the building of the Sverdlovsk City Council of People’s Deputies, and the standard construction of 6- and later 9-story buildings began. </p><h2>  1970-2010s: the era of skyscrapers and skyscrapers </h2><p>  In the seventies in Sverdlovsk, by that time the millionaire city, the construction of real high-rises - 12-16-storey buildings began.  The first two sixteen-story buildings (1976-1977) appeared at the address: st.  Clear, 28 and 30. </p><p>  In 1975, construction began at the then standards of the skyscraper of Yekaterinburg-Sverdlovsk - the 23-story House of Soviets, or the White House (89-meter building).  The tallest building in the city, he was two decades.  In the two thousandth, Antey, the 26-storey LCD Rainbow, Catherine’s Ring, and Aquamarine, breaks his record. </p>

    <p>  In the mid-2000s, construction began on three high-rise projects at once - the Vysotsky skyscraper, Prisms, and the February Revolution residential complex.  In addition, a 20-25-year plan for the city’s skyscraper development is being developed.  It includes the skyscrapers "Tatishchev", "Iset" "De Gennin", "Ural", combined into the business complex "Yekaterinburg City", 33-storey "Demidov Plaza" and a number of other high-rise buildings.  However, the financial crisis prevented the implementation of such a grandiose project - the construction was frozen until 2010, then the construction of Iseti was resumed.  But high-rise residential construction was not affected by difficult times - in 2012, the construction of the Olympiysky residential complex (38-storey buildings) and the Opera complex (42-storey building) began. </p><p>  It is estimated that in January 2016, 1,066 skyscrapers were erected in the city of Yekaterinburg (houses above 35 m).  This allows the Ural capital to occupy 86th place in the ranking of high-altitude cities of the globe. </p><h2>  New skyscrapers in Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  What are the skyscrapers in the Ural capital?

    <p>  The Vysotsky skyscraper in Yekaterinburg (address: 51 Malysheva St., at the intersection of Malyshev and Krasnoarmeyskaya Streets) was officially opened on November 25, 2011 - especially for the premiere of the film "Vysotsky. Thank you for being alive."  The family of the legendary artist and poet officially allowed the building to bear the name of their great ancestor.  Today anyone can visit the museum of Vladimir Vysotsky on the second floor of the complex.  Only here you can see the manuscript of his latest poem, personal belongings of the Vysotsky-Vladi family, the personal car of the poet Mercedes 350 W 116, as well as his wax figure. </p><p>  One of the attractions of the city is an open observation deck on the "Vysotsky", opened in 2012. </p><h2>  Yekaterinburg City: Reality and Projects </h2><p>  Today, the highest skyscraper in Yekaterinburg is Iset.  You can see the photo of this building below.  Iset is part of the yet not fully implemented Yekaterinburg City project.  In addition to the skyscraper, the Hyatt Regency hotel complex and the Demidov business house were built within its framework.  By 2022, it is planned to complete the construction of the Ekaterina tower, the expected height of which is 300 m. The construction of the business park, De Gennina, Tatishcheva, and Ekaterina Boulevard was postponed indefinitely. </p>
