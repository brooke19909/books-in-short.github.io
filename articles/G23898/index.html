Apple shares: statistics, how to purchase</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Financiers argue that if people instead of buying iPhones or iPods invested in Apple shares, they would soon have several thousand dollars in their account.  Apple's stock price continues to rise, so if you want to buy the company's securities, in this article you will find detailed information on how to easily do this. </p><h2>  Apple story </h2><p>  Apple is one of the most expensive today.  It has a tremendous impact on the development of society along with such giants as Microsoft, Coca-Cola, IBM. </p><p>  It was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Robert Wayne.  At first, none of them was sure about the future of the company.  But over time, the position strengthened and grew, in 1977 the first computer was released. </p><p>  Apple has become an innovator in many areas.  When the first iPhone went on sale at the beginning of the 21st century, Steve Jobs called it the exclusive work of the apple company. </p><p>  The main breakthrough was in 1996.  If before that Apple tried itself in different directions, then after the restructuring, it decided to focus on the manufacture of portable and stationary computers iMac and iBook. </p><p>  More than 300 employees were laid off during the same period.  Thanks to the decisive actions of the management, the company has become what it is now known.  And in 2007, the first iPhone was released, which had the effect of an exploding bomb. </p><p>  Due to its popularity and growing sales, Apple stocks are now in high demand. </p><h2>  The most expensive company </h2><p>  Apple‚Äôs profit is billions of dollars.  The main source of income is the sale of content and the sale of computers and gadgets.  The value of shares is growing every year.  Back in 1997, the company's shares were sold at three dollars.  For 9 years, their cost has increased to 600 dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 2012, stock prices have fallen slightly, but still deserve attention.  Not many companies could boast the same profitability as Apple. </p><p>  How much are stocks now?  The bidding range is 160-230 dollars for one security (from 10 500 rubles).  At the moment, shares can be bought both independently and with the help of special companies.  Over the past few years, the number of shares issued has exceeded one billion. </p><h2>  Time to invest? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gizmodo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple stock performance" class="if uuid-2991116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991116.jpg"></div><p>  Apple has been a leader in electronic devices for 35 years.  Her profit is growing steadily.  How can I make money with the help of a company? </p><ul><li>  On receipt of dividends. </li><li>  Investing. </li><li>  Trading </li></ul><p>  Investing involves the acquisition of securities, which after some time can be sold at a better price.  The times when it was enough just to deposit money into the account were long gone.  It is with the help of shares that you can earn a substantial amount, but it is also easy to go bankrupt. </p><p>  The dynamics of Apple shares indicates a slight decline, but in general, shares continue to be profitable to their owners.  Is it worth it to <span>invest in an</span> ordinary person who is far from understanding the basic principles of the functioning of the stock market?  Definitely worth it.  Although 2018 was not as rosy for high-tech companies as 2017, Apple stocks have not lost their appeal.  After the presentation of the latest iPhone models, stocks fell 1.24 percent.  Despite this, experts believe that Apple is a great long-term investment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How it works </h2><p>  Many influential businessmen began with small investments at one time.  After all, they can be much more profitable than deposits in banks, which bring only a small percentage.  But what if you are not familiar with this method of investing? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.notebookcheck.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stocks apple yield" class="if uuid-2993479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2993479.jpg"></div><ol><li>  To get started, learn the basics.  You do not have to have an economic education.  It is enough to constantly analyze the market and understand the language of brokers. </li><li>  Set a goal.  Return on investment may vary.  Shares of new or unreliable companies can bring up to 20% per year or more.  But with the same success, you can lose everything.  Therefore, most newcomers choose even a small but stable income. </li><li>  Find a broker.  A good financial professional can help you make money without losing yours. </li><li>  Select an area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity.  If you have just started investing, it is best to try different types of investments.  Buying stocks, currencies or deposits will help determine which area is best to work in. </li><li>  Review your portfolio.  In the field of investment, you must always be alert.  Do not forget to monitor the price level and study the stock market news.  Perhaps this will help you increase your fortune or save yourself from ruin. </li></ol><h2>  Apple subsidiaries </h2><p>  Not many people know that Apple has quite a few subsidiaries in different countries.  Among them, the following can be noted: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  FileMaker launches data analysis software. </li><li>  Beats Electronics produces headphones and speakers. </li><li>  AuthenTec is responsible for creating the new software. </li><li>  Prismo Graphics is known for developing software that recognizes gestures and facial expressions. </li></ul><p>  Thus, you can study the profitability not only of Apple, but also of subsidiaries specializing in software or in the manufacture of devices. </p><h2>  Stock dynamics </h2><p>  Apple stock statistics show stability.  In the US market, it is considered not the most profitable, but it also does not have significant drawdowns. </p><p>  Some external factors may slightly affect Apple stock quotes, such as the 2008 crisis.  But overall, the dynamics are positive.  The company attracts investors precisely because of its stability.  Despite the high cost of shares at the moment, in the next few decades, you can be sure that Apple quotes will remain at a high level regardless of a number of fluctuations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="independenciafinanciera.com.ar" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple stock forecast" class="if uuid-2991120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991120.jpg"></div><h2>  What affects stock growth </h2><p>  Apple stock forecast may be provided by a financial broker.  But if you want to learn how to understand investing yourself, then it is better to study which factors influence the growth or decrease of quotes. </p><ul><li>  Demand for products.  Every year, Apple presents the world a new model of smartphone.  New models of laptops, computers and gadgets come out a little less often.  After each presentation, stocks experience a rise or fall depending on how successful the new product has been. </li><li>  Market sentiment or a behavioral factor that is rather unpredictable.  The main role is played by the psychology of investors - their reaction, real indicators of income and losses. </li><li>  Data on financial statements. </li></ul><p>  By regularly monitoring the above data, you can not only get rid of the ‚Äúsagging‚Äù stocks in time, but also make money on their growth. </p><h2>  Stock price </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.industryleadersmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple stock forecast" class="if uuid-2991117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991117.jpg"></div><p>  To date, the shareholders of the company are more than 26 thousand people.  The largest organizations own portfolios, which include up to 6% of the value of the corporation. </p><p>  How much are Apple stocks worth?  At the moment, they can be purchased for 186 dollars.  The maximum cost in 2018 was $ 233.  It reached a minimum in March, then the price dropped to $ 153.  Since autumn, the value of securities continues to grow every day.  The company's upside potential is 14%, and annual revenue is 1.6%.  In the market you can find many much more attractive offers with a large income.  But investors like Apple's stability and continuous growth.  This is the best solution for long-term investments. </p><p>  How to determine when stock prices will rise or fall?  You need to pay attention to the dates of presentations of new products, reports of analysts and any changes occurring in the market or within the company itself.  The output of competitors, as a rule, always slightly reduces the value of shares.  Even if you have recently started investing, over time you will have a professional instinct and interest that will help you make money on the purchase and sale of securities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coolbusinessideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple stocks statistics" class="if uuid-2991121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991121.jpg"></div><h2>  Expert Advice </h2><p>  Many do not understand how and how much they need to buy securities, what to do if Apple shares have fallen in price.  When calculating medium-term stock holdings, the most promising strategy is to use the Buy &amp; Hold strategy.  That is, you can buy stocks and store them long enough in order to make a substantial profit. </p><p>  During medium-term storage, possible drop in quotes is smoothed out, which favorably affects the amount of your earnings.  If you have a significant amount of money and are ready to purchase a lot of shares, then it is best to follow the short term.  For a profitable sale, it is most reasonable to resort to a technical and fundamental analysis of the market, which will help to form a complete picture. </p><p>  If you decide to use a long-term or medium-term strategy, then always remember that today in many countries the government raises taxes and actively fights offshore organizations and legal entities.  And this can lead to a deterioration in financial performance and a decrease in the yield of Apple shares. </p><p>  Other information must be considered: </p><ul><li>  Patent litigation. </li><li>  Manufacturing disruptions that may occur in enterprises manufacturing Apple-branded products. </li><li>  The change in the dollar. </li><li>  Political tensions in those countries where the company's products are bought the most (demand is declining). </li><li>  The possibility of adopting new laws that can reduce the company's profits. </li></ul><h2>  Ways to buy company shares </h2><div class="photo" data-original="freightmoversschool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple stocks statistics" class="if uuid-2991118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991118.jpg"></div><p>  If you have calculated and considered everything, then you will probably be puzzled by the Apple stock purchase system.  How to buy shares to an individual who does not have any relations with brokers?  No wonder we live in the age of Internet technology.  Now you can buy anything with the help of a worldwide network, including promotions. </p><p>  There are a huge number of online stock stores.  You need to choose your company carefully: read customer reviews, study registration information, TIN and other available data.  You can make a purchase using a bank card or electronic wallet. </p><p>  Another way to purchase shares is to buy them directly through the stock market.  This is the most obvious and understandable way.  Apple shares are listed on all major exchanges.  You can contact AMEX, NYSE or LSE.  Recent amendments to the law allowed individuals to make financial transactions with foreign funds, so shares can be purchased without problems in just a couple of minutes. </p><p>  To purchase on some exchanges, you first need to conclude an agreement with a broker who acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the exchange.  Please note that not all of them are licensed for foreign trade. </p><p>  The last way is to buy them using binary options.  If the securities themselves can be quite expensive, you can buy binary options without even having a lot of capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picerne.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple shares fall" class="if uuid-2991119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2991119.jpg"></div><p>  What it is?  This is a contract with a specific exchange, which is used to generate income from asset value movements.  Some experts consider this not the most reliable method.  But then it allows you to start investing even with a small amount. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The issue of acquiring company shares and investing in general is no longer as surprising as it used to be.  Now the deal can be made in various ways, even using the phone. </p><p>  But no matter which option you choose, do not forget to follow the dynamics of Apple shares, as well as conduct market analysis before concluding an agreement. </p>
