  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Definition: what are firewood?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the onset of cold weather and snowfall, peasants in Russia used sledges to transport goods.  Their main purpose was to transport logs, brushwood and firewood for kindling stoves in huts.  Typically, villages were located near the main resource base for the procurement of fuel material.  Forests and woodlands served as sources of not only wood for heating, but also building materials for homes and vehicles. </p><p>  So, what are firewood, when and by whom were they used and what were they intended for?  As mentioned above - this is one of the main types of sleds, such an adaptation was in every peasant family.  A horse was harnessed in the sled and logs and firewood were transported for short distances. </p><h2>  Types of sledges in Russia </h2><p>  In winter, sledges were used as transport in villages and small towns.  Some of them were intended for transporting people and were used in cities and towns.  In the Russian village, sledges such as: </p><ul><li>  sledge; </li><li>  firewood; </li><li>  freight; </li><li>  skid; </li><li>  cue ball; </li><li>  visiting. </li></ul><p>  The first two species did not have wings and were intended for the transport of firewood.  The exit model was used to transport no more than three people.  All of them harnessed with one or two horses. </p><p>  Often sleds were used not only in everyday life, but also for riding on folk festivals.  They were decorated with ribbons, viburnum and other decorations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sleigh for transportation" class="if uuid-3015085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3015085.jpg"></div><h2>  What are firewood? </h2><p>  The main purpose of the sleigh-wood is transportation of firewood.  Other goods were also transported to them.  The peasants rode out to fairs on their sleighs, it is not so convenient to transport people to them, but since this was the main means of transportation for most families, they used it for different purposes. </p><p>  So what are firewoods?  In the photo presented in the article, you can see how this design was used.  This device was very convenient to use in the conditions of the Russian snowy winter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Definition of wood" class="if uuid-3015086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3015086.jpg"></div><h2>  The device is wood </h2><p>  The principle of the sleigh design is similar for all their types: </p><ul><li>  two runners; </li><li>  from five to eight lances on each runner; </li><li>  elm; </li><li>  splint. </li></ul><p>  Lances are about 20 cm long; they are driven into a recess in a high-head skid.  Elm is called transverse weaving with soft rods of hooves and runners.  A scaffold is a longitudinal fastening, a bar fastened to lances.  Thus, all the details of the wood were firmly connected to each other, and the sled did not fall apart when moving.  On top of the firewood there was a semblance of a charioteer, it was called a vaga - a thicket of wood.  Shafts for sleighs on one horse were fastened with wrappers, leather rings, to the heads of runners.  If necessary, sledges or pods were also fixed to the logs. </p>
