Without them, the modern owner of the vehicle loses a significant part of the functionality that facilitates the preparation of routes and further follow-up.  Gadgets designed for pedestrians are less popular, which, however, does not detract from their merits.  Anticipating the review of the Garmin eTrex 20 model, it is worth noting immediately that the device is average and does not have revolutionary capabilities.  Nevertheless, the quality factor and overall quality of the American navigator attract the attention of a considerable part of users of navigation and topographic equipment. </p><h2>  Technical specifications </h2>

    <p>  The eTrex 20 version replaced the popular in Russia eTrex 10 in an improved form.  Actually, the platform remained the same, but a number of fundamental improvements allowed the creators to select the gadget into an independent model.  Like its predecessor, the Garmin eTrex 20 successfully interacts with GPS and GLONASS systems. </p><p>  The TFT color screen, the resolution of which is 176 x 220 pixels, takes on the information.  By the way, detailed cartography and 65,000 colors provide a decent picture.  The built-in memory of 1.7 GB allows you to increase the efficiency of the device.  This volume is enough to download high-quality and detailed maps.  Moreover, part of the memory is already filled with useful topographic information especially for Russian tourists, hunters and fishermen.  The rest of the place can be allotted for recording routes, tracks, locations and intermediate points with the possibility of describing them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Functional Features </h2>

    <p>  Along with the options that came from the "dozens", the new modification also incorporates other features.  The basic functions include tracking the parameters of the moon and the sun, applications for anglers and hunters, a table of ebbs and flows, as well as a program for calculating the area. </p><p>  A new option includes <span>image viewing</span> and photo navigation - it is thanks to the color display that the Garmin eTrex 20 navigator has enhanced the usability of multimedia ‚Äúlotions‚Äù.  Along with these tourists are available features such as geocaching, a GPS receiver with the WAAS option, predicting the location of HotFix satellites and support for the GNSS system. </p><h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  In terms of ergonomics, the device is completely ground for efficient, comfortable and safe operation in any conditions.  The developers managed to minimize the number of manipulations with the control and increase the convenience in physical handling of the gadget. </p><p>  The case of the model is still supplemented with rubber inserts, large buttons and attachments.  At the same time, the dimensions of the device were reduced.  Minimization and emphasis on practicality led to the fact that the GPS-navigator Garmin eTrex 20 lost excessively protruding keys, which were replaced by smooth, but tangible analogues. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The configuration of the screen interface is easily adjusted for you.  The main controls, including satellite, map, compass, etc., can be arranged on pages according to individual preference.  All manipulations are performed by the joystick according to the type of banding, that is, menu control does not imply a tedious return to the first positions, but logically returns to the original choice. </p><h2>  Use of cards </h2><p>  The process of downloading maps is similar to that provided in version 10. It is noteworthy that the Garmin eTrex 20 GPS already comes with the package ‚ÄúRoads of Russia‚Äù.  There is no doubt in the correctness of viewing these materials.  Errors and inconsistencies occur only in working with new cards.  The device mainly uses two formats - vector .img and raster .kmz.  But if the first operations for loading and further use are quick and easy, then in the case of raster maps you will have to tinker.  As a rule, the difficulties are associated with the conversion to <span>the .kmz format.</span>  One way or another, most maps are successfully combined and reliably form an image of the area. </p><h2>  Who is it for? </h2><p>  Although the Garmin eTrex 20 is pedestrian oriented, it would be wrong to limit its range of applications.  For motorists, the device can come in handy even as a replacement for a car navigator.  Of course, the model‚Äôs capabilities are not so extensive, but a long charge support time sometimes justifies such a choice. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the main audience of the product is travelers, tourists and athletes.  The navigator will help in recording tracks, making bike rides, searching for infrastructure facilities, etc. The versatility of the device opens up all possibilities for outdoor activities and for targeted use as a treasure hunter tool.  Terrain exploration, research and calculation of territories can also be included in the list of tasks to be solved.  But the key to the success of any event is not only the technical unit, but also careful preparation - only having provided the necessary set of cards, you can go on a trip. </p><h2>  Device Reviews </h2>

    <p>  In working conditions, according to users, the navigator manifests itself as a tough and reliable device.  This is the very advantage for which the absence of a large Garmin eTrex 20 display is forgiven. The instructions in this case are quite consistent with the practice.  Operation in cold weather, in a downpour and in other situations that are not at all conducive to convenience will not cause problems for the user. </p><p>  The compactness of the navigator is also noted.  Oddly enough, the small device does not make it difficult to use in large men's hands, but at the same time, women and children quickly get used to control through a mini-joystick.  A pleasant design introduction, according to owners, was the approach to organizing the capacity for batteries.  Even in the dark, it is impossible to confuse their polarity, while many navigators do not insure this nuance of operation. </p><p>  Using Garmin eTrex 20 (reviews indicate this) is facilitated by a fully Russified menu.  Most problems are again resolved by following the instructions. </p><h2>  Expert review </h2>

    <p>  Professional testing of navigation devices usually focuses on signal reception quality.  In the case of the Garmin eTrex 20 it is assumed to work with satellites in harsh environments with interference. </p><p>  Regarding the reception in rooms near the window, in dense forests and tunnels, experts note average performance indicators, which is quite typical for representatives of more advanced models compared to Garmin eTrex 20. Reviews also indicate a slower search for specific objects in an area with tight development.  Nevertheless, there are attempts by the navigator to capture and fix the signal, and in this regard, the presence of even 2-3 satellites in the search area is already becoming a good result for a device of this level. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summarizing, it is possible to note the undoubted reliability of the gadget - it will not fail in the performance of the main tasks, but it will also justify itself under high loads.  Nevertheless, an unambiguous conclusion about the Garmin eTrex 20 model cannot be made by only one of the criteria.  This unit is beneficial for those who require a combination of qualities of a reliable travel accessory.  Analyzing the operating parameters and capabilities of the navigator, it becomes clear that this gadget is comparable to more advanced devices - it breaks out of the middle segment.  And yet, the lack of new-fangled refinements, which are often superfluous in the hands of practical users, affected the price of the device - it is quite affordable. </p>
