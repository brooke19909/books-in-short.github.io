The city is located between the mountains of Monte Pellegrino and Monte Gallo.  The sights of Mondello and Sicily include the vast green area formed by the Favorita Park.  However, most tourists who come to this small town are primarily interested in the beach.  Most tourists leave extremely delighted reviews about holidays in Sicily, which is facilitated by the unique climate of the Mediterranean, rich culinary traditions, and also the developed hospitality industry, since the tourist boom on the island began back in the distant XVlll century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mondello bay" class="if uuid-2974812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2974812.jpg"></div><h2>  Town History </h2><p>  The historical foundation of the city was formed during the bicentennial Arab domination, when a small fishing village was founded on one of the shores of the bay, traces of which are still preserved in the city street grid. </p><p>  In the overall historical geography of Sicily, Mondello occupies a very important place, since two defense towers are located on its territory, one of which stands in the very center of the city, while the other is somewhat removed from the center.  These structures were once an important part of the defense information network of fortifications along the entire Sicilian coast.  With the help of signal lights, information about raids on coastal cities was transmitted from one tower to another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the modern look of Mondello in Sicily began to take shape in the XVlll century, when the town became an important center of the Mediterranean trade in luxury goods.  It was in the eighteenth century that the city became the habitat of rich people from different European powers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="38.1971133212276" data-lng="13.318952829052705" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/0/2/5/12025.png"></div><h2>  The bourgeois capital of Sicily </h2><p>  Mondello radically changed its appearance in the XlX century, when more than 250 villas belonging to the European bourgeois were built in it.  However, the villas provided comfort to only a small number of rich people, while the rest of the town residents were forced to put up with extremely unfavorable, and often unsanitary, living conditions. </p><p>  Although the luxurious villas of Mondello and Sicily are still part of the pan-European historical heritage, they were surrounded by urban mud in the early nineteenth century.  The town was extremely undeveloped, since the local elite practically did not walk around the city on foot, preferring closed crews.  The beaches of all of Sicily and Mondello in particular were either not landscaped, or they did not exist at all until the end of the XlX century. </p><p>  The development of the coastal reed swamp began only in 1891.  The reed quagmire populated by mosquitoes was drained, sand was poured on the coast, and temporary pavilions were built in which spa people could satisfy their needs for every taste. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Heaven on earth </h2><p>  In 1816, Sicily and Mondello had a new owner, who became Ferdinand l Bourbon, who went down in history as the first ruler of the <span>Kingdom of both Sicilies.</span>  It was this monarch who belonged to the Neapolitan branch of the ancient royal house of the Bourbons, laid the foundations of the modern well-being of the town. </p><p>  This ruler is worthy of special mention also because he made a huge contribution to the development of local science and art.  For example, it was with his direct participation that the observatory in Palermo was built, and the Royal Museum of Bourbons, which is now known as the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, was opened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ioamolasicilia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mondello Bay" class="if uuid-2975223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975223.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see in Mondello </h2><p>  Sicily is famous for its antiquities.  Today on the island you can see historical monuments left by people in various eras.  There are ancient Greek colonies with their beautiful temples, and Arabian architecture, and luxurious Byzantine mosaics. </p><p>  As for Mondello, the photo of Sicily is difficult to imagine without the cave paintings that were discovered in caves located in the vicinity of this town.  The karst cavities inside Mount Monte Pellegrino were first inhabited by people in the Mesolithic and Paleolithic.  It is about that period of human history, the mores and customs of prehistoric people, that cave painting in Mondello caves tells. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilturista.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing boats in mondello" class="if uuid-2975232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975232.jpg"></div><h2>  Mondello Architecture </h2><p>  In turn, the refined architecture of the early XX century testifies to the mores and customs of modern man.  The most popular among the European aristocracy and the bourgeoisie at the beginning of the last century was the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  Numerous villas of that era turned into hotels in Sicily.  Mondello Palace, for example, was built in the Moorish style and is still one of the most popular hotels in this cozy town.  The hotel is in close proximity to the warm Mediterranean Sea, separated from it by only a small municipal road.  Reviews about Mondello in Sicily are extremely diverse. </p><p>  First of all, this is due to the fact that the hotel was built a long time ago and during its existence it has deteriorated significantly, which many guests complain about.  However, those who leave positive reviews are also right, because the hotel has its own beach, and a swimming pool is located directly on its territory.  The hotel also serves an impeccable breakfast, while its rooms really have no slippers or bathrobes.  The Mondello Palace Hotel in Sicily is, in spite of everything, one of the most popular attractions not only of this resort suburb, but of the whole of Palermo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.palermotoday.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mondello resort square" class="if uuid-2975236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975236.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Most of the villas built in the XlX century, were converted into hotels and apartments in Mondello and Sicily with the beginning of the tourist boom.  In addition, numerous specialized apartment hotels were built in the second half of the twentieth century. </p><p>  Given the highest wishes of travelers, it is not surprising that most of the hotels and apartments of this resort town belong to the category of four- or five-star.  Many travelers who choose the highest level of comfort prefer to use the services of specialized agencies that help organize an exclusive vacation. </p><p>  However, numerous independent tourists also have every opportunity to organize a good holiday for themselves.  Single travelers can organize a holiday in Mondello in Sicily with the help of special services for booking hotels or private accommodation with local residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogsicilia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beach volleyball" class="if uuid-2975239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975239.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  However, not only measured relaxation attracts tourists to the beaches of Sicily and Mondello.  To entertain the many guests in the city, there are several large, world famous festivals. </p><p>  The Beach Festival is very popular, because the resort is famous for its white sands.  As part of this holiday, windsurfing, beach volleyball, kiting and sailing competitions are held in the immediate vicinity of the city shore. </p><p>  However, the parallel program of the festival provides competitions in fencing, running and surfing.  Of course, such a major event is accompanied by nightly entertainment events: concerts, fiery parties and art exhibitions.  Numerous social gatherings allow you to get acquainted with the European bohemia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="neighborhood of mondello" class="if uuid-2975246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975246.jpg"></div><h2>  Favorite Park </h2><p>  Holidays in Sicily and in Mondello include not only relaxing on the beach, but also long romantic walks in the bosom of a unique island nature.  In 1799, by the personal order of King Ferdinand lll of Bourbon, a garden was laid out at the very foot of Mount Monte Pellegrino, which served as the basis for the future national park. </p><p>  To implement the grandiose project, more than 400 hectares of private land were expropriated.  It was assumed that, over a vast territory, selected guests could enjoy the coolness in the shade of orange and olive trees, as well as ash, walnuts and sumac. </p><p>  Over the next two centuries, a variety of balls and masquerades were held in the park, balloon races were organized.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a football field and a hippodrome were built. </p><p>  In 1995, the park was more than doubled, as a result of which the Monte Pellegrino Nature Reserve was born, the slopes of the mountain of the same name became part of it.  Today, the entrance to the park is from Leo Square. </p><h2>  What to see in the vicinity </h2><p>  Since even a beach holiday in Sicily is not complete without visiting historical and cultural monuments, it is worthwhile to talk about places that must be visited in the capital of the region - the city of Palermo.  It is from the airport of this city that it is possible to get not only to the Sicily Mondello beach, but also to other cities of the interior of the island. </p><p>  In order to make your vacation more diverse and interesting, you can visit the museums of the Sicilian capital. </p><p>  After all, no matter how beautiful the whitewashed beaches of Mondello and Sicily in the rays of the hot summer sun, a beach vacation can tire you sooner or later. </p><p>  One of the must-see museums in Palermo is considered to be the archaeological museum, whose collection began to take shape in 1814.  As often happens, the collection was initially replenished through private donations from Sicilian aristocrats.  Later, the collection began to be systematically replenished through excavations of numerous ancient cities of Sicily, as well as thanks to the donations of Sicilian kings. </p><h2>  Museum Creation </h2><p>  Initially, the Palermo Archaeological Museum and the Palermo Museum of Art were a single entity and housed on the campus of the University of Palermo.  Since 1866, this still unified museum has moved to the building of the former Ortorian monastery, and the collection has become available to more people. </p><p>  The collection was divided into two independent museums only as a result of World War II, when the main building of the museum was badly damaged due to the bombing.  When the restoration began after the war, it was decided to move part of the collection to the Palazzo Abatelis. </p><p>  The undoubted pearl of the museum's collection are artifacts brought from the ancient Greek city of Selinunte.  These antiquities fell into the collection thanks to the incredible efforts of the Italian amateur archaeologist and numismatist Antonio Salinas, who was very passionate about Greek culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipfs.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cathedral monreale" class="if uuid-2975595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975595.jpg"></div><h2>  Monreale Cathedral </h2><p>  The most convenient way to travel around Sicily is a rented car, as numerous historical monuments are scattered in various parts of the island.  For example, just 22 kilometers from the magnificent beaches of Mondello in Sicily, there is the small town of Montreal, which adorns the old cathedral. </p><p>  The main temple of Montreal was founded in 1174 by order of the King of Sicily, William ll Good.  An ancient legend says that the Mother of God appeared to William ll and indicated the place where his father buried countless treasures.  It was at this place, in appreciation, that the king built the main temple of his capital and dedicated it to the Virgin. </p><p>  The main decoration of the cathedral are its mosaics, which were laid out by skilled Byzantine craftsmen.  In total, the walls of the temple are decorated with 130 mosaic panels, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich exceeds ten thousand square meters.  The entire interior of the Cathedral of Monreale is decorated with a rich pattern that is not found anywhere else. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="palatine chapel" class="if uuid-2975828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101043/2975828.jpg"></div><h2>  Palatine Chapel </h2><p>  Once you break away from the white beaches of Mondello in Sicily and ride around the surroundings, you can discover a lot of beautiful things.  Since Sicily has long been part of the Byzantine Empire, it is not surprising that there are numerous monuments built under its cultural influence and with the direct participation of Byzantine masters. </p><p>  Since mosaic was one of the most common Byzantine decoration techniques, the craftsmen in this technique were in demand throughout the Mediterranean.  Another architectural monument worthy of attention even with the best beach vacations is the Palatine Chapel, located in the Norman Palace in Palermo. </p><h2>  Mosaic Treasures </h2><p>  The arches and walls of this palace church, commissioned by foreign invaders, are decorated with numerous mosaic panels, the most significant of which depicts Christ the Almighty, also known as Christ Pantocrator.  Most of the mosaic is a golden background, made according to ancient Byzantine technology, which has not been preserved to this day.  The interiors of the chapel are so beautiful that quite often become an illustration of holidays in Sicily and Mondello, and photos of its interiors are decorated with numerous guides and albums with Sicilian antiquities. </p>
