But there are assistants who can make this process interesting, simple and even enjoyable.  And these helpers are cordless vacuum cleaners.  The rating, which we give below, will help you make the right choice and choose an effective model for cleaning the house. </p><h2>  Convenient and functional </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="cordless vacuum cleaners rating" class="if uuid-1474910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474910.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  Wireless vacuum cleaners are more expensive than conventional models, but they are more versatile and easy to use.  They operate on batteries and have a vertical design.  For cleaning the floor in such models, only a brush is used, and the rest of the functional elements - housing, motor, dust collector, filters - are located directly in a compact vertical design.  Charging such devices is simultaneously their parking space on the floor, next to a power outlet. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Today, <span>cordless cordless vacuum cleaners</span> are becoming increasingly popular <span>.</span>  We decided to make a rating taking into account both positive and negative sides of these devices.  Among the advantages of such structures, the following can be noted: </p><ul><li>  lack of wire, which requires an outlet; </li><li>  compact size and light weight; </li><li>  easy operation of a vertical vacuum cleaner, since you do not need to carry a heavy case with a thick hose. </li></ul><p>  On the other hand, battery operation limits the life of the vacuum cleaner - until it is completely discharged.  In addition, the volume of the container is very small, so you will have to clean it more often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another drawback is the suction power, which is lower compared to the classic vacuum cleaner models. </p><p>  And now we offer a rating of the most popular models of wireless vacuum cleaners.  Let's start with the most recognizable brands. </p><h2>  1st place.  Bosch athlet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="cordless vacuum cleaners for home rating" class="if uuid-1474912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474912.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  We decided to open the rating of cordless vacuum cleaners in 2016 with the popular German brand Bosch.  Lightness, maneuverability, the ability to work without recharging for an hour, fast charging, weight of only 3 kg - all these are the advantages of this model.  A maximum power of 25 W is enough for optimal cleaning of the living area.  The model sucks dust and debris well, while saving battery power.  The vacuum cleaner easily works on carpets and in any hard-to-reach spots, completely removing dirt.  Among the technical features of this model can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Sensor Control system, which controls the degree of filter contamination and a special signal warns of the need for cleaning; </li><li>  Sensor Bagless cleaning system, which automatically determines the time when you need to clean the membrane filter. </li></ul><p>  Probably, these are the most reliable and at the same time compact wireless vacuum cleaners for the home.  We built the rating 2016 on the basis of information about three models of the Bosch line: Athlet BCH6ATH25, BCH6ATH25K, BCH6ATH18.  We should also mention the Bosch Athlet BCH6ATH25K, as it comes with a set of additional cleaning accessories.  A special nozzle can be used to clean upholstered furniture, a crevice nozzle - the most inaccessible areas, a corrugated hose and a special strap make it possible to carry the accessory on the shoulder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  2nd place.  Electrolux rapido </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="rating of vacuum cleaners 2016" class="if uuid-1474913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474913.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  In making the rating, we could not ignore the Electrolux brand.  Perhaps the most stylish cordless vacuum cleaners are presented in his lineup.  We made the rating taking into account the Ergorapido model, which is inlaid with Swarovski crystals.  In addition to the unusual design, this model attracts with versatility and practicality: with its help you can remove any surface - from the floor to furniture.  Thanks to the ergonomic design and reasonableness of each part, the vacuum cleaner is very convenient to use.  Among the advantages of this model include: </p><ul><li>  miniature size: weight of 1.5 kg allows you to clean quickly and without stress; </li><li>  time to complete discharge - 12 minutes, and the blue indicator will inform about the need for charging; </li><li>  wheels available: this is the only cordless vacuum cleaner that has wheels.  This increases the maneuverability of the device and the convenience of its operation. </li></ul><p>  A simple design combined with functionality and practicality is what distinguishes these <span>vertical</span> wireless <span>vacuum cleaners</span> .  The rating will help you with the choice of a device that will be your reliable assistant in cleaning. </p><h2>  3rd place.  LG CordZero Bedding </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="vacuum cleaners vertical wireless rating" class="if uuid-1474914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474914.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  The LG brand line includes 6 cordless vacuum cleaners, each of which is worthy of the attention of customers.  Convenience, compactness and at the same time power are the distinguishing features of each model.  Most LG vacuum cleaners are two in one devices, that is, they can be used both as a portable accessory and as a vertical one.  When choosing a cordless vacuum cleaner, the rating of models should be considered in order to make the right choice.  Among the technological features of the LG CordZero vacuum cleaners, one can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  weight less than 2 kg; </li><li>  the ability to clean the floor, and upholstered furniture, and mattresses; </li><li>  the presence of the CordZero Bedding system provides effective removal of particles of dirt, allergens and dust mites; </li><li>  Dual Punch technology and a three-stage cleaning system are the key to cleanliness and comfort in the room; </li><li>  the vacuum cleaner has a built-in UV sterilization system, so that there will be no odors or dust in the room; </li><li>  You can clear the container by pressing the One Touch button. </li></ul><p>  Including this model in the rating of wireless vacuum cleaners for the home in 2016, we took into account reviews and design features as the main parameters.  So, according to reviews, it is clear that any of the LG CordZero * 2 in 1 models is universal, since it can be used both in vertical mode and for manual cleaning. </p><h2>  4th place.  Philips PowerPro Duo </h2><p>  Describing the popular cordless vacuum cleaners for the home, we could not help but supplement the Philips brand model.  From a technological point of view, this is one of the best and functional vacuum cleaners, as it easily copes with cleaning any floor coverings.  The device shows maximum performance thanks to PowerCyclone technology.  Accordingly, cleaning becomes even simpler due to the greater suction speed of the air and ensuring its circulation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="cordless home vacuum cleaners rating reviews" class="if uuid-1474915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474915.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  The TriActive Turbo nozzle can easily clean hard floors and carpets, and the cleaning efficiency is achieved by optimized airflow.  The wireless mode of operation helps to move the vacuum cleaner throughout the premises.  Ergonomic design makes it easy to think about the layout in the room.  An electrically driven brush can be used to efficiently clean animal hair.  High purity is achieved using a three-layer filter developed on the basis of German technology.  It easily picks up the smallest dust particles, microorganisms, which a conventional vacuum cleaner cannot boast of. </p><h2>  5. Samsung Flex Slim </h2><p>  The best helper to make home cleaning easier is the cordless home vacuum cleaner.  Rating, reviews - these are the most popular parameters, on the basis of which many buyers make conclusions about the purchase.  The vertical vacuum cleaner on the Samsung Flex Slim battery is a compact but powerful device that shows excellent results on any surface.  A special control plate in the design serves for the highest quality garbage collection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="cordless vacuum cleaners for home rating 2016" class="if uuid-1474909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474909.jpg?1547579193"></div><p>  In Samsung Flex Slim, you can use the suction module separately from the vacuum cleaner, as it is removable.  In this case, it can be used to process the interior of the car, for example.  High-quality cleaning is achieved by double filtration technology. </p><h2>  Separate attention </h2><p>  We have described the most popular models of cordless vacuum cleaners that are in high customer demand.  These brands are well known, therefore, are better known to customers.  But there are models of cordless vacuum cleaners that are no worse in terms of technical parameters or in appearance.  Separately, we decided to mention a few more baby models that are ideal for cleaning the house: </p><ol><li>  Hoover Handy Plus.  This vacuum cleaner weighs only 600 g, but is equipped with an innovative brush that can easily cope even with the smallest substances. </li><li>  Dyson Animal Pro.  This model has a <span>cyclone filter</span> and is remembered for its futuristic appearance and excellent performance due to a high power brush. </li><li>  Hoover ATHEN ATN300B 011. This is a classic cordless vacuum cleaner that can last 60 minutes without recharging.  It equally effectively copes with both floor cleaning and carpet cleaning. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="rating wireless vacuum cleaners for home 2016 reviews" class="if uuid-1474911" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/1474911.jpg?1547579193"></div><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, despite the relative novelty, cordless vacuum cleaners are becoming increasingly popular.  And this is no coincidence: they are compact and convenient, so vacuuming has become much easier and more enjoyable.  Especially relevant is the purchase of such units in rooms in which the floor is covered with laminate, parquet, carpet and requires a more careful attitude. </p>
