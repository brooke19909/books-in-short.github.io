Somehow, in most cultures and civilizations, it is customary to say goodbye to the deceased and remove them a couple of meters below the surface of the earth, regardless of their attitude to them.  The posthumous fate of the founder of the Soviet state took shape in just such a bizarre way - he was put on public display in the center of Moscow.  Those who wish to admire it will only have to find out the mode of operation <span>of the Lenin Mausoleum.</span>  In 1953, Stalin's body was also brought here.  But after seven years, Vladimir Ilyich again remained in the Mausoleum in splendid isolation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Keywordsmode of work of the Lenin Mausoleum" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/330786.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Historical attraction </h2><p>  The author of the building of the Mausoleum is the famous <span>architect Schusev.</span>  Many consider this work the pinnacle of his work.  Whether someone likes this fact or not, this object is today one of the main attractions of the capital.  Many tourists are still interested in the Lenin Mausoleum - mode of operation, ticket price.  Some are even surprised to learn that visiting the Mausoleum was free at all times of its existence.  Everyone who wants to visit it can do this from 10 to 13 hours on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Be prepared to go through the <span>frame of the metal detector</span> and hand over bulky objects to the storage room.  Photography and video shooting are prohibited. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin's mausoleum mode of operation Price" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/330788.jpg" width="450"></div>

The 2013 operating mode was distinguished by the fact that the facility was temporarily closed for restoration.  The building of the Mausoleum for this purpose was covered with a large plastic dome.  Currently, all work has been successfully completed, and it functions as usual.  In addition to the building itself, its occupant undergoes periodic restoration.  Many express legitimate doubts about the authenticity of the exhibit presented to the public and believe that a wax copy of the great leader is on display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin's mausoleum 2013" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/330787.jpg" width="486"></div>

    <h2>  <span>The working hours of the Lenin Mausoleum</span> during Soviet times </h2><p>  This place has long been cult for people of the Soviet era.  Everyone recognized his significance, regardless of their attitude to Lenin himself.  It was considered mandatory to visit the Mausoleum at least once in a lifetime and pay homage to the leader of the world proletarian revolution.  The queue on Red Square entered the figurative series of myths of a bygone era.  She was always compared with the length of any other queue that Soviet people came across daily.  In particular, the working hours of the Lenin Mausoleum, creating a meaningless crush, were often remembered in the lines for alcohol in the late eighties.  That was the reality.  The line for vodka has become comparable to a series of people going to bow to Lenin.  They did not express themselves very politely.  But it was so conceived - in order to visit the main state shrine, you had to wake up early and head to the Alexander Garden, where you should take a turn and stand for several hours.  Such was the operating mode of the Lenin Mausoleum.  Now visit the Mausoleum </p>
