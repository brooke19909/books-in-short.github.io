    <h2>  History </h2><p>  In the forties of the last century, a new material hitherto unknown to clothing manufacturers appeared - polyacryl.  What kind of fabric?  The United States was the first to answer this question, because it was the American company DuPont that produced the first synthetic fibers, which were called polyacrylonitrile. </p><p>  The first meter of material was obtained in 1948.  He made a decent competition to the then popular nylon.  At first, the material was very difficult to stain.  But after several years of refinement and research, manufacturers were able to get the perfect synthetic fabric. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  Polyacrylate.  What kind of fabric?  There is no definite answer to this question.  In today's world, most materials contain it.  Acrylic fibers are added to wool, mohair, cotton, angora, <span>coat</span> , etc. The percentage can fluctuate and can be completely different.  Some fabrics will be 95 percent acrylic, others only five. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No matter how the clothing manufacturers insist on one hundred percent wool or cotton, in most cases their products contain polyacryl.  What fabric can have a long service life, and besides, for many years, socks to maintain their original appearance?  There is simply no such thing.  All modern cotton, mohair or woolen things have such qualities thanks to the addition of polyacryl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polyacrylic fabric properties" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1692108.jpg" width="531"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristics and advantages of the material </h2><p>  Polyacrylate.  What kind of fabric?  Many call it ‚Äúnaked‚Äù synthetics, others - artificial wool.  But sometimes only a specialist can distinguish these synthetic fibers from natural ones.  Acrylic is as soft and soft as cotton.  It is as warm and light as a woolen thread. </p><p>  Polyacrylate is a fabric whose properties and advantages can be listed for a very long time.  Products from this material are very pleasant to the touch, soft and delicate.  They look very beautiful.  A distinctive feature is the ability to retain heat.  That is why such a fabric is most often used for the manufacture of warm winter clothing. </p><p>  In addition, synthetic fabric is hypoallergenic.  Allergy sufferers may not always wear natural wool.  But polyacrylic products are quite suitable for people suffering from hypersensitivity to the skin, for young children and even pregnant and lactating women. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polyacrylic what kind of fabric reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1692107.jpg" width="359"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The fabric does not crease at all - this is another significant advantage.  Items made from polyacryl are great for traveling.  They can be taken on the road without worrying that they will remember in a suitcase or bag and lose their beautiful appearance.  The given form will be held in any conditions. </p><p>  A big plus of acrylic items is the ability to dry clean them.  Synthetic material perfectly tolerates the various effects of chemicals, acids and solvents.  It is resistant to weather conditions.  If it is a disaster to get into a coat of natural wool under heavy rain, then products made of synthetic fabric will withstand any whirlwinds and bad weather. </p><p>  In the process of coloring the material, the paint is absorbed so firmly that products in the future are not afraid of numerous washings.  Color saturation will not be lost and will not fade over the years. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Along with many advantages, polyacryl has several disadvantages.  Firstly, the fabric does not absorb moisture well and is airtight.  Secondly, things can be covered with small spools over time, which negatively affects the appearance of the product. </p><p>  Quite often, people who wear synthetics use special anti-static aerosols.  Polyacrylum accumulates static electricity - this is another drawback. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polyacrylic what fabric" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1692105.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, we have already figured out what polyacryl is, what kind of fabric.  Reviews about the material will also be useful.  People who choose things from <span>synthetic fabrics</span> for themselves always note the long term of wearing things and their excellent appearance.  Many say that they are specifically looking for the label ‚ÄúPAN‚Äù on the label.  It means that the item will look perfect for many years, will not lose the color brightness, will not stretch after washing. </p><p>  In reviews, it is often noted that it is convenient to take things from polyacryl with you when traveling.  Especially if it is known that there will be no iron in the hotel.  Disadvantages such as static electricity or poor breathability overlap with the many advantages and benefits of the material. </p>
