Tours to this country are becoming more popular from year to year.  Luxurious snow-white beaches, the world's best discos and nightly dances until you drop, three hundred varieties of tequila and bright, unforgettable colors - travelers are ready to talk about these impressions for hours.  And also the eternal spring, turning into an endless summer, and exotic animals in the real jungle.  In a word, this is a real paradise.  The only thing that can overshadow the tourist trip is a too long flight.  But what can‚Äôt you do to see all this beauty?  And so that your trip does not turn out to be too expensive, we will talk about how best to take last-minute tours to Mexico. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thewallpaper.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="When to buy a last-minute tour to Mexico" class="if uuid-2361100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361100.jpg"></div><h2>  When to buy a package trip </h2><p>  In the high season, buying a last-minute tour to Mexico is more problematic.  Therefore, get ready for the fact that from November to April - in the "dry period" - prices can rise significantly.  But in summer and autumn, the so-called rainy season begins.  But the fact is that it manifests itself in Mexico in a very peculiar way.  Humidity rises, winds begin, but not too strong.  The water in the ocean becomes very warm, so swimming is more comfortable than in high season.  And the rains - there are also tropical showers - occur in Mexico at this time mainly at night.  During the day, you can sunbathe or go on excursions.  It will not bother you.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to buy last-minute tours to Mexico during the rainy season.  Their prices then fall very much.  But keep in mind that a hot tour to this country means that you should be ready to leave almost the next day.  So fold things in advance.  If there are unsold seats left on the flight, last-minute tours can be bought two or four days before departure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.taketours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Mexico Attractions" class="if uuid-2361108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361108.jpg"></div><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Those from all over the world flock to Mexico who love to travel and are interested in history.  The ancient civilizations of the Aztecs and Mayans with their gloomy, brilliant and mysterious culture can reveal their secrets to us.  That is why sightseeing tours to Mexico are so in demand.  In Mexico, music, wine and culinary festivals take place all year round.  And what caves, volcanoes and mountains are here!  But use this tempting opportunity to travel around the country only in high season.  Otherwise, it becomes too wet, and many roads will become impassable due to rains.  Therefore, if you want to see the natural attractions of the country, look for last-minute tours in the fall and winter. </p><h2>  Excursion packages </h2><p>  The easiest trip that you can buy at a discount at "last minute" prices is the "Mayan Sacred Cities."  It takes 4-5 nights.  Tourists visiting all the most interesting places associated with this amazing civilization.  But if you are lucky, then you can also not too expensive to buy a ticket covering the capital of the country, the main natural and archaeological sites, as well as resorts.  For example, such a tour usually starts in Mexico City.  Travelers spend two days in it, examining Spanish colonial architecture, the pyramids of the Moon, the Sun and the Feathered Serpent in the former Aztec capital Teotihuacan, the Museum of Anthropology, the house where Frida Callot and Leo Trotsky lived.  Then the tourists move to the most legendary resort in Mexico - Acapulco, where they watch how desperate daredevils jump from the 40-meter-high rock into the water.  For several days, travelers visit the most diverse archaeological zones associated with the cultures of the Indians - Oaxaca, Monte Alban, Teuantepec, Mayan cities Palenque, Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Ek Balam.  The natural beauties of the country are not forgotten on this tour.  <span>Sumidero Canyon,</span> Misol-Ha Waterfall, <span>Ik-Kil Lake</span> in the karst well, and much more.  In the end, tourists relax in one of the sea resorts, for example, in Cancun.  Tours to Mexico from Moscow with excursions of this magnitude can also be last minute.  A similar trip lasts from 11 days to two weeks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mexperience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sightseeing Tours in Mexico" class="if uuid-2361128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361128.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach tours </h2><p>  Mostly such trips last from six to ten nights.  Although there are tours for two weeks.  The natural conditions of Mexico, as well as the fame of its resorts are such that holidaymakers from around the world seek it.  After all, here you can soak up the beaches of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the Caribbean.  The sandy coast here stretches for many kilometers, the choice of hotels is simply huge, and the leisure infrastructure is well developed.  Acapulco, Los Cabos, Cancun, Mayan Riviera, Cozumel are known to the whole world.  But it is last-minute tours that you can not buy at all these resorts.  And prices in Mexico are pretty ‚Äúbiting."  The resorts here are very prestigious, and their main admirers are American tourists.  And this, of course, does not at all reduce the cost of vouchers.  Therefore, we will tell you about some resorts where you can buy a burning tour.  They are the most popular among Russians. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cntraveler.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Tours in Mexico" class="if uuid-2361141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361141.jpg"></div><h2>  Cancun </h2><p>  This is the most expensive and fashionable resort in the country.  And <span>tours to Cancun</span> (Mexico) are in demand.  Amazing turquoise water in the ocean, blinding white sand, luxury hotels.  Resorts stretched in a row along the sea along the spit.  No wonder Cancun is in the top 5 best resorts in the world.  All hotels with animation and restaurants serve fresh seafood, and there are also many entertainment venues, places for relaxation, fitness and spa.  But tours to Cancun (Mexico) are some of the most expensive.  In addition, there are many natural attractions near this resort.  Underground rivers with dinosaur skeletons, relic Akumal caves, where at the same time you can also see underwater beauty.  After all, they have their own access to the sea.  And it‚Äôs not far to get to some historical places from here, as, for example, to the famous settlement of Chichen Itza. </p><h2>  Riviera Maya </h2><p>  This is a more democratic holiday destination.  It is not for nothing that tour operators choose trips to the Riviera Maya from tours to Mexico.  Despite the fact that this is one of the youngest resorts in the country, it was immediately chosen by tourists from Europe.  Vacationers with children also come here.  Travelers advise this resort at least for the fact that it consists of a hundred kilometers of continuous beach.  Moreover, it is from here that it is the cheapest to go on excursions to the ancient Mayan cities, especially Tulum.  The hotels in this resort meet all European standards and are somewhat reminiscent of Spanish.  But beach bungalows are very popular here.  The Mayan Riviera hotels compare favorably with Cancun in that they have a large territory.  Often, it is here that tours to Mexico are organized all-inclusive, because local hotels more often than other resorts practice this system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cancun Mexico Tours" class="if uuid-2361152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361152.jpg"></div><h2>  Playa del carmen </h2><p>  The former fishing village now attracts travelers from all over the world.  This is a great vacation spot for young people.  Here are good, but not too expensive hotels.  And the vibrant life on the beach and along the promenade does not calm down either day or night.  The resort is very suitable for nature lovers, because it is very convenient to visit the national parks of Mexico from here.  Tours from Moscow to Playa del Carmen are quite simple to pick up, and they are often visited by operators.  Next to this resort is one of the largest islands in Mexico - Cozumel.  All divers dream of getting there.  The fact is that next to this island is the second largest coral reef in the world.  Nearby is the stunning Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve.  The underwater world is very diverse.  This is why the Cozumel Strait between Playa del Carmen and the island of the same name is very popular with divers.  And Shkaret ethnographic park, located nearby, will introduce curious tourists to the Mayan culture. </p><h2>  Puerto Morelos </h2><p>  This resort is located approximately in the middle between Playa del Carmen and Cancun.  Tours to Mexico with offers to settle in Puerto Morelos are suitable for lovers of solitude and real beach relaxation.  This place adores bohemia.  Artists, writers and artists come here from all over the world.  There are still not very high prices, and the rhythm of life is calmer than in Cancun.  A few kilometers south of this resort village is a huge botanical park named after Dr. Alfred Barrera.  It is divided along the coast of the Caribbean Sea.  Here strange cotton trees grow, which were considered sacred among the Mayans, many species of rare birds are found.  You can see almost disappeared monkey koat in this park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tour to Mexico for two" class="if uuid-2361156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361156.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours from Moscow and St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Operators offer residents of the Russian capital many options for traveling to Mexico.  There are short-term tours for a week without food, but with accommodation in a five-star hotel.  You can choose a more budget trip, in a hotel class lower.  But sometimes three or four star hotels can be expensive.  Most often we are talking about tours to Cancun (Mexico).  But in the travel agency you can pick up a trip for ten days or two weeks, with breakfast or ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù, with accommodation in any resort - Acapulco, Riviera Maya, on the Yucatan Peninsula.  In the "Northern Palmyra" the most popular is a beach holiday.  Tours to Mexico from St. Petersburg are mainly flights to Cancun for a week or two.  Less often you can find hotels in Playa del Carmen or the Mayan Riviera.  Trips to other resorts or sightseeing trips are formed individually and upon request. </p><h2>  Last-minute tours to Mexico: prices included in the package </h2><p>  As a rule, such package tours cost economical tourists cheaper than basic ones.  Sometimes you can save 20-40 percent.  The price of a <span>tour to Mexico</span> from Moscow will be from 1300 dollars (74 000 rubles) per person for 9-10 nights, if this is a budget burning trip for a beach holiday.  This package includes a flight, transfer to the resort and the airport, accommodation in a four-star hotel with free Wi-Fi, in cozy, modern and comfortable rooms with breakfast.  If you choose a hotel with an all inclusive food system, then two weeks at a beach resort will cost you (on the condition of a last-minute tour) $ 1900 (107,000 rubles) for one.  True, this also includes the cost of a round-trip airplane ticket.  A stay at the Three Stars hotel in Cancun for a week can be bought for a price from 120 to 140 thousand rubles per room.  The cheapest last-minute tours to Mexico for two with excursions cost from 3600 (205 000 p.) Dollars without air travel.  The price includes hotel accommodation (minimum 4 stars) with breakfast, a Russian-speaking guide throughout the route, transfer to hotels and entrance fees to museums or archaeological parks, which are included in the program. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to Mexico all inclusive" class="if uuid-2361146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2361146.jpg"></div><h2>  Tours to Mexico: reviews </h2><p>  Responses about traveling to this country leave full of delight Russians of different ages.  It is popular with youth companies, families with children, and lovers.  Great food, good service, comfortable hotels.  Many tourists praised the all inclusive system.  The level of service is almost the same everywhere, despite the class of hotels.  Unless in five-star hotels, alcohol is an order of magnitude better than in others.  But if you like a variety of food, you need to look for a hotel with a lot of restaurants.  For entertainment, it is worth booking the Oasis hotel chain.  But for the rest on the sea, tourists consider the main criterion not a hotel, but a beach.  For a relaxing holiday, it is better to choose five-star resorts.  And for those who love parties, the Temptation chain hotels are suitable.  In addition, there is food 24 hours a day, and a lot of seafood.  Vacationers in hotels live very decent, despite the country of origin.  And guided tours of Mexico are something incredible.  More beautiful and mysterious places are hard to find on our planet.  Therefore, those who visited them, do not regret the money spent. </p>
