  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ufa - Ekaterinburg: travel options on the route</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The distance from Ufa to Yekaterinburg is 530-550 kilometers.  This distance can be traveled along the dull roads of northeastern Bashkiria, and along a more civilian route through Chelyabinsk.  Between cities, not only trains and buses run, but planes sometimes fly. </p><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  Buses from Ufa to Yekaterinburg leave from the southern bus station and from the TRC "Family".  Roughly a day there will be six flights with the following departure schedule: </p><ul><li>  06:50. </li><li>  07:00 a.m. </li><li>  15:50. </li><li>  6 p.m. </li><li>  19:30. </li><li>  23:00. </li></ul><p>  The trip takes from 8 to 12 hours.  Hyundai, Kia and Man buses with a capacity of 30-45 passengers ply along the route.  A ticket costs about 1100 rubles, so the fare is 2 rubles per kilometer.  The Severny bus station and the Sverdlovsk shopping center can also be the place of arrival in Yekaterinburg.  Both are located near the railway station and near the Uralskaya metro station.  Buses travel along the roads of north-eastern Bashkiria, through Mesyagutovo to Krasnoufimsk and then to Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  On the way back, from Yekaterinburg to Ufa, buses depart according to this schedule: </p><ul><li>  08:00. </li><li>  12:00 p.m. </li><li>  17:33. </li><li>  9 p.m. </li></ul><p>  Ufa also takes 8-11 hours and the ticket price is the same as above. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yekaterinburg in winter" class="if uuid-3160249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3160249.jpg"></div><h2>  Rail ride </h2><p>  This option is better because you can ride on a train at night while lying down, rather than sitting, like on a bus.  The distance by train from Ufa to Yekaterinburg will be more authentic than on the highway.  This is due to the fact that the train first goes to Chelyabinsk, that is, it makes a detour, and then travels north to Yekaterinburg.  A total of 730 kilometers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are enough trains on this route: </p><ul><li>  02:42. </li><li>  08:23. </li><li>  12:51. </li><li>  17:33. </li></ul><p>  So, you can leave at night, afternoon, evening and morning.  To go from 14 to 16 hours, the trip takes longer than by bus, because the trains have longer stops, up to 30 minutes, for example, in Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  All trains are non-branded, they can follow from Ufa itself and from different cities to the south, for example, Makhachkala and Anapa. </p><p>  The ticket price from Ufa to Yekaterinburg depends on the type of car: </p><ul><li>  Reserved seat.  From 850 rubles. </li><li>  The compartment.  From 1330 rubles. </li></ul><p>  On the return route from Yekaterinburg to Ufa, the schedule is as follows: </p><ul><li>  03:01. </li><li>  13:03. </li><li>  19:31. </li><li>  19:40. </li><li>  23:02. </li></ul><p>  All trains are formed by Russian Railways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Hall of Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-3160250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3160250.jpg"></div><h2>  Flight between cities </h2><p>  Despite the small distance, airplanes fly between cities.  At 05:10, a Ural Airlines flight departs from Ufa to Koltsovo.  One hour to fly, the ticket costs from 2600 rubles.  However, flights are rare, that‚Äôs why air travel is inferior to the option of traveling by bus and train. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufa Center" class="if uuid-3160252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3160252.jpg"></div><h2>  Car ride </h2><p>  The distance by car from Ufa to Yekaterinburg depends on the route.  If you go to the north-east of Bashkiria, through Mesyagutovo, you get 535 kilometers.  Entrance to Yekaterinburg on the highway E-22 from Druzhinino. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The trip will take place along the following routes: </p><ul><li>  E-30.  To the border with the Chelyabinsk region.  In the village of Shalash you need to turn to the north-east. </li><li>  R-242.  To Mesyagutovo. </li><li>  R-350.  To the settlement of Russian Taurus in the south of the Sverdlovsk region. </li><li>  You can get to Druzhinino from the Russian Taurus by secondary roads through the Lower Sergi or along the aforementioned P-350 to Achita and from it to Yekaterinburg by E-22. </li></ul><p>  There is an option with a trip through Chelyabinsk.  422 kilometers to it should be passed along the highway E-30.  Already in the regional center, in front of the international airport of Balandino, you need to turn onto the M-36.  This route leads to the Sverdlovsk region and Yekaterinburg cars enter from the south on the M-5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panorama of Ufa" class="if uuid-3160253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3160253.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractions along the way </h2><p>  In Ufa, Yekaterinburg and in the cities between them you can visit a lot of objects. </p><p>  For example, Ufa is interesting with a large equestrian monument to Salavat Yulaev and various museums, among them: national, art, military glory, geology, literary, local Ministry of Internal Affairs.  In addition, there are expositions rare for Russia, for example, the writer Aksakov or the forest museum near the zoo and the Botanical Garden. </p><p>  There are as many as three museums on Soviet subjects in the city: Lenin, Stalin and Soviet life. </p><p>  Not far from the station there is a children's railway, it works only in summer.  Interestingly, there are similar transport routes in Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg.  All three cities are interesting for their architecture, both pre-revolutionary and Soviet, for example, the Stalinist Empire.  In this style, buildings of universities, institutes and libraries were built in the 1950s, for example, the regional one in Chelyabinsk. </p><p>  In terms of the diversity of the museum exposition, Yekaterinburg is superior to both Chelyabinsk and Ufa.  In the central part of the city there are museums of famous people - B. Yeltsin, Nicholas II, Vladimir Vysotsky, E. Unknown.  In addition to them, there is a literary quarter and museums on military subjects - internationalist warriors and airborne forces. </p><p>  If you go from Ufa to Yekaterinburg through the Chelyabinsk region, then you should stop on Lake Turgoyak near Miass. </p>
