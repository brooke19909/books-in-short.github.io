When pronouncing this word, associations most often arise associated either with the railway platform or with shoes on the platform.  It should be noted that they correspond to reality, however, the spectrum of interpretation of this token is much wider.  More details about the fact that this is a platform will be described in the article. </p><h2>  High ground </h2><p>  The explanatory dictionary offers many meanings of the word ‚Äúplatform‚Äù.  The first option says that this is an elevated platform.  The following examples illustrate this interpretation of the word. </p><ol><li>  Wooden platforms were attached to the pyramids, and two large open glades were cleared and leveled in a nearby grove. </li><li>  For the performance of artists in the open air, they quickly put together a large platform made of improvised material, rather high, durable and spacious. </li></ol><h2>  For the convenience of passengers </h2><p>  The second option denotes a transport term that describes the site, which is specially equipped on the route of transport and is intended for boarding and alighting passengers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway platform" class="if uuid-2900221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2900221.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Alena and her friends looked for Andrei for a long time on a crowded platform, and when she was already seriously excited, she suddenly saw him sitting quietly on a bench at the far end of the platform. </li><li>  In accordance with how the platforms are located relative to the station building, they are divided into two types: main and intermediate. </li></ol><h2>  Stop point </h2><p>  According to the third option, this is a small stopping point on the railway, without a station and without side tracks, from the infrastructure there is only a platform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  In order to avoid any misunderstandings, Anatoly decided to write down the address and modes of transport in detail: "Take an electric train at the suburban station, get to the Starokonyushennaya platform, then transfer to the bus going to the village of Selyanovsky, find Karuzelnaya street, house number 4 there." </li><li>  It was a pity for Natasha to part with her friends, who were newly acquired in the train, but her stop appeared already in the window - Snegiri's platform, and she was reluctant to move towards the exit. </li></ol><h2>  Platform like a wagon </h2><p>  In transport, wagons, trailers, semi-trailers or a part of a body having a flat horizontal platform are also called a platform.  This area may or may not be equipped with sides.  It is intended for the transport of long loads, such as logs or rails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globaltrademag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cargo platform" class="if uuid-2900219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2900219.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Open railway platforms are divided into two types: universal and specialized.  The former transport a wide variety of cargoes of a wide range, and the latter transport only cargoes of a particular type, such as large containers, timber, cars. </li><li>  Open specialized platforms have no sides, and sometimes no flooring, they are equipped with special fastenings for goods, as well as other devices that facilitate loading and unloading and transportation. </li></ol><h2>  In technology </h2><p>  The platform is also a technical term for a general set of any units, technological and design solutions.  On its basis, different types of cars and other mechanisms are produced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  This vehicle cannot be reckoned with any one class, relying on the Boomerang unified platform; on its base it is possible to create both a combat vehicle, a heavily armed vehicle, a wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier. </li><li>  The developed platform (according to preliminary estimates) can provide 2-4 times acceleration of processes such as design and implementation of innovative dual-use products.  Among them, medical equipment, which is competitive and meets international standards. </li></ol><h2>  In computer technology </h2><p>  In computer terminology, it is a complex of technologies and specifications that provides hardware-software compatibility of different products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.it-terminal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Platform 1C" class="if uuid-2900218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2900218.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Initially, such a 1C platform as "Enterprise" was intended only for the automation of management and accounting.  It included personnel management and payroll.  However, to date, this product has found application in solving problems that are far from accounting. </li><li>  As for the latest generation of anti-virus solutions, as a base it uses a fundamentally new software platform that has broad support for cloud technologies. </li></ol><h2>  In geology </h2><p>  Geologists so-called large tracts of the earth's crust, which are located on the continent, and are in a relatively calm tectonic state. </p><ol><li>  Ancient platforms, called cratons, lie on the crystalline basement dating back to the Precambrian period or to cryptozoic.  They occupy about 40% of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãall continents of the Earth. </li><li>  There is an assumption that the Siberian platform, which is located in the middle of North Asia, corresponds to Angarada - one of the ancient continents. </li></ol><h2>  Shoe platform </h2><p>  In conclusion, the study of the fact that this is a platform will consider such an interpretation of the word as ‚Äúthick shoe sole‚Äù. </p><ul><li>  The platform on shoes has long been very popular among women, as it is much more convenient than just high heels.  This sole also visually ‚Äústretches‚Äù the legs and growth in general, but does not additionally load the lift or calf muscles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxstarstore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Platform in sneakers" class="if uuid-2900224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2900224.jpg"></div><ul><li>  As soon as such a shocking new product as the platform in sneakers appeared on the catwalks, it instantly won the hearts of real fashionistas. </li></ul>
