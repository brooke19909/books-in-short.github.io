  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best speakers: reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A home theater along with an amplifier cannot be imagined without an intelligent speaker system.  Today's market offers a huge assortment of equipment of this kind, ranging from simple speakers to high-quality Hi-End equipment.  The first include portable speakers and shelving, which, as a rule, are budget solutions, and the second - exclusively floor and expensive brands. </p><p>  Which class, and from which segment to choose models, depends on you, your preferences and capabilities.  We will try to identify some of the <span>best speakers of</span> different levels, distinguished by their quality component and the mass of positive feedback from users. </p><h2>  Heco Victa Prime 602 </h2><p>  This is a floor system from a famous German brand.  Here, the designers adopted an interesting and bold decision, where equal to 120 mm speakers are responsible for low and medium frequencies.  While for high frequencies, classic inch tweeters are responsible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reprosoustavy-reproduktory.heureka.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustic systems" class="if uuid-2285307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285307.jpg"></div><p>  The result is <span>an active speaker system</span> with excellent sensitivity.  This solution makes it easy to cope even with the most exotic sound nuances.  But there is one unpleasant moment in such a design.  Judging by the reviews on the speaker system, the only ones who are unhappy with the sound of the speakers are lovers of ultra-low synthetic bass.  In this case, fans of such music will have to separately purchase a subwoofer, because the front is intended primarily for natural sound. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Acoustics Features </h2><p>  A good peak power of 280 watts, together with a nominal power of 160 watts, can also be written in obvious pluses.  In addition, the capabilities of this <span>speaker system for the home</span> allow you to fully separate instrumental parts, without reducing the sound to cacophony. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heco-audio.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="German acoustics" class="if uuid-2285310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285310.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  good sound quality at the output; </li><li>  explicit separation of instrumental parts; </li><li>  work in three bands; </li><li>  classic and universal appearance. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  too restrained bass (it is better to immediately get a subwoofer). </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 29,000 rubles. </p><h2>  DALI Zensor 5 </h2><p>  This floor <span>speaker system is</span> positioned by the manufacturer as a budget.  But looking at the dollar exchange rate and the wages of the domestic consumer, you cannot call it that in any way.  Despite the rather high price, the speakers turned out to be really high-quality and worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dali-speakers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best acoustics" class="if uuid-2285311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285311.jpg"></div><p>  The sound is adequately maintained at its peak due to sensible paper diffusers on two medium basses with a diameter of 133 mm.  Judging by the reviews, some users have noted a slight decline in detail at a low volume, but without any critical subsidence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Experts advise you to immediately put a complete fabric grill.  This will allow you to slightly muffle the high frequencies and fully reveal the capabilities of the speaker system.  Users have no complaints about the assembly or exotic sound modes, so the model can be called successful and justifying its high cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vickershifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose acoustics" class="if uuid-2285306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285306.jpg"></div><p>  Advantages of the system: </p><ul><li>  very good volume margin; </li><li>  superior build quality; </li><li>  dense sound and a clear separation of instrumental parts; </li><li>  nice appearance. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the high frequencies seem bullied when the grill is removed; </li><li>  88 dB sensitivity (mediocre detail at a very low volume). </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 46 000 rubles. </p><h2>  KRK ROKIT 5 G3 </h2><p>  This is a bass reflex type acoustic system that beats 100% of the finances invested in it.  The sound power reaches 50 watts, which is enough for a shelf and freestanding speaker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.famasom.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shelf acoustics" class="if uuid-2285309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285309.jpg"></div><p>  The front panel of the system is made of high-quality MDF material, and the bright yellow contrast adds personality and originality to the column.  Judging by the reviews, some users did not appreciate such a design solution, but they are in the vast majority. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the system </h2><p>  The column calmly produces a pressure of 106 dB, and the sound does not merge into a cacophony even at maximum volume.  Proper tuning will allow you to calmly distinguish between individual instrumental parts, which is a significant plus for technology in this segment.  Naturally, the domestic consumer was especially pleased with the price tag for the model. </p><p>  Advantages of the system: </p><ul><li>  good power; </li><li>  reliable design along with quality assembly; </li><li>  deep and clear bass; </li><li>  small dimensions; </li><li>  more than adequate price for the available characteristics. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  some did not like the design. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 14,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Yamaha NS-777 </h2><p>  This is a three-way floor system from a famous brand.  One of the main distinguishing features of the speakers is the presence of built-in subwoofers, that is, there is no need to buy it separately: two 200-mm speakers quite manage the bass. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hifi-review.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustic Yamaha" class="if uuid-2285308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2285308.jpg"></div><p>  The mid-range speaker is responsible for 127 mm, and the high ones are given to a tweeter with a traditional diameter of 25 mm.  In addition, the user has the opportunity to connect each lane separately and biamping here works as it should, especially if you want to squeeze the most out of the speakers.  And the likelihood of burning a tweeter in this case is much less. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, this system is perfect for working with home theaters.  But the meticulous music lovers are not quite satisfied with the available opportunities.  The characteristics of medium and high frequencies here are far from ideal, although they are considered optimal.  Some achieve the desired effect with deep adjustments, and someone treats this lack with biamping, so this moment is difficult to write down in critical shortcomings, especially since the price tag clearly does not contribute to this. </p><p>  Pros of acoustics: </p><ul><li>  Full 2.0 format is possible if there is no need for a subwoofer; </li><li>  Ideal for home cinema </li><li>  sensible biamping support; </li><li>  Stylish and modern speaker design. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Music lovers who are picky for high and medium frequencies may not like the sound of individual musical directions. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 45 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Summing up </h2><p>  Choosing a speaker system, it is not superfluous to adhere to some simple rules.  First, never listen to the speakers in the store - this is a futile exercise.  A winning sound in one place may be reversed in another.  It‚Äôs better to go over the equipment specification once again. </p><p>  Secondly, pay special attention to the amplitude-frequency characteristics (AFC).  This is one of the most important indicators of system quality.  Mediocre acoustics overwhelms the frequencies and in most cases they cannot be fixed with any equalizer.  Ideal lines for almost every model from a famous brand are indicated in specialized magazines or in specialized forums. </p><p>  Well, and thirdly, it is power.  Everything is simple here.  This indicator should be higher than the power of the amplifier, otherwise twisting the volume to full, you will get cacophony and instrumental porridge. </p>
