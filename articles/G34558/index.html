But the city is famous not only for this.  The many attractions of Mozhga attract tourists.  The city has monuments, museums and other interesting places.  It is about them that will be discussed in our article. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.4380444" data-lng="52.21166019999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/7/3/4/10734.png"></div><h2>  Museum of Local History </h2><p>  Among the sights of Mozhga it is worth paying attention to the Museum of History and Local Lore, within the walls of which are stored rich collections related to such sciences as ethnography, paleontology, archeology and history.  It is the cultural center of the city.  It holds scientific and historical events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Mozhgi photo" class="if uuid-2924290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924290.jpg"></div><p>  The museum had to go a long way to get such a high status.  It was opened in 1936, and in 1941 it was closed, since all funds were lost.  It was reopened only in 1979.  The museum exhibited works by local artists.  Scientists with the help of local watchmen gradually gathered a lot of information about the history of the region.  The institution received its current status in 2011. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alarm bell </h2><p>  Another attraction of Mozhga is the Nabat Memorial Museum.  It was opened within the walls of school number 2. Initially, the institution was called "Buchenwald Nabat", because its exposition consisted of materials on the history of the Nazi concentration camp.  The museum was considered a school museum, but since 1983 it has turned into the national museum of the Udmurt Republic, and later it became a municipal one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.culture.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mozhga landmarks" class="if uuid-2924297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924297.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, not only information about Buchenwald is presented in its walls, but also information about local residents who took an active part in the Great Patriotic War, about military units, about the besieged Leningrad and famous pilots.  Within the walls of the museum, there is the Club Front Friends, which once included 42 people.  But at present there is only one front-line worker left. </p><h2>  Saburov Museum </h2><p>  The Saburov Museum is another attraction of Mozhga.  The institution was opened in 1966 at the initiative of a local teacher of Russian literature and the language of Chizhova, who, together with her students, decided to collect materials about the defenders of the Brest Fortress.  To do this, the children had to find the addresses of the heroes in the passport office and correspond with them.  So the information was collected, which formed the basis of the exposition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum also collected information about children of the women of Udmurtia, awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  In 1981, the institution was given the status of the People's Museum. </p><h2>  Monument "Airplane" </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Mozhga (some of the photos are given in the article) include the monument ‚ÄúAirplane‚Äù, erected in August 2014 in honor of the 115th anniversary of the hero of the Great Patriotic War F. Ya. Faleev, an air marshal from Mozhga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dostoprimechatelnosti-m.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mozhga hometown project" class="if uuid-2924316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924316.jpg"></div><p>  The monument is installed on the street of the same name and is an arrow with a training aircraft L-29 installed on it. </p><h2>  WWII Memorial </h2><p>  The memorial is a significant attraction of the city of Mozhga.  It was installed after the reburial of the bodies of soldiers in 1965.  The monument is made in the form of a figure of an unknown soldier with his head bowed.  This type of monument was not chosen by chance.  The bowed head of a soldier symbolizes respect and admiration for the dead heroes. </p><p>  In the decoration of the monument were used granite slabs on which the names of the dead soldiers were carved.  Here is the eternal flame.  In 2001, the T-34 tank and the D-20 cannon were added to the memorial. </p><h2>  Monument to people who died in local conflicts </h2><p>  The sights of the city of Mozhga in Udmurtia include a monument to those killed in local conflicts.  It is a red granite stone mounted on a pedestal.  Around it rises a fence of shells.  This complex is dedicated to soldiers who died in Chechnya and Afghanistan.  It was opened in 1998, and later a combat vehicle was added to it.  Now the monument is the main venue for celebrations dedicated to the Navy and Airborne. </p><h2>  Church of St. Michael the Archangel </h2><p>  What sights are there in Mozhga?  Temple admirers should pay attention to the church of St. Michael.  There is a church in a village near the city.  The first temple at this place was opened in 1861, it was made of wood.  It was originally named after St. Basil the Great.  In 1902, a new one was built of stone on the site of the old church. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ros-spravka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the city of Mozhga Udmurtia" class="if uuid-2924323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924323.jpg"></div><p>  The new temple was built over five years.  In 1909, the church was renamed.  Since then, she bears the name of the Archangel Michael.  The temple still works and did not close even in the most difficult periods. </p><h2>  Church of the Wonderworker Nicholas </h2><p>  The church of St. Nicholas and the miracle worker is relatively young.  It began to be built in 2001.  Two years later, the construction of the church was completed.  Funds for the construction of the temple were raised among city enterprises and parishioners.  Church service began in 2005.  And in 2007, the temple received a new name.  Since then, he bears the name of St. Nicholas. </p><h2>  Temple of the Icon of the Mother of God </h2><p>  All believers should definitely visit the temple of the Icon of the Mother of God of Kazan.  It was opened in 1751, but received its name only in 1754 after it was consecrated by Metropolitan of Kazan Luke. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.temples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What sights are there in Mozhga?" class="if uuid-2924329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924329.jpg"></div><p>  The first building was made of wood.  But in 1816 the reconstruction of the temple began, which lasted as long as 46 years.  The new building was built of stone.  Since then, the temple has never been closed and is open to parishioners to this day. </p><h2>  Cultural and Sports Center </h2><p>  Currently, the region pays close attention to the study of the history of the region, in connection with which new projects are being introduced.  The sights of the native city of Mozhga include not only memorials, temples and monuments, but also a cultural and health center, which is a favorite vacation spot for guests and residents.  The complex is considered the main venue for national competitions and city holidays.  Near the center building there is a park in which there are attractions, a dance, volleyball, basketball, hockey and children's playgrounds.  But the real pride of the complex is the modern stadium, which has a synthetic coating on treadmills, and a football field equipped with all the technical equipment.  The center has created the best conditions for playing sports. </p><h2>  Modern monuments </h2><p>  In 2017, a new monument dedicated to the Mozhgins sailors who served in the Russian Navy appeared in the city.  And in 2012, a monument to the lineup was opened near the Krasnaya Zvezda woodworking enterprise.  It is made in the form of a hemisphere of the globe, near which there is a two-meter ruler and a square. </p><p>  In addition to traditional Orthodox churches, Mozhga has a mosque.  It was built in 1988-1992.  Funds for the construction were raised by the parishioners themselves.  The mosque is working and sow the day.  She is able to accept up to 400 parishioners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.izh.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What sights are there in Mozhga?" class="if uuid-2924335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2924335.jpg"></div><p>  The enterprise "Red Star" is the oldest in the city.  It produces all kinds of goods for children and adults from wood.  Previously, pencil cases were made here, developing toys, cribs and other wooden things.  Not so long ago, the company opened a new line for the production of modern playgrounds for children. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  In general, Mozhga is an interesting city in which there are sights and interesting places.
