    <p>  <strong>Mallorca History</strong> </p><p>  The island is inhabited by people from the Paleolithic era and for many years has been a strategic point controlled by Carthage.  After his defeat, these beautiful places became the base of pirates, and in 123 BC they were conquered by the Roman troops, which gave rise to an era of prosperity.  After the <span>fall of the Roman Empire, the</span> island was included in the kingdom of Vandals, and then Byzantium, which brought Christianity with it, but did not save such beautiful lands, which were soon captured by the Cordoban caliphate.  And only in 1229, Mallorca (Spain), freed from Muslim oppression, was annexed to the <span>kingdom of Aragon</span> and included in the autonomous region of Spain.  Until the 50s of the last century, it was considered a <span>Spanish province,</span> until the invasion of tourists began.  The tourist boom has transformed this paradise into a popular Mediterranean resort offering both democratic and luxurious vacations.  Spain (Mallorca) is considered a true paradise. </p>
