Many are interested in the question: are there methods and ways of playing a game that guarantee a 100% win?  In the proposed article, we will try to answer it. </p><h2>  On the history of the origin of backgammon </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Google Art Project, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backgammon - an ancient game" class="if uuid-3105658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125234/3105658.jpg"></div><p>  This game is one of the oldest in the world, which appeared in the east.  It is known that in the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun was found a likeness of this fun.  According to many historians, an interesting and entertaining entertainment - backgammon - is older than chess.  Their modern varieties have a fundamental resemblance to their distant ancestors.  The board is divided into four equal and identical parts, symbolizing the four seasons. </p><p>  Twelve cells for chips on one side are twelve months of the year.  There are 24 cells for chips in total - the number of hours in a day.  The location of the points on the bones is in strict order, their sum on opposite sides is 7: 1-6;  2-5;  3-4.  There are 15 pieces of chips of one color, the same number of other, dice - 2 pieces. </p><p>  In our century of the latest information technologies, when you can play backgammon with a person located almost anywhere in the world with the click of a mouse, however, nothing can replace live communication with an opponent on a wooden board. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Game types </h2><p>  There are two types of backgammon - short and long.  In Russia, long ones were widely used, and it will be discussed about them in the article.  The short game has many nuances and differences, determined primarily by geographical and national characteristics. </p><h2>  Secrets of Victory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.stockfreeimages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lady Fortune" class="if uuid-3111738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125234/3111738.jpg"></div><p>  Is guaranteed win in this fun possible?  Are there any secrets to win backgammon?  The winner is the player who managed to get all the chips into his "house" and the first to remove them from the board. </p><p>  The first move is very important: as the game practice shows, the right to it is in a better position than his opponent: his chances of winning will be at least 60% to 40% of the opponent.  The right to the first move is played by throwing the dice - whoever has the most points, the first to start the game.  Moreover, the drawing of the first move is done either before the start of each game, or the winner of the previous game begins.  It depends on the pre-agreed conditions established in a particular company.  The most interesting and exciting thing is to play three or four - “on the fly.” </p><p>  We continue to share the secrets of how to win backgammon.  The task of each participant is to capture enemy cells with his chips as quickly as possible and at the same time close the cells in his field (where there is still a string of your chips).  It is most rational to do this as follows: we remove the fewer points from the “head”, and attack the opponent’s field with more points.  But it should be borne in mind that your five or six cells are preferable to be occupied with your chips. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is advisable to start figures in your “house” from several positions, this will expand the possibilities of entering your chips at the final destination.  And do not rush to expose the “head”, that is, the place of the initial accumulation of chips, because these cells have important strategic importance. </p><p>  Often a situation arises when two or three or more of your chips remain almost completely isolated from the main part.  In this case, it is necessary to place them at a far distance from their nearest chip, that is, at the distance of a five- or six-point throw.  This will be another clue how to win backgammon. </p><h2>  Types of victory in the long backgammon </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to win backgammon long" class="if uuid-3111827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125234/3111827.jpg"></div><p>  Winnings in this variety of fun distinguish three types: </p><ul><li>  usual: advancing an opponent by several moves in throwing his chips; </li><li>  “Mars”: the opponent was able to bring his pieces only from the side of the board where they were originally located, to the next half, but could not get them into his “house”; </li><li>  “Coke”: some of your opponent’s chips remained locked on the first half of the board. </li></ul><p>  Individual players distinguish another type of victory - “home Mars”, when the opponent brought all the chips into his “house”, but did not manage to throw a single one (this is the most annoying loss). </p><p>  Here lies one more little trick how to win backgammon, and not just win, but qualitatively - to “Mars”.  In a situation where the opponent’s pieces gathered in the very extreme corner and can only get them out of there when the “six” falls out, you should load the “five” more so as not to open free cells ahead of time to advance the opponent’s chips. </p><p>  This is especially important when you consider that backgammon is a gambling entertainment and many compete in it for money.  Suppose that each of the players is betting ten rubles.  If the victory is ordinary, the winner will get this amount (10 rubles), and if it is “Mars”, then the loser should pay twenty rubles, and if “coke”, then thirty. </p><h2>  Backgammon - a game of chance or skill? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yesofcorsa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backgammon - luck or accurate calculation?" class="if uuid-3111884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/125234/3111884.jpg"></div><p>  Now that you’ve got an idea of ​​how to win long backgammon, you can speculate on the topic: are there any ways or methods in the fun that guarantee a 100% victory?  What is more in backgammon - luck and luck or skill and logic?  This is exactly what makes this game interesting, exciting, exciting and unpredictable at the same time.  Here, often a clearly losing or clearly winning situation due to accidental bone loss can dramatically change: 50% for success and the same for losing. </p><p>  There is no absolute victory in this fun, nor is there a way to always win backgammon.  That is why firms specializing in betting on the outcome of football matches or a tote on horse racing, where a clear favorite can lose to a notorious outsider, are thriving.  Blind adherence to dogmas and established laws is not one hundred percent success and victory.  Only constant analysis and control of the evolving and constantly changing situation can lead you in backgammon to the desired result. </p>
