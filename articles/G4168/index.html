There is an opinion among people that all smartphones that run under Windows Phone 8 have pretty good performance and hardware features and work smartly at their cost.  Let's check the veracity of these statements, based on what ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 525‚Äù reviews received regarding each important part of the smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The very first thing that users determine the practicality of a smartphone is its technical characteristics.

The quality of the print on it is not in doubt.  Opening the boxes, you can see the phone itself, the battery, which is lying separately, a charger, a cable for charging and synchronizing with a computer, a standard stereo headset and a set of documentation (manual and 12-month warranty).  This is all that you will see in the box, having bought the Nokia Lumiya 525 phone.  Feedback from users about the quality is only good.  Even the headphones here have great sound. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  As for the <span>appearance of the</span> Nokia Lumia 525 smartphone, here the developers did not bother much.  It is already very noticeable that he completely repeats his predecessor - the 520 model.  They even have the same size and weight.  But unlike the ‚Äúold man‚Äù, the new ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù has glossy interchangeable panels with bright colors inherent to the line, and here you can change the battery yourself. </p><p>  The back panel in the smartphone is designed to capture ribs.  This visually creates the effect of solidity of the case.  The assembly itself is very good, however, like all ‚ÄúFinns‚Äù.  There are no backlashes, and this is taking into account the fact that the back cover is quite easy to remove. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Considering the "Nokia Lumiya 525" reviews, I would like to pay a little attention to interchangeable rear panels.  Unfortunately, the company decided to sell them separately, and they are not included in the package.  But still, the opportunity to change the look of the phone to suit your mood is very pleasing. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Looking at the display of a smartphone, you will immediately realize that the manufacturer decided not to save on it.  This is a high-quality four-inch <span>IPS matrix</span> that does not fade in the sun and has maximum viewing angles without glare. </p><p>  Smartphone "Nokia Lumiya 525" received good reviews about the sensor.  The company also decided not to save on it.  The gadget responds to the slightest touch with high accuracy, and the ability to control the device with gloves guarantees convenience in the winter.  In addition, I would like to note the sensitivity of the device to fingernail touches.  Oh, this greatly pleased the ladies with a chic manicure. </p><h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  The smartphone uses a dual-core processor having a working purity of 1 GHz.  I was very pleased with the possibility of asynchronous operation of the cores.  This technology allows you to smoothly control energy consumption and in the case of processing a small amount of information can save a significant battery charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the request of users, the predecessor in the 525 model, the manufacturer used 1 GB of RAM.  This has a positive effect on the ability to work with large games and applications.  Additionally, the overall performance of the device has increased. </p><p>  The amount of internal memory is 8 GB.  This is enough to store photos, audio and space, even enough for a couple of films.  Naturally, if you actively use a smartphone, then there is not enough memory.  For this, it is possible to expand it with a flash drive up to 64 GB. </p><p>  In general, the ‚ÄúNokia Lumiya 525‚Äù received good reviews from users about the performance.  The fact is that this value of this smartphone is higher than that of the 520 model, but they practically do not differ in cost. </p><h2>  OS and embedded applications </h2><p>  So we got to the highlight of the smartphone Nokia Lumia 525 - the operating system.  Many see this as a big minus due to their unpopularity and prefer the ‚Äúpop‚Äù OS Android.  And in vain, because WP8, judging by the feedback from users, is much more stable and more convenient to use. </p><p>  WP8 OS in Lumia 525 received a special update called Lumia Black.  It uses the same kernel as the popular Windows PC.  Due to this, all applications work quickly and stably, and <span>surfing the Internet</span> brings only pleasure. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the interface, then users note its identity in all smartphones of this manufacturer.  On the lock screen, a set of notifications can be adjusted by the user himself.  Unlocking the screen, you can see the traditional WP desktop with tiles.  They can be easily resized.  Additionally, users note the presence of a large number of color schemes, which is not typical for state employees, and this is rarely seen in standard firmware. </p><p>  The store provides a thorough check of all applications for the "Nokia Lumiya 525".  Customer reviews about getting malware into the smartphone are not found, as the company‚Äôs security is top-notch. </p><p>  Very pleased users with the presence of the application called "Nokia Mix Radio".  Essentially, this is a redesigned Nokia Music utility.  The application is a player that, in addition to already downloaded audio recordings, can select licensed music from the store based on them.  Thus, the user forms his own tracklist. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like spending money, the company has provided special ‚Äúmixes‚Äù from the most famous singers and musicians around the world.  The range of styles is amazing.  Here you can find collections for relaxation, running, playing sports, recreation, entertainment, etc. </p><p>  The Nokia Mix Radio app in Nokia Lumia 525 received owner reviews for the following innovations: </p><ul><li>  well-designed colorful interface; </li><li>  the ability to like a favorite track; </li><li>  selection of ‚Äúmixes‚Äù in accordance with the musical tastes of the owner; </li><li>  the opportunity to tell friends about your favorite track on social networks. </li></ul><p>  The users were somewhat upset by the conditional free application.  In this version, you can rewind a track only six times and store a certain number of tracks.  But for those who will pay a small monthly fee, these restrictions are removed. </p>

    <p>  The navigator in the smartphone has remained unchanged.  It works flawlessly.  Often users use the Lumia 525 precisely as a navigation device, putting off gadgets specially designed for this purpose. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera at the <span>Nokia Lumia 525</span> received relatively good <span>reviews</span> .  She has one here - the rear.  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã5 megapixels.  But it can surpass other state employees by the quality of the photo under normal lighting.  Still very pleased users with the ability to record video in HD-quality. </p><p>  Unfortunately, even in the presence of autofocus, the absence of a flash affects.  As soon as the lighting becomes insufficient, a digital ‚Äúnoise‚Äù begins to appear on the photo. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Nokia Lumia 525 smartphone has a removable 1430 mAh battery.  Users note its "survivability".  This is achieved through the use of "smart processor".  So, in standby mode, the smartphone can easily work up to 14 days without recharging.  The most active use in offline mode is guaranteed for 8 hours.  As for the state employee, these figures are very high. </p><h2>  General reviews and cost of a smartphone </h2><p>  Let's summarize all of the above based on the reviews received by the Nokia Lumiya 525 smartphone.  The price of the gadget is within the budget lines, but is it?  So, with regard to performance, here all the owners unanimously speak positively about the smartphone.  And this is understandable, because the developers paid attention to the wishes for the 520 model and eliminated all the shortcomings in the 525. The sensor and display are simply excellent.  Users were pleased with the ability to control the gadget with gloves, a stylus and a fingernail.  As for the software, here everything is a little taut.  I would really like to have more games and applications in the store.  The camera, although not of the highest quality, is excellent for the budget cost of a smartphone. </p>

    <p>  Based on these reviews, you can declare the independent cost of Nokia Lumia 525, and it should exceed the average by about $ 20-30 minimum.  Those.  smartphone pulls all $ 150 unconditionally.  Here we find another huge plus - a rather low price. </p>
