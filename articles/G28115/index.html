    <h2>  Beach and sea vacations </h2><p>  Why do people usually go to Magna Graecia Hotel 4 *?  Corfu is, as already mentioned, a popular seaside resort.  Therefore, a beach holiday here is the main goal of tourists.  You can choose whether to sunbathe by the pool or take sea baths.  There is a special terrace for sunbathing.  There are two basins.  And to relax on the sea you need to go down to the beach (although you have to go back uphill, but it is good for the body).  The coast has a <span>blue flag,</span> and although it is pebble, it has an English lawn where it is convenient to lie.  In the sea itself, the bottom is sandy.  The beach strip is somewhat narrow, but olives and palm trees grow on it, which creates a natural shadow.  The sea is unusually clear.  The beach does not belong to this hotel, so sun loungers are paid here.  But only before dinner, then you can not pay for them.  <span>Beach towels</span> are provided for deposit.  Fans of comparing different coasts are attracted to nearby bathing spots.  For example, Ipsos with its diving, night clubs and stunning views of Mount Pantokrator.  And a few kilometers from here is the beautiful Aqualand water park. </p><h2>  What to look around </h2><p>  In Magna Graecia 4 * guides organize various excursions.  Of course, first of all, these are boat trips: barbecue, panoramic around Corfu and a visit to neighboring islands.  Tourists are happy with them.  Corfu is called an exceptionally beautiful green island, which the scorched Rhodes and Crete cannot compare with.  And indeed, the local orange, cypress and lemon groves make the rest completely unique.  Magna Graecia Hotel 4 (Corfu) also organizes long-distance travel.  From distant excursions, the famous Meteors on the mainland are recommended, although it takes four hours to get there (by ferry and bus).  And for the whole day you can go with a guide to Albania.  Inexpensive car rental at the hotel allows you to independently visit all the attractions of the island much cheaper.  If there is no driver’s license, but you want to see something interesting, but on a budget, it is recommended to go to Kerkyra by bus.  There you can walk, admire the city, sit in a tavern and have a good time.  Fortresses, shopping streets, elegant buildings of Venetian times will appeal to anyone.  Nearby are Paleokastritsa, Sidari and other pearls of the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corfu Magna graecia hotel 4" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442110.jpg" width="500"></div>
