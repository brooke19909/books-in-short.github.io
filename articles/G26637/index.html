Of particular interest in the last two centuries is the energy of the sun.  As scientists calculated, the sun only needs three days to produce the amount of energy consumed by the entire planet during the year.  Most importantly, no one needs to pay for this energy. </p><p>  By installing on the roof of the building or on one of its walls <noindex>  <span>solar panels for home</span> </noindex>  , you can not worry about the quality of energy, and about the integrity of the family budget. <br><br>  Alternative Energy Benefits <br><br>  1. Free electricity (you only need to invest in the purchase of equipment). <br><br>  2. The long period of operation (more than 2 decades). <br><br>  3. Lack of regular service (only in winter, solar panels need to be cleared of snow). <br><br>  4. Uninterrupted power supply. <br><br>  5. Environmental cleanliness of alternative energy source. <br><br>  To be honest with readers, let's say a few words about the shortcomings.  This is a long payback period (on average about 2 years), weather dependence and inability to provide energy to those devices whose power is high.  As for the long payback period, it is more than compensated by long-term operation.  Special rechargeable batteries will allow you to protect yourself from the vagaries of nature, able to accumulate in yourself the energy that solar panels produced for the home, and which turned out to be unspent during the day.  On days when there is no sun in the sky, as well as at night, energy can be supplied by the energy stored in the batteries. <br><br>  In which cases it is worth resorting to alternative energy <br><br>  - if the central power supply network is not connected to the building; <br><br>  - if the power supply is strictly limited; <br><br>  - if the cost of electricity supplied is unreasonably high; <br><br>  - if there is a need for uninterrupted power supply. <br><br>  Yes, solar panels cannot be called a budget purchase.  Their cost is quite high, but the benefits are impressive.  While the neighbors will lament over the failure of electrical equipment due to a thunderstorm, nothing like this will happen in your home.  Natural disasters, the human factor, or the total blackout of electric energy are not terrible for a solar power plant.  As long as there is sun, there will be energy, which means that it is light and comfortable in your home! </p></div></article>
