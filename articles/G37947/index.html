In total, 12 types of leaflets were issued, which came out in a circulation of 600 thousand copies.

    <p>  I can‚Äôt believe how such a young man (he was only 26 years old) was able to withstand the torture to which he was subjected by the Nazis and not to extradite his comrades.  This is a great example of courage and fortitude, so his achievement will never be forgotten. </p>
