Extra beds are even provided for them.  And free of charge if guests come with one child whose age does not reach two years.  If he is less than 12, then you will not have to pay for accommodation either.  Only the child will have to sleep in the beds available in the room.  Additional will not provide. </p><p>  And further.  The hotel is non-smoking.  There are specially designated places for this.  The administration of the complex warns - if the guest does not comply with the rules regarding smoking, he will be fined. </p>

And it is positioned as a business hotel.  On the territory of the complex, as was mentioned at the beginning, there are several halls for events and conferences, so often many well-known companies, organizations and corporations rent them for this.  And a certain part of the guests are people who came not on vacation, but on a business trip. </p><p>  However, everyone is satisfied.  The rooms are all well furnished, very beautiful, cozy, comfortable.  People who were cold at first are surprised at the lack of batteries, but by turning on the air conditioner in heating mode, they quickly warm up - it is really very powerful.  Some say that even the balcony had to be opened in order to ‚Äúcool‚Äù the room a bit. </p><p>  Another apartment is pleased with the presence of a coffee machine with a set of tea and coffee.  Moreover, many say that it is free, although the price is indicated in the price list.  The bathroom has everything for hygiene - soap, shampoo, body lotion and hair conditioner.  And, as many claim, these funds are not cheap, as is the case in many hotels.  And the insulation in the apartment is really good.  Despite the fact that the port is literally 500 meters from the windows of the rooms, the noise of steamboats and ferries is not heard. </p><p>  More guests note the local cuisine.  The hotel restaurants really cook well and tasty.  Breakfast includes omelettes, sausages, eggs, cold cuts, homemade cheeses, yogurts, national sweets, preserves, dried fruits, nuts, good coffee and freshly squeezed juices.  In general, there is a gastronomic variety.  And people who had a rest in winter say that drinks and cocktails in hotel bars are cheaper than in institutions located in the city center. </p><p>  In general, as you can see, this hotel has an excellent reputation and all the conditions necessary for a comfortable stay and relaxation.  No wonder people book rooms at Aquila Atlantis long before their arrival. </p>
