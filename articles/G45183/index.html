    <p>  "Bank in your pocket" from the Russian standard is a completely new product, which has already been highly appreciated by many customers of the company.  Having issued a card, a consumer will be able to use a huge range of services.  First of all, the card will be convenient for shopping.  Using it, the client of the Russian Standard will receive rather high interest on the balance of funds.  Card "Bank in your pocket" is issued in the offices and offices of the Russian standard.  This is a convenient and compact financial instrument with which you can transfer funds to any accounts, pay for Internet and phone, and also make purchases at any time.  To visit the office for this is not necessary. </p><p>  Many got the opportunity to use the Bank in your Pocket card.  Reviews about the new product of the Russian Standard are very controversial.  One part of consumers responds positively about the card, and sensibly evaluates this financial instrument.  Other <span>customers of the bank are</span> panicky afraid of such an innovation, suspecting that under favorable conditions there is some kind of trick.  The fear that another fraud will be presented to people under a favorable guise is high.  Some members of the public even recommend cutting the Bank in your pocket card.  Reviews of this kind cause smiles of people who are more likely to look at the latest in <span>banking.</span>  To avoid mistakes when using any credit card, you must read the terms of the contract.  Yes, most of these guides are written in small print and in dry legal language.  But reading such instructions is necessary. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The action of the card is somewhat similar to another product of the Russian standard - the "Postcard".  Terms of use are similar, only it has a restriction on the withdrawal of funds.  Both financial instruments have a number of similar characteristics.  In addition to the fact that the client receives 10% of the balance, he can also count on getting a loan without visiting the bank‚Äôs offices.  Money will be transferred if approved to the Bank in your pocket card.  Reviews on loans of this kind are almost never found.  After all, the card itself appeared relatively recently, so most consumers have not yet been able to fully evaluate its functionality. </p><p>  There are three options for the Bank in your Pocket service: regular, gold and platinum.  The last two cards use premium service.  All three types of cards are covered by the Internet banking service, as well as the mobile bank.  This means that the client can transfer funds not only through the Internet, but also through a mobile phone.  In a number of stores, Bank in your pocket holders can get attractive discounts.  For example, in those outlets that support the program "Discount Club", they can reach 30 percent.  The advantage of transfers from the Russian standard card is that no fees are charged to the client. </p><p>  These are the attractive conditions that Bank in your pocket offers.  Reviews of some particularly cautious customers warn of pitfalls that are hidden under all these enticing promises of the Russian standard.  Realistic persons at the same time believe that the bank can simply introduce tariffs on transfers or a mobile service after a while.  However, so far, customers have the opportunity to evaluate the usability of such a tool. </p><p>  Today, you can use the service as a funded tool.  Indeed, not every bank can offer its customers a deposit at ten percent per annum.  The same conditions can be obtained by the "Post Card".  True, at first it‚Äôs better to nevertheless read in detail all the terms of the contract, so that later there will be no unpleasant surprises. </p>
