    <p>  The 152th region of Russia has a rich history.  Under Peter I in 1708, during the local reform, Nizhny Novgorod was included in the Kazan province.  Already in 1714, the Nizhny Novgorod province was separated from the structure of Kazan, but soon (in 1717) it was abolished.  Already in 1719, the Second Petrine Reform recreated again the Nizhny Novgorod province.  Its structure included three provinces: Arzamas, Alatyr and Nizhny Novgorod, as well as seven cities. </p><p>  Under Catherine II in 1779, Nizhny Novgorod governorship was created in Russia.  It included the Nizhny Novgorod province, part of Kazan, as well as parts of the Vladimir and Ryazan governorates, which were formed earlier. </p><p>  In 1797, under Paul I, the size of the province was significantly increased.  This happened due to the annexation of territories that were separated from the Penza province.  But already in 1801, the Penza province was restored to its former volume.  In 1865, as a result of the Zemstvo reform in the Nizhny Novgorod province, a zemstvo was introduced - local self-government. </p><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod province after 1917 </h2><p>  After the revolution, the current region 152 <strong> </strong>  (Nizhny Novgorod region) has undergone significant territorial changes.  The structure of the province in 1922 included Vetluzhsky and Varnavinsky districts, previously belonging to the Kostroma province, 6 volosts from Koverninsky district, 4 volosts of the Tambov province, Kurmysh district.  Nizhny Novgorod province has grown by almost half.  In 1924, some changes took place again, the territory began to include 4 districts - Sormovsky, Rastyapinsky, Balakhninsky and Kanavinsky, as well as 11 counties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
