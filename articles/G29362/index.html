    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The foundation time of the village of Chagan-Uzun (see photo below) is considered to be 1801. Initially, the settlement was located on the banks of the Uytu-Terek River on the very edge of the Chui steppe.  It was founded by Russian merchants who traded with the Chuiski fortresses, as well as Chinese and Mongolian merchants.  A little later, several Altai families settled on the left bank of Chui. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At its current location, the village of Chagan-Uzun began to be built up already during the years of Soviet power.  Previously, this territory was occupied by a dense forest, the trees of which went to the construction of houses. </p><p>  A horse trail ran along the right bank of Chui.  In some places, it was expanded by merchants or troops of all peoples and tribes, who advanced deep into Altai along the Chuy valley. </p><p>  Later, according to the project V.Ya.  Shishkova, the horse trail became the basis of the famous tract, which had a huge impact on the development of the village.  Three kilometers from Chagan-Uzun, the village of Moshtu-Dzharyk was built, in which road builders lived. </p><p>  The village was located so conveniently that in the prewar years it attracted the attention of geologists.  Not far from him, they pitched their base, calling it Red Hill.  From here, geologists could easily go on foot or on horseback to a huge forest, as well as the territory of Upper Chui, which was little explored in those days. </p><p>  The life of the village of Chagan-Uzun did not stop bubbling during the years of the war against fascism.  Not far from it was built the village of Moshtu Airy, designed for miners of mercury. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance version </h2><p>  The formation of colored mountains of Altai occurred in places of large concentrations of sandstone and mineral deposits.  It happened millions of years ago.  Further, atmospheric precipitation and air took up the matter.  Under their influence, these deposits were oxidized, which caused the formation of a mountain range of such an unusual color.  In addition, for many centuries, soils have been subject to erosion.  In this case, colored clay was applied layer by layer to the soil.  She interacted with the soil, which led to the appearance of original forms resembling waves in their appearance.  Now they are clearly visible on every slope. </p><p>  Scientists believe that these mountains were formed in the Mesozoic period.  Thus, they must store a huge number of fossils of ancient reptiles and animals. </p><p>  Tourists note unusual sensations when moving around this area.  First of all, the idea comes to mind that you are on the surface of the planet Mars, which is so attractive for the study of earthlings. </p><h2>  Kuehtonar melting furnaces </h2><p>  7.3 km from the village of Chagan-Uzun is another attraction of the area.  These are ancient melting furnaces located not far from the small Kuehtonar rivulet, the name of which translates as ‚Äútie up armor, attach armor‚Äù.  All this testifies to the development of iron production in the old days near the village of Chagan-Uzun.  And, most likely, it was associated with the manufacture of armor, shells, which were widely used in the Middle Ages by Turkic warriors.  On the soil near the furnaces there are still a large number of pieces of ore and slag. </p><p>  All surviving domnica, most likely, was erected in one period.  According to experts, they could work simultaneously, which suggests the presence in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãa large iron smelting center, which is most likely built in the second half of the first millennium AD or at the beginning of the second.  Small pieces of galena near the stoves indicate that with their help they smelted not only iron, but also bronze. </p><h2>  Altar </h2><p>  Among the attractions of Chagan-Uzun (Altai Mountains) is one interesting archaeological site.  This is the altar, which is located behind the village of Ortolyk.  You can get to it from Chagan-Uzun by covering a distance of 15.7 km. </p>

It started from the current region, where the village of Chagan-Uzun is located, passed through the settlements of Aktash and Kurai, followed through the upper river.  Kadrin on the territory of the villages of Maima, Manzherok, Cheposh and Edigan, leaving further north to the village.

Similar phenomena occurred from 25 to 30 thousand years ago, when there were fluctuations of such a narrow and long bay of the largest glacial-dammed type in the Altai mountains of the Chuisky lake.  At the moment, the structural features of this reservoir are traced in the drawings of tape clay.

    <h2>  Healing spring </h2><p>  The tourists will also be interested in the area located just one kilometer from the village of Chagan-Uzun.  Here is the source of the same name, the waters of which have a significant calcium content.  This figure is 112 milligrams per liter.  This characteristic brings the water from Chagan-Uzun in its healing qualities to "Essentuki-17." </p><p>  The source is located in a rocky ledge located on the southern fortress of the Kurai ridge.  Water at its outlet forms several streams here.  Their total width is 15 meters.  The main output of the healing fluid is from an iron pipe.  The spring water is used by locals.  They use it to treat the eyes. </p>
