Review of the most presentable resort in the country</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone knows that we even need the ‚ÄúTurkish coast‚Äù.  After all, there it is so good to relax at sea.  And among the many beaches of the "Brilliant Porta", tourists often especially highlight one of the resorts that Turkey is so famous for: Belek.  Feedback about this place is often written in enthusiastic colors, which is not at all surprising.  We are talking about one of the most prestigious and expensive cities, where only super fours and fives are at your service, as well as luxury villas with apartments.  Therefore, wealthy families prefer to "ride" there, both with children and without them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Belek Review" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/291323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>VIP-vacation in Turkey: Belek</strong> </p><p>  The hotels of this resort, as can be judged by the responses of vacationers, are mainly surrounded by beautiful gardens and parks where you can walk or wait out the sultry summer heat.  They are mainly located right on the beach and have their own access to the sea.  The beaches are characterized positively - they are clean, wide and often (which is not typical for most Turkish coasts) sandy.  The picturesque area, eucalyptus and pine forests, mild climate and the presence of heated pools give tourists the opportunity to go there all year, regardless of the season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong><span>Turkey, Belek.</span></strong>  <strong>Review about rest with children</strong> </p><p>  Many tourists who write about this resort emphasize that they are not coming there for the first time, and are very pleased with their choice.  They believe that <span>Belek hotels</span> are in the top ranking of the best hotels in the world.  They are not afraid of the price of services, because they are really high quality.  Hotel complexes provide a lot of entertainment right on their territory - so you don‚Äôt have to go anywhere on purpose.  Of course, the "party" youth here will probably be boring, but respectable people - just right.  And the children are very happy and ask their parents to come here again.  Moreover, the beaches are not only awarded the ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù, but also very convenient for bathing kids. </p><p>  <strong>Turkey, Belek.</strong>  <strong>Review of shopping, treatment and golf</strong> </p>

The sweets here are apparently invisible, and they are all very high quality and varied.  A good shopping will be made by those who wish to purchase bedding, especially the so-called "bamboo".  Of course, this is a resort, and the prices are appropriate, but still they are cheaper than in other places.  You can also buy good souvenirs and gold jewelry with ‚Äúpebbles‚Äù.  In Belek, it is also good for those who came to heal nerves and relieve stress - walks under pines and cedars, where, according to doctors, ozone, which is extremely beneficial for health, is concentrated and soothing.  These places are also called a paradise for golf lovers - it is rare where in Turkey you can find so many fields for this game.  All of them are in excellent condition and are waiting for their visitors.  If you don‚Äôt know how to play, then you will be taught this noble art for not very big money.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Turkey Belek hotels" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/291322.jpg" width="585"></div>  Tourists visiting Belek highly recommend renting a boat, a boat, a glider or even a yacht, if funds permit, and go to enjoy the bays, cliffs and secluded beaches.  There is nothing better than such an excursion in the whole world.  It will be easy for people who can afford to rent a car to travel independently through the local forests and mountains, as well as visit Antalya, Kemer and other attractions of the region.  You can even afford longer trips to understand what real Turkey is.  Belek in September is the most comfortable for excursions.  The weather does not get so hot, prices begin to fall, and the ‚Äúvelvet season‚Äù begins, when it is not so windy yet, and the temperature of water and air is almost the same.  If most of the money you spent on a good hotel, do not worry!  Turkish minibuses-dolmushi will take you to almost any picturesque place in the area for a penny.  And walking in Belek is good everywhere.  In a word, come, you will not regret it!  Then there will be something to remember.
