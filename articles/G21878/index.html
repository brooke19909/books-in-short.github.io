    <p>  Among the most prestigious devices released by the brand is the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 1020 smartphone <span>.</span> What are its main features?  What are the undeniable competitive advantages?  Is it possible to say that this phone fully reflects the quality and comfort of use inherent in the brand? </p><p>  Many experts who tested the smartphone are of the opinion that the characteristics laid down by the manufacturer in the Nokia 1020 make it possible to talk about the appearance of a completely new type of device - the ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù.  Why this is so, you can try to understand just by looking at the device.  A huge and functional camera is located right in the middle of the case.  It has unique characteristics in terms of the level of resolution, as well as the quality of the parts used - lens, stabilizer, shutter. </p>

    <p>  However, the manufacturer brand has something to brag about, apart from equipping the phone with an impressive eyepiece.  What exactly will surprise us with the Nokia 1020 gadget?  At least the fact that the device supports most of the communication standards that exist today.  And therefore, the specialization of Nokia 1020 can not be called narrow.  This is a multifunctional Windows device designed to become a worthy competitor to products from the leaders of the global mobile device market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The phone comes in several basic colors: black, white, and yellow.  But the device controls (such as power keys, volume controls, and shutter buttons) for all modifications are black.  The shape of the smartphone case from the geometric point of view is most similar to the box.  The corners are elegantly rounded.  The rear panel is almost perfectly flat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1020 specifications" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/515927.jpg" width="567"></div>

    <p>  The main camera of the smartphone stands out very much from the body.  But this is not surprising, since this hardware component of the device is thoroughly "stuffed" with additional electronics.  It is, in particular, an optical stabilizer and a mechanical type shutter.  Especially for photography enthusiasts, Nokia has introduced a special design element - the Camera Grip holder.  By activating it, the owner of the smartphone can give his device a form that is as close as possible to the design of a classic camera.  The holder is equipped with a mount on which you can fix the tripod. </p>

    <p>  Most experts note the highest quality of materials used in the manufacture of the smartphone case.  Designers themselves also praise the design itself.  There is no likeness of backlash, inconsistencies of the edges or any elements that would not fit into the design of the case.  The smartphone, experts say, sits perfectly in the hand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next in turn is the next most important point in our review of the Nokia 1020 - specifications. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a powerful dual-core processor chip Snapdragon S4, operating at a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  The device has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of regular flash memory (support for additional modules, however, no).  The parameters, most experts believe, are impressive, which is consistent with the tasks assigned to the device.  It is believed that the predefined amount of flash memory is not enough.  But there is a counterargument to this thesis: the device has more than a wide range of communication capabilities.  At almost any time, you can overwrite photos on an external PC media, external hard drive or other mobile gadget. </p><h2>  Does Windows rule the ball? </h2><p>  With its main task - processing photos in maximum resolution - a smartphone, as found by expert testers, copes with excellent.  There are no brakes and freezes in work.  Most applications are launched without any overhead.  This, experts believe, can be to some extent related to the architecture of the Windows Phone OS, which has some advantages in terms of using hardware resources over other platforms (primarily Android). </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Smartphone Nokia 1020 is equipped with a camera with a huge resolution of 41 megapixels, capable of taking photos of the highest quality.  This hardware component of the device has a powerful xenon-type flash, LED backlight, and also a shutter driven mechanically.  The camera installed in the Nokia 1020 is manufactured by one of the world's most famous manufacturers - Carl Zeiss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Just think, the amount of image files saved from the camera can reach 20 megabytes!  To understand how much this is, we recall that even the best quality photos stored on social networks (Vkontakte, Facebook or Odnoklassniki) barely reach 1-2 MB.  The camera can also record <span>video with a resolution</span> of 1080 pixels. </p>

    <p>  The phone is also equipped with a Rich Recording module, which provides very high quality sound recording in almost any key and range.  When shooting a video, you can be sure not only of the perfect picture, but also that the soundtrack will be at its best. </p><p>  The device is also equipped with a front camera.  It, in turn, is not so powerful, moreover, inferior in terms of resolution to even some budget models of smartphones.  This parameter of the <span>front camera of the</span> device is only 1.2 megapixels.  But this hardware component, experts say, is far from determining in terms of the functionality of the Nokia Lumia 1020. The characteristics of an additional camera are a secondary issue. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The device screen has an average size of 4.5 inches.  It is made using modern AMOLED technology.  Display resolution - 1280 by 768 pixels.  It is clear that in the best quality, photos will be visible on larger screens (those equipped with PCs or tablets).  But technologies for improving the clarity of the image used in the manufacture of the display (such as, for example, ClearBlack) squeeze the maximum out of the possible, experts say.  The screen surface of the Nokia 1020 is protected by high-strength Corning <span>Gorilla Glass</span> in one of the latest versions - the 3rd. </p>

    <p>  Some experts believe that the AMOLED display has advantages over IPS-based solutions.  In particular, in the Glance Screen mode of operation, the Nokia 1020 screen consumes very little battery power.  It is believed that IPS has better color rendering.  But there are counterarguments, one of which is based on the fact that Nokia recently released the GDR2 software extension, which allows for maximum personalization of the screen color reproduction.  It is unlikely, experts say, that the brand-maker Nokia Lumia 1020 did not think of such a nuance as the ratio of the performance of the main camera and the quality of the display.  Engineering tests probably showed that the AMOLED screen would be the optimal solution. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery installed on the phone has a capacity of 2 thousand mAh.  This resource, as experts have found, is enough in practice to view video in 720 pixels for about 8 hours.  This is a very good result (however, for such a battery - quite expected).  The battery, like in many other devices of the Lumia line, is non-removable. </p><h2>  Marketing prospects </h2><p>  It will be useful, drawing up a review aimed at a comprehensive study of the Nokia 1020, a little deeper into the economic side of the issue.  What are the chances of a smartphone taking its rightful place among the best-selling devices of its class?  Many experts are sure: the phone is unique to the market.  For the Nokia 1020 devices, the Android platform, experts say, is definitely not a competitor.  As for Apple devices, rivalry between brands is possible only in certain market segments. </p>

    <p>  However, the target group of buyers of the device is also quite narrow.  Most likely, people involved in professional photography, as well as active travelers, will want to own a smartphone.  In addition, the phone has excellent chances to occupy a niche in the market structure due to the unique combination of functions and high performance. </p><p>  Among experts, there is a thesis that the distribution of this smartphone can be promoted by Microsoft, which produces an operating system for it.  One of the possible methods of promoting the device is <span>"aggressive marketing."</span>  In particular, there is a version that Microsoft is going to organize a campaign in the USA, within the framework of which it will offer owners of mobile gadgets on Android and iOS platforms to exchange their devices for Nokia Lumia smartphones for free.  Of course, the modification that we are talking about now may be included in the number of such devices.  And this taking into account the fact that the price set by the manufacturer on the Nokia 1020 can significantly exceed that for Android and iOS devices. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The smartphone supports cellular networks in almost all existing standards, including 4G.  There is support for the Band 7 high-speed <span>data transfer</span> mode (this standard is one of the most common in Russia).  The smartphone is equipped with modules within a very wide range of communication capabilities.  This is GPS, and GLONASS, and, of course, Wi-Fi.  There is support for Bluetooth version 3, as well as NFC - technology for quick contactless data transfer (in practice it is most often used at modern cash registers in stores).  There is a built-in radio that works in the FM band.  Most experts who wrote about the Nokia 1020 review speak of the smartphone as a high-quality device that copes with communication functions. </p><h2>  What users say </h2><p>  Most smartphone users speak of it as a great product.  Many call this camera phone the best in its class, which has no worthy analogues.  The device receives praise, including from people who are engaged in professional photography.  That is, we can say that Nokia was able to please just the target audience. </p><p>  Users praise the smartphone for speed, user-friendly interface, a comfortable procedure for synchronizing with other devices.  Many people note a wide range of functionalities that are not directly related to the main task assigned to the device (that is, with photographing).  We are talking, for example, about the speed of the browser, performance when working with various applications. </p><h2>  Nokia holds the brand </h2><p>  Users, as well as experts, note that the device shows traditionally high quality of communication functions for Nokia phones.  Communication device holds well in any standards.  The voice of the interlocutor is transmitted in excellent quality.  In addition, Nokia phones are famous for their high build quality.  In this regard, the camera phone also confidently holds the brand, according to the owners of the device. </p><h2>  Nokia makes discounts </h2><p>  Many users highlight one interesting marketing feature that is characteristic of smartphone sales.  The fact is that the price of the device has a tendency to decline dynamically.  Some buyers noted an interesting fact: when launching the gadget on the market, it cost about 27 thousand, and after just a few months - already about 22 thousand. The characteristics laid down by the manufacturer in Nokia Lumia 1020, users believe, fully justify the price of the device. </p>
