However, this state refused the ruble almost by the very last.  The development of the state dictated its own rules, and the need arose to create its own national currency. </p><h2>  Kazakhstan tenge - currency of the Republic of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  <span>Kazakhstan</span> called its <span>money the</span> word "tenge" for a reason.  The origin of this term is rooted in the past and belongs to the Turkic languages.  It was in Taraz and Otrar, the ancient <span>cities of Kazakhstan,</span> that in the 13th century they began to mint coins and called them "tanga", which in translation means "money." </p><p>  Modern Kazakhstan is a rapidly developing and promising state.  The acquisition of the sovereignty of the country contributed to the development of the economy and the maintenance of its currency.  Kazakhstan tenge came into use in 1993, and the first factory for their production opened in 1995.  The country of England became the birthplace of the first tenge, and the first coins - ‚Äútyiins‚Äù - began their life in Germany.  The process of importing money into the country was organized in such a way that within eight days, absolutely all banks in the country were provided with new currency. </p><h2>  Banknote number of national currency </h2><p>  At first, the government of the Republic planned the phased entry of tenge into the country's monetary turnover.  But then it was decided to change all the money at once.  That is, completely switch to the Kazakhstan tenge. </p>

    <p>  The Kazakhstanis saw on their hands tenge with a face value of up to 500 and paper tyines.  But such money quickly and unexpectedly went out of circulation.  And they were replaced by the 1000s, 2000s, and in 1998 the country already had the 5000th bill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coins of Kazakhstan </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of higher denominations in the money market meant that the Kazakhstan tenge was strengthening.  Coins went into circulation as swiftly.  An interesting fact is that initially the tyins were paper.  Then they were replaced by metal ones.  Now the nominal range of coins is extensive, which is very convenient when exchanging large bills.  However, at present tiyyns are out of circulation.  50 tiyn were created in 1995, since then their number has been decreasing.  Paper tenge replaced by metal.  Their nominal range consists of one to one hundred tenge. </p><h2>  Banknote design </h2><p>  Like any other currency in the world, Kazakhstani tenge have become a reflection of the entire cultural and political life of the country.  The best minds of the republic worked on the design of banknotes.  Each bill has its own unique, very colorful design and carries a subtle meaning. </p>

    <p>  It is noteworthy that on all bills are the same main characters.  This is both the state symbols of Kazakhstan and the image of ‚ÄúAstana-Baiterek‚Äù, meaning peace and harmony.  Another repeating drawing is an open palm as a sign of goodwill and openness.  The difference is only in the colors and in the form of ministerial buildings.  So, for example, 200 tenge is yellow, and on the bill you can see the building of the Ministry of Defense and Transport of the Republic.  On the back there is a contour of Kazakhstan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the 500th banknote of the Kazakhstan tenge is an image of the building of the Ministry of Finance of the country.  This bill has a gray-blue color. </p><p>  1000 tenge is presented in tan with the image of the Presidential Cultural Center. </p><p>  The denomination in denomination in 2000 tenge has a green color and the image of the Abay Theater located in the city of Almaty. </p><p>  Independence Monument was decorated with 5000 tenge.  The image of the Kazakhstan Hotel is also located on this bill.  The predominant color is reddish brown. </p><p>  10,000 bill painted in purple with a blue tint.  On the main side is the residence of the President of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that the most colorful currency is Kazakhstan tenge.  Photos prove this.  By their brightness, tenge is not inferior even to all known euro banknotes.  It is noteworthy that the Kazakhstani <span>tenge currency</span> is one of the most protected in the world.  Banknotes are protected by various watermarks, special combining and hidden images, paint, which changes color in the ultraviolet, etc. A distinctive feature of all degrees of protection is a transparent window in the bill.  There is also a label for visually impaired people.  But, despite this, fraudsters still manage to fake money.  This fact leaves the government no choice but to invent and improve the Kazakhstan tenge more and more every year. </p>
