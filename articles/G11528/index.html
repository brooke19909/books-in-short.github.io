We are talking about the LG Spirit H422, a device with a curved screen that has an unusual design and, accordingly, ergonomics. </p><p>  Of course, due to this move, phone sales, as well as interest in it from buyers, have increased significantly.  With the price of the device at 10 thousand rubles, the buyer can have a real smartphone with a curved screen - who would not be interested in this? </p><p>  However, there is reasonable criticism towards such a decision.  Specialists, for example, argue that such a move is nothing more than pure marketing aimed at increasing sales.  Like, the phone does not have any advantages from this form of the screen, and they can buy it, perhaps, out of interest and what technical characteristics (basically) it has. </p><p>  Whatever it was - and in this review we will take a closer look at the LG Spirit H422 and issue a verdict on whether the model is really interesting or not. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  So, since we started talking about the appearance of the device, we will begin its characterization precisely with the design.  From the side it may seem that in the design of the smartphone there is nothing worth attention.  LG Spirit H422 is a classic ‚Äútouch brick‚Äù with slightly rounded upper and lower edges and a slightly narrowed back cover at the edges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the front side of the phone is also a familiar design, represented by narrow frames on the sides and more thickened - above and below.  The logo of the manufacturing company flaunts on the bottom, while the front camera, speaker and proximity sensor are placed on top. </p><p>  An interesting navigation system is implemented - the front buttons are displayed on the screen (they are touch-sensitive);  while the physical <span>control buttons are</span> presented on the back cover (as LG and Asus are used to doing).  Thus, you can unlock the display or change the sound volume of the smartphone using the control point under the camera. </p><p>  Functional openings are traditionally installed in the upper (headphone jack), as well as in the lower (microUSB) parts. </p><p>  The entire body of the LG Spirit H422 is made of plastic - unfortunately, there is no metal here.  But, holding it in your hands, you can get a pleasant experience due to the high cost of the materials themselves and the high quality of their fitting together. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  As we already reported, the smartphone LG Spirit H422 has a <span>curved display</span> (at an angle of 3000R, as reported on the manufacturer‚Äôs website).  The first thing I would like to say about this design is practicality.  You can‚Äôt say for sure whether such a display creates any special, more realistic picture, but one thing is certain: due to this curvature, the model‚Äôs glass is protected from rubbing and scratches because it rests on the side faces.  The surface on which the model lies simply does not contact the screen - and this is a noticeable plus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the image transmitted on the display, it has a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels and a diagonal size of 4.7 inches.  The picture is obtained quite high quality also due to the high number of dot density - about 312 per inch. </p><p>  Numerous tests conducted on the LG Spirit H422 (a review, in fact, is designed for this), showed that the phone has a fairly wide viewing angles.  This means that when you rotate and tilt the device, the image on the screen does not lose its lighting and saturation.  And this, in turn, is an important indicator during the operation of the phone. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Of course, in addition to design and display, the hardware base of the gadget, its ‚Äúfilling", remains important.  In the case of the LG Spirit H422, we are talking about a processor for budget devices from MediaTek (model MT6582).  In fact, this is a 4-core solution with a clock frequency of each core up to 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  In addition to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone, 1 GB of RAM also deserves attention, due to which the practical tests of the smartphone (as well as its price affiliation) turn out to be quite predictable.  So, the model can really easily reproduce various (including ‚Äúbulky‚Äù in terms of graphics) games, although something supernatural should not be expected.  You can say the following: given the price tag, the LG Spirit H422 smartphone (in terms of performance) is presented quite adequately. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In addition to response speed, an important issue is the amount of internal memory of the gadget.  According to technical specifications, the device is equipped with 8 GB of memory initially (half of which is probably occupied by system files).  The phone also has support for memory cards, thanks to which the above-mentioned amount of free space can be significantly expanded (up to 64 GB additionally).  This can not but rejoice fans of games, lovers of series, as well as those who like to make a large number of photos and videos.  From the device you can make a real multimedia center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In any gadget (and especially those that run on Android OS), the level of its autonomy is important - an indicator of how long the device can operate on a single battery charge.  Two factors influence the device in this respect - the capacity of the battery itself and the speed with which the device consumes a charge. </p>

    <p>  As for the first, the LG Spirit H422 is equipped with a 2100 mAh battery, which is clearly not a matter of pride.  Compared to what other manufacturers offer, this is a low segment.  There are smartphones that have batteries of 3-4 thousand mAh, which have the same characteristics.  The LG Spirit H422 (Black) model lasts for only a couple of hours of intensive work, which undoubtedly gives users a lot of discomfort. </p><p>  The second factor - the rate of charge consumption - depends on how optimized the device and the systems operating in it are.  Since there is evidence that the model is warming, this is already an indicator of poor optimization.  As a result, the battery charge goes to the physical heating of the processor. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  We are used to the fact that smartphones of this class are equipped with two cameras, so nothing has changed in the case of the LG Spirit H422 Titan.  The front has a resolution of 1 megapixel;  while the back has an 8 megapixel matrix.  Thus, the capabilities of the first will be enough to successfully support video communication using this gadget;  and the second - to take quite tolerable pictures (not even in the best conditions). </p><p>  Given the budget orientation of the smartphone, it can generally be praised by pointing to the images obtained with its help. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  We have already noted that the gadget is based on Android.  We are talking about the actual version 5.0 at the time of the release of the smartphone, which was not the most stable, but had an interface similar to iOS.  Along with it, an interesting KnockMode mode functions on the phone, which allows you to activate the display after clicking on some previously set screen areas.  This is convenient and, at the same time, provides an additional level of security. </p><p>  In addition to it, the software features of the device include turning on the screen with a double tap. </p><p>  The graphical shell of the LG Spirit H422 Titan is not ‚Äúnative‚Äù and ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android, but a separate graphics system developed by the manufacturer that has an individual design and a slightly different transition system between the windows.  Perhaps a person who is accustomed to other smartphones on Android, at first it will not be easy to get used to such an organization. </p>

    <p>  For example, innovative is the ability to add to the standard menu, which consists of three buttons (on the lower touch panel), an additional key to change the SIM card and create notes.  This, in principle, is convenient - but, in my opinion, it does not bear practical value, since with the same success these keys can be brought to the main screen. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone, in the best traditions of its class, supports two SIM cards.  This makes it possible to correctly select tariff plans for the user, saving on some services of mobile operators (Internet, calls, messages). </p><p>  In addition to supporting GSM, the device also works with others from the ‚Äústandard set‚Äù - Bluetooth, WiFI, GPS and 3G. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In the process of how we created a review for the LG Spirit H422, we also found various opinions of customers about this device.  In particular, I had to meet with whole forums of reviews, where the characteristics of the device are described in detail. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, first of all, I would like to note that most of these reviews are the highest rating.  In them, people praise the device, its capabilities, low price, the quality of the LG Spirit H422, the characteristics of its filling. </p><p>  However, there are also negative reviews.  They concern, first of all, low autonomy, a weak camera, a plastic case.  You can also find opinions that the device is losing a signal, can reboot itself and perform other unauthorized actions.  Of course, there comes a period when this is possible, only after 6-12 months of use. </p><p>  There are also recommendations criticizing the easily soiled screen of the device, as well as its damage-resistant housing.  Although, on the other hand, this problem can be easily solved by buying a case for LG Spirit H422.  This, firstly, individualizes the device, makes it externally unique (to some extent);  secondly, it will provide protection to the body of the smartphone.  Then, in the event of a fall, you should not worry much about the device.  It is easy to do.  You can order a cover for the LG Spirit H422 at any of the Chinese auctions for a penny. </p><p>  There are also a lot of negative comments related to a weak processor.  The point is that the designated MediaTek does not cope with the tasks that users can often perform - because of which it starts to slow down and freeze. </p><p>  Also, people, as a drawback, note the lack of oleophobic coating. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What can be said about this device?  A budget, multi-functional and high-quality assembled smartphone, which, although not ideal, can serve the owner for more than one year.  My assessment, despite customer reviews, is a high ‚Äúfour‚Äù. </p>
