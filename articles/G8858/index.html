Surely, this question worries 99% of Russians who are forced to rent housing.  However, the purchase of an apartment or house has always been considered one of the best ways to profitably invest. </p><h2>  Strategy selection </h2><p>  The question of whether it is worth buying real estate now becomes doubly relevant due to the fact that the US currency regularly rises in price, and the Russian ruble cannot come to stability.  It would seem that everything is simple: the best way to protect your hard-earned money from inflation is to purchase housing.  Most of our compatriots are convinced that apartment prices will only increase in the future.  However, when deciding the question: "Is it worth it to buy real estate now?"  - the following factor must be taken into account.  Today one cannot be sure of the stability of the dollar, the ruble and the cost per square meter. </p>

    <p>  Experts point out that today one should not commit rash acts in the desire to derive maximum benefit for oneself.  Buyers should remember the following: you should not expect that due to the crisis, real estate will fall in price.  And apartment owners and contractors need to consider that it makes no sense to wait a long time until housing prices go up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Primary real estate market is gradually developing </h2><p>  Should I buy real estate now?  Of course, yes, when it comes to new buildings.  Currently, demand has intensified in this market segment, investing money should be in it.  A significant part of developers has not changed ruble prices since last year - this is a weighty argument in favor of acquiring an apartment in a house under construction.  At the same time, one shouldn‚Äôt be too slow in making a positive decision, since after a while construction companies will raise prices for new buildings due to the rise in prices of materials, engineering systems and energy resources, and increase in interest rates on loans. </p><h2>  Is a mortgage profitable today? </h2><p>  A huge number of Russians are concerned about the question of whether to buy real estate on a mortgage right now (2015)? </p>

    <p>  This question cannot be answered unequivocally.  On the one hand, bank interest on loans increased, and on the other, a program of state participation in subsidizing mortgage lending programs was launched.  If we talk about mortgages for new buildings, the objects of the primary real estate market are sold at a rate of 11-12%.  Among other things, some developers offer on certain conditions to reduce the amount of the contract at a subsidized rate, which further reduces the cost of housing.  Thus, in this context, the question of whether to buy real estate in a mortgage now has a definite solution.  The buyer wins: he saves on discounts, he is allowed to book a house for a long time, he receives installment payments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In any case, the answer to the question of whether to buy real estate on a mortgage now becomes obvious.  January 2015 already showed positive dynamics in the above market segment: bank rates fell from 20% to 16% (new buildings - 14.9%). </p><h2>  Prices will be under pressure </h2><p>  In the <span>secondary</span> real estate <span>market</span> , a peculiar situation has developed.  Despite the fact that a significant part of potential sellers decided to postpone the sale, a certain choice still remained. </p>

    <p>  One way or another, it makes sense to buy a used apartment in the category for the simple reason that today the buyer has the right to dictate terms to sellers, which means that there is a great chance to purchase apartments at a lower price.  The housing owner, in turn, is forced to make concessions, because he is not sure whether there will be an increase in the value of real estate after a few months.  In the category of economy class objects, discounts can reach 150 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Crimean real estate market </h2><p>  Today, a huge number of Russians are considering the prospect of acquiring housing in Yalta, Kerch and Sevastopol.  Excellent climatic conditions, picturesque nature, fertile soil - all this encourages investors to develop business in this particular geographical area, which has recently come under the jurisdiction of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, today one of the burning issues is the question of whether it is worth buying real estate in the Crimea now.  Let's consider it in more detail. </p><h2>  Prices are rising </h2><p>  The coastline of Crimea has clear boundaries, and therefore, there is not enough space for everyone. </p>

    <p>  However, taking into account the density of development of the coastal territory, there will still be time to take a convenient place in the sun.  In general, there is still plenty of free territory, but this does not mean that investors should hesitate in making transactions: prices for Crimean land are gradually rising.  As for the most promising areas (southern <span>coast of Crimea),</span> they are already 99% occupied. </p><h2>  Is it profitable to purchase Crimean real estate now </h2><p>  Of course, the question of whether to buy real estate in the Crimea should be considered from different angles.  Many are frightened by the confusion in the regulatory framework of the republic, the register of real estate transactions must be brought into line with Russian legislation, which takes some time.  The peninsula‚Äôs infrastructure also leaves much to be desired: many facilities have not been repaired since Soviet times.  And, of course, for the development of the economy it is necessary to build a bridge across the <span>Kerch Strait.</span>  Nevertheless, the question of whether to buy real estate in the Crimea after the republic joins our country can be answered in the affirmative. </p>

    <p>  If you use a competent approach to investing, then you can not only profitably acquire a home ownership in Yalta, but also sell it after a while.  If your apartments are located a few hundred meters from the sea, then the profit from the sale can be threefold, since the demand for such objects is incredibly high. </p><p>  Buying housing in the Crimea should also be because it can be leased immediately after the transaction.  Cottages, houses, <span>cottages in Crimean</span> villages are in high demand among tenants, so this business can bring quite good income for the season.  Of course, you should not count on superprofits, because the level of service still leaves much to be desired.  However, over time, the situation will straighten out in this sense. </p><h2>  Imperfect legislation </h2><p>  Considering the question of whether to buy real estate in the Crimea after the accession of the peninsula to Russia, it should be said that there is a vacuum in the legislation that has accumulated as a result of the transition from one legal field to another. </p>

    <p>  There is currently no real opportunity to register real estate transactions in Crimea, but this factor has in no way reduced the demand of Russians for resort facilities.  In such conditions, prices for Crimean apartments crawled up. </p><h2>  Caution, scammers! </h2><p>  It should be noted that the confusion in the regulatory sphere of Crimea was used by local scammers.  The Russians, who when making real estate transactions make a deposit, become victims of scammers who impersonate owners of apartments and houses, but in reality they are not.  The fact is that today access to the registry is limited, so determining who legally owns the apartment is quite difficult.  It is also almost impossible to find out whether any encumbrances were imposed on real estate. </p><p>  In such a shaky legal field, the Crimean coast looks like a risky object from the point of view of investment attractiveness, and scammers naturally use this.  Very often dishonest businessmen falsify title documents for residential real estate. </p><p>  According to media reports, at first the registries were turned off in an emergency mode, which made it possible for scammers to collect the necessary information about genuine documents and subsequently make copies of them. </p><h2>  Recommendations for those who decided to invest <span>money</span> in Crimean real estate </h2><p>  If you decide to invest your savings in Crimean real estate, then adhere to the recommendations described below. </p>

    <p>  1. Wait for the start of real estate sales: in the conditions when money for the apartment will be transferred after the paper on the transfer of ownership is completed (in the registration authority).  Otherwise, you may not see not only apartments or houses, but also your own money.  Remember: scammers do not sleep! </p><p>  2. When calculating the potential benefits of investing in Crimean real estate, do not forget to analyze the prospect of developing a negative scenario for the deterioration of relations with Ukraine.  On the other hand, you should not panic, since the presence of the Russian army on the peninsula is already a guarantee of security. </p><p>  3. Analyzing the dynamics of the increase in prices for real estate on the peninsula and the prospect of business development in this market segment, do not forget to monitor the implementation of the construction of the bridge across the Kerch Strait from time to time.  Only road and rail links will make the peninsula an economically prosperous region.  In particular, the bridge across the <span>Tuzla island,</span> which involves the division of Kerch into two parts, is considered promising from the point of view of investments. </p><p>  4. When developing a business plan for investing capital in Crimean real estate, one should not rely on the opinion of local experts in everything.  They do not know all the nuances and subtleties of the Russian legal system, so a selective approach should be used in the search for lawyers, realtors, designers. </p>
