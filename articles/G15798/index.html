This is in vain.  The device has a small cost, but good features.  The assembly is beautiful, the display is excellent, performance is also on par. </p><p>  Before reading the review, you should immediately say about the main feature of the phone Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb.  Its characteristic will be described later.  It's about cost.  In China, it does not exceed $ 75.  If we talk about the Russian Federation, it does not rise above the mark of 5 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4a 16gb specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054786.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Unpack </h2><p>  For a long time, budget phones, like their expensive "brothers", do not have an interesting configuration.  The described model is delivered in a cardboard box.  It has a very small size.  There is not much space, but everything fits perfectly into the container.  The whole set weighs no more than 325 grams.  This feature of Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb pleases. </p><p>  Inside you can find a cable for charging and connecting to a computer, a power supply.  The quick charge function is not integrated.  If you buy in foreign stores on the Internet, then you can also get an adapter to the outlet in the kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Many Chinese companies are creating low-cost phones with a metal case, as well as necessarily embed fingerprint scanners in their models.  All this, of course, pleases, but the quality of implementation leaves much to be desired.  Is this the case with the described model? </p><p>  Xiaomi manufacturer did differently.  He created a plastic case, refused a fingerprint scanner.  Thanks to such savings, a more or less powerful chipset was installed.  A quality screen is also installed, and the assembly satisfies even the most critical user. </p><p>  The external characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb (Rose and Gold - two color options) are excellent.  With the fact that there is a pink and gold phone, while its front part is white.  Only the color of the rear panel changes. </p><p>  You can understand that the phone is made of plastic only after touching it.  Also gives out the weight of the smartphone.  However, this is not scary, since the phone was created in good faith. </p><p>  The manufacturer is clearly not going to use glass such as 2.5D.  The described device received the usual flat panel.  Its brand and manufacturer are not advertised.  Oleophobic type coating is available, and it is of high quality.  On the screen you can notice the presence of light sensors, distances, there is also a speakerphone and a camera. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there are problems with the sensors of the device.  At one point, all sensors may turn off.  For example, many buyers complain that their display does not turn off during a call when presented to the ear, the auto brightness option that is turned on does not work, and the accelerometer does not rotate the picture to a horizontal position.  Buyers report that in 90% of cases, this can be cured by rolling back to factory settings.  But at the same time, even though the screen backlight works, it's still bad, it is often late and incorrectly adjusts the brightness.  In this, the characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb buyers are not encouraging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4a 16gb gold specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054670.jpg"></div>

They do not have a backlight, so in the dark you have to rely on your intuition.  If desired, in the settings you can change the key assignment. </p><p>  Installed regular MicroUSB.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer refused the USB Type-C connector.  Otherwise, it would have been necessary to use other components, and, accordingly, the cost of the device would be higher.  OTG mode works. </p><p>  The phone also has the following characteristics: Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb Gold has an infrared port and a headphone jack.  In this matter, the manufacturer does not change its traditions. </p><p>  There is an interesting pattern on the back cover.  The mirror logo of the manufacturer is also applied.  This is done so that the device does not seem boring.  The idea was 100% successful. </p><p>  Near the bottom of the device you can find a speaker.  It is external, used for hands-free calling and listening to music.  Buyers note that it is quite impressive - expectations were much worse.  The volume is average, the speaker has decent quality.  Due to the speaker on the back, when the phone is on it, the sound becomes muffled.  This is a minus, for some quite critical. </p><p>  The owners say that in the model the most pleasant feature is the ratio of the size of the device, the screen and its thickness.  The phone is convenient to use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="specifications xiaomi redmi 4a 16gb rose gold" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054669.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  For Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb Gray smartphone and screen specifications, buyers have no complaints.  A high-quality IPS-type matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled, an <span>oleophobic coating is</span> present <span>.</span>  Brightness got a good margin.  Let us consider in detail its characteristics. </p><p>  The diagonal of the screen is 5 inches.  Its resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels.  Contrast at a good level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xiaomi redmi 4a 16gb gray specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054667.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen features </h2><p>  What about viewing angles, it all depends on the degree of deviation.  If you observe straight lines, you will not notice any shortcomings and distortions, however, if you turn the device along the axis, a slight "fog" will appear.  This is considered the norm for most IPS-type matrices. </p><p>  The menu has color settings, a mode with a glow that allows you to protect your eyes.  You can also configure the display to wake up by double-clicking on the screen.  This feature is useful and many customers like it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4a 16gb phone feature" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2054666.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Technical specifications Xiaomi Redmi 4A </h2><p>  The device runs on a processor of a 64-bit system - Qualcomm Snapdragon.  The core frequency is 1.4 GHz.  RAM reaches 2 GB, but about 870 MB is available for use after the phone is fully loaded.  The internal storage is voluminous, as for a state employee, - 16 GB.  You can install memory cards with 128 GB or less. </p><p>  What are the <span>characteristics of the</span> front camera <span>Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb?</span>  Its resolution is 5 megapixels, the main - 13 megapixels.  The latter is also capable of shooting video in 1080 quality. The battery has a capacity of 3120 mAh.  Works on the sixth version of Android.  The MIUI shell from the company is installed on top.  Of the sensors, the presence of sensors, an accelerometer, an infrared port and a gyroscope should be noted.  The device weighs 132 g. </p><p>  It is possible to work with 2G, 3G, 4G networks.  Two radio modules are installed, that is, functionality is supported with two SIM cards of the ‚Äúmicro‚Äù and ‚Äúnano‚Äù type.  One of the connectors is combined and suitable for a memory card.  There are bluetooth and wireless access point modules.  Owners note stable operation with navigation. </p><p>  Buyers also emphasized that there are no problems with the operation of the fourth generation network.  There are no problems with communication. </p><p>  The internal memory is 16 GB, but only 8 GB is available to the buyer.  These <span>characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4A 16Gb are</span> not very impressive.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer has installed a large number of unnecessary Chinese applications.  The good news is that half of them can be removed independently in a special menu.  This will free up about 1 extra GB.  For devices running on Android, this is a weak indicator.  This statement can be explained by the fact that usually with this amount of memory, phones work with 11-12 free GB. </p><p>  Navigation works perfect.  Starting systems lasts no more than 10 seconds.  After that, the satellites are picked up, but the signal is not lost. </p>
