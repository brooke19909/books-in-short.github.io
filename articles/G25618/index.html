Leningrad Oblast is one of the few in Russia where there is a unique natural phenomenon.  In the Lomonosov district there is a large ravine, the depth of which is several tens of meters.  A small river Ruditsa paved its way along its bottom.  Near the local school building, the slope of the hollow has the shape of a sheer cliff, composed of limestone.  This sedimentary rock formed the Paleozoic era.  It consists of petrified ancient fossils (trilobites) and marine mollusks.  Further in the article will be described in detail about radon lakes and their history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radon lake" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451420.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village of Lopukhinka, located in the Leningrad region, is famous for its lakes and radon sources.  They are hydrological and regional geological monuments of the region.  Radon Lakes in the Leningrad Region is a natural treasure of the northern capital of Russia.  There are fourteen landscape monuments in the area.  But we will not talk about all of them.  Let us dwell only on radon lakes, their properties and history. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Officially, this territory acquired the status of a local landmark in 1976.  The entire area of ‚Äã‚Äã270 hectares is strictly protected.  Under control are the Lopukhinka river basin and the places where springs beat.  It prohibits any production and construction work, as well as actions that may lead to pollution of the protected area.  Each radon lake in Lopukhinka is truly unique and peculiar.  In all, emerald-clear, crystal clear water.  Since ancient times, such lakes were considered to be witchcraft.  But besides their attractive beauty, these sources have healing properties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Radon Lake, Leningrad Region" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451421.jpg" width="400"></div>

These are artificial reservoirs formed after the construction of dams in the upper Ruditsa.  The upper radon lake stretched about two hundred meters.  The lower one, located after 50 m, is 550 meters long and about 60 m wide. The water in them is transparent, clean and pale blue. This is because there are no algae at the bottom and reeds do not grow along the banks. </p><p>  <strong>Healing action</strong> </p><p>  The reservoir has healing properties due to radon - a colorless inert radioactive gas.  He emerges from the earth, mingling with groundwater.  The radiation background of our planet is strongly influenced by natural sources of radiation - radioactive elements contained in the Earth's crust (87%).  And radon gives us 32% of them.  A gas dissolved in a concentration of up to 60 Bq / kg is not dangerous.  On the contrary, radon therapy is a traditional method of hydrotherapy.  Therapeutic baths with gas have a beneficial effect on sleep, help reduce pain and eliminate chronic inflammatory processes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radon lakes in the Leningrad region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451422.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the estate </h2><p>  In the village of Lopuhinka, the radon lake is not the only attraction.  In ancient times, the <span>estate</span> was founded by a famous noble family <span>.</span>  <span>The estate has been</span> mentioned in documentary archives since the 18th century.  She got her name from the names of the founders - Lopukhins.  In 1833, the estate began to belong to Pavel Khristianovich Goering, who subsequently appreciated the healing properties of radon lakes.  In 1841, a resort with several hydropathic centers appeared on this site.  In 1839, the governor of Kronstadt Faddey Faddeevich Bellingshausen and the surgeon N.I. Pirogov rented the estate and opened a hospital for sailors who were treated for rheumatism with the help of water from sources.  The results of water therapy were positive.  The boarding house gained wide popularity at that time.  They came here from all over the country.  Here you could not only improve your health, but also enjoy in the silence the beauties of the surroundings.  The resort here existed until 1885, and the owners of the estate until 1917 remained the Goring.  Now in this building is a high school.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the sources that feed the radon lake attracted the attention of the famous hydrologist N.F. Pogrebov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="radon lake in burdock" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/451423.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  The nature of the village of Lopuhinka </h2><p>  Radon Lake attracted with its healing properties and beauty, and the nearby water body became a favorite fishing spot - in the 20th century it was inhabited by trout.  But already in 1994, this territory received the status of a hydrogeological natural monument of local importance.  In this regard, fishing is prohibited.  If we talk about the vegetation surrounding the lakes and springs, then these are more deciduous forests: oak, elm, linden, maple and ash.  There is viburnum and honeysuckle.  The lower tier is represented by the medunica, bluegrass, spring ranch, spiky Voronets, yellow zelenchuk.  Here grows lily of the valley, and buttercup, and woodland, as well as giant fescue, liverwort, lanceolate sprocket, chyme, forest cleaner and rare <span>broad-leaved bell.</span>  Currently, the capabilities of radon lakes are not used.  <span>Breeding of trout has</span> stopped <span>.</span>  The Lopukhins' estate after the second fire is a miserable ruin.  But these places, albeit almost forgotten, in the same way as almost two centuries ago, please with their beauty. </p><h2>  How to get to the radon lakes? </h2><p>  When you get from St. Petersburg to Peterhof, you need to go to Gostilitskoe highway.  Next you need to get to Lopukhinki.  Having passed in the village to the square on the right side, after 200 meters you need to turn right onto the dirt road.  This street will lead to the estate.  On the left side of it there is a staircase, descending along which you can get to the radon lakes. </p>
