A photo of the man in whose honor he is named hangs in the lobby and in his dressing room.  The building itself was built over a hundred years ago.  It was specially created by order of the merchant Danilov for Albert of Salamon, whose big top at the end of the nineteenth century was already very popular.  In October 1880, the circus received its first visitors.  They say that Salamonsky, having inserted in a frame, hung his first ruble received from the sale of tickets at the box office.  This is the Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard today, the layout of the hall with seats in which helps to orientate with the purchase of tickets, can take up to two thousand spectators.  And then, at the end of the nineteenth century, it had only five rows with armchairs, two lodges, a mezzanine, secondary places - wooden unnumbered benches - and a gallery for standing visitors.  Then this building was rebuilt more than once, additional areas were added and completed.  And today, as then, laughter and applause of those who come to Nikulin‚Äôs circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard are heard here.

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A lot of pets left here in different arenas of the country.  These are Romanov and Kotov, Kukso and Popov, the leader of the ‚Äúchoir‚Äù of dogs Bousslaev ... It was Nikulin‚Äôs circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard that became the place where <span>Leonid Yengibarov</span> shone with his talent <span>.</span>  However, the most famous clowns were the students from his second edition - Nikulin and Shuydin. </p><p>  At the arena of this circus, Durovs and Lazarenko, Truzzi performed with a troupe of their well-trained horses, jumpers Sosina, dancer Sur ... Equilibrist Koch, acrobats Oceanos, and finally, the famous Kio - this list can be continued for a long time. </p><p>  In 1983, they entrusted Yuri Nikulin with managing the circus.  In 1985, the last performance took place at his already outdated arena.  It, according to many, was a grand event for all viewers.  And after the old building was demolished, and two years later the first stone was laid in this place in the foundation of a new one - a modern circus.  The capsule was even walled up.  And two years later, a new building had already risen on this place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And in December 1996, it was decided to rename it to ‚ÄúNikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard‚Äù.  After Yuri Vladimirovich died, the director and successor of ideas is his son Maxim Yuryevich. </p><h2>  Poster </h2>
