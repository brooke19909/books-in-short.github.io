    <p>  According to the information provided by the hotel, all rooms in it are of a standard category.  In fact this is not true.  If you believe the reviews about Labranda Excelsior Hotel 4 *, then the reception desk employee decides where the client will be placed.  If you are lucky, you will get a room with a bay window and views of the Mediterranean Sea.  Otherwise, you can run into an option located on the ground floor, with poor lighting and a musty smell. </p><p>  Russians extremely negatively comment on this state of affairs.  They extort $ 20 from them for a clean room with working plumbing and new furniture.  The hotel employee puts this money in his pocket.  German citizens have no such problems.  All controversial issues are resolved in their favor, which cannot be said about the behavior in relation to our compatriots.  Russians are forced to seek help from the administration.  But in high season, the leadership does not make contact with vacationers. </p><p>  The standard room has a double bed.  At the request of the maid brings a playpen or cot.  In the bathroom there are bath and cosmetic accessories, a shower unit, a toilet bowl, a wide illuminated mirror and a hairdryer.  There are rooms for disabled guests.  There are family apartments. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Food in Labranda Excelsior Hotel 4 * is implemented at a high level.  It does not cause complaints.  The menu abounds with fresh vegetables, meat and fish dishes, seafood dishes, and traditional oriental dishes.  Delicious coffee is brewed in the bars and fragrant tea is poured.  On the beach they cook cakes, hamburgers, deep-fried potatoes.  Periodically treated with ice cream.  Five types of jam are offered for the treat. </p><p>  The guests had questions about the quality of the number of rooms.  Some buildings were in need of repair.  There were spots on the carpet in the rooms.  It was damp.  But hot water was supplied around the clock.  All household appliances were in good condition. </p><p>  The evening animation was also not up to par.  Artists were rarely invited.  I really liked the performance of African acrobats.  Their tricks were remembered for a long time.  But the musical part of the program was boring. </p><p>  For towels surcharge is not required.  I did not need a deposit.  Service was carried out on guest cards.  To replace the bath accessories in the room, they just had to be thrown to the floor.  There were clues on the shower door. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If at check-in, the reception desk employee offers accommodation in a room located in the Garden building, refuse immediately.  Be prepared for the fact that it has budget-level rooms.  They do not reach the Standard category.  Usually a suitable option is immediately available.  If the hotel employee does not make contact, do not arrange a squabble.  It will not lead to anything.  Wait for the older shift. </p><p>  The road to the beach is comfortable and smooth.  But at noon, walking on it is not very pleasant.  The absence of trees indicates a meager shadow.  In the most sultry way on the coast turns into torment.  It is not necessary to occupy sunbeds in advance by the sea.  There are enough deck chairs for everyone.  Hotel staff helps to install umbrellas and bring mattresses.  Sand is regularly cleaned and sieved.  There are no stones or boulders in the water. </p>
