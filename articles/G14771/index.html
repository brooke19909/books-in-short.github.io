    <h2>  Painless hair removal </h2><p>  Veet Sensitive Precision is not an epilator and removes excess hair as a trimmer.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork of his knives is very small, respectively, it is impossible to complete a full haircut with his help, however, his main purpose is not this.  Work knives move very quickly and accurately, gently cutting hair and without causing pain and irritation. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The trimmer was created specifically for women's hands - its small size and convenient, ergonomic shape allow you to grab the device without fear that it will fall out or slip out, which is especially important when working in the bathroom, where there is always high humidity.  In reviews of the Veet Sensitive trimmer, it was noted that it is impossible to drop it from the hands even in the shower - its design and ergonomics are so thought out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  To work with the device, you do not need to study the volumetric instruction manual: the trimmer is easy to maintain, it works on a regular battery inserted in a special compartment.  Before switching on directly, it is necessary to install the selected nozzle and proceed to work. </p><p>  In the reviews of the Veet electric trimmer for sensitive areas, it is noted that the instruction that comes with it is Russified and understandable, which greatly facilitates the use of the device itself: you can work with it on an intuitive level. </p>

    <h2>  Safe work </h2><p>  It is impossible to cut while working with the device: its working knives are hidden under special nozzles and are located at a distance from the skin, unlike a razor, which, if not handled carefully, can cut off the upper layer of the epidermis or leave a deep bleeding cut. </p><p>  The trimmer works on ordinary batteries, so you can not be afraid of electric shocks or wires that get confused at hand during the procedure. </p><h2>  Takes care of the skin </h2><p>  Most razors are not designed for shaving intimate areas: such depilation often leads to cuts, injuries and pain, at best, red dots remain in place of the removed hairs.  In addition, the likelihood of ingrown hairs is high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the reviews about the Veet trimmer, it is noted that even after repeated holding the device in the same place, irritation does not remain even on the most sensitive skin, the hair structure is not disturbed, so that they can be grown under the upper layer of the skin. </p><h2>  Trimmer Multifunctionality </h2><p>  The Veet trimmer is designed to correct hair in the bikini area, on the face and armpits.  Men can also use the device to trim their beard and mustache.  A large number of nozzles allows you to use all the functions of the trimmer. </p>

    <h2>  The possibility of hair removal at home </h2><p>  Not every girl will agree to visit a salon for intimate hair removal: this requires overcoming shame and gaining courage.  The Veet trimmer allows you to perform this procedure at home, calmly processing intimate places without embarrassment and modesty. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The girls in the reviews on the Veet trimmer note that you can use the device without additional means - shaving gel or foam.  It is necessary to carry out depilation with a trimmer only on dry, not steamed and non-soaped skin. </p><p>  All hygiene procedures for the best effect are best done before taking a shower or bath.  Using a trimmer in a steam room or bath is not recommended. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the Veet trimmer </h2><p>  Here are some negative aspects of the device: </p><ol data-id="e39054d12a40e"><li>  Poorly removes coarse and stiff hairs.  Such hairs often after removal leave follicles under the skin, which can only be removed by a professional epilator.  The Veet trimmer is not designed to remove hair follicles, so it will not work with such marks on the skin. </li><li>  The trimmer easily removes only regrown hairs, so eyebrow correction should be carried out very carefully and requires a certain skill.  When working with hairs of acceptable length, it may seem that the device does not shave them, but this is not so - the difference is almost imperceptible. </li><li>  The inability to sharpen knives.  Despite this, with proper operation and maintenance, sharpening knives will not take a long time: they will remain sharp for a long time. </li></ol><p>  It is strictly forbidden to lubricate knives with vegetable oil - only special oil can be used for this purpose, in extreme cases - sewing or machine. </p>

    <h2>  How Veet Trimmer Works </h2><p>  The device works from a regular AA battery, which can be purchased at any store.  The following are some rules for handling it: </p><ul data-id="b82fb9050fbc1"><li>  Before the start of intimate depilation, it is recommended to cut off the grown hairs with a special nozzle in the form of a comb, and then change the nozzle and remove all the hairs under the root. </li><li>  After the procedure, the knives are cleaned with a special brush, which is supplied with the device. </li><li>  The trimmer head without nozzle is washed under a stream of water so that moisture does not get on the device body. </li><li>  The cleaned knives are oiled. </li><li>  The trimmer is put into a special storage bag. </li></ul><h2>  Intimate hair removal </h2><p>  For painless removal of excess hair in the intimate area, the Veet trimmer is perfect, because its knives are designed and sharpened taking into account all the properties of the hair. </p><p>  Hair in the intimate zone has the following properties: </p><ul data-id="4bca746dfb65d"><li>  Stiffness, due to which they create an air gap that protects the groin from overheating and overcooling. </li><li>  Waviness - improves the evaporation of sweat and pheromones, creates an air gap. </li></ul><p>  The reviews on the Veet trimmer claim that the trimmer knives do a great job of removing hair in the intimate parts of the body, doing it very carefully and carefully, without leaving marks and without injuring the skin. </p>
