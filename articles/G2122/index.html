  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attractions Hua Hin, Thailand: what to see necessarily</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thailand is located in Southeast Asia, bordered by Laos and Cambodia in the east, with Malaysia in the south and Myanmar and the Andaman Sea in the west.  The coastline is over 2600 kilometers long.  The coasts are flat.  The largest islands are: Phuket in the Andaman Sea, Samui and Phangan in the Gulf of Thailand.  And Hua Hin is a tourist city located on the shores of the Gulf of Thailand, about 200 km south of Bangkok. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Hua Hin boasts a beautiful 4 km beach.  It is here that the best five-star hotels are located.  Understanding what to see in Hua Hin, you should pay attention to the magnificent palaces, including Klai Kangwon, as well as the city station.  Translated, "Hua Hin" means "a large stone head," although it has much more in common with many sandy beaches than with stones. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Finding out what to see in Hua Hin and the surrounding area, it is worth taking into account the history of this settlement.  This city was founded by peasants in the XIX century as a result of migration due to drought.  This area became a resort only when King Rama VII built his summer residence and hotel here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="baomoi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hua hin" class="if uuid-3208113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208113.jpg"></div><h2>  Terrain </h2><p>  The city stretches from the sea to the top of the Tanaosi mountain range, the highest point of which is the mountains of Myanmar, with Khao Luang peak (1494 m above sea level).  From the mountains run down, carrying water to fertile soils and caves, the Pran Buri and Klong Kui Buri rivers (great for kayaking and canoeing).  An undoubted attraction of this region is the Khao Sam-Roy-Yot National Park, created in 1966 in order to protect the heritage of the country's largest freshwater wetlands and mangroves.  Picturesque caves are also protected on the territory of the park, of which, perhaps, the most famous, to which, by the way, a very remarkable and pleasant tour is conducted, is the Praia Nakhon Cave.  In its vicinity is one of the main attractions of Hua Hin in Thailand - the pavilion erected by King Rama V. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebesthotelsinthailand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="in the park" class="if uuid-3208115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208115.jpg"></div><p>  The original symbol of the entire province is the tree and the Ryan flower, as well as the so-called iron tree, which is an extremely valuable seasoning in Asian countries.  In Thailand, the cheapest way to travel is by bus or boat, you can visit the beautiful sandy beaches of Ao Manao, a famous place in Hua Hin in Thailand.  Here is a mythical footprint of the Buddha, as well as a museum of the fight against the Japanese army during the Second World War.  Another attraction of Hua hin is the elephant festival held every year. </p><p>  The temperature here never drops below 20 degrees Celsius, but during the rainy season the rainfall is non-stop. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Explaining what to see in Hua Hin and the surrounding area, in the reviews, tourists wrote that this city is a place where you can really relax.  There are many hotels here and the prices are really varied.  If someone likes to spend time on the beach, wake up and fall asleep, hearing the sound of waves, and at the same time want to live away from Bangkok, for them Hua Hin, according to tourists, is perfect! </p><div class="photo" data-original="dulichhoangnguyen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local nature" class="if uuid-3208118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208118.jpg"></div><h2>  Residences </h2><p>  In this city you can always go on an excursion (hotels often offer free travel at certain hours).  In the town itself you should go to the sea, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe central entrance to the beach there are picturesque cliffs, ideal for a photo shoot!  Another interesting place is the recently created retro village - Mercado de Plervan, where you can have a nice meal, shop or spend the night. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Understanding what to see in Hua Hin with children, it is worth considering that the city also has two summer residences of the King of Thailand.  One of them, in the town itself, can not be visited, because all the time it is used by the monarch, and can‚Äôt get inside. </p><p>  However, the second - Marigadaiwan - is located a little north of the city itself and is open to the public.  It is worth seeing what the traditional Thai houses of the royal family look like.  Tea House seems to be especially heavenly, where you can drink traditional Thai tea and taste local sweets. </p><p>  It is important to remember that in the city there are no problems with renting a car, even without prior booking it can be done (per day it costs about 800-1000 baht, or 1700-2090 rubles).  To get to the palace is by car, which can be used to get to other interesting places. </p><h2>  Winery </h2><p>  And if you already have a car, then it‚Äôs a sin not to go to one of the few wineries in this country.  This is an important attraction of Hua hin.  Thais do not have a developed tradition of winemaking, but they study all the time, and their wines, at least from here, are really good! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monsoon valley" class="if uuid-3208109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208109.jpg"></div><p>  Monsoon Valey itself has some very interesting sights.  Here you can taste the wines, walk along the slopes full of grapes, or have a delicious lunch.  Monsoon Valey is located in a very picturesque place, no one regrets visiting this attraction of Hua Hin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Temple in the cave </h2><p>  One of the places recommended for tourists staying in this city is the temple in the Praia Nakhon Cave.  It can only be reached by boat.  But this attraction of Hua hin is extremely beautiful. </p><p>  On foot, those who wish to visit it will have to overcome about 500 meters, however, this is the path along the stone steps along a steep staircase, and shortness of breath is guaranteed.  On the way there will be stops at several viewing platforms that perfectly compensate for such a load.  After about a half-hour intensive walk, a person gets to the goal. </p><p>  In the reviews, tourists are advised not to forget to take water with them, and more, especially on hot days.  So, those who visited the temple said that one group of 10 people had only one small bottle of water for everyone.  It is good that a nurse was nearby - she rendered first aid to a unconscious person, and due to the fact that those around had bottles of water, and someone and ice water in a thermocup, the person did not end his life in this place.  After a half-hour resuscitation, the arrived rescuers of the national park along with the ambulance staff took the tourist to the hospital.  Apparently, he had heart problems.  Be that as it may, such "climbing" is not recommended for people with heart disease. </p><p>  The cave was discovered more than 200 years ago by the then ruler of the area, who hid in its bowels in search of refuge before the storm.  The name comes just from his name. </p><p>  The huge cave consists of three grottoes.  In two of them, calcareous arches subject to erosion collapsed, forming holes through which sunlight and rain fall here.  Therefore, lush bushes and trees grew here. </p><p>  There are two openings in the arch of the first cave, and the bridge between them is the so-called Dead Bridge (the Dead Bridge, sometimes called even more menacingly - the ‚ÄúDeath Bridge‚Äù). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.toplanit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nakhon Cave" class="if uuid-3208112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208112.jpg"></div><p>  In a large cave is a red-gold building, something like a small temple.  It was built by order of King Rama V after his visit here in 1890.  The pavilion itself is not impressive, but the rays of the sun penetrate here from the outside and, upon reaching the pavilion, create indescribable visual effects, and beautiful stalactites and a grove growing in the cave add magic.  According to tourists, no photos or videos will convey her power and beauty.  You need to see it with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Palace </h2><p>  Maruehathayyavan Palace near Hua Hin was built by King Rama VI in 1923 as a seaside summer residence. </p><p>  He ordered the use of a teak tree for construction.  The new palace was built overlooking the sea in the Cha-Am area.  The location was convenient because Cha-Am was by that time connected to Bangkok by rail, and the area proved to be healthy due to the presence of forest and fresh sea air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sohu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thai palace" class="if uuid-3208106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208106.jpg"></div><h2>  All teak </h2><p>  The palace is built of teak wood and has a very attractive architectural style, which completely distinguishes the structure from other Thai palaces.  The overall design was developed by the king himself, and the palace became a very convenient place with excellent ventilation and magnificent niches.  Ercole Manfredi, an Italian architect, was hired to complete the project.  King Rama VI used the palace as a summer residence for himself and other members of the royal family until his death in 1925. </p><h2>  Love and hope </h2><p>  The house, which is also called the "house of love and hope", consists of three sections connected by long paths.  Two long covered corridors connect the palace to the beach, one leads from the king‚Äôs private living quarters and one from the female part.  King Wajiravudh, who ruled from 1920 to 1925, was a great poet and during his stay in Maruehathayyavan wrote works, sitting in his office overlooking the sea. </p><p>  His wife, Queen Indrasakdi Sachi, lived in the Samundra Biman section, which consisted of a number of rooms, including a living room, bedroom, dressing room and bathroom, as well as a corridor leading to the bathing pavilion on the beach. </p><p>  The Sevakamart section was used for official receptions, there were rooms and a theater where performances were staged.  When the royal family came to Maruehathaiwan for the summer, furniture was transported there from Bangkok. </p><p>  After the death of the king in 1925, the palace remained deserted.  Today it is completely restored, and tourists can still see some of the furniture from the king‚Äôs chambers, his desk with pencils and paper, a sofa and a bed.  A walk around the palace gives a unique view of how the Thai royal family lived almost a hundred years ago.  After visiting the complex, you can take a walk along the nature trail in the mangrove forest. </p><p>  Maruehatahayavan is located almost halfway between Cha-Am and Hua Hin in the province of Phetchaburi, about 10 kilometers south of Cha-Am and 15 kilometers north of Hua Hin. </p><p>  From anywhere you can easily and quickly get a taxi.  A local orange bus runs between Cha-Am and Hua Hin, which stops on request. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bangkok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local forests" class="if uuid-3208117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98582/3208117.jpg"></div><p>  You cannot take pictures indoors.  It is important to dress appropriately, which means the absence of short pants or short skirts, sleeveless shirts.  Guests can rent a bicycle and go on a walk through the mangroves. </p>
