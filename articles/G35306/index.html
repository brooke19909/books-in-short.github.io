The structure of epithelial and connective tissue</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tissue is a combination of cells and intercellular substance.  It has common structural features and performs the same functions.  There are four types of tissues in the body: epithelial, nervous, muscle and connective. </p><p>  The structure of the epithelial <span>tissue of humans</span> and animals is due primarily to its localization.  Epithelial tissue is a boundary layer of cells lining the integument of the body, mucous membranes of internal organs and cavities.  Also, many glands in the body are formed precisely by the epithelium. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="epithelial tissue cell structure" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/1110337.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The structure of epithelial tissue has a number of features inherent only in the epithelium.  The main feature is that the tissue itself has the appearance of a continuous layer of cells that fit tightly together. </p><p>  The epithelium lining all surfaces in the body has the appearance of a layer, whereas in the liver, pancreas, thyroid, salivary and other glands, it is an accumulation of cells.  In the first case, it is located on top of the basement membrane that separates the epithelium from the connective tissue.  But there are exceptions when the structure of epithelial and connective tissue is considered in the context of their interaction.  In particular, in the lymphatic system, an alternation of epithelial and connective tissue cells is observed.  This type of epithelium is called atypical. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  High regenerative ability is another feature of the epithelium. </p><p>  The cells of this tissue are polar, due to the difference in the basal and apical parts of the cell center. </p><p>  The structure of epithelial tissue is largely due to its borderline position, which, in turn, makes the epithelium an important link in metabolic processes.  This tissue is involved in the absorption of nutrients from the intestines into the blood and lymph, in the excretion of urine through the epithelium of the kidneys, etc. We also must not forget about the protective function, which is to protect tissues from damaging effects. </p><p>  The structure of the substance forming the basement membrane shows that it contains a large number of mucopolysaccharides, and there is also a network of thin fibrils. </p><h2>  How is epithelial tissue laid? </h2><p>  The structural features of the epithelial tissue of animals and humans are largely dictated by the fact that its development is carried out from all three <span>germ layers.</span>  This feature is inherent only to this type of fabric.  Ectoderm gives rise to epithelium of the skin, oral cavity, a large part of the esophagus, cornea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe eye;  endoderm - epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract;  and mesoderm - the epithelium of the genitourinary organs and serous membranes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In embryonic development begins to form at the earliest stages.  Since the placenta contains a sufficient amount of epithelial tissue, it is a participant in the metabolism between the mother and the fetus. </p><h2>  Maintaining Epithelial Cell Integrity </h2><p>  The interaction of neighboring cells in the reservoir is possible due to the presence of desmosomes.  These are special multiple structures of submicroscopic size, which consist of two halves.  Each of them, thickening in certain places, occupies adjacent surfaces of neighboring cells.  In the slit-like gap between the halves of desmosomes is a substance of carbohydrate origin. </p><p>  In cases where the intercellular spaces are wide, the desmosomes are located at the ends of the protruding cytoplasm towards each other on the contacting cells.  If you look at a couple of these bulges under a microscope, you will find that they look like an intercellular bridge. </p><p>  In the small intestine, the integrity of the layer is maintained by the fusion of the cell membranes of neighboring cells at the points of contact.  Such places are often called closing plates. </p><p>  There are other cases where there are no special structures to ensure integrity.  Then the contact of neighboring cells is carried out due to the contact of flat or winding cell surfaces.  The edges of the cells can tile overlay one another. </p><h2>  Epithelial tissue cell structure </h2><p>  The features of epithelial tissue cells include the presence of a plasma membrane on their surface. </p><p>  In the cells involved in the isolation of metabolic products, folding is observed in the plasma membrane of the basal part of the cell body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Epithelial cells - this is the name in science of cells that form epithelial tissues.  Structural features, functions of epithelial cells are closely related.  So, in shape they are divided into flat, cubic and columnar.  In the core, euchromatin predominates, due to which it has a light color.  The nucleus is quite large, its shape coincides with the shape of the cell. </p><p>  The pronounced polarity determines the location of the nucleus in the basal part, above it are the mitochondria, the Golgi complex and centrioli.  In cells that perform secretory function, the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex are especially well developed.  The epithelium, which is under great mechanical stress, has a system of special threads in its cells - tonofibrils, which create a kind of barrier designed to protect cells from deformation. </p><h2>  Microvilli </h2><p>  Some cells, or rather their cytoplasm, on the surface can form tiny, directed outward, outgrowths - microvilli.  Their largest accumulations are on the apical surface of the epithelium in the small intestine and the main sections of the convoluted tubules of the kidneys.  Due to the parallel arrangement of microvilli in the cuticles of the intestinal epithelium and the brush border of the kidneys, strips are formed that can be examined under an optical microscope.  In addition, microvilli in these places contain a number of enzymes. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  The structural features of epithelial tissues of different localization make it possible to classify them according to several criteria. </p><p>  Depending on the shape of the cells, the epithelium can be cylindrical, cubic and flat, and depending on the location of the cells, it can be single-layered and multi-layered. </p>

    <p>  There is also the so-called transitional epithelium lining the organs of the excretory system.  Depending on whether the <span>organ contracts</span> or stretches, the tissue takes on a different look.  So, when the bladder is stretched, the epithelium is in a thinned state and forms two layers of cells - basal and integumentary.  And when the bladder is in a compressed (contracted) form, the epithelial tissue thickens sharply, the cells of the basal layer become polymorphic and their nuclei are at different levels.  The integumentary cells acquire a pear-shaped and layered on top of each other. </p><h2>  Histogenetic classification of epithelium </h2><p>  The structure of the epithelial tissue of animals and humans often becomes the subject of scientific and medical research.  In these cases, the histogenetic classification developed by academician N.G. Khlopin is used more often than others.  According to her, five types of epithelium are distinguished.  The criterion is from which rudiments tissue developed in embryogenesis. </p><p>  1. The epidermal type, the beginning of which was given by the ectoderm and prechordal plate. </p><p>  2. Enterodermal type, the development of which came from the intestinal endoderm. </p><p>  3. Celonephrodermal type, developed from the coelomic lining and nephrotome. </p><p>  4. Angiodermal type, the development of which began from the site of the mesenchyme forming the vascular endothelium, which is called angioblast. </p><p>  5. The ependymoglial type, the beginning of which was given by the neural tube. </p><h2>  Structural features of the epithelial tissues forming the glands </h2><p>  The glandular epithelium performs a secretory function.  This type of tissue is an accumulation of glandular (secretory) cells called granulocytes.  Their function is to carry out the synthesis, as well as the allocation of specific substances - secrets. </p><p>  Thanks to secretion, the body is able to perform many important functions.  The glands secrete secrets on the surface of the skin and mucous membranes, inside the cavities of a number of internal organs, as well as in the blood and lymph.  In the first case, we are talking about exocrine, and in the second - about endocrine secretion. </p>

    <p>  Exocrine secretion allows the production of milk (in the female body), gastric and intestinal juice, saliva, bile, sweat and sebum.  The secrets of the endocrine glands are hormones that perform humoral regulation in the body. </p><p>  The structure of epithelial tissue of this type may be different due to the fact that granulocytes can take different shapes.  It depends on the phase of secretion. </p><p>  Both types of glands (endocrine and exocrine) can consist of one cell (unicellular) or of multiple cells (multicellular). </p>
