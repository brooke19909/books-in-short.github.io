    <h2>  "Volga pearl" (Yaroslavl) - reviews, advantages </h2><p>  Hotel guests note a number of positive points, namely: </p><ul><li>  original location on the river; </li><li>  the central part of the city with good transport interchange, as well as close to the main infrastructure facilities; </li><li>  friendly and helpful staff; </li><li>  there are armchairs on the balcony, and therefore enjoy the beautiful scenery with comfort; </li><li>  hearty and delicious breakfasts;  good assortment in the restaurant; </li><li>  There is a bicycle rental company near the hotel. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The following can be considered negative characteristics of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  the rooms have poor sound insulation (especially noisy in those apartments located next to the restaurant); </li><li>  standard rooms are so small that it is difficult to move around; </li><li>  when weddings are held in the restaurant, the whole hotel shudders from the noise; </li><li>  old, washed towels; </li><li>  the carpets in the rooms are very dirty; </li><li>  lamps were twisted in half of the lighting fixtures;  the view from the windows of the rooms on the river is blocked by neighboring buildings; </li><li>  there are no mosquito nets on the windows, and therefore there are always clouds of mosquitoes in the room; </li><li>  the rooms do not have dishes (but they can be taken for free at the bar). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Volga Pearl is one of the most popular hotels in Yaroslavl.  And this is not surprising, because it is located directly on the water.  It would seem that nothing should stop the guests from enjoying beautiful views, but if your windows are not facing the embankment, then most likely the landscape will be obscured by various kinds of buildings.  It is also worth noting that the rooms are too small (especially standard ones).  Nevertheless, many people choose this particular accommodation option, due to its convenient location in the central part of the city and proximity to the main infrastructure and tourist facilities. </p><p>  One of the features of the hotel is its restaurant, which is popular not only among tourists, but also among local residents.  A huge assortment of dishes is presented here, and the original interior deserves special attention.  Nevertheless, for hotel guests, a restaurant is a source of noise that keeps you awake until late at night (and especially if any banquet or wedding is held), because the rooms are just terrible soundproofing.  Therefore, if you are used to going to bed early, then this accommodation option will not suit you. </p>
