Of course, our ancestors did not attend movie theaters and did not exchange SMS messages with each other, but they were also inventors.  And their most terrible invention was the instruments of torture of the Inquisition - the Christian justice of that time. </p><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that the torture of the Inquisition had about a hundred varieties.  Some "tools" have survived to this day.  However, most often these are ordinary museum exhibits restored from descriptions.  Of course, the sophistication of the mind and fiction of the inventors of that time simply amazes with its cruelty! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="instruments of torture of the Inquisition" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/276516.jpg" width="276"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Torture Instrument # 1 - Spiked Shoes</strong> </p><p>  These are iron shoes, under the heel of which there is a sharp spike.  The victim had to stand on his heels with a spike twisted up until his strength ran out.  Imagine how hard it is to do?  So, try to stand on your toes yourself and check how much you stand in this position? </p><p>  <strong>Instrument of torture No. 2 - "heretic‚Äôs fork"</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  This brutal device consisted of four sharp spikes - two on each side.  The top two dug the heretic into the chin, and the bottom into the sternum.  This completely immobilized the victim, preventing her from making any head movements.  The head was numb, a hemorrhage in the brain began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="instrument of torture" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/276514.jpg" width="300"></div>  <strong>Instrument of torture No. 3 - "witch's chair"</strong> <strong><br></strong>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A potential witch was tied to a chair, which was suspended on a long pole, lowering him into the water for a certain time.  Then the witch was given the opportunity to take a small breath of air, after which she was again lowered into the water ... <span>This torture</span> was especially cruel in the winter.  An ice hole was made in the ice, which allowed the witch not only to suffocate, but also to become covered with a crust of ice! </p><p>  <strong>Instrument of torture No. 3 - "cat's claw"</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  In this case, this ‚Äútool‚Äù was not used to scratch the back.  He was stuck in a heretic whose flesh was torn slowly and painfully.  It got to the point that the same hook pulled out not only internal organs, but also ribs from the victim.  This, perhaps, was the most cruel ancient instrument of torture, with the help of which the servants of the Inquisition tried to obtain the recognition of a heretic! </p><p>  <strong>Other instruments of torture</strong> </p><ol><li>  Among the other torture measures invented by the sophisticated minds of the time was the so-called <span>‚ÄúSpanish boot‚Äù.</span>  This special mount on the victim‚Äôs leg with a special fixing plate, which with every refusal of the heretic to answer questions, was delayed with even greater force.  In the end, the bone in the leg broke.  As a result, the heretic remained with fragmented bones below the knee. </li><li>  One of the medieval torture devices that have survived to this day is the so-called "rack".  Today, many representatives of the criminal world are using this method to gain this or that recognition.  A person is suspended from the ceiling with shoulder joints turned back, and a heavier load is gradually hung on his legs.  As a result, unbearable hellish pain arises, up to a rupture of muscles and joints of the <span>shoulder girdle!</span> <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient instrument of torture" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/276515.jpg" width="450"></div>  To increase the effect, bandits inject adrenaline into the victim‚Äôs bloodstream, preventing her body from turning off during pain. </li></ol>
