    <h2>  history of the company </h2><p>  The MMCIS Investments Fund is a private closed-type investment organization that began its existence in 2004.  The association is a subsidiary of MMCIS Group.  Until 2006, the main goal of the corporation was to professionally manage the capital of the founders.  But since 2006, the department received the title of open investment fund.  MMCIS investments is officially registered as a private company in Panama.  Representative offices of the organization successfully operate in England and France, Israel and Turkey, Italy and Russia, Germany and Ukraine, Bulgaria and Estonia, Kazakhstan and Georgia, Latvia and Norway. </p><p>  The first part of the abbreviation MMCIS stands for Multiply Money, which in translation means increase your money.  The second part of the CIS company name in translation sounds like CIS, which indicates the organization‚Äôs preference to work with residents of the countries of the former Soviet Union.  The priority has always been and remains today to attract Russian investors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

This opens up broad prospects for conducting an individual investment policy, which automatically eliminates the lion's share of non-systemic risks. </p>

    <h2>  Unit Transformation </h2><p>  One of the most active companies that has developed in the investment services market is, unconditionally, MMCIS Investments.  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and many other countries respect the fund because of its rapid development and prosperity.  Always focusing on the interests of clients, the company management decided to create a division called FOREX MMCIS Group. </p><p>  The division was created for clients who want to independently manage their risks and take direct part in trading in the Forex market.  Like other brokers, the company offers favorable terms of trade, optimal leverage and powerful technical support.  You can say more, the organization has gone so far ahead of its competitors that it has organized a charity fund to which it transfers about 10% of its profits.  Many investors choose MMCIS Investments.  Forex traders are inclined to cooperate with a dealing center because of its reliability. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews: MMCIS Investments </h2><p>  On the Internet you can find a fairly large number of negative reviews about the company.  At the same time, we draw attention to the fact that ‚Äúblack PR‚Äù today is much more common than before.  Active attacks on the reputation of the corporation began in 2013.  All negative impacts were successfully rejected, and obligations to customers were actively fulfilled.  There were no complaints about payments.  MMCIS Investments offered exclusively highly profitable and promising projects.  The history of financial investments really deserves respect. </p><p>  What is happening in the company today is rather problematic to describe.  Discussions on forums and official statements are understood in two ways.  Many Russian-language projects are not functioning now, while foreign versions of sites continue to work properly.  Regional offices, which both performed and do their work, did not close.  According to information from the media, the company is currently in <span>litigation</span> with one of the electronic payment services, which (according to the management of the fund) stole a fairly large part of the clients ‚Äômoney, which significantly complicated the work of the corporation. </p><h2>  Rumors or truth? </h2><p>  Many argue that MMCIS Investments, an investment fund, is not really one.  Some call the structure a pyramid or professional hype, the time of which is exhausted.  The information indicates that, as the management of the company, there were obviously nominees who, in fact, are not among the employees of the organization. </p><p>  MMCIS Investments Plus company systematically made its payments until attacks on the official website and panic from customers began.  Over the years, there have been no complaints about the fund.  The reasons for the current situation in the company include the following factors: </p><ul><li>  The breakdown of important partnerships due to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. </li><li>  Black PR in order to crush competitors. </li><li>  Tough competition. </li><li>  The spread of panic among the company's customers, cashing out large amounts of funds in a short period of time. </li><li>  The blocking of funds on the accounts of electronic payment systems, as an opportunity to earn money from them on the difficulties that the company faced. </li></ul><p>  How the situation will turn around is still unknown, but discussions about MMCIS do not cease to subside, and passions only flare up.  On official sites, they continue to lay out reports on the description of the company's litigation, whether they are real remains a mystery. </p>
