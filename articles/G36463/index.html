This happens because not all bills and coins have the value whose dignity is applied to them.  And a small round piece of 50 kopecks may well turn out to be a true rarity and cost hundreds of thousands of rubles.  This situation develops through the efforts of numismatists - people collecting money, who for some rare instance can lay out a fabulous amount.  Although such cases are extremely rare, specimens worth hundreds of thousands of rubles do not pop up every day.  But to find a coin worth 5-6 thousand rubles is quite realistic.  Collectors are also willing to buy them. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Since ancient times, mankind has been trying to find a single equivalent to goods and services, using for this a variety of objects and materials.  Having come to metal processing, exchange currency began to be produced from it.  Gradually, all countries developed their own way of making cash.  In every era and during the change of power, the printing of a new sample of money began, since they were not only a medium of exchange, but also a kind of symbol of power.  Some variations of coins and notes were produced in huge batches, while others - in small trial volumes, so the value for numismatists of such prototypes that are rarely found in free circulation is very high.  According to such criteria, a modern coin of small denomination may turn out to be more expensive than the ruble of tsarist times.  One of such Russian rarities is 1 ruble of 1997 with a wide edging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who is a numismatist </h2><p>  Quite often, numismatics are confused with numismatic coin collecting, although this is rather an additional historical science that studies the history of <span>coin minting</span> in different countries and the processes of <span>money circulation.</span> </p>

    <p>  In everyday life, collectors of minted money are called numismatists, be they some rare specimens, old, of historical value, and simply collecting coins according to the principle they only know.  It can be various anniversary issues or devoted to a memorable event, which may not be of any value to others. </p><h2>  How to distinguish a rare ruble </h2><p>  The definition of a valuable copy begins with the establishment of the face value and year of issue, that is, it really should be 1 ruble in 1997.  On the side with the coat of arms under the eagle's foot, the seal of the mint is clearly visible.  The ruble was issued by the <span>Moscow Mint,</span> as evidenced by the MMD badge.  Having determined these criteria, it is necessary to turn the coin face up and look closely at the floral ornament in the upper right part - the usual 1 ruble of 1997, of which there were a large number, has a narrow edging on the edge that does not reach the final curl of the picture.  Most coins of this denomination have this appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A rather small party, which served as either a prototype or a kind of ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù, has a distinctive edging, which determined its value for collectors.  The rare 1 ruble of 1997 has a wider band bordering the edge of the coin, so the curl of the ornament seems to be hidden under the rim, as a result it is not fully visible.  In an ordinary, widespread specimen, he lacks a little edging. </p><h2>  Valuable 1 ruble of 1997.  Variety </h2><p>  In addition to coins with a wide edging, there are sometimes specimens with the so-called ‚Äústep‚Äù, when the bordering rim is not flat, but with an additional protrusion.  You might think that such a ruble would cost even more, but this opinion is erroneous.  A ‚Äústep‚Äù is just a kind of ‚Äúwide edging‚Äù, therefore its cost is comparable to its price or even lower.  There is not much hype around these very specimens. </p><h2>  How much is a valuable copy </h2><p>  As with any other product, the cost is determined by its safety and appearance.  Since the coin was issued a long time ago, the specimens constantly circulating in circulation lost their original appearance.  This is mainly due to abrasion of the surface, loss of clarity of the ornament and violation of borders. </p>

    <p>  According to some auctions of rare coin collectors, the value of 1 ruble in 1997 ranges from 2,500 (in poorly preserved copies) to 9,200 rubles if the condition is excellent.  On average, for more or less good security, you can get at an auction 3500-4000 rubles. </p><h2>  Coin Safety Assessment System </h2><p>  The following abbreviations are generally accepted in determining the state of minted money: </p><ul><li>  Unc - those who did not apply - were not put into circulation, therefore they do not have any scuffs associated with this;  scratches and notches formed during technological processes are allowed (recounting, transportation, pouring into containers);  They are distinguished by a bright metallic luster. </li><li>  XF - exceptional preservation - happens with little used coins;  may have slight abrasions while maintaining small relief details. </li><li>  VF - very good degree of preservation;  small details of the drawing are damaged, but still readable, although there are scuffs over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coin;  no deep damage. </li><li>  F - good safety - found in long-circulating money, so the picture is quite erased, but the inscriptions and the main relief are easy to read;  contours are overwritten;  There may be slight scratches. </li><li>  VG - a very satisfactory degree - the surface is worn off significantly, only large parts are distinguishable, there may be large notches and scratches. </li><li>  G - satisfactory preservation - is found in coins, in which only the main lines of the picture can be distinguished, with inscriptions and dates practically unreadable. </li></ul>

    <p>  The 1 ruble coin of 1997, when sold, is evaluated in accordance with this scale, which affects its final cost. </p><h2>  Where can I sell a rare copy </h2><p>  The lucky owner of a rare copy of the products of the domestic printing yard raises a reasonable question: what can you get besides moral pleasure.  The answer can be found in the information from various numismatist communities, where you can approximately evaluate the find.  In free access there is a "Catalog of coins of the USSR" and "Catalog of modern coins of Russia", which can more accurately determine the price of 1 ruble in 1997. </p><p>  The easiest way to sell a valuable copy in <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>This</span> can be done at the Numizmat store on Taganka and at the Taganskaya flea market located nearby.  Another way is specialized forums where you can not only communicate, but also put up for sale.  To do this, after registration, you need to carefully describe the product - 1 ruble in 1997.  The photo must be of high quality and prove that the proposed coin is the one with the ‚Äúwide edging‚Äù. </p><h2>  Sale through auctions </h2><p>  Today there are so many different numismatic and antique portals.  The most famous of them - "Russian Coin", "Numismatist", the auction house "Gelos".  These companies regularly hold auctions for which you can put on hand the rarity.  First of all, it is necessary to describe and photograph the coin in order to send a request by e-mail.  If the proposed copy is of interest, the company can directly redeem it or put up for auction.  The above companies have real representative offices in Moscow, which makes the transaction more convenient. </p><p>  In addition, you can find several more sites conducting including online auctions of rare coins.  An example is the St. Petersburg company Conros, the Rare Coins Auction House and others. </p>
