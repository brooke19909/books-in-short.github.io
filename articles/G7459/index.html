    <h2>  Eilat: where is this resort place located? </h2><p>  Today it is one of the most famous and most visited resorts in Israel.  It is located in the south of the country, where the territory belonging to the state is a wedge in Aqaba - the bay of the Red Sea, which locals call Eilat.  Here passes the conditional border between the Arabian and Sinai Peninsula.  Here, the borders of three countries merge - Israel, Egypt and Jordan. </p><p>  At the northern end of the bay, where Eilat is located, its width does not exceed five kilometers.  By Israeli standards, the city is significantly removed from the rest of the country's settlements.  The closest (190 km) is the city of Beersheba.  The outskirts of Eilat in the east almost abut the border with Jordan.  And if you imagine that it would be possible, despite the mountains, to move from the city to the west, then, having overcome only a few kilometers, you would find yourself in Egypt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  By 1948, when the independent state of Israel was officially proclaimed, Eilat was under the control of the Arabs and was a small military post.  The city moved to Israel, where Eilat began to actively develop as a tourist center, in 1949. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A great place to relax with family or friends is modern Eilat.  Where this wonderful place is located is known to many travelers from all over the world.  Here you can not only have a great time enjoying the rays of the Israeli sun and basking in the warm Red Sea, but also visit many interesting places that are located both in the city itself and in its immediate vicinity. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  It is easy to guess about the weather conditions in the region, knowing where Eilat is located.  The country is located in the dry climate zone, which is typical of deserts.  Rains here are very rare: they fall no more than 8–9 days a year, and air humidity does not exceed 30%.  In summer, the air warms up to an average of +35 ° C, but often the temperature rises to + 45 ° C.  But such high temperatures in Israel are tolerated quite easily due to dry air and winds.  Winter in the city is very warm and mild: the air temperature at this time does not drop below +20 ° C.  Water in the summer is heated to +26 ° C, and in winter - to +22 ° C.  Such weather conditions have turned the city into a year-round resort. </p><h2>  Where is it better to relax in Eilat? </h2><p>  A small town can be conditionally divided into two zones: Southern and Northern beaches.  If you are interested in where to relax in Eilat, then you should understand which of the two coasts suits you best.  Fans of a relaxing holiday or lovers of diving and snorkeling are advised to choose the South Beach.  Here are the most beautiful reefs of the Gulf of Aqaba.  There is also the “Coral Beach” (marine reserve) and the “Dolphin Reef”, where you will have the opportunity to swim with dolphins.  The distance from the city center makes this beach a peaceful place, although many hotels in the area are located next to a busy highway with heavy traffic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
