    <p>  In relation to the airport, this hotel is located, according to tourists, is not particularly successful.  By direct flights, vacationers who rent rooms at this hotel most often fly to Antalya.  The airport of this city is located more than 100 km from Alanya and, accordingly, the hotel.  To get to this hotel, its guests usually have about 3 hours.  The situation in this case is saved only by the fact that Russian operators provide their clients with quite comfortable transfer buses in most cases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  The Kleopatra Melissa Hotel 3 * (A <span><span><span>lanya) hotel</span></span></span> was built back in the last century - 1986. Moreover, the last reconstruction, judging by the information available on the websites of tour operators, was carried out here already in 2010. But cosmetic repairs in subsequent years at the hotel most likely still passed.  Tourists usually do not express any special complaints in their reviews on the Web related to the venerable age of this hotel (at least for 2017). </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKleopatra Melissa is 1700 m <sup>2</sup> .  That is, the territory of this hotel is relatively small.  And this is not surprising.  After all, the hotel is urban.  On the territory of this hotel there was only a place for a pool, sunbeds and a small terrace with tables. </p><p>  Most Germans and other Europeans live in this hotel.  There are usually not too many Russian guests here. </p>

    <p>  Silence on the territory is the main, according to tourists, feature of the Kleopatra Melissa Hotel 3 * (Alanya).  Quiet hotels in Alanya are, in a sense, even a rarity.  In most cases, city tourists can be disturbed by hotel noises.  The Cleopatra Melissa hotel is a pleasant exception in this regard.  Discos and animations (except for rare performances by visiting bards) are not held here.  That is why many vacationers believe that this hotel is best suited for family tourists with children and senior citizens.  Young people on its territory may be bored.  Well, if, of course, they do not come to the hotel in a big company and will not entertain themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  All rooms for rent at Kleopatra Melissa Hotel 3 * are of standard class.  In total, Alanya guests are offered about 120 rooms.  All rooms have: </p><ul><li>  air conditioners and telephones; </li><li>  TV sets </li><li>  safes; </li><li>  refrigerators. </li></ul><p>  The doors of rooms in this hotel are locked with an electronic key.  In terms of security, this, of course, is quite convenient.  However, in the absence of tenants in the room due to such a key, the electricity in it, unfortunately, turns off.  Therefore, the use of refrigerators in this hotel is quite problematic for guests. </p><p>  About cases of theft in this hotel no information from tourists on the web is available.  However, to leave valuables in sight at Kleopatra Melissa Hotel 3 * (Alanya), as in any other recreation complex, vacationers are not worth it just in case.  It would be better to lock them in a safe.  True, this service costs $ 2 a day in a hotel. </p><p>  Almost all rooms have balconies.  It will be convenient to sit here in the evening, admiring the surroundings or just to dry beach items. </p>
