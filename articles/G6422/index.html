This type of lending has many advantages.  One of the main ones is high loyalty to new customers and quick terms for considering cash requests.  Green Money is one of the leading MFIs in the financial services market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.publika.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="green money personal" class="if uuid-2976520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2976520.jpg"></div><p>  The company offers to issue a loan and sign an offer remotely.  This is convenient and allows you to get the right amount of money in any part of the country.  Reviews about Green Money indicate that, in addition to high speed, users can receive funds remotely directly to a bank card.  For this, after registering in your account, convenient tools for issuing and repaying a loan are offered. </p><h2>  Company Description </h2><p>  Throughout the entire existence of the company, reviews about Green Money in most cases are positive.  This is because debtors receive favorable interest rates, as well as high-quality service provided in the microfinance market.  Not every MFI can boast a large audience, the number of which exceeds 100 thousand people.  The company gained a leading position in the market due to the high speed of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.loanadvisor.sg" data-author=": Loan Advisor, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interest rate calculation" class="if uuid-2976033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2976033.jpg"></div><p>  The organization has been working for more than 5 years.  During this time, the service has undergone changes several times.  The company can not only receive profitable loans, but also earn.  There is an open investment system in which everyone can invest money at interest as dividends.  At the same time, the yield is much higher than that of most bank deposits. </p><h2>  Microfinance Services </h2><p>  About Green Money reviews also note a number of innovations regarding obtaining borrowed funds using electronic digital signature.  To do this, you need to go through a version on the organization‚Äôs website and provide your details confirming the identity of the applicant.  This may also require your photo with a passport spread.  Before concluding an agreement, it is necessary to sign an offer and consent to the processing of personal data. </p><p>  After agreeing with all the conditions specified in the document, the borrower will open a credit line for the agreed amount of funds.  This size depends on what kind of earnings a citizen has and for how long he wants to get a loan.  As a general rule, since MFIs provide small amounts, the first loan will be no more than 3-5 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Benefits of Lending </h2><p>  In reviews of Green Money you can find comments that indicate the high speed of the service.  The maximum term for consideration of an application is not more than 40 minutes from the moment of processing the application and providing documents.  Convenient functionality of your personal account allows you to save all the details.  A reliable site security system guarantees the confidentiality of all data.  The loan itself is credited to the applicant‚Äôs personal bank card within the specified time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.proptiger.com" data-author=": Sunita Mishra, "><img itemprop="image" alt="loan calculation" class="if uuid-2976038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2976038.jpg"></div><p>  Delays may be minor and are not associated with the MFI itself, but rather with the receiving bank.  In addition, a microloan in a company can be repaid in installments with a long loan term.  With the active use of the lending program, the limit increases and the interest rate becomes lower.  According to company representatives, loans are issued to all citizens with formal employment. </p><h2>  Amounts and terms of the loan </h2><p>  About Green Money debtor reviews are positive and positive.  The staff works quickly and processes applications for a second loan no longer than 30 minutes, and no more than 10. The site has a convenient extension for mobile browsers, which makes it possible to quickly issue a loan through a smartphone if necessary.  All you need is a passport and a photo of a bank card so that employees can verify its validity.  Then in your personal account all the necessary details are indicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The minimum loan amount is 3 thousand rubles.  After several appeals, the loan term can be increased up to 25 thousand rubles.  At the same time, active participants in the lending program who have never missed the deadline for repaying loans and interest receive a number of privileges.  The main one concerns the loan term - up to 168 days instead of 30, as for all company customers. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  Customer reviews of Green Money also note that MFIs are quite loyal to many borrowers.  However, the company does not issue loans to adolescents.  The minimum age of the applicant must be at least 20 years.  In addition, a citizen must be issued a bank card, which should receive money.  It is forbidden to tie someone else's card to credit the company‚Äôs rules.  It is mandatory to provide photographs or digital copies of identity documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zakon.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="green money" class="if uuid-2976526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2976526.jpg"></div><p>  Only then can the approval process be completed.  Without consent to the processing of personal data, the issuance of a loan may be rejected.  This is necessary so that company specialists can check the new borrower for debts to other financial institutions. </p><h2>  The process of obtaining a loan </h2><p>  In Green Money, your personal account is fully adapted to receive a loan remotely.  To do this, enter the username and password, as well as indicate the phone number of the person being registered.  It is through it that the process of versioning will go.  Next, on the new user page, a section will appear indicating all the necessary details of the citizen.  After filling them in and checking, access to the choice of the loan amount and terms will open. </p><p>  An individual system for calculating loan amounts is offered for each user.  This is due to the fact that the solvency of each client microfinance organization is different.  If the applicant has small incomes, it is not worth counting on an amount of 15 or more thousand rubles, as this can create a difficult financial situation for him.  After choosing the necessary amount and term of funds, within 10-15 minutes they arrive at the specified bank card details. </p><h2>  How is the debt repaid </h2><p>  In Green Money, a loan is as easy to repay as it is to borrow.  This can be done in any way convenient for the borrower.  Commission for crediting funds is not charged.  You can deposit money using bank details already tied in your account or using various types of electronic payment systems.  Also available is a transfer of company details through a bank or post office.  The funds are credited almost instantly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sensyria.com" data-author=": sensyria, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quick approval" class="if uuid-2976039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2976039.jpg"></div><p>  However, as some users have noted, delays may occur in crediting money to a company account.  In order for the loan not to be marked as past due, it is necessary to inform about the delay in payment to the organization's hotline.  Specialists will mark the payment and freeze on it the daily accrued interest until the funds arrive at the organization‚Äôs bank account. </p><h2>  Work with your personal account </h2><p>  In Green Money, it is convenient to use your personal account both on a PC and on a smartphone.  The adaptive menu adjusts to any screen resolution.  To manage personal details on the site, you must click on the tabs located in the upper part of the window.  At the bottom of the site is a navigation menu.  In it, users can familiarize themselves with the current lending conditions and shares held by the company.  All documents and addresses of microfinance organization offices are also indicated there. </p><p>  Information on the concluded agreement on the provision of microfinance services to the borrower is also available in your personal account.  It is available at any time and downloaded electronically.  Additionally, there is a section on the user‚Äôs page where the entire history of lending to MFIs is indicated.  The main window displays data on the availability of an active loan, as well as its interest rate and maturity. </p><h2>  Service &amp; Support </h2><p>  Green Money Company develops microcredit services for the population.  For 5 years of activity, the organization has opened two offices in the central part of Russia.  The staff has more than 50 people, while they work around the clock.  Borrowers note the loyalty and courtesy of the company's specialists, who are always striving to help and solve the problems that arose with obtaining a loan or paying a debt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diena.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="green money company" class="if uuid-2976530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2976530.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, this is one of the few MFIs that, when delinquencies are created, offers to freeze interest and provide installments so that the loan user can pay the necessary loan amount without increasing the body of the debt and fines.  However, for this it is necessary, if there are problems with the payment of funds, immediately contact the specialists of the company so that they can help. </p><p>  The support hotline number is constantly working, and the call from any number or operator will be free.  The response timeout is minimal.  The company offers new site users to go through online registration through the portal of public services. </p><h2>  When they can refuse to receive </h2><p>  Refusal to issue a loan may be related to the unstable financial position of the borrower.  Contrary to many opinions, microfinance is not provided to absolutely everyone, but to those citizens who are able to receive a stable income on a monthly basis.  Usually a company refuses first loans in a large amount.  Get 25 thousand rubles immediately will not work.  In addition, the reason for the refusal may be a failure to return on time or a valid active loan in this MFI or another.  All such information about active debts is checked by the company system automatically through a single database. </p><div class="photo" data-original="reachfinancialindependence.com" data-author=": Pauline Paquin, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Low percentage" class="if uuid-2976045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2976045.jpg"></div><p>  There are no other grounds for refusing to issue a loan.  The company does not set strict requirements for providing income statements.  However, it is necessary to indicate the details of the employer, so that, if necessary, MFI specialists can verify information about clients and the reliability of these data. </p>
