This is one of the most popular holiday destinations for tourists from all over the world.  Many kilometers of sandy beaches stretch along the turquoise sea, forming bays and coves.  Looking at the photos of this resort, one involuntarily begins to doubt: is this not a photoshop?  No, beautiful islands, magnificent coral reefs and picturesque bays are a reality.  But what about the resort of Nha Trang with tourist infrastructure?  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, it is also at its best.  Many restaurants and cafes in Nha Trang will satisfy any hunger.  Gourmets have the opportunity to taste both swallow nest soup and exotic seafood.  Nha Trang is suitable for any category of tourists.  Fans of an imposing beach holiday make up the lion's share of all holidaymakers.  But lovers of vibrant nightlife will also not get bored in Nha Trang.  Those who cannot live without surfing or diving will find what they are looking for in the azure waters of the bay, which occupies an honorable twenty-ninth line in the ranking of the most beautiful bays in the world.  There will be something to see in Nha Trang and lovers of excursions.  And those who care about their health can correct it in the mud baths and <span>thermal waters of</span> Thubpa.  But where to settle and which hotel to choose?  In this article we will look at a hotel called Nha Trang Beach Hotel.  We built its description solely on the reviews of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha trang beach hotel" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/719749.jpg" width="312"></div>

From the metropolitan Domodedovo, they are operated by Vietnam Airlines.  For independent tourists, this can be of some difficulty.  But the same airline company with enviable frequency sends flights to Nha Trang from Ho Chi Minh City and the capital.  So getting to the resort with a change may be the best option.  For example, from Ho Chi Minh, an hour will fly here, and the trip will cost, according to reviews, only twenty-eight dollars.  In addition, during the high tourist season (winter-spring), a whole squadron of charters departing from various cities of Russia lands at Nha Trang Airport.  The resort recently acquired its own hub: until 2001, Camran was a military air base.  This airport is located thirty kilometers from the city.  You can get to the resort from the airport by taxi (fifteen dollars) or by bus ($ 2).  According to reviews, Nha Trang occupies an advantageous position almost in the middle of Vietnam, stretched from north to south.  A railway line runs through the city, connecting Hanoi with Ho Chi Minh City.  You can also get to Nha Trang from the two main cities of Vietnam by bus.  The journey from Ho Chi Minh City will take seven hours.  The station is located in the northern part of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels 3 nha trang vietnam" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/719757.jpg" width="312"></div>

When dank and damp weather reigns in Russia, <span>Vietnam (Nha Trang)</span> will meet you with the sun and will envelop you in warmth.  You can relax here all year round.  After all, unlike North Vietnam, there is no winter in Nha Trang.  Water temperature does not fall below +24 degrees, and air temperature - +22.  According to reviews, in the summer the sea does not bring the desired coolness.  The heat reaches its peak - +32 degrees.  The best time to visit Central Vietnam, tourists call March-April.  The temperature of the air and sea is then the most comfortable.  Although most charter flights from Russia begin to arrive in the winter.  Since September, the weather begins to deteriorate: Vietnam (Nha Trang) covers the rainy season.  It lasts until December.  In May and June, despite the dryness of the air and the low probability of precipitation, winds blow, which cause unrest at sea.  However, if you are a keen surfer, you need to go to Central Vietnam at the beginning of summer.  But you should not trust bikes about the horrors of the rainy season.  Precipitation is plentiful, but short-term.  You will certainly get your share of the sun and tan.  And at a lower price.  Tours in Nha Trang require an average traveler of 25 thousand rubles.  However, prices largely depend on the season, length of stay and hotel category. </p><h2>  Nha Trang beaches </h2>

    <p>  The resort is considered the beach capital of Vietnam, and that‚Äôs it.  The local sand is crushed and frayed multi-colored shells.  This seven-kilometer beach cover allows you to maintain a comfortable temperature even under the scorching tropical sun.  Tourists claim that such sand does not bake legs.  And at the same time, heavier shells do not form a nasty dirty suspension in the surf.  Unlike most sandy beaches, the water in the sea near Nha Trang is always clear and turquoise.  The approach is gentle, but not so much as to wander knee-deep to a depth of several hundred meters.  The beaches are well equipped.  But tourists warn: almost all of them are municipal.  Only two "fives" have their own beach in Nha Trang: Ana Mandara Beach Resort and Sofitel.  The last hotel is located on an island off the coast.  As for the three-star Nha Trang Beach Hotel, it is located seventy meters from the city beach.  In order to get to the sea, you need to cross the road.  Traffic on it is busy, there is no traffic light, but tourists say: only the first time is scary.  Do not rush under the wheels of trucks, and scooters, motorbikes and other types of transport will definitely go round you if you do not fuss and rush from side to side.  On the beach there is a rental of umbrellas and sunbeds (eighty thousand dong per day for two). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nha Trang Hotel Fund </h2><p>  In the resort, only three hotels have five stars.  Of these, it is worth mentioning the Sofitel chain hotel, which occupies a whole small island.  There are two more "fours" - "Yasaka" and Que Huong.  On the territory of the villa of the last Vietnamese king Bao Dai is Bao Dai's Villas.  The lion's share of the resort's hotel base (about 50) is 3 * hotels.  Nha Trang (Vietnam) is famous for its high level of service, so - say reviews - do not be afraid to settle in "treshki".  In each of them you will find a comfortable rest.  The rooms in them are equipped with air conditioning, TVs, and the bathroom often has a separate bath and shower.  All 3 star hotels have pools.  True, in some it is located on the roof of the building.  As for the infrastructure, it is at the highest level: free Wi-Fi (including in rooms), bike and moped rental, one or more restaurants.  But in the hotel of interest to us (Nha Trang Beach 3 *) there is no pool.  Its absence is compensated by a high class of rooms.  They are spacious, some with terraces.  Local "treshki" is a profitable and economical option for relaxing in an exotic country.  On average, a double room in hotels of this category costs one and a half to two thousand rubles per night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam nha trang prices" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/720683.jpg" width="597"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  All hoteliers of the world sin with the desire to name their establishment sonically and beautifully.  In this regard, confusion arises.  Even locals can refer you to a hotel with a similar name: Palm Beach 3 * Nha Trang.  It‚Äôs okay if a taxi driver drops you off at the gates of this hotel.  The hotel we are interested in is located on a parallel street.  This is the very center of Nha Trang European quarter.  Everything that may interest the tourist is at hand.  Directly opposite is the city bus stop (a ticket for it costs seven thousand dongs).  With this <span>type of transport,</span> it is convenient to get to the market (and tourist attraction) Cho Dam, to the Maxi Market supermarket.  And two small grocery stores are generally within walking distance.  The reference point for your hotel, however, as well as for the Palm Beach Nha Trang hotel, will be a forty-five-story high-rise building.  To the sea - two minutes walking step.  If it happens that the city beach is windy and big waves, do not worry.  Take the number 4 bus at the hotel and go to the final stop.  On the beach "Panagan" is always calm.  The hotel that is of interest to us is close to the airport (half an hour drive), and to local sightseeing attractions: Long Son Pagoda and Po Nagar Tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews nha trang" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/719765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which number to choose </h2><p>  Guest rooms at Nha Trang Beach Hotel are divided into Superior, Deluxe City View, VIP City View and VIP Sea View categories.  As the name implies, a view of the sea opens only from the last, most expensive class of rooms.  They are spacious and adjacent to the terrace.  Those traveling to Nha Trang on holiday packages are usually settled in deluxes.  They are smaller, and the windows often overlook the corridor, ventilation shaft or construction site.  At the reception upon check-in, you can pay ten dollars a day, and you will be placed in VIP Sea View.  And in the rooms of the superior there are no windows at all, or they go to the construction site.  Room equipment also depends on the category.  Excellent soft and spacious beds in VIPs and deluxe.  Everywhere there is air conditioning, TV with cable channels, free internet directly in the room, an electric kettle with accessories for self-brewing drinks.  There is a minibar.  Its contents - nuts, wine and other - paid.  Judging by the reviews, tourists used the minibar as a refrigerator for their products.  But the maids, when they are cleaned, always leave two bottles of mineral water.  The bathrooms (deluxe - shower) have a hairdryer and hygiene items.  VIP rooms include slippers and a bathrobe.  The rooms are equipped with real bathrooms.  Guests are warned that they only check in at fourteen.  Things can be left in the lobby under the supervision of a camcorder.  By the way, the policy of the hotel is that passports are returned only after eviction from the room, so do not forget to make photocopies of your documents.  They clean the rooms well, even without tip, no complaints were noticed in the reviews.  This hotel is a typical local treshka.  Similar reviews are left by guests of the neighboring hotel, Palm Beach Hotel Nha Trang. </p>

    <h2>  Nya Chang Beach Hotel Services </h2><p>  This is a city hotel.  So do not count on a huge park surrounding the building.  There is only parking and a couple of flower beds.  There is a souvenir shop in the lobby, as well as a tour desk.  When booking the hotel, you can order a transfer from the airport and back.  For business meetings, the hotel has a conference room.  But the pool, unlike the neighboring Palm Beach Hotel Nha Trang, the hotel we are interested in does not.  The administration is trying to make up for his absence with excellent round-the-clock service.  The girls at the reception know a little Russian, are always friendly and try to please you as much as possible.  The hotel has a laundry service, there is a currency exchange.  Also at the reception you can arrange a rental car.  Nha Trang Hotel positions itself as a family vacation destination.  Therefore, there are quite developed services for children.  The restaurant has high chairs for babies.  But if you want to place a cot in your room (for a child under two years old), you need to agree on this paid service in advance.  As for the miscalculations in the service of tourists, the reviews mention only the absence of any twine for drying swimwear and linen.  But this is a seaside hotel.  Take the twine with you.  During the rainy season, tourists are advised to hang clothes in the bathroom.  A fan works there, and everything dries just instantly. </p><h2>  What and where to eat </h2><p>  Nha Trang Beach Hotel rates include breakfast.  It takes place in a buffet restaurant.  Breakfast guests were very pleased.  Traditionalists in food found for themselves everything that was familiar: scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages, pancakes.  Exotic lovers praise saigon, mini rolls, fried rice, Vietnamese noodles with vegetables stewed in sauce.  What tourists were very surprised about was that they serve soup for breakfast.  And not one, but three of their species.  From the Mast Tray, reviews recommend tasting Pho soup.  Where can I have lunch and dinner?  Right next to the hotel you will find a lot of small "sidewalk" trays where they sell necks, fresh and fruits.  In cafes, prices are average in the city - it makes no sense to go somewhere for cheapness.  From the reviews we can conclude that they are tasty and plentifully fed in the ‚ÄúRock Cafe‚Äù on the third line (the second turn to the right from the hotel), in the Spanish cafe ‚ÄúLa Mancha‚Äù with live music, the Tarantino bar (excellent hookah), ‚ÄúLouisiana ".  Fans of authentic Vietnamese cuisine should pay a visit to the Hon Kien restaurant (opposite the sea side, not far from the Greek tavern).  Those who can‚Äôt live a day without Slavic dishes can satisfy their nostalgia for their homeland at Check Point.  Tubers are also advised to drop by Ganesha to sample the delights of Indian cuisine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather Vietnam Nha Trang" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/719769.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions in Nha Trang </h2><p>  The convenient location of the hotel (as well as the neighboring Palm Beach Nha Trang) makes it a profitable starting point for independent travel.  What is included in the local "mast si"?  First of all, this is the island of Chi-Nguyen, on which are located: a water park, an amusement park Vinpearl Land, an aquarium and a 3D cinema.  Even if you are indifferent to these entertainments, you should still visit this attraction of the resort, because the longest railway in the world ‚ÄúWinperl‚Äù leads to it.  An equally interesting tour that you can take on your own is an immersion in an interesting and exciting world of coral reefs.  The South China Sea, according to reviews, is in this regard worthy competition to the Red.  If diving is an impossible task for you, snorkeling (snorkelling) is also suitable.  Tourists do not recommend contacting the tour desk at the hotel.  The same services, but at a price less than half, can be found at the operators on the street.  Reviews recommend starting your acquaintance with Vietnam with a sightseeing tour of Nha Trang.  It includes visits to the Po-Nagar towers built during the reign of the Cham Dynasty (seventh-twelfth centuries), the Long Son Pagoda, a giant Buddha statue, Nha Trang Cathedral, Cape Honchong and Cho Dam Market.  There are museums at the resort: oceanographic and named after Alexander Yersen.  Nature lovers can go on excursions to the "Monkey Island", the mud baths of That Ba, Yangbai and Baho waterfalls.  Once in Central Vietnam there was a separate kingdom of Tampa.  Reviews enthusiastically talk about excursions to the ancient capital and the spiritual center of this state - the land of Michonne.  The sanctuary includes seventy sacred structures. </p><h2>  Vietnam, Nha Trang: prices </h2><p> When traveling in Asia, you need to know two rules.  First: buy where locals shop.  And the second rule: feel free to bargain.  Prices for the same product may vary significantly.  For example, carved wooden figurines in a local supermarket stand, translated into Russian rubles, about a hundred thousand.  Stuffed alligators are popular among wealthy tourists (from thirty to three hundred thousand rubles).  In principle, Nha Trang is a resort spoiled by visitors, it can hardly be called a budget.  Jewelry and branded electronics are sold at higher prices than in Russia.  Reviews are advised to go shopping at Cho Dam Market.  It all depends on your bargaining ability.  You can bring down the price to half the previously announced.  Tourists usually bring home summer clothes, tea, coffee, fruits.  The popularity of local medicinal drugs is not declining.  Python fat and rubbing with cobra venom, <span>coconut oil</span> and the classic Vietnamese "star" are sold without a prescription in any pharmacy.  Beach ammunition rental on local coasts is paid.  Day use of the sunbed will cost one hundred and twenty rubles.  Food (as, indeed, everywhere) is very dependent on the class of the institution.  Let's just say: in a cafe, a tight meal together will cost 200-250 thousand dong.  But seafood prices are biting: they ask for eight hundred thousand for lobsters, and three hundred and fifty thousand dongs for a kilo of shrimp.  Excursions from street operators cost from twelve (sightseeing in Nha Trang) to twenty-five dollars (to the Northern Islands or to Yangbai waterfall). </p>
