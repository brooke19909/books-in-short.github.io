Inhabitants of the northern part of Pattaya also love this place, since it is the most well-groomed and picturesque coastal area with azure water and clear white sand.  This area is chosen for families with small children and retirees, and just those who do not like active parties, which, incidentally, can still be visited outside the area.  Near the beach, guests are greeted by many hotels that combine affordable prices and high quality service.  One of those is the Long Beach Garden Hotel 4 *. </p><h2>  Why choose a vacation on Vogamat beach? </h2><p>  As for the beaches, the length of their territory is more than 1.5 kilometers.  The entire recreation area is strewn with golden white sand, in which you can rarely find the smallest stones.  The central beach area, which is fully equipped for a comfortable rest for any tourist, is considered to be a favorite place of calm relaxation for travelers. </p><p>  There are secluded, quiet corners both in the north and in the south of Thailand, however, this does not mean that there are fewer tourists here, it all depends on the season chosen for the trip.  The average level of the width of the beach varies depending on the tides of the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãwaves,</span> but the average value of this value is about 20 meters. </p><p>  As for the cleanliness of the beach, the level of water temperature and the availability of amenities, the most optimal point of this place is the middle, since there are a number of sun loungers and sun loungers with umbrellas, even if you have to pay for it all. <br>  Speaking about the outskirts of Wongamat beach, it is worth saying that this area is not recommended for bathing holidaymakers, but walking here is a pleasure, as magnificent landscapes open up.  Although compared to other beaches, Wongamat is considered the cleanest, nevertheless even here you can sometimes notice all kinds of garbage, bags and plastic bottles on the shore.  Very often high waves rise on this beach, which impede safe swimming, and during calm you can see a muddy bottom and a dirty coast.  Depth begins almost at the coastal zone, which is also not very convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to numerous reviews of vacationers, the south of Wongamat is most beneficial for swimming, since the coast there is gentle and it is not so scary to dive into the water. <br>  For visitors to this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãThailand, the best vacation is such a form of leisure as a quiet pastime on the beach, especially noisy parties are not held here, which attracts people of retirement age and couples here. <br>  Those who wish to be treated very much will enjoy the Thai health base, which includes mud therapy, massage, thalassotherapy and others.  A massage session provided by professionals costs around 100 baht here.  The northern sector cannot boast of such a high level of customer service, therefore, the issue of improving your own leisure needs to be taken care of in advance. </p><p>  Although Wongamat is considered to be a quiet and nondescript beach, here too there is a place for lovers to come off for real.  There are also ‚Äúbananas‚Äù, scooters, and water skis, and catamarans, and boats, and much, much more for entertaining vacationers. </p><p>  Attractions are within walking distance of this beach.  The most significant are the famous temple of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and the "trick" of the area - the temple of Truth.  Many travelers, regardless of religion, come to this temple to fulfill their long-planned goals.  As for the point of location, the abode of Truth is located in the north, if you move along the coast.  Any inscriptions on the direction signs have been translated into many languages, including Russian, which greatly facilitates the process of orientation in unfamiliar areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Regarding the issue of nutrition, on a shady alley near the beach there are a large number of restaurants and cafes, as well as a market with a variety of goodies.  Nearby restaurants serve Thai, Italian and Japanese dishes, prepared only by skilled chefs using the freshest ingredients.  At the market in the central part of the beach there is a department with a variety of exotic food, but the prices there are a bit overpriced, which tourists on a limited budget will not like. </p><p>  According to tourists, the most popular restaurant in the area is Rim Talay Seafood, which serves Thai, Japanese and Italian dishes.  Other institutions work for an international audience. </p><p>  There is no direct approach to the beach, because many holidaymakers have to make a small detour to get to the place, going around all the available hotels.  Or you just need to settle in a complex located in the very center of Wongamat Beach - Long Beach Garden 4 * (Thailand, Pattaya). </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In order to get to this place, you need to take a bus passing through the second street, drive to its end and return to the beach or get off at 18 Naklua Soi Street and walk a few more meters.  The bus route ends near a sculpture depicting dolphins.  By the way, the fare in any transport costs about 10 baht.  For those who do not want to languish in a stuffy bus, there is the opportunity to catch a taxi, but this does not mean that walking already completely lose their relevance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Upon reaching da Jomtien, you can also catch a bus called Songteo, but a ticket for it will cost 20 baht instead of 10.  These buses drive through Thai streets such as Tappraya, Second, Beach, and Dolphin Sculpture.  Here the tourist has a choice: you can transfer to the songteo and get to Naklua, or you can walk for a few more minutes, enjoying the fresh air.  Walking takes 20 minutes, and a taxi can take 15, but it will cost 100 baht. </p><h2>  Hotel description Long Beach Garden </h2>

    <p>  Even if you arrive at the hotel well after midnight, you will be kindly provided with a room.  If desired, it can be changed to a more suitable one.  Please note that not all apartments have sea views.  There are rooms from whose windows you can see the unfinished building of the neighboring hotel.  The sight is not pleasant.  Another minor minus is the smell of dampness.  But for Thailand, this is considered the norm due to high humidity.  You quickly get used to this nuance. </p><p>  The atmosphere in the room is comfortable.  There are beds of impressive sizes, furniture made of wood.  In some places, you can observe traces of the hands of previous guests in the form of scratches or broken pens.  Please note that the railing of the balconies are low.  Therefore, residents of the upper floors should be careful about the surroundings.  But it's worth it, because the melodious sound of the surf comes to your ears, ships float before your eyes.  And even the unpleasant specific smell, which Thailand is famous for, will not be able to spoil a pleasant experience.  Balconies are designed to enjoy the scenery while sitting on them.  Yes, and the Thais themselves are not tall. </p><p>  The bathroom is well appointed.  There are all bath accessories (soap, shower gel, hat, sticks, shampoo). </p><p>  The room itself has a TV, tea facilities, water and air conditioning.  Quality service requires a tip.  Linen is changed daily; cosmetics are updated as needed.  For a little money, the room will be decorated with fresh flowers.  Not only for this is loved by many Hotel Long Beach Garden 4 *. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Upon check-in, two power cards are issued.  One must be presented to the manager during each trip to the restaurant.  The second is used once when receiving drinks in the bar. </p><p>  Meals are provided on a buffet basis.  Dishes are presented for every taste.  Everyone will find a favorite treat for themselves.  There are simple sausages and more sophisticated dishes.  Mostly European cuisine.  Tourists who miss homemade dumplings and borscht can enjoy all this in a nearby restaurant. </p><p>  The only inconvenience that may occur when visiting the dining room is the presence of a huge number of noisy Chinese.  They instantly sweep away everything from the table.  Therefore, it is better to come in advance.  It is better to come to other places of leisure in the hotel, for example, to the pool, when there are no Chinese.  Otherwise, you may simply not have enough space.  But they, fortunately, do not occupy the upper part of the pool.  For Chinese children there is deep.  They also do not like to swim in the sea, so you can relax on the beach from the Chinese. </p><p>  The pool itself is great.  Many tourists note that this is the best place in the Long Beach Garden Spa 4 * hotel.  Near the pool there is a bar and access to the sea. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  The beach is just strewn with local merchants who are ready to sell you anything.  But there‚Äôs no point in buying from them, since they buy all the goods at a local supermarket for a penny.  On the beach you can buy only fruits and local seafood specialties.  They are cheap.  Here, Thai massage therapists offer their services, and they certainly know a lot about massage. </p><p>  The sea is relatively clear, especially when there is no tide.  Otherwise, all the rubbish is washed ashore.  Here you can find bottles, bags, and even dead fish.  Sometimes you can suffer from a bite of jellyfish.  But it is not fatal. </p><p>  For its own beach and pool, the Long Beach Garden 4 * hotel (Thailand) undoubtedly deserves a huge plus. </p><p>  Every evening, guests of the hotel can enjoy beautiful live music performed by a popular band.  There is nothing nicer than sitting in a comfortable chair and immersing yourself in the amazing beauty of the melody. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2>

Locals can happily tell you the most interesting sights, as well as tell about their culture.  It is bad that practically no one speaks Russian here. </p><p>  Within walking distance there are many interesting places for tourists. </p><p>  Of the minor minuses, it is worth noting the presence of a specific smell, as well as a huge number of Chinese people randomly scurrying throughout the hotel. </p><p>  Towels are better not to lose.
