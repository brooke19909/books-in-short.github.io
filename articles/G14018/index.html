He was born into the family of a factory clerk near St. Petersburg in the village of Zayanie, which was located on the territory of the Gdovsk district, located in the southwestern part of St. Petersburg province.  He entered the Sestroretsk plant, where at first he was a student, and then a full-time worker. </p><p>  He became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1905.  He took an active part in the revolutionary movement in 1905-1907.  In 1909, his mother died.  Immediately after this tragedy, Pavlin Vinogradov was drafted into the army, he hid for a long time from the official authorities. </p><p>  It was possible to detain his tsarist police only in 1912.  He was tried, convicted and sentenced to a disciplinary battalion for two years. </p><p>  A few months later, Pavlin Vinogradov appeared in court again.  In the second trial, he was accused of campaigning against the king and the government.  This time the case was examined by a military court, which sentenced him to eight years in hard labor.  Pavlin Fedorovich Vinogradov served his term first in the Shlisselburg fortress, then in Siberia, in the Alexander central in the territory of modern Irkutsk region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He took part in the February Revolution, and then in the suppression of the Kornilovsky speech.  He was among those who stormed the Winter Palace.  Then in 1917 he married a girl Olga from the Pskov province, who was from the village of Vinogradov‚Äôs parents. </p><h2>  Business trip to Arkhangelsk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peacock Vinogradov" class="if uuid-2707917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2707917.jpg"></div><p>  After the October Revolution, Vinogradov received distribution to the food committee of the Alexander Nevsky District.  While working there, he was sent on a business trip to Arkhangelsk to organize the delivery to Petrograd of food, in particular, 10,000 pounds of bread. </p><p>  In February 1918, the task was successfully completed, but Pavlin Vinogradov did not leave Arkhangelsk.  Then he was elected a member of the provincial executive committee, he soon became deputy chairman, a position similar now to the vice-governor. </p><p>  Since the summer of 1918, mobilization into the Red Army began throughout the country.  Moreover, it turned out that will have to fight with yesterday‚Äôs allies - the British, Americans, French.  The peasants could not understand why they should shoot at soldiers who, even six months ago, were actually in the same trenches with them.  In addition, mobilization began in the midst of haymaking; most of them tried to evade it by any means. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A critical situation arose in Shenkursk, where the armed peasants blocked the Communists in the building of the soldiers' barracks, in which they spent several days under siege, and then were forced to surrender. </p><h2>  Suppression of the rebellion in Shenkursk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="photochronograph.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://photochronograph.ru/2013/07/25/grazhdanskaya-vojna-na-severe-rossii/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Civil war in the north of Russia" class="if uuid-2707905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2707905.jpg"></div><p>  Vinogradov was appointed one of the leaders of the suppression of the kulak rebellion in the territory of Shenkur district.  He led the detachment, which was aimed at suppressing the uprising. </p><p>  On the wall of the local barracks, a memorial plaque is still preserved, which says that the Socialist Revolutionary uprising in Shenkursk was crushed by the Red Army under the leadership of Vinogradov.  In reality, most of the peasants themselves went home to continue to make preparations for the winter, and they were not particularly interested in politics and opposition to the communists. </p><h2>  Intervention </h2><div class="photo" data-original="history.wikireading.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Intervention in Arkhangelsk" class="if uuid-2707903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2707903.jpg"></div><p>  While Vinogradov was dealing with the rebels in Shenkursk, the allies landed in Arkhangelsk itself, launching an attack on the south in two directions at once: along the Severnaya Dvina river and by rail. </p><p>  A military commissar by the name of Zenkovich tried to organize resistance by placing military units on the left bank of the Dvina.  They were based in Isakogorsk, but the plan failed, Zenkovich himself was killed at the railway station.  Most Soviet officials who remained in Arkhangelsk traveled to Kotlas by boat. </p><p>  Vinogradov created the Kotlas fortified area, a military flotilla.  Her ships also participated in battles with the White Guards in the Kotlas direction, fought with the interventionists. </p><p>  Another detachment was sent to Dvinskaya Bereznik, where the units commanded by the hero of our article joined there.  When the intervention vessels approached Dvinsky Bereznik, the Vinogradov detachment located there quickly retreated. </p><h2>  Water battles </h2><p>  In August 1918, Vinogradov was able to arm three wheeled steamers called the Phoenix, Bogatyr, and Mighty.  Each of these ships had two machine guns and two Macklin guns. </p><p>  Allied artillery was much more powerful.  However, Vinogradov with three steamboats went to Dvinsky Bereznik, where the Allied ships were already standing.  He began to move along the coast, firing at the enemy with machine guns and cannons.  Soon, they began to shoot back.  The battle lasted for more than two hours, after which the Severodvinsk flotilla of Vinogradov went up the river.  Losses amounted to nine people (one killed and eight wounded). </p><p>  Nothing is known about the losses of the Allies, it can only be argued that they were struck by such an attack and slowed down the pace of their offensive.  This was the first battle in which the White Guards and the Allies were rebuffed on the Northern Dvina. </p><h2>  The death of Vinogradov </h2><p>  Since September 8, the Red Army infantry was in the village of Shidrovo, which was located on the right bank of the Vaga River.  A Whiteguard steamer arrived there, who began shelling the village. </p><p>  According to eyewitnesses, the enemy shell hit the logs on the shore.  Most of them were split into chips, fragments of a shell damaged the guns from which the Bolsheviks fired, one of the fragments killed Vinogradov.  Now the area in which the village of Shidrovo is located is called Vinogradovsky. </p><p>  The Communist himself was buried in St. Petersburg in the territory of the Forestry Academy park. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ruskompas.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.ruskompas.ru/users/0/albums/00131/5483.shtml"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Vinogradov" class="if uuid-2707901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2707901.jpg"></div><p>  A wooden monument to Pavlin Vinogradov was erected in the village of Shidrovo.  It has not survived to our days; it can be found only in post-war photographs. </p><p>  In the very center of Arkhangelsk on Troitsky Avenue, another monument was erected to the hero of the Civil War.  By the way, the avenue itself previously bore his name. </p><h2>  Vessels named after Vinogradov </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mmflot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vessels named after Vinogradov" class="if uuid-2707904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2707904.jpg"></div><p>  During the Soviet era, Vinogradov‚Äôs participation in river battles was especially appreciated, therefore all kinds of river and sea vessels were often named after him.  It began almost immediately after the death of the hero of our article. </p><p>  For example, the ship "Murman" was named after Pavlin Vinogradov.  It was a <span>gunboat.</span>  She fought in the Severodvinsk Flotilla until 1919.  The base and sea minesweepers that were part of the navy of the Soviet Union were also named. </p><p>  In 1929, another ship was built, named after the hero of the Civil War.  During World War II, it was undermined on the way from Portland to the Aleutian Islands.  April 23, 1944 he was blown up by a mine.  Of the 42 crew members on board, only 29 managed to leave the sinking ship.  They reached the coast and survived only 9 people. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, a large timber carrier "Peacock Vinogradov" was built in Poland.  He belonged to the Northern Shipping Company. </p>
