The goal of both parties is to seize <span>state power.</span>  There is still no consensus on the <span>start</span> date of <span>the war</span> in Russia.  Some historians attribute it to October 1917, and others to the spring-summer of 18. <br><br>  <strong>Stages of the civil war in Russia:</strong> <br><br>  1. The first stage of the civil war began in May-November 18 with the formation of centers of movement against the Bolsheviks.  In February, the Union of the Revival of Russia was created in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) and Moscow by the forces of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Cadets and Mensheviks.  In March, the Union for the Defense of Freedom and the Motherland appeared under the leadership of B.V. Savinkov.  The anti-Bolshevik movement spread among the Cossacks.  In the South Urals, it was headed by A. I. Dutov, and in the Kuban and Don, the gene.  P.N. Krasnov.  A Volunteer Army is being formed in the North Caucasus under the leadership of L. G. Kornilov and M. V. Alekseev, which later became the basis of the Belykh movement.  With the support of Germany, the gene regime is being established in Ukraine.  Krasnova. </p><p>  Since May 1918, a policy of the so-called <span>"war communism" has</span> been pursued in Russia <span>.</span>  In September, the policy of <span>"red terror"</span> and "white terror" began to operate in the country. </p><p>  In March of the same year, troops of France, the USA and England landed in Murmansk, Japanese troops in Vladivostok, Germany occupied the territory of Ukraine, Crimea and part of the North Caucasus.  In May, in the Urals, in the Volga Region and Siberia, an anti-Soviet uprising of Czechoslovak troops was launched, which consisted mainly of former prisoners of war.  The result of this uprising was the overthrow of Soviet power in Siberia and the Urals and the subsequent formation of a new power from the Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries and Cadets. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On July 17, the royal family was shot without trial. </p><p>  In the fall of 18, Czechoslovak troops reached the Volga River.  Under the command of Wencesis (July 19, Kamenev), an Eastern Front was formed against them, which was able to defeat the Czechs and capture Samara, Kazan and Simbirsk.  The first stage ended with the restoration of the power of the Soviets in the Urals and the Volga region. <br><br>  2. Stages of the civil war: second.  Rebellion centers are being formed throughout the country, the movement against the Bolsheviks has reached its peak. </p><p>  November 1918 - A.V. Kolchak overthrows the Directory and establishes a military dictatorship.  Declares himself the "Supreme Ruler of all of Russia."  Then Denikin unites in the North Caucasus and Kuban the Volunteer and Don Army in the All-Union Socialist League, which in July 1919 already numbered more than 160,000 people.  This army, led by Denikin, captured the Donbass in March 19.  An army is being formed in the north of the country with the help of the Entente under the leadership of General E.K. Miller, N.N. Yudenich is preparing a campaign against Petrograd, and in Ukraine Petlyura unites supporters for his independence.  The plans of these leaders had a blow to the Soviet regime, which they could not take due to rivalry and disagreement. </p><p>  At the second stage, the scale of intervention is also expanding, troops of other countries are being withdrawn from the <span>territory of Russia.</span>  In April-August 19, the troops of the USA, England, Germany and France were withdrawn. </p><p>  3. Stages of the civil war: third (March 1919 -1920).  This is the time of decisive battles, during which it became clear that the Bolsheviks won the victory in the struggle for power. </p><p>  In November 18, the offensive begins under the leadership of Kolchak.  On December 25, his troops occupied Perm, and on the 31st of the same month their advance was stopped.  In March 19, Kolchak‚Äôs army launched an offensive against the Volga, it occupies Ufa, approaches Samara and Simbirsk.  In April 19, the troops of the Eastern Front stopped him, and in the summer they threw him to Siberia.  Dissatisfied with such a policy guerrillas organize an uprising.  At the beginning of 20, Kolchak was shot. </p><p>  In May 19, under the command of Yudenich, an attack on Petrograd began, which was stopped by the Red Army.  In October, Yudenich‚Äôs troops were driven back to Estonia and disarmed there. </p><p>  In July 1919, Denikin captured Ukraine and launched an attack on Moscow.  By September, his army captures Oryol, Kursk and Voronezh.  At the beginning of 1920, Denikin‚Äôs army was defeated, and Bolshevik power in the south of the country was restored. </p><p>  4. The final stage of the civil war (held in 1920 - 1922). </p><p>  In April 1920, Wrangel was elected "ruler of the south of all of Russia."  He forms the "Russian Army", with which he begins an attack on the Donbass.  In October, Wrangel‚Äôs troops were defeated and forced into the Crimea.  The defeat of Wrangel marked the end of the war, although there remained centers of resistance on the outskirts of Russia. </p><p>  The losses of Russia during the stages of the civil war are enormous.  The population decreased by 12 million people, and the amount of economic damage amounted to more than 50 billion rubles. </p>
