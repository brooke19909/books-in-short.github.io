    <p>  The Comintern (Communist International) is an international organization that united the communist parties of various countries until 1943.  The Anti-Comintern Pact was concluded against her.  The Comintern was organized in March 1919 at the initiative of V.I.  Lenin for the dissemination and development of the ideas of socialism.  A pact is an international <span>agreement, an agreement</span> between two or more parties.  <span>The subject of the contract</span> can be anything.  In this case, the Anti-Comintern Pact <strong> </strong>  was concluded between Japan and Germany on November 25, 1936 in Berlin.  The official goal of this was the joint struggle of these two countries against the countries of the Comintern (Third Communist International) in order to prevent the spread of the ideology of communism in the world. </p><p>  In November 1937, fascist Italy in the person of <span>Benito Mussolini</span> joined the Anti-Comintern Pact <span>.</span>  Later, several more states joined him, where people came to power who sharply negatively reacted to the communist idea and the USSR, as well as the governments of those states that shared the ideology of <span>Italian fascism</span> and Nazi Nazism. </p><p>  In February 1939, Manzhou-go and Hungary joined the pact.  Under strong German pressure during the ongoing <span>Spanish Civil War</span> in March 1939, Franco <strong> </strong>  also signed it. </p><p>  The Anti-Comintern Pact was actually turned into a military alliance.  It included new states - Romania.  Finland, Bulgaria, and besides them the governments of the countries of Denmark, Croatia and Slovakia, which were occupied by the Germans, as well as the puppet rulers of Nanjing, where the Japanese ruled, joined. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In essence, the Anti-Comintern Pact was a bloc of aggressors led by Nazi Germany.  Other pacts reinforced this pact - the Steel Pact of 1939, as well as the Berlin Pact of 1940.  This aggressive bloc took shape under the guise of fighting communism, but in reality it was only a cover for the real goals of the countries included in all the pacts led by <span>fascist Germany,</span> and masked their true intentions. </p><p>  In fact, intensive preparations were made for war against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as England, the United States of America, France and other states. </p><p>  JV Stalin on this occasion said that in our time it is not easy to rush into war, ignoring public opinion.  Therefore, the fascist leaders, before starting to fight, decided to process public opinion, misleading the people.  They began to say that they were not waging a war against England, the USA, France, but against the Comintern.  The events that followed the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact only confirmed the real plans of these states.  Germany, together with Italy, was in solidarity with aggressive politics in the Far East of Japan, and the latter recognized the fascist government of General Franco in Spain and the annexation of Ethiopia.  Italy and Germany officially recognized the puppet government in Manchuria, which the Japanese created by invading and conquering this territory. </p><p>  Later, the chain of aggressive acts increased even more.  Japan, capturing Manchuria in 1937, carried out an invasion of Central and Northern China.  Germany in March 1938 invaded Austria and captured it, and in March 1939 the Germans captured Czechoslovakia. </p><p>  On May 22, 1939, an alliance and friendship treaty was signed between Germany and Italy.  According to it, the parties undertook not to conclude agreements that would be directed against one of them, and should help each other in the event of hostilities with a third party.  On December 11, 1940, Japan also acceded to this treaty, nicknamed the Steel Pact. </p>
