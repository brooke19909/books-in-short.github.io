The choice of clothes becomes a holiday - I want to pamper the baby only with the most beautiful and most comfortable outfit.  Tiny overalls, small socks, the first boots and tights are kept by parents as the apple of an eye.  Over the years, children's things cause tides of nostalgia and warm feelings for a fleeting childhood.  The most tender and tender memories evoke booties - the first shoes of a little man. </p><h2>  What are booties </h2><p>  Booties are light shoes for a child up to a year old.  Often appear the first shoes of the baby, just starting to walk.  Protect the child's legs from injuries, cold, give additional grip to a slippery surface.  The sole of such shoes is soft, and the boots themselves do not contain rigid fixation of the ankle.  In fact - the role of socks is performed by booties.  May be decorated with additional decor. </p><h2>  Types of booties </h2><p>  Booties (the name "topics" is also found, from the word "stomp") come in different types and forms.  They can be knitted and crocheted, sewn from fabric, felt, fur.  Boots come with and without an open toe, with a strap on the rise and without it, tall as socks and low as slippers. </p><p>  Needleworkers with experience have developed a lot of patterns for knitting various models of children's shoes.  Booties in the form of sneakers, ballet pointes, with and without decor, delight the eye with a variety of ideas.  Any pattern of baby booties with sizes will allow you to sew comfortable and beautiful shoes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each seamstress thinks up shoe decoration independently.  It can be applications, flowers from beads or beads. </p><p>  Booties can also be sewn from a combination of fabrics - a leather sole, a felt sole and a soft insole perfectly perform all the necessary protective functions. </p><h2>  Sizes of booties </h2><p>  Most often, booties are sewn individually for each baby.  There is no size range for this type of shoe.  However, the masters created an indicative scheme, based on which, you can approximately understand the required shoe size. </p><p>  For sewing, you need a pattern of booties for the baby with sizes.  With your own hands, you will need to adjust the boots to the right size. </p>

A master class will help you figure this out. </p><p>  <em>1st method</em> .  To build it is necessary to draw an oval, the length of which is equal to the length of the foot of the child.  For a newborn, this is about 5 cm. 1 cm is added to the seams and freedom of fitting. </p><p>  <em>2nd method</em> .  A rectangle is also drawn, the long side of which is equal to the circumference of the oval.  For convenience, a centimeter tape measures the length of the oval. </p><p>  The oval, if desired, can be slightly changed, giving it an anatomical shape.  To do this, a small ledge for the thumb is made in the upper part, and for the remaining four, a bevel is made at an angle of about 5 degrees.  Below, where the heel is, the corners are beveled more strongly to get a sharper angle. </p><p>  For ease of construction, a 7 x 5 cm rectangle is drawn. Perpendiculars are drawn with the intersection in the center.  1 cm down from the upper border and 1.5 cm to the left (the right booties are drawn).  Point A is marked. Upper perpendicular B, bottom C, left D, right D1.  It connects with a smooth line A to B, then A to D. The thumb is obtained.  The remaining points are outlined evenly and smoothly. </p><p>  <em>3rd method</em> .  The child‚Äôs leg is encircled with a pencil.  The resulting contour is surrounded by a smooth line with an allowance of 1 cm. </p>

    <p>  Ready-made patterns are still convenient in that they already contain diagrams of booties details.  Accessories and additional items are simply scaled. </p><p>  The finished pattern can be printed on white paper.  The circuit is drawn with a grid of 1 cm cells. If the cells are smaller, it will be more convenient to reduce or enlarge the image. </p><p>  The printed circuit is reduced based on the actual parameters of the baby‚Äôs legs.  If the finished circuit is much larger or smaller, then the proportional change is carried out in several approaches. <strong></strong></p>

    <h2>  Cutting booties </h2><p>  When the pattern of booties for the baby with dimensions is ready, it is necessary to sew the resulting parts with your own hands.  Before sewing, it is necessary to cut the fabric. </p><p>  For <span>children's clothing</span> and shoes, you must choose only natural materials.  To prevent the child‚Äôs leg from breathing, breathing and not getting irritated by touching unpleasant, scratchy or synthetic material, fabrics of natural origin are used - cotton, linen, knitwear.  If the booties are winter and should warm the legs well, then the use of a lining made of natural material is mandatory. </p><p>  Booties are sewn with the inside and the outside.  When cutting for the left and for the right pair, 2 details are drawn, with the top 0.5 cm greater than the bottom. </p><p>  The selected material is processed according to the characteristics - the wool is steamed, the cotton fabrics are ironed.  The pattern is transferred to the fabric from the wrong side and is cut with sharp scissors. </p><p>  Parts of booties are cleaved with tailor pins. </p>

    <h2>  Stitching parts </h2><p>  Cut and chipped parts are sewn together.  The peculiarity of working with booties is that most models are built in such a way that the sole and top together with the inner layer are sewn at the same time.  The bootie turns out ready almost immediately. </p><p>  Before sewing the top to the sole, the lining and the outer fabric must be combined.  The stitched blank is ironed. </p><p>  Then the fabric unfolds so that the pattern is outside and inside the booties, with a stitching inward. </p>

    <p>  The resulting blank is folded in half and sewn to the sole.  The sole is arranged in layers so that the outer part that will contact the floor is inside and the lining is at the top. </p><p>  The finished stitched blank is trimmed.  Zigzag seam processed sole.  Can be overcast by hand.  The bootie is turned out and decorated as desired - ribbons are sewn for ties, and beads are glued. </p><p>  It is worth noting that on booties with appliques, the pattern must first be modeled on the fabric and sewn, and only then proceed to assemble the parts together. </p><p>  If you have built a pattern of booties for your baby with sizes, how to sew it - there should not be any questions in the work. </p><h2>  Leather booties </h2><p>  If there is a pattern of booties for the baby with sizes, you can also sew booties from fur on this pattern.  To work with the skin, it is necessary to make an allowance of 1 cm - for seams and freedom of fitting. </p><p>  The skin is stitched out with a seam, it is difficult to sew such a small part manually without experience.  To connect, decorative braiding is most often used with a thread of contrasting color or a thin leather cord. </p><p>  In fur boots, the pattern of booties for the baby with sizes may differ from the workpiece.  It is necessary to take into account what such shoes will be worn on - on a toe, a warm pantyhose. </p><h2>  The simplest booties </h2><p>  The simplest pattern of booties for the baby, with the dimensions of which it is not necessary to make lengthy calculations, is built very simply. </p><p>  First, an oval is drawn.  The length of the ellipse is equal to the length of the foot of the child, the width is equal to the width of the foot.  For a child 3 months.  the oval is 7 x 4.5 cm. </p><p>  In the upper part, a straight line is drawn perpendicular to the length of the ellipse.  To the left and right, segments with a length equal to the height of the ellipse are plotted.  A rectangle 3 cm high is drawn. A 1.5 cm seam allowance is added on each side along the length. </p><p>  The blank is cut along the contour and folds like an origami.  This is necessary in order to check whether the strip is long enough so that it fits at the bottom of the oval and forms a heel. </p><p>  If the calculations were correct, 2 workpieces for each leg are cut out.  The blanks are sewn with the front sides inward, then turned out, and the heel is sewn.  For greater softness, the heel can be sewn with a <span>blind stitch</span> manually. </p>
