    <p>  The official language in Saudi <span>Arabia is Arabic.</span>  The state religion is Islam.  The main administrative center of the United Arab Emirates is Riyadh.  The rule is carried out by an absolute theocratic monarchy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basis of the country's economy is oil production.

The government of Saudi Arabia invests a certain part of oil revenues in the further development of its own economy.  Some amounts are allocated for investing capital in countries with developed industries, as well as for lending to other Arab states. <em></em></p><p>  On this territory of the Arabian Peninsula there is a huge number of Muslim mosques.  After all, it was here in the past that Islam was founded, which is currently one of the most numerous world religions. </p><p>  Tourism in Saudi Arabia began to develop more recently.  Today, travelers are eager to come here to feel the amazing color of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and enjoy the shrines of the Muslim religion.

    <p>  Saudi Arabia attracts tourists with camel beauty contests that have no analogues in the world.  Travelers also get an unforgettable experience during the famous falconry, in which they can take a direct part. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weather and climate </h2><p>  The Arabian Peninsula is one of the few places on earth where the air temperature in summer does not fall below +50 degrees.  This explains the unusually dry and arid climate of Saudi Arabia. </p><p>  The climatic zone of the north of the country is subtropics, and the south - tropics.  But here you can see the snow.  True, it falls only in the highlands, and even then this does not happen every year. </p><p>  January air temperature in deserts and cities almost never exceeds +20 degrees.  A somewhat different picture is observed near the Red Sea.  On its coast, the air can warm up to +30 degrees. </p><p>  Summer in Saudi Arabia is unusually hot.  Do not hide here from the heat even in the shade, where the thermometer column can show a temperature in the range from +35 to +45 degrees.  But for deserts, temperature differences between daytime and nighttime are quite common.  After sunset, the sand gives up its heat so intensely that the thermometer sometimes reaches a zero mark. </p><p>  As for the rains, they fall in Saudi Arabia very unevenly.  So, in the center and in the eastern regions of the country, the season when the sky gives a large amount of beneficial moisture begins in February and ends in April.  In the west of the country, this can only be observed in the winter, that is, from the end of November to the beginning of February.  Mountains at this time are often enveloped in dense fogs. </p>

    <p>  The main attraction of the city is the Haram Mosque, which was erected in 1570. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis sacred structure is 357 thousand square meters.  m. During the Hajj, it accommodates up to 4 million people. </p><p>  Haram Mosque is a magnificent building, an example of Arabian architecture.  The walls of his nine minarets are completely lined with lilac marble.  In the central part of the structure is the Kaaba sanctuary, constructed in such a way that each of its corners is oriented to a certain side of the world.  The most interesting of them is the Eastern corner.  Among others, it stands out Black Stone.  According to some scientists, this is nothing but a meteorite.  However, believers hold a different point of view.  In their opinion, God gave this stone to Adam after the repentance of an exile from paradise.  According to legend, the stone was originally white, but after the touch of sinners it turned black. </p><p>  Another major attraction of Saudi Arabia - located near the city of Jeddah, Asir National Park.  Tourists are attracted by its interesting wildlife and unique vegetation. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Tourism in Saudi Arabia is also an acquaintance with the country's national dishes.  For travelers from Russia, the cuisine of the Arabian state, based on the culinary traditions of almost all <span>countries in the Middle East,</span> becomes a real exotic <span>.</span> </p><p>  The population of Saudi Arabia prefers lamb and poultry, lamb, fish and eggs.  Traditionally, these products are served with a side dish of rice with raisins.  There are various soups, including pea, bean and rice, among the national dishes of Arabic cuisine.  Locals love stew flavored with lentils and onions. </p><p>  At any feast in Saudi Arabia, you can find such a national dish as burgul.  Such an original name is porridge, which is prepared from wheat or corn grits, in which sour milk is added.  There is another popular dish among the peoples of this country.  This is flour porridge.  Pepper and olive oil are added to it. </p><p>  Local restaurants are sure to serve the most famous national dish.  It is called goose and includes baked lamb meat seasoned with spices, nuts and rice. </p><p>  A significant amount of the diet of the inhabitants of Saudi Arabia is occupied by a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.  But figs and dates are especially popular here. </p><p>  Among drinks, the favorite among the local population is coffee.  But he is preparing in a special way.  Coffee is flavored with cardamom, cloves and other spices. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  The development of the tourism services sector in Saudi Arabia is currently only at the initial stage.  Certain restrictions on attracting foreign visitors here are associated with strict Muslim customs.  It is because of them that many hotels in Saudi Arabia cannot possess the required number of stars.  Indeed, to obtain a certain status, one should comply with the international classification.  And only hotels located in large companies were able to go through these tests.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting the fact that in almost all hotels, visitors are offered comfort and service that meets all the necessary European standards. </p>

    <p>  The bulk of the best hotels in Saudi Arabia is located in the capital of the Kingdom of Riyadh.  Here tourists can stay in comfortable and spacious rooms and get many additional services.  The hotel has restaurants, fitness centers, spas and pools for guests. </p><p>  For those who are not yet familiar with the intricacies of tourism in Saudi Arabia, it is worth describing the principle of the Lauzan Hotel.  It was built only for women.  Here, ladies, despite the rules of conduct that exist in this Muslim country, are allowed not only to reserve rooms on their own, but also to check in. </p><p>  Tourists who come to the Kingdom on vacation can rent a separate apartment.  In the capital of the state, it will cost almost $ 800, and in other cities the price for such apartments will be up to $ 400 for one month of residence. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  What does Saudi Arabia offer its guests?  Often a country attracts the attention of those who enjoy diving.  After all, here you can admire the coral reef, which is considered one of the most beautiful on our planet. </p><p>  A great attraction for tourists will be unforgettable for their magnificence cruises on yachts plying near the coastal islands.  This short trip will not only allow you to get acquainted with the beauty of the area, but will certainly leave an indelible impression on everyone‚Äôs soul.  For such cruises, yachts are used, on board which there are air-conditioned rooms, spacious rooms equipped with video systems, as well as small and very cozy bedrooms. </p><p>  Those who prefer a relaxing holiday in Saudi Arabia have a great opportunity to fish in the deep sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Persian Gulf.  To do this, during a cruise on a yacht, you just need to talk with the captain.  If he agrees to stay in the fishing place itself, then such a nibble will be remembered by the tourist for the rest of his life. </p><p>  Disappointing Saudi Arabia only lovers of nightly entertainment.  After all, such events are not held here (based on strict Sharia law). </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  But for this to strive to Saudi Arabia is not worth it.  Despite the presence of beautiful sandy beaches in the country, not many tourists agree to enjoy the sun and sea in clothes.  That is what severe Sharia tells us to do.  Often on the beaches of Saudi Arabia, you can see the local population who dives into the water in all their robes.  And foreigners are at the same time by the sea in at least shirts and shorts. </p>

    <p>  Beach tourism in Saudi Arabia thrives only in those coastal areas that are considered the property of the hotel.  This allows you to protect people who have come to the Kingdom from meetings with the police. </p><p>  Religious Sharia laws prohibit women from appearing on public beaches at the wrong time for this.  After all, for bathing ladies in the country there are certain days and hours.  This is usually permitted only on Thursdays.  The same rules should be followed by foreign tourists, who need to wear <span>long tunics</span> on the beach, like local residents, <span>that</span> hide their legs and arms. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Those who seek to visit this exotic country on the Arabian Peninsula will need to familiarize themselves with some rules of conduct that are accepted in Muslim society before the trip. </p><p>  So, already at the entrance to the Kingdom, women should put on a long dress or burqa to close their legs and arms.  In addition, they should not appear on the street without a headscarf.  In violation of such rules, tourists are expelled from the country without any explanation.  A sharp condemnation by the police is also caused by the appearance of a woman with arms bared above the elbow and in a short dress. </p><p>  In addition, according to Sharia law, ladies of any nationality are not allowed to drive a car. </p>

    <p>  Only recently, in Saudi Arabia, the ban on video and photography in a public place was lifted.  However, those who decided to capture private or state property, as well as military facilities, can do this only with special permission. </p><p>  In this country, people who abuse drugs and alcohol, who have committed willful killings or thefts, are very severely punished.  For this, local laws provide for chopping off hands or beheading. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  For those who wish to visit the exotic Kingdom of the Arabian Peninsula, the easiest and fastest way to travel is to fly on an airliner.  But it is worth keeping in mind that not all Saudi Arabia airports accept flights from abroad.  In addition, there are no direct flights to this country from Russia yet.  To get to the Arabian Peninsula from Moscow is possible only with transfers in Dubai, Amsterdam, Kuwait or Frankfurt.  Given the various connections, the duration of the flight will be almost 10 hours.  It should be borne in mind that the time in Saudi Arabia coincides with Moscow. </p><p>  One of the international airports of the Kingdom is located near the capital.  However, the country's largest air gate is Dammam King Fadh.  King Abdulaziz Airport, located in Jeddah, takes the main care for the reception of pilgrims.  There is an airport in Medina itself.  However, it has a relatively small size, which does not allow regular flights to major airlines.  The government plans to expand this airport and its reconstruction. </p>
