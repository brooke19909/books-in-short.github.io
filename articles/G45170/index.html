Views of Mount Fuji (photo)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The real trademark of Japan is Mount Fuji.  Photos of this sleeping stratovolcano adorn all the tourist avenues about this country.  The mountain is covered with myths and legends, sung by poets, captured in the paintings of famous artists.  What brings such glory to Fuji?  Maybe it is Japan‚Äôs highest peak?  Most likely, in this case, the history of the mountain played a role, and not its geographical parameters.  In the view of the Japanese, Fuji is very far from its real image.  Even an educated person is sure that enlightened souls live in the bowels of the volcano.  Therefore, the Japanese call the mountain respectfully - Fuji-san.  Its outlines form an almost perfect cone.  At the top are Shinto shrines.  And at the base is growing no less mythical ‚ÄúForest of Suicides‚Äù.  Let's try to separate the truth from fiction and determine what constitutes a phenomenon - Mount Fuji. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount fuji" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dry science facts </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Fuji is the highest point in the entire Japanese archipelago, and at the same time, an active stratovolcano.  The peak is located on the <span>island of Honshu,</span> less than a hundred kilometers from Tokyo.  On clear days from the <span>capital of Japan,</span> you can even see the peak of the mountain shining with ice in the southwest.  Fuji is 3,776 meters above sea level.  This volcano belongs to the mountain system of the Japanese Alps.  So named the three ranges in the Land of the Rising Sun, the Englishman William Gowland.  He released a book for Europeans, "A Guide to Japan," where he compared the steep slopes of local mountains with alpine peaks.  However, Mount Fuji, Japan, is not a completely dead volcano.  The last time he erupted in 1708, and quite powerfully.  Then the streets of Edo (now Tokyo) were covered with a layer of volcanic ash 15 centimeters thick.  During this eruption, the Hohei-zan crater appeared, somewhat distorting the ideal shape of Fuji. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Fuji in Japan" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532827.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first was formed another 80 thousand years ago.  He was quite active.  And about 20 thousand years ago, a powerful and prolonged (several centuries) eruption occurred.  As a result, lava blocked the streams and the beautiful Five Fuji Lakes formed, and the old volcano completely collapsed.  The new one began to grow about 11 thousand years ago.  Its activity began to be recorded in the annals from 781.  Since then, 12 eruptions have occurred.  The largest, accompanied by the release of basaltic lava, were observed in the 800th, 864 and 1708 years.  Mount Fuji in Japan, and now has not lost activity, but just sleeping.  The fact that this is still a volcano is evidenced by many hot springs.  But the crater (with a diameter of 500 meters and a depth of 200 m) is now an absolutely safe place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Views of Mount Fuji" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532829.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fujiyama in Japanese Culture </h2><p>  For centuries, a stratovolcano has been a popular topic in folk art.  This, first of all, was promoted by ancient legends and legends.  It was believed that on the top of the mountain, in the vent itself, live Taoist enlightened men.  The smoke on the volcano is a brewed drink of immortality.  Poets and artists described Fuji-san as a mountain, the top of which is bound by eternal ice.  However, in reality, in July and August, the snow completely melts.  In woodcuts, the mountain is depicted as very steep and steep, with a slope of 45 degrees.  It was believed that only a select few could reach the top.  So, according to legend, such an ascent was made by Prince Shogoku.  However, the views of Mount Fuji, taken from different angles, show us rather gentle slopes.  Despite the fact that the volcano has repeatedly erupted, in the visual arts there is not a single picture representing Fuji raging.  Probably because in Japan it‚Äôs not permissible to show feelings even to a volcano. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount fuji photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532831.jpg" width="600"></div>

Woodcuts of Hokusai and Hiroshige, which depict a magical peak rising above a layer of clouds, captivated the imagination of Europeans.  About two hundred thousand people rise to the top every year.  And this despite the fact that climbing is allowed for only two months - from July 1 to the end of August.  But tourist expeditions are not the main suppliers of visitors to the crater of the volcano.  The share of foreigners among those who climb the mountain is only 30%.  The main goal of the ascent to the top is a religious pilgrimage.  At the top of Fuji, right at the edge of the crater, is a Shinto shinen jinja temple.  The company to the monks is composed of meteorologists whose station is nearby, and ... postal servants.  Send a postcard to relatives right from the top of the sacred mountain - this is considered a good sign in Japan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Fuji" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532832.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  World fame </h2><p>  In June 2013, Fuji was included in the UNESCO list.  It is noteworthy that she fell into this respectable list not as an interesting natural phenomenon, but as an object of cultural heritage.  This is a tribute to the fact that for many centuries the volcano inspired artists and poets to creativity.  Therefore, officially on the UNESCO list is listed: ‚ÄúMount Fuji.  An inexhaustible source of inspiration and an object of religious worship. ‚Äù  In addition, the volcano and its environs are part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu - National Natural Park.  And the five lakes - Sai, Shojin, Motosu, Yamanaka and Kawaguchi - are a resort in which Tokyo residents like to relax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Japan fuji" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532835.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Climbing fuji </h2><p>  In the season open for mountaineering, numerous rescue centers, shops and Yamagoya, tourist shelters where you can spend the night, work on the mountain slopes.  Fujiyama is divided into ten levels (gome).  The fifth can be reached by bus, although there are official routes right from the foot of the volcano.  The largest number of Yamagoy, restaurants and other tourist infrastructure are observed on the northern slope.  On the way, you will also find dry closets.  They even heated the toilet seat on the toilet (this is Japan!).  Fuji requires considerable effort from the conquerors of the peaks.  Eight hours for the ascent and five for the descent, and this is not counting the time for halts and overnight.  And if you climb from the fifth level, you can meet one <span>daylight hours:</span> three hours up and two down. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain Fuji Forest" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/532833.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Necessary caution </h2><p>  Not far from the top you can see gliders soaring.  Such flights are dangerous in principle, since Mount Fuji is famous for gusty winds and fogs.  Also, some tourists take wide ruts leading up the hill for hiking trails.  In fact, these dangerous tracks are intended for bulldozers that deliver provisions to the Yamagoya and bring down affected tourists.  Walking along such a road, despite the apparent directness of the route, is dangerous.  It is not rolled, and stones can injure not only you, but also travelers who are walking along tourist paths.  Throwing garbage throughout the route is prohibited.  In shops on the slopes you will be sold water only in exchange for an empty bottle. </p><h2>  Why go up to the top of the volcano </h2><p>  Despite the fact that you can climb up and down from the summit of Fuji in one daylight, many tourists prefer to spend the night at the tenth, highest station, in a small hut.  What makes them endure the cold and dine near the oil oven with curry noodles (three times more expensive than in the restaurant below)?  The fact is that Mount Fuji is famous for its sunrises.  Therefore, at four o'clock in the morning all the tourists leave their sleeping bags and rush with lanterns to the edge of the volcano to meet the sun.  But even if you get to the top in the afternoon with the intention of returning home in the dark, you will have an unforgettable experience.  The crater of the mountain resembles a Martian landscape.  The entire surface of the peak is covered with dark stone debris.  A weather station and sacred altars complete the strange picture. </p><h2>  Mount Fuji in Japan: Suicide Forest </h2><p>  No less popular is Jukai.  Translated from Japanese, it means "Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtrees."  During the last eruption, the lava did not affect a small, about 35 square kilometers, patch of forest at the foot of the mountain.  Since then, the trees have grown so much that they formed a dense tent of crowns and boxwood thickets.  It is said that earlier poor families brought old men and children into this forest, whom they could not feed.  And according to Japanese beliefs, the souls of the deceased remain a painful death in this world to avenge the living.  And the forest near Mount Fuji became an object of pilgrimage for suicidal individuals.  Rejected lovers, people who have lost their meaning in life, burned out at work without views to increase office plankton - all rush to Dzukai.  The number of bodies found only ranges from 70 to a hundred annually.  Outstripped Zukai in the number of suicides, only <span>the Golden Gate Bridge</span> (San Francisco). </p>
