This is due to the fact that the nature of this country is simply amazing.  It is full of stunning aromas that come from nearby forests.  In this regard, more and more people are trying to pre-book their place in one of the hotels in the resort towns of Montenegro.  One of these hotels is WGrand 3, which is located in a city called Petrovac. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wgrand 3" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location and view of the hotel </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the WGrand 3 hotel is located in a resort town called Petrovac.  The hotel building is located on a hill, which allows you to see stunning views of the city bay from the hotel rooms.  As for the hotel itself, the style of its construction is very modest and does not differ much from most Eastern European hotels.  As for the colors, the hotel owners decided to use a coral-beige color as the main one, which combines very well with white accents.  The location of the hotel in relation to significant places of the city is very good.  Firstly, near the hotel you can find the entrance to the stunningly beautiful forest, and only 300 meters from the entrance to the WGrand 3 hotel the beach begins.  The hotel is located near the center of Petrovac, just 900 meters from it.  Therefore, most of the places necessary for a comfortable life in this Montenegrin resort town are in comparative proximity to the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wgrand 3 montenegro" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580106.jpg" width="600"></div>

There is no city airport in Petrovac, so you will have to get to the resort town by several means of transport.  There are two options for arriving in Petrovac if you are located in Moscow.  The first is to get to the Montenegro resort through Tivat.  The second - through Podgorica.  There is no difference between the two methods, since the cost of tickets to these cities and the transfer from them to Petrovac are approximately the same.  By the way, the road from Tivat to Petrovac takes about an hour by bus.  The bus station is located just a kilometer from the beach of Petrovac, so further questions regarding how to find the hotel should not arise.  If you still don‚Äôt like the option with a bus, you can always use the transfer service from the airport to the hotel.  In this case, it will be necessary to indicate through which city you plan to get to Petrovac.  Otherwise, you can miss each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wgrand 3 petrovac" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580107.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  Room conditions </h2><p>  Upon arrival at the three-star Hotel W Grand, you will be assigned to the room you have booked.  All rooms are mini-apartments with their own bathrooms and kitchens.  This is a definite plus for those people who prefer to cook breakfast and dinner for themselves.  As free services that are characteristic of any type of room, you can highlight free internet that works throughout the hotel.  Another advantage of the WGrand hotel (Petrovac) is that each room provides free cable TV with a fairly large number of channels.  In order to contact the reception, the hotel owners put a telephone in each room.  In case there is a need for a car, it can be rented directly at the hotel.  A very convenient plus is the presence in each room of its own safe.  This makes it possible to keep safe their own expensive or simply important things for hotel guests.  Each room has its own minibar, which will be filled with a certain amount of alcoholic drinks in the event that the guest has activated the condition ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  If necessary, vacationers can order breakfast or dinner directly to the hotel room, which is a very convenient option for those who do not want to go downstairs to eat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews wgrand 3" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580108.jpg" width="452"></div>

Unlike most other hotels in the same Petrovac, WGrand 3 Petrovac does not have buffet breakfasts.  In order to have breakfast, you need to go to the top floor, as this is where the hotel restaurant is located.  For breakfast, you can order both ordinary sandwiches and something more substantial in the form of scrambled eggs or fried bacon.  If you want, you can eat a couple of fruits as breakfast, they are also in the hotel's assortment.  Dinner at the WGrand hotel (Montenegro) is also not bad.  The waiters can offer a choice of first, hot, cold appetizers or dessert.  If desired, you can order everything at once.  In general, the restaurant is quite large in size and accommodates 90 people.  Therefore, it can simultaneously serve on its territory all hotel guests. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt have a desire to have lunch at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant, you can go to the city and find an institution that can satisfy both your appetite and wallet.  There are plenty of such places in Petrovac, but they are always half empty.  This is not due to the fact that they are not popular with local residents or tourists, but because the town itself is not very crowded, and tourists have chosen this resort not so much that all the cafes and restaurants of the city were packed to capacity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wgrand 3 petrovac" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580109.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  Recreation and Sports </h2><p>  Hotel WGrand 3 will offer its guests a wide variety of leisure or sports activities.  For example, if you are tired of the long road to the hotel, you can use the services of a professional massage therapist, which is located right on the hotel premises.  For those people who want to maintain their physical fitness, a fitness room is provided where you can work out or do something more complicated.  People who love water sports or just swimming will be happy to know that there is a great pool on the territory of the three-star WGrand 3 Hotel, the water in which changes daily.  In addition to all of the above, you can also use the hotel‚Äôs sauna, which is located near the pool.  Hotel owners even foresaw the desires of couples with small children.  Therefore, in the WGrand 3 hotel you can find a play area for the youngest guests who can have fun with the permission of their parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel wgrand 3" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580110.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel in the glorious small resort town of Montenegro, Petrovac, has a fairly small number of rooms.  Their number is a little over 50, but at the same time each room is beautiful and cozy in its own way.  The hotel has three categories of rooms.  The first category includes standard rooms, which can be designed for both two persons and three.  These rooms are smaller in comparison with the deluxe and luxury rooms, but at the same time they are the cheapest and most popular among the guests.  Deluxe and luxury rooms can also accommodate both two and three people.  However, unlike standard rooms, there is a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments, as well as LCD TVs with a large diagonal.  Regardless of the room category, each of them provides for free access to the Internet, as well as the possibility of using air conditioners. </p><h2>  Hotel room prices </h2><p>  The cost of each room of the WGrand 3 hotel <span>(Montenegro), reviews</span> of which on the Internet are good, depends on which category of room you prefer.  A standard room for two people will cost guests $ 78.  For three people, this room can already cost $ 105.  A deluxe room for two and three people will cost 85 and 115 dollars, respectively.  <span>The deluxe rooms</span> in this hotel, as in other others, are the most expensive.  In order to move into this room, you will need to pay 110 dollars for one night for two people.  Room for three will cost $ 140. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wgrand 3 montenegro reviews" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580111.jpg" width="452"></div>

    <h2>  What you can see in Petrovac </h2><p>  Petrovac is, above all, a resort where silence, peace and nature are most valued.  If you went beyond the boundaries of the WGrand 3 hotel (Petrovac), then you can go to the sea and swim in it.  There are two beaches in the city.  The main city beach consists of pebbles, which tourists may not always like.  The second beach, Lucice, is a 10-minute walk from the main beach and has better pebbles than the main.  If you are interested in a city tour, it makes sense to go to the ancient Venetian fortress, where a night club is now located.  Another interesting place for lovers of old buildings can be the old Catholic church, which was rebuilt more than two centuries ago. </p><h2>  Opinion of people about the hotel </h2><p>  On the Internet you can find quite interesting reviews.  WGrand 3, according to them, has a very attractive appearance and comfort.  As pluses, many visitors to this hotel note the good service and friendliness of the staff at the reception.  But besides the people who liked everything at the hotel, there were those who were not as happy.  In particular, some people did not like the fact that the hotel is located on a hill.  This prevented them from freely approaching the entrance.  As a wish, one of the former guests of the hotel offered to buy large televisions in all the rooms so that you could watch TV shows with interest. </p>
