  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Suburban Real Estate of Moscow Region: Houses & Cottages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Life in the country is a special, breathing patriarchal, measured way, where there is no room for noise and fuss.  Moreover, wherever a person settles, in a luxurious cottage, a huge country house or a cozy wooden house, he always has the opportunity to have a good rest, close communication with nature and systematic restoration of health.  Recently, a rather acute question has arisen about high-quality, and at the same time, environmentally friendly housing for young families who move from noisy and crowded Moscow to a calm and spacious Moscow region. </p><p><br>  On the other hand, the Moscow region has always been and will be a promising region in terms of the development of transport interchange and infrastructure.  In addition, it perfectly combines two positive aspects: clean ecology and proximity to Moscow for those owners of suburban real estate who work in the capital.  By the way, buying a house outside the city is attractive for young families and families with several children, since the higher cost of houses, cottages and townhouses at an insignificant distance from the Moscow Ring Road will be fully justified by the sufficient amount of living space.  In addition to the treasured "squares" of suburban housing, the family receives a piece of land that can be used, if desired, for a parking lot, front garden or flower garden. <br><br>  What determines the cost of housing in the Moscow region? <br><br>  The price of an apartment or a country plot is determined by several criteria.  First of all, it is remoteness from the Moscow Ring Road and the transport direction, which will save time on the road.  There is a direct pattern - the closer the plot or cottage village is to the ring road, the more expensive the housing will cost.  In addition, the increase in the price per square meter will be all the more noticeable the higher the status of the village itself.  So, one "square" of elite-class residential space can range in price from $ 4,300 to $ 7,500, while business-class real estate will cost 35-40% cheaper.  The price of one square meter in apartments and business class houses reaches $ 2800- $ 4500, and economy-class real estate is only $ 1500- $ 2800 per "square". <br><br>  The analytical department of "Realty City" notes that the price level per square meter in apartments is lower, since the price of the mentioned housing does not include a land plot, which is naturally "attached" to lanehouses, townhouses or cottages.  That is why a certain trend in projects remains: the price per square meter in multi-storey buildings is 30-40% lower than in prestigious cottage villages, while the difference between housing in multi-apartment buildings and town houses is only 7-10%.
