His bright architectural ideas will help the quarter under consideration to become one of the most interesting in the capital as a whole. </p><p>  What about the environmental situation in the area?  In this regard, the territory in question is considered clean.  This is due to the proximity of a large number of forests and parks (for example, Losiny Ostrov National Park, due to which the territory of the Losinoostrovsky District is one of the most ecologically clean areas of the city; <span>Dzhamgarovsky Park;</span> Trofyanka <span>Park</span> ; Babushkinskiy PKiO, as well as the Yauza River Valley, which is specially landscaped for family vacations and children's leisure). </p><p>  This housing complex is easy to reach.

Closed courtyards free of transport, beautiful walking areas, sports grounds, as well as places for children's games - all this became the basis for the development of a construction plan.

There will be no identical buildings.  Each house will be individually decorated, representing one or another world city.  The main role in the implementation of this concept will be played by the design of facades.  Each of them will reproduce the plans of the most memorable cities of our planet, for example Chicago, Monaco, New York or Barcelona.  Moreover, the subject under consideration will be preserved in the design of all public areas, and even in landscape design.  This quarter will be a masterpiece of Etalon-Invest.
