    <h2>  Historical background (beginning) </h2><p>  The first mention of the city of Soltsy (Novgorod region) dates from the end of the XIV century.  Since ancient times, the settlement, and later the merchant village, has been the main stopping point on the trade route from Novgorod to the Pskov region.  In 1471, walking on the right side of the river.  The troops of the ruler of Ivan III crossed the riverbed and completely defeated the troops of the Novgorodians.  This battle was called Shelonsky and introduced a decisive factor in the history of this area on its accession to the Moscow unified state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of 1579, by decree of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, the city of Soltsy (Novgorod Region) was organized in the Wheel Suburb.  Tax-free carts were required to manufacture cannon carriages and wheels.  Thus, for about 200 years the great army of Russia was supplied with wheels. </p><p>  Over time, the managerial position of the village began to grow, which passed into the village, and then into the settlement.  In 1914, Soltsy Posad was proclaimed a city by the High Council of Ministers.  In 1915, one of the merchant families (Bogovskoye) opened a sanatorium for injured officers in its "mansions", after which the city received the status of a resort.  At the end of the 1920s, there were already 3 sources of mineral waters on its territory.  At the same time, a mud and balneological resort begins to function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soltsy city Novgorod region" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1297151.jpg" width="400"></div>
