  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect a tablet to the Internet: ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you have a tablet, it must be connected to the Internet.  Otherwise, the meaning of using such a device is lost.  Light weight and small dimensions make the tablet portable at any distance, the limited use is only in the battery charge.  When traveling there is no way to comfortably watch movies or play games, the Internet will come to the rescue.  In addition, just moving around the city, great opportunities open up - viewing current events, making appointments and chatting on social networks. </p><h2>  Connection Methods </h2><p>  The tablet can be connected to the Internet in at least four ways without using additional devices.  And with the purchase of the necessary adapters and the installation of third-party software, you can even enter the network through an Internet cable. </p><p>  You can access the Internet through your tablet in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  via Wi-Fi; </li><li>  through access points; </li><li>  via bluetooth; </li><li>  using a 3G / 4G modem; </li><li>  via USB; </li><li>  cable connection Ethernet. </li></ul><h2>  Via Wi-Fi Router </h2><p>  One of the most common ways to connect to the network is through Wi-Fi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ishopping.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wifi router" class="if uuid-2484917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2484917.jpg"></div><p>  It can be a private or public access point.  The advantages of connecting to Wi-Fi of various institutions is that it is free.  However, mobility is excluded - the Internet is disconnected outside the allowable distribution radius. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to connect the tablet to the Internet via wifi and provide constant access?  The solution may be the use of mobile Internet on a smartphone.  By activating the access point on the phone and, if both devices are nearby, the signal will not be interrupted. </p><p>  The user finds the name of the connection, enters the appropriate key, if the data matches, he can use the Internet.  Before you connect your tablet to the Internet, you need to clarify this feature.  Often, the distribution of "Wi-Fi" is limited to third parties.  There are many tools for this: </p><ul><li>  sorting by IP and MAC address; </li><li>  setting a connection session limit - the Internet does not connect when the number of connections exceeds a specified value; </li><li>  Connect exclusively via the WPS button - simplified user identification without a password. </li></ul><h2>  Via laptop </h2><p>  Often the tablet is used as an additional device for work.  This helps to share tasks and thus increase productivity.  In addition, the number of running processes is reduced, respectively, the workload of the working computer is reduced.  To work on a tablet via the Internet from a laptop, you must create an access point on the device. </p><p>  Instructions on how to connect the tablet to the Internet on a computer running Windows: </p><ol><li>  Click on the "Network Control Center" icon in the lower right corner. </li><li>  In the window that appears, select "Configure new connection." </li><li>  By clicking on it, a new window appears, where you need to select "Configure wireless computer-to-computer network."  It is important here not to confuse with the usual, because in this case the user will create a new connection, but not the distribution point. </li><li>  When a new screen appears, you must click the "Next" button. </li><li>  Now directly creates a wireless network.  There are three fields here: name, security type, key. </li><li>  In the "Network Name" field, the desired name is indicated. </li><li>  The default security type is set as in WPA2.  It provides connection via password.  You can also select the type of WPS encryption, and thus remove the password connection, and use only the button on the router for authentication.  Some router models offer a combination of these methods. </li><li>  Now you need to tick "Save settings", click "Next". </li></ol><h2>  Through another tablet </h2><p>  Connection can be made through another tablet or mobile device.  The advantage of the method is that it increases mobility.  The instruction will come in handy when the user wants to use the tablet on the road and take the Internet from a mobile. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="zululandobserver.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Access point" class="if uuid-2484925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2484925.jpg"></div><p>  Creating an access point on a mobile phone is practically no different from how it is done on a laptop.  Instructions on how to connect a tablet to the Internet on Android: </p><ol><li>  In the network settings, select ‚ÄúCreate access point‚Äù. </li><li>  Enter the network name, connection key. </li><li>  The encryption method is set. </li></ol><p>  How to connect the Internet from a tablet to a computer?  The instructions are similar, only now the access point is configured on the tablet, and the computer receives the signal. </p><h2>  3G modem </h2><p>  Connecting to a modem is one of the most common methods of accessing a network.  It does not require costs in the form of installing third-party applications, additional settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ishopping.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="3G connection" class="if uuid-2484943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2484943.jpg"></div><p>  All that is needed is included immediately after purchase.  The steps are described in the instructions on how to connect the tablet to the Internet: </p><ol><li>  First you need to make sure that you have the appropriate usb port.  In rare cases, an unsuitable connector is located on the tablet, and you have to use a special adapter. </li><li>  If after connecting the modem the tablet did not react in any way, you need to try installing the drivers.  You will also need to install a program to control the modem. </li><li>  The user must configure the modem as described in the instructions.  This is done through the appropriate application. </li></ol><p>  But what if the device is still without the Internet?  The tablet is connected, but there is no Internet?  Then you should try rebooting the device. </p><h2>  By USB </h2><p>  This method, how to connect the Internet through a tablet, involves the use of additional applications, as well as a USB cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="community.acer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="USB adapter" class="if uuid-2486321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2486321.jpg"></div><p>  The method is useful in cases where you need to connect to the Internet from a computer, but there is no Wi-Fi distribution option. </p><ol><li>  First you need to install programs such as ADB, USB Tunnel and AndroidTool. </li><li>  On the tablet, enable USB debugging. </li><li>  On the computer, in Services and Exercises, check the status of Routing and Remote Access. </li><li>  After connecting the tablet to the computer, launch Android as administrator and update the list of available devices. </li><li>  Click the connect button, after selecting the device. </li></ol><p>  After the completion of the process, you can connect. </p><h2>  Over Ethernet </h2><p>  When you need the fastest internet, you need to connect directly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bargaincableusa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power cord" class="if uuid-2484955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2484955.jpg"></div><p>  <span>How to connect the tablet to the Internet through a computer</span> via cable?  To do this, you need an adapter, the necessary drivers.  One of the recommended USB adapters is RJ45.  It is for him that drivers are needed.  Along with the installation package, you can find instructions for use.  After completing the steps described in the instructions, the adapter will work, it will be possible to connect to the network directly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The simplest methods of connecting to the Internet are via Wi-Fi, a 3G modem. </p><p>  3G connection is already losing its relevance, as there is 4G, which is much faster than the previous version.  3G networks provide a maximum speed of 3.6 Mbps, and while driving, the speed is significantly reduced.  It was established that subscribers who moved no faster than 3 km / h had a connection speed of 384 kbit / s.  Fixed objects had the ability to transmit traffic at a speed of 2048 kbit / s. </p><p>  The 4G network provides traffic speeds of up to 1 Gigabit / s for stationary objects, and up to 100 Mbit / s for users on the move. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techmoran.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fourth Generation 4G Connection" class="if uuid-2485299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85062/2485299.jpg"></div><p>  The fifth generation of 5G should provide high bandwidth compared to 4G technology.  They promise that in a megalopolis (10 thousand people or more) the transmission speed will be 100 Mbit / s, and in a group of people up to 50 people - 1 Gbit / s at the same time. </p><p>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãover Wi-Fi varies, depending on the provider package used.  If the router supports the IEEE 802.11ac standard, the transmission speed can reach several Gbps.  The 802.11n standard provides speeds up to 600 Mbps, and 802.11g - up to 54 Mbps. </p>
