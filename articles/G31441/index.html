These fantasies of units have come true, while others can make spaceships with their own hands with the child.  There are many diverse options for original crafts that even a child can handle. </p><h2>  How to make a model of a spaceship? </h2><p>  To make a bright and beautiful craft, you do not need special talents, the main thing is to follow the instructions.  For work you need to take: </p><ul><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  corrugated cardboard strips 1 cm wide; </li><li>  hot glue gun. </li></ul><p>  Finished corrugated strips can be purchased at needlework stores or cut from cardboard sheets.  Depending on this, their length will vary from 29 to 50 cm (strips of 50 cm are used in our description). </p><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  We begin to make a model of a spaceship with our own hands: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself spaceships" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/412388.jpg" width="307"></div>

    <ol><li>  It is necessary to take 2 strips and glue together using <span>PVA glue.</span>  As a result, you need to make 10 pcs. </li><li>  Each of the obtained strips must be wrapped in a tight spiral, the end of which must be glued.  As a result, you should get 10 ‚Äúgoals‚Äù.  They must be glued into one cylinder.  By the way, if you do not have strips, then the cylinder can be made from a sheet of corrugated cardboard. </li><li>  Getting to the bow.  To make it beautiful, it is recommended to take strips of different colors, they need 3 pcs.  Glue them together and twist them into a spiral, like the previous ones.  The same "washer" must be made for the engine. </li><li>  Now you need to take the spiral, put your finger inside and squeeze out the ‚Äúwasher‚Äù, so that it takes the form of a cone, you can also take a pen or knitting needle for extrusion.  Just do not make sudden movements, otherwise the paper will unwind and you will need to do everything from the very beginning.  As a result, the bow should turn out with a sharp end, and the engine with a blunt one, so that it can hold the spaceship in an upright position.  To prevent the resulting cones from blooming, inside, coat them with a thick layer of glue. </li><li>  Now you need to make additional nozzles.  To do this, take 2 strips, for example, red and 4 green.  They must be cut in half in length and width.  Then it is worth gluing them in 3 pieces into 4 strips.  They again need to be twisted into tight spirals and extended as well as the bow of the ship. </li><li>  We attach the engine to the cylinder with a sharp end, and around it we glue small nozzles.  We fix the nose of the <span>future spacecraft from</span> above <span>.</span> </li><li>  Now we need to make the wings of our craft.  To do this, take 2 strips of different colors, glue them and roll them into a tight spiral.  Then you should shape the future wings.  To do this, you need to squeeze the resulting ‚Äúpuck‚Äù into a triangle.  We attach the finished wings to the center of the cylinder from two sides at the same distance. </li><li>  Now, by the same principle, we make 2 round portholes, but only they should be small. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY spaceship" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/412385.jpg" width="320"></div></li></ol><p>  You can make such spaceships yourself with your children.  Such a product will look no worse than an expensive toy from a store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Craft: DIY spaceship </h2><p>  This option will definitely master any child, since it is very simple to do.  For this craft you need to take: </p><ul><li>  various cardboard cylinders, for example, a base for foil or cling film, a roll of toilet paper or paper towel, etc. </li><li>  plain cardboard; </li><li>  <span>double-sided tape</span> and glue; </li><li>  a glass of yogurt and cardboard cups; </li><li>  multicolored paper or foil. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself spacecraft layout" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/412389.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ul><h2>  Manufacturing process </h2><p>  Craft - a spaceship, made with his own hands, will appeal to any boy.  In addition, this is a great option for exhibitions in kindergarten and school.  We proceed directly to the manufacture of: </p><ol><li>  For the base of the rocket, you need to take 2 thick rolls: large and small.  To make a cone, just roll the cardboard, just make sure that the radius of the base is like that of a cylinder.  We connect the parts with glue or tape.  In order for the spacecraft to be able to stand upright, you need to glue the glass from the yogurt with the bottom to the cylinder on the base. </li><li>  Now you need to make 2 fuel tanks.  To do this, take 2 small cylinders of the same diameter as the base of the rocket.  Glue the cups on top. </li><li>  To make rocket launchers, you need to take small cylinders and make cones from cardboard, which must be glued on top.  Glued finished rockets to the central rocket between the fuel tanks. </li><li>  Use foil and colored paper for decoration. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a spaceship model" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/412387.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ol><p>  You can make such spaceships with your own hands even more original with the help of various decorations, for example, stars, confetti, etc. In addition, you can give your child paints and ask to decorate the crafts at your discretion, in which case you will get a real family masterpiece. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  To make spaceships with your own hands, you can also use plastic bottles.  To do this, cut off the base, make wings out of cardboard and decorate with colored paper.  In general, be creative, as your child will be very pleased to receive crafts made by parents, and not bought in a store. </p>
