Therefore, both parents and children dream of deservedly relaxing.  There are several ways to spend the summer: </p><ul><li>  Go to the grandmother's cottage, eat natural fruits and berries, walk through the woods and swim in the river.  The cottage is good in that there is a return to the origins, to the place where your ancestors live, which, perhaps, just need your love and care. </li><li>  Go to recreation centers and pensions in your region, where the usual nature, water and food are.  You will rest from cooking, you can walk, swim in the lake or river. </li><li>  Stay at home and walk in the parks, on the rides, meet with friends. </li><li>  Go to the sea - from ancient times this vacation was considered the best.  And if a trip to the sea can be combined with a visit to such a <span>natural phenomenon</span> as the Tizdar mud volcano, then this is doubly good. </li></ul>

    <p>  Holidays at sea - the best for summer pleasures.  And both for adults and for children.  The sea heals, strengthens, supplies our body with strength for the next year.  Therefore, almost all people tend to visit the sea in the summer at least once or twice. </p><p>  For Russia, the Black Sea is the most popular; Russians visit Turkey or their native coast, Crimea or Ukraine (Odessa and so on).  Salt water strengthens hair and nails, as well as the morale of a person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Amazing place </h2><p>  The volcano Tizdar, which will be discussed in this article, is not quite a volcano in the usual human notion.  This is a modern mud bath near the Sea of ​​Azov, where thousands of tourists seek in the warm season.  There are all conditions for a comfortable stay, and you can also improve your health. </p><p>  For almost all types of diseases, such as diseases of the organs of the musculoskeletal system, gynecological, skin and so on, therapeutic mud is used (Tizdar volcano, for example).  Such health resorts are very popular among Russians, as they are closer to nature and are relatively cheap. </p><p>  And if it is possible to combine useful with pleasant, mud treatment with rest at sea, then the best thing is to choose a vacation spot near the city of Anapa. </p><p>  This city is traditionally considered a children's resort.  On the beaches, everything is arranged with use and interest for children, the sea is not deep, there are bays, paddling pools, the city has places where in summer you can have a great time with the kids. </p><p>  But not only children will be happy with the city of Anapa.  The nearby Tizdar volcano awaits adults in mud baths.  This is a small reservoir located in the vent of an ancient volcano.  It’s nice to bathe in it, dirt pushes the body out, not allowing you to plunge deeply. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  From ancient times, people deified natural phenomena, because they did not understand their nature.  Volcanoes are one of the most obscure "creatures" on the planet.  Their sudden eruptions, pillars of fire - all this was scary to an ancient person.  Tizdar Volcano is also known since ancient times.  It is located in the Sea of ​​Azov, which communicates with the Atlantic Ocean.  Big water also always frightened people, although the science of navigation was gradually developing in a positive way. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  After the Pacific Ocean, the largest on the map of the Earth is the Atlantic Ocean.  It occupies the entire space between Iceland and Greenland (north), Africa and Europe (east), two Americas (east) and from the south it is limited to Antarctica.  These are truly enormous bodies of water, which are currently crossed faster by air than by water. </p><p>  <span>The name of the ocean was</span> given the name of the ancient Greek titan Atlanta (or Atlas, according to other options).  The coastline of this huge reservoir is diverse, including bays and seas.  However, the area of ​​coastal seas does not exceed one percent of the entire ocean. </p><h2>  Features of this water area </h2>

As a result, the sea became more salty over the 20th century. </li></ul><h2>  How to go? </h2><p>  150 meters from the Sea of ​​Azov is the Tizdar Volcano.  How to get there from Anapa, you can not think, but join one of the many excursions.  Many travel agencies in the city offer travelers relatively inexpensive trips to this famous place.  It is always nice to take a comfortable transport with a guide and surrender to the course of life, to go, entrusting yourself to professionals. </p>

    <p>  If you are going to visit the Tizdar volcano in your car, then you should go from Anapa through the village of Golubitskaya to the village "For Homeland" (towards the Kerch Strait).  This road is very picturesque, and it will be interesting for children to look through the windows of the car in order to absorb the nature of these places.  On the way there are many cafes and roadside restaurants where you can eat and relax, especially if you are traveling with children. </p><p>  If you turn towards the "native" village, the Tizdar volcano will be two kilometers away. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the resort is very well organized.  There are locker rooms, catering points where you can have a bite to eat and even have a great lunch, parking for your car.  Everything has been thought out for the guests to the smallest detail!  In addition to the above, there is also an ostrich farm, which kids love to visit. </p><p>  A visit to the home of these cute animals is inexpensive, but the kids really like it!  Ostriches can be fed with cabbage, which is sold right there, and the animal amusingly throws food around. </p><h2>  Joy to the kids </h2><p>  Visiting the volcano is paid, but you will not regret the money spent.  Children especially enjoy swimming in the mud.  They are trying to plunge into this dense mass, one cannot say “liquid”, but it pushes the body out, like salt water, only even more. </p>

    <p>  Kids laugh, they like this activity.  In addition, volcanic mud has healing properties, not without reason ancient people revered the volcano for something like a deity. </p><p>  Here is such an interesting volcano Tizdar.  The Sea of ​​Azov is 150 meters from the mud bath, therefore, you can wash yourself directly in this salt pond.  This is a doubly fun sight and event. </p><p>  If you visit Tizdar volcano by car, it will be better if you arrive early, before the arrival of numerous sightseeing buses from Anapa. </p><h2>  Mud and bathing </h2><p>  The volcano resembles a lake <span>(this is a crater).</span>  Various recreation centers and pensions located nearby offer to visit it.  In addition, the Tizdar volcano, the photo of which can be found in our article, is one of the most exotic places to visit in that geographical area.  Images of this place are pictures of children and adults happily swimming in the mud.  It is a dream of many people from childhood - to smear themselves well in a sticky dark mass. </p>

    <p>  After bathing in a mud spring, many people, going towards the sea, collect dirt with them in bottles, and from one person you can collect up to two liters of dirt!  Since it is strictly forbidden to take dirt out of a mud source, people collect it from themselves. </p><h2>  Mud </h2><p>  Mud volcano Tizdar is otherwise called "Blue Beam".  Gray-blue mud became the basis for this second name.  The source of this useful substance is the crater, and its reserves are constantly replenished from the bowels of the volcano.  Scientists have calculated that the depth of the source is about twenty-five meters, but there is no way for a simple person to check it: as already mentioned, it is impossible to dive into the mud.  But floundering on the surface of the source is truly good for health and spirit! </p>
