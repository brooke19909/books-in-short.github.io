For the time being, it makes no difference to the child and, nevertheless, there is a way out.  Pretty original gift - a cake made of diapers.  This is a great solution, because at first you just need a lot of diapers!  In addition, this gift has an attractive appearance, even very!  You can capture a newborn against the background of a kind of cake, thus, a grown-up child will be able to see this ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù, with which he later could quickly deal with. </p><p>  Fashionable trend - to make all kinds of unique gifts, has found wide distribution among amateurs to amaze and delight with their unique offerings.  What just do not come up!  But, believe me, it is unlikely that someone will refuse a bouquet of dollars or rubles, which may consist of several or one "roses" from a skillfully folded bill.  No worse than a diaper cake made by yourself.  The main thing is that this gift is so timely!  Having received such an abundance of diapers, beautifully decorated in the form of a cake, it remains only to pull them out, at least six to eight pieces a day.  Such is the need for them at first. </p><p>  <strong>How to "bake" a cake from diapers?</strong> </p><p>  The main thing is to stock up with the necessary ‚Äúingredients‚Äù: </p><ul><li>  diapers; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  whatman; </li><li>  decorations (toys, ribbons, bows, etc.); </li><li>  elastic bands for fastening. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Cake made of diapers</strong> .  <strong>"Cooking"</strong> </p><ol><li>  The basis for the future cake is cardboard cut out in the shape of a circle, to the center of which a paper is attached using tape and rolled up into a tube (tube). </li><li>  In the tube you can put everything that the soul wants: hygiene items <span>(shampoo, baby</span> oil, powder and more), rattles, clothes for the baby. </li><li>  Perform the lower "cake", twisting the diapers and securing them with an elastic band.  Some ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù are recommended to be used for fastening pins and scotch tape, but it is still better to do with rubber bands - they are safe, unlike pins.  Scotch can damage diapers, as well as pins, and they simply have to be thrown into the trash.  About forty diapers go to the first layer, well, it already depends on the size of your cake.  Maybe you decide to give a huge cake from diapers - then calculate the quantity yourself. </li><li>  About twenty diapers should go to the second layer, tentatively, for a standard cake. </li><li>  The third "cake" is performed by twisting each diaper into a tube and securing it with an elastic band, and only then several such tubes are fastened with a common elastic band. </li><li>  Then they <span>decorate the cake,</span> showing imagination.  If the cake is prepared for the girl - all kinds of bows, dolls, you can put a diadem on top - for the little princess.  The boy, respectively, has small cars, sports paraphernalia - everything that can be peculiar to the future representative of the stronger sex. </li></ol><p>  Do-it-yourself diaper cakes is an expanse for imagination, because it is not necessary to make a regular round cake - you can square, in the shape of a car or a stroller.  Decorating a finished cake, except for sex, can vary depending on the time of year or the upcoming holiday, for example, if a child was born on New Year's Eve - how can you do here without a traditional Christmas tree? </p><p>  In addition to the strategic supply of much-needed diapers, the cake may contain baby diapers, sheets, sets, towels, in general, everything necessary and relevant for the baby period.  It is indisputable that such a popular and useful gift can become memorable thanks to its spectacular and original design, it will decorate your child‚Äôs feast and first photo shoot. </p>
