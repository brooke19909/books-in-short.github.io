The Chinese company has released the third version of the Teclast line - X98 Pro.  An overview of this gadget will be presented below.  This model went on sale in the summer of 2015.  It is equipped with an updated processor.  Windows 10 acts as the operating system. There are modifications with two OSs, and Android is selected as the second.  In this article, we consider the features of the external design of the tablet, its technical characteristics and owner reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="teclast x98 pro review" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1946289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Accessories kit </h2><p>  We begin the review of Teclast X98 Pro with the description of a complete set.  The <span>manufacturer</span> does not offer anything unusual for the <span>tablet</span> .  In the box, the buyer will find all the necessary documentation (warranty card, certificate and manual), a USB cable and a power adapter.  Other accessories will need to be purchased separately. </p><p>  It is important to note that this tablet works with a keyboard.  When you connect it, it becomes a full netbook.  Owners can work with documents while on the go.  The manufacturer did not attach the keyboard to the factory equipment, as it was considered an additional accessory.  However, it can be purchased at any specialized store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Continuing the review of Teclast X98 Pro, we will consider design features.  Externally, the tablet has some similarities with the products of the "apple" company.  The design can definitely be called stylish and attractive.  Around the screen is a white frame.  The developers did not display any controls on the front panel.  The only thing above the screen is the front camera lens. </p><p>  The back cover of the gadget is aluminum.  The speaker and camera lens are displayed on it.  On the left side face there are mechanical buttons that are designed to turn on / off the device and adjust the volume.  On the same side at the bottom of the tablet you can see the connector for external media. </p><p>  Some comments were made regarding the location of the USB port and headphone jack.  The manufacturer for some reason placed them on the bottom. </p><p>  As for the size of the device, they, as befits a 10-inch tablet, are rather big.  The height and width of the case are 240 √ó 169 mm.  Thickness is an undeniable advantage, as it is only 7.8 mm.  If you compare some models of tablets running on Windows, then this model is the undisputed leader in this indicator.  The weight of the device is small - only 522 g. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="teclast x98 pro windows" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1946290.jpg" width="500"></div>

It is manufactured in compliance with IPS technology.  The display has wide viewing angles and excellent color.  The picture is reproduced in resolution 2048 √ó 1536 px.  Pixelization with the naked eye is not noticeable.  Resolution is 264 ppi. </p><p>  This tablet model runs on a 4-core <span>Intel Atom</span> x5-Z8500 processor.  Each of the computing modules accelerates to 1440 megahertz.  Paired with the main chipset, Intel HD Graphics is installed.  The amount of RAM in 4 GB allows you to judge the power of the gadget.  For comparison, we say that competing models provide a maximum of 2 GB.  The integrated memory in the tablet is 64 GB.  Surprisingly, the developer also provided support for memory cards. </p><p>  The operating system on which Teclast X98 Pro runs is Windows 10, and Android 5.1 is installed in some versions. </p><p>  There are cameras in this unit.  The front is equipped with a 0.9-megapixel sensor.  For the main manufacturer, I chose a resolution of 5 megapixels.  The tablet is equipped with a Wi-Fi module.  It works autonomously due to a battery with a capacity of 8000 milliamps per hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="teclast x98 pro reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1946291.jpg" width="579"></div>

    <h2>  Teclast X98 Pro: Owner Reviews </h2><p>  If you carefully study all the reviews of owners presented on the Web, you can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this gadget.  First, consider the benefits.  Most users were satisfied with the large amount of "RAM" and high performance.  The tablet does an excellent job with all applications designed for a 64-bit system.  We continue to talk about memory.  The integrated volume pleasantly surprised users, it amounts to as much as 64 GB, and the storage size can be increased due to external media.  And, of course, the indisputable advantage of this device is its excellent screen. </p><p>  As usual, there were some shortcomings.  Users attributed them to an insufficiently powerful battery and processor heating.  Also, the fact that the developers did not use <span>an oleophobic coating</span> was attributed to the weaknesses, which is why the screen becomes very dirty. </p>
