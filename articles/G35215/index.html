    <h2>  Nina Khrushchev: biography </h2><p>  Nina was born in <span>1900</span> in the city of Vasiliv.  At this time, he belonged to the Lublin province.  Her parents were simple peasants.  At nine, the girl went to a rural school.  She always studied diligently, was collected and accurate.  She later graduated from the Mariinsky Women's School.  During the evacuation, he got to Odessa with him.  She worked in the office of the training department. </p><p>  In 1920, it clandestinely sided with the CPSU (B.).  In June of that year, she was sent to the Polish front as an agitator.  A little later in the fall, Nina went to study at the Communist University named after Ya. M. Sverdlov.  In 1921 she was sent to the city of Bakhmut in the Donbas to teach at a local party school. </p><p>  In 1922, she almost died of typhus.  The woman was persistent and strong-willed.  A short time after the illness, she was sent to work: to train teachers in Taganrog.  I met Nikita Khrushchev in Yuzovka, where she worked at a party school. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Widower Khrushchev </h2><p>  At the time of the meeting, Khrushchev was already a young widower and had a son and daughter.  He got married early.  A handsome guy, dancer, harmonist and athlete was an enviable groom.  It is not surprising that the girls did not give him a pass.  The first wife of Khrushchev is Efrosinya Pisareva.  She was a real clever and beautiful.  Unfortunately, the woman died of typhus, leaving Nikita with two children.  Khrushchev was very worried about the departure of his beloved, but he had to live on.  Since he was still very young, and the children needed a mother, he caught up with Nina Petrovna.  Her warmth, friendliness, sincerity and at the same time purposefulness conquered Nikita. </p><h2>  Fateful meeting </h2><p>  Nina Kukharchuk was a pretty Ukrainian with a boyish haircut and a round face.  They were internally very similar - children of their era.  Nina had the gift of persuasion, good oratory.  Since Kukharchuk was born in Poland, from childhood she knew three languages: </p><ul><li>  Ukrainian; </li><li>  Russian </li><li>  Polish. </li></ul><p>  Later, Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva perfectly mastered English.  Her ignorance and primitiveness is nothing but the rumors that envious people spread. </p><h2>  Simple communist </h2><p>  Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva worked like everyone else.  She did not think that anything was different from any other Soviet woman.  Her working day began at eight in the morning, and sometimes she got home no earlier than nine.  Nina Petrovna headed the party department at the electric lamp factory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  She rode to work by tram.  The woman could not even think about protection.  Until the mid-60s, her passport indicated that her name was Nina Kukharchuk.  The couple did not see the need to register a relationship.  They signed only after Nikita Khrushchev resigned and they needed to register together in a new place. </p><h2>  Strong family and husband‚Äôs wisdom </h2><p>  In marital life, Khrushchev (first secretary of the <span>Central Committee of the CPSU)</span> behaved in accordance with the principles of the psychology of independence.  He was hardly familiar with this teaching, but he chose such tactics intuitively.  He did not limit his family members in anything and respected the opinions of everyone.  Respecting other people's psychological boundaries is the key to a happy married life. </p><p>  Khrushchev‚Äôs children also did what they wanted.  Parents did not choose professions for them, but made it possible to develop the abilities laid down by nature.  Rada and Julia learned to become a journalist.  Elena devoted herself to jurisprudence.  Son Sergey realized his father's dream and became an engineer. </p><h2>  Full house of children </h2><p>  The Khrushchev couple had three more children.  The laughter of the children always sounded in their house.  Nephews also loved to visit Nina.  The wife of Nikita Sergeevich was responsive and kind, but at the same time strict and organized. </p>

    <p>  She did not deal with household issues.  I just checked the instructions given to the servant.  She never stood behind the stove, did not tidy up, and did not bring comfort to the house.  Spouses lived in state government apartments.  Nothing belonged to them here.  And most importantly, she did not like alcohol in the house. </p><h2>  Funny delegation </h2><p>  In 1961, the Khrushchev couple went to Vienna to meet with President <span>John F. Kennedy there.</span>  He was accompanied by his wife Jacqueline - a tall, slender, tastefully dressed lady.  It is impossible to look at their joint photo without a smile.  Nina Khrushcheva and Jacqueline Kennedy looked so funny next.  Nikita Sergeyevich‚Äôs wife looked a little strange for the ‚Äúhigh society‚Äù: half-gray hair, a simple dress that looked more like home clothes.  But at the same time, she behaved unchained, smiling and joking.  Inside this woman a fire burned that could warm anyone. </p>

    <p>  Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva at the meeting amazed everyone with her excellent knowledge of English.  She completely replaced the translator.  The woman had an excellent education, spoke fluent in three languages.  In addition, she approached the visit responsibly and adjusted her pronunciation in special courses. </p>

    <p>  Nikita Khrushchev and his wife went to meet with the US president to show that they can be closer to America, and that they are ready for a new round in relations.  These lovely, full and friendly people who absolutely did not fit into the overall picture of the ‚Äúhigh society‚Äù made a wonderful impression.  No one expected that the huge and formidable USSR was controlled by an eccentric fat man, brandishing a boot and embarrassed at the sight of Latin American dancers.  Nina Khrushcheva and Jacqueline Kennedy chatted like bosom friends just half an hour after meeting. </p>
