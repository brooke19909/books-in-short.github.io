Countless many different hotels are scattered throughout their territory - cheap hostels, low-budget hotels, cozy houses, five-star complexes.  It’s not necessary to list everything, but it’s not necessary either, since now I would like to touch upon only one option.  And this is Manathai Surin Phuket. </p>

    <h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a very advantageous place from a tourist point of view.  It is important for every visitor that it is easy to get anywhere from the hotel in which he decided to stay.  Well, Manathai Surin Phuket wins in this regard. </p><p>  The large Plaza Surin Shopping Center can be reached in 2-3 minutes.  Bliss Beach Club is approximately 15 minutes away.  Tesco Lotus Supermarket is just 2.5 kilometers from the hotel.  The popular Laguna Phuket Golf Club is 4.4 km away. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that in just 10 minutes you can walk to Laem Sing, a little-known beach located in a small but very picturesque lagoon.  Clean and calm sea, magnificent views of the jungle and mountains, the absence of annoying merchants ... If you want to be in such a place, then definitely worth going to this beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also quickly get to Kathu Falls, Kalim Bay, Phuket Fantasy Park and Khao Phra Theo National Park from the hotel.  And also, importantly, to the international airport.  It is only 15 kilometers away. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Manathai Surin Phuket is a short walk <span>from Surin Beach.</span>  In length, it is slightly less than a kilometer, and is limited to huge stones in the water, which are hard to miss.  The beach is wide, covered with sun loungers and umbrellas, which even in the midst of the swimming season are enough for all vacationers. </p><p>  I am glad that the ebbs and flows in Surin Beach are not so pronounced as in the same Bang Tao, located in the neighborhood.  And here is very pleasant, fine, delicate cream-colored sand.  The sludge is absent, which ensures transparency and purity of water, which is not without reason called azure. </p><p>  Cleanliness is constantly monitored here, regularly cleaning up the garbage and other consequences of tourist vacations.  However, it is not difficult for the guests of the resort themselves to maintain the tidy condition of the beach, since there are enough waste baskets on it. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to the prices of tours to Thailand, in Manathai Surin.  A weekly trip with good conditions from a reliable tour operator will cost about 100-110 thousand rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  Paying for a direct flight from Vnukovo to Phuket International and vice versa.  Flights are convenient - they are selected so that people do not have to wait at the hotel due to early arrival or wait a few hours at the airport on the way back due to the fact that the check-out is too early. </li><li>  Deluxe accommodation with a balcony and pool view. </li><li>  Payment of breakfast for the whole stay. </li><li>  Taxes and fees (including fuel). </li></ul><p>  In principle, the price of tours to Thailand is low.  A trip costs more profitable than an independent trip.  In addition, direct flights to Thailand and back still need to look.  The price of round-trip tickets is 50,000 rubles - and this is only for one person. </p><h2>  When is the best time to fly? </h2><p>  Phuket is always warm.  The tropical monsoon climate reigns here, and this feature divides the year into two seasons - dry and wet.  The first lasts from November to April, and the second from May to October.  Tours to Thailand at any time of the year are in demand, but when is it really best to fly here? </p><p>  Definitely not in the rainy season.  Showers here are very strong, short-term (do not drag out longer than 30-40 minutes), and are amazingly frequent.  Lulls do not last more than 15-20 minutes.  Of course, during this period on the island there is extremely high humidity, which sometimes reaches 90%. </p><p>  The rainy season begins in August, near the end of the month.  In September there is a peak - this is the wettest month of the year.  And everything subsides in October.  Tours to Thailand in the second month of autumn are bought up especially actively.  Why?  Because the showers are retreating, the weather is normalizing, but hotel prices remain as low as in August and September. </p><p>  High humidity is also observed in April and May.  In June it is hot, 32-34 degrees, but showers often.  Also during this period, monsoons bring winds that cool the air a little. </p><p>  The best months to relax are January and February.  The driest and sunniest of the year!  And the sea, moreover, at this time is very calm, warm and clean. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say that for many years now, one of the most visited world resorts is Thailand.  Where better to relax?  There are many options, but the most popular are Bangkok, Pattaya and Phuket.  There are also islands such as Ko Lan, Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Tao, Chang, Samet, Ko Kood, Ko Lipe. </p><p>  These are also very interesting places that you can someday visit if you wish.  There is something to see, what to do, where to walk and have fun.  But every traveler must go to Phuket.  This is a resort that has become legendary. </p>
