The cordial attitude of local residents towards the Russians and the almost complete absence of a language barrier make this country desirable for our tourists.  But where to stay in Bulgaria?  Of course, on the Black Sea!  And it is advisable to choose a hotel on the first line. </p><p>  In this article we bring to your attention the Royal Bay 4 * hotel <span>(Bulgaria, Elenite).</span>  The review of this hotel is based solely on the reviews of those who have already visited there.  Tourists not only shared their impressions of the hotel, but also left us a photo of the complex, its buildings, pool, etc. </p><p>  To begin with, we say that "Royal Bay" in translation from English means "Royal Coast".  And indeed it is.  The name is justified, since the hotel is located on the front page of a great beach.  And another feature of the hotel.  It is an integral part of the Elenite Holiday Village - this is the name of the huge resort complex, which also includes a water park.  The sea, which can be reached in a maximum of five minutes, a water entertainment center, a giant landscaped area and an all-inclusive program - all this makes the Royal Bay 4 * Hotel (Bulgaria) an ideal place to relax with the whole family.  But lonely people, as well as groups of friends, will not be bored here either. </p>

    <h2>  What is the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãElenite </h2><p>  Bulgaria has its own know-how in servicing tourists.  These are closed recreation zones that have recently begun to appear in corners untouched by civilization, away from the bustle of the city.  There, vacationers can feel like members of a club. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of such recreational areas was Elenite.  The name translates as "Deer."  The construction of the complex began in the nineteen eighty-fifth year at the foot of the Old Planina - a mountain in the forests of which roe deer and chamois lived.  Gradually, the resort grew, and the Royal Bay 4 * hotel (Bulgaria) appeared in the southern part of the resort complex. </p><p>  Elenite reviews are called a cozy and elite town with a well-developed infrastructure.  This village was built in an unusually beautiful place.  Many experienced tourists claim that even the landscapes of Spain fade in comparison with the riot of greenery and azure of the sea in the resort of Elenite.  Landscape designers worked hard for fame.  In the garden, stylized as a forest, there are luxurious villas with snow-white walls under tiled roofs.  The park descends with ledges to the golden beach, and surfers surf the blue of the picturesque bay. </p><p>  A special place in Elenite is a water park with a variety of slides.  An electric car runs through the vast territory of the complex.  Reviews note that the climate here is atypical for Bulgaria.  It is warm enough for a beach holiday, but there is no sweltering heat, and the smell of pine trees guarantees a healing effect for those who suffer from respiratory diseases. </p>

    <h2>  Where is Elenite Holiday Village </h2><p>  The club resort is located at a distance from large cities.  Everything here is conducive to a fun, eventful vacation.  After all, guests of the Royal Bay 4 * hotel (Bulgaria) can use any services of this resort complex.  Elenite Holiday Village is located almost in the middle between the resorts of Nessebar and Sunny Beach.  Both settlements are about fifteen kilometers away.  But to get to the nearest airport, it takes time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Burgas Air Harbor is forty kilometers from the hotel.  This geographical location in southern Bulgaria ensures that the holiday season here lasts quite a long time - from May to October.  Even in mid-autumn, the sea temperature is at around twenty-four degrees.  The absence of sweltering heat in the summer and cold winds at other times (from the north Elenite is safely covered by the Stara Planina Mountain), a sandy beach with a gently sloping bottom, a lagoon, where a storm is a rarity, all this makes the area attractive for vacationers with small children. </p><p>  Hotel Royal Bay 4 * (Bulgaria) is located in the southern part of the resort complex.  But the epicenter of entertainment Elenite is two hundred meters from the hotel.  Therefore, it is cozy, quiet, but at the same time not far from various interesting places. </p><h2>  Enclosures and territory </h2><p>  Elenite Management is part of the Victoria Group Hotel Corporation.  In the very south of the resort complex, but closest to the sea, is the Royal Bay 4 * hotel (Bulgaria).  Elenite, in addition to her, has six more hotels and villas.  The vast territory of the complex is fully accessible to all guests.  Reviews say bars with restaurants too. </p><p>  In Elenite, there are two hotels with a similar name - Royal Bay and Royal Park.  The last hotel is a five star hotel.  But the fullness and equipment of the rooms is the only difference.  The rest of the members of the Elenite club are equal. </p>

    <p>  The Royal Bay Hotel consists of one eight-story building.  This building is new, and vacationers will be pleased with spacious bright rooms with excellent working equipment.  The only hotel building stands, you can say, right on the beach.  To the sand - only forty meters.  Vacationers highly recommend overpaying a bit, but order a Sea View room.  The view from the spacious balcony offers simply amazing, and sometimes you can admire the dolphins, swimming very close to the shore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many vacationers appreciated the location of the hotel Royal Bay 4 * (Bulgaria).  Elenite with the Atlantis water park and entertainment is far enough away to make the noise bother you, but also within walking distance.  You can reach the center of Elenite along a shady alley among cypresses, plane trees, palm trees and magnolias. </p><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  The four-star Royal Bay 4 * hotel (Bulgaria) has prepared rooms in which vacationers will feel comfortable.  The cheapest room category is the standard with a view of the park.  There are two single beds in the bedroom, but there is also a pull-out chair where a child or a third adult can fit.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a room is twenty-five square meters, which is pretty good. </p><p>  The same conditions in the standard view.  But there is one undeniable advantage.  This is a view of the endless blue of the sea. </p>

The first room has a wide matrimonial bed.  In the living room there is a sofa bed.  This room category has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfifty square meters. </p><p>  The studio has the same dimensions.  But these numbers consist of one room.  But all the studios have sea views. </p><p>  The best room category in the hotel Royal Bay 4 * (Bulgaria, Elenite) reviews consider maisonette sea view.  They are two story.  On the lower level is a living room, which can be a bedroom for one adult or two children.  On the second floor there is another room with a king size bed.

If you want to go online and chat with family or friends on Skype without unnecessary witnesses, you will need to pay for this service. </p><p>  Maids clean the rooms every day.  Moreover, the thoroughness of their work does not change in any way from the presence or absence of a tip.  They just value their workplace, and therefore try. </p><p>  Reviews also mention good soundproofing in the rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Bay 4 (Bulgaria)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1431678.jpg" width="600"></div>

The second, small, is intended for children.  But guests can use the pools of all hotels of the Elenite complex, and there are seven of them on the territory. </p><p>  Many reviews, if not dedicated, at least mention the Atlantis water park.  Entrance to this town of water entertainment and the use of all attractions are free.  Tourists claim that there are slides for every taste.  They are without joints, so you can not hurt yourself or tear a bathing suit.  Two slides are quite extreme, but there are entertainment for more cautious people.  In the water park there is a bar where they make delicious ice cocktails.  Tourists say that they did not observe the lines to the slides. </p><h2>  Conditions at the hotel Royal Bay 4 * (Bulgaria) </h2><p>  Reviews often claim that the hotel deserves not even four, but all five stars.
