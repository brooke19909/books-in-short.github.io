    <h2>  Beach, romance and green tourism </h2><p>  Of course, most people are going to go to sea, and this is not surprising.  After all, what could be better than basking in the warm sand under the light sea breeze.  For many, this is the best vacation.  As for August, this month you can go to many countries, for example, Tunisia or Egypt, Turkey or Greece, as well as Bulgaria.  The choice is very large.  If you like the so-called green tourism and everything related to this, you can visit the eastern and western shores of Crimea.  Here you can find not only a lot of dense greenery, but also a lot of interesting entertainments, such as diving or windsurfing.  Active holidays can be alternated with a romantic one.  At any resort there are cozy places where you can spend time with your loved one.  In Crimea, these are quiet shallow bays, and in Greece - sandy beaches with emerald-clear water, in which you can see the most diverse exotic living creatures.  Of course, you already know that <span>rest on the sea</span> in August is considered the most favorable.  This is due to the fact that it is not so hot already, and the water is warmed up enough to relax with the children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in tunisia in august" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/486816.jpg" width="460"></div>

Let's try to compose it.  If you are a lover of <span>beach holidays,</span> we strongly recommend visiting Greece in August.  Montenegro will also be pleased at this time.  As for Turkey, you will not see the difference between August and July, it will be equally hot here.  Tunisia is rightfully in fourth place, which in recent years has become very popular.  In August, there is a "golden season" and there are a lot of vacationers.  But it is worth paying your attention to the fact that prices this month are very, very high.  This is the so-called tourist peak.  If you go to the same place, but already in September, you can save up to 20% of the money, although the rest will not be so bright anymore. </p><p>  If you are a fan of various excursions and festivals, then you can travel endlessly in Europe.  These can be the most diverse countries, for example, Portugal or Italy, Greece or Spain.  These places really have something to see.  For example, you can visit various museums or see the historical sights of cities.  As for romance or relaxing with children, Paris, Montenegro and the countries of Scandinavia are considered ideal places.  Of course, this is not a complete list, but you already know what you should be guided by. </p><h2>  Holidays in Tunisia in August: advantages and disadvantages </h2>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This month the sea is incredibly warm.  The temperature at night does not decrease much, this contributes to the fact that you can swim in the sea around the clock.  August is the imperial month for a vacation in Tunisia.  This month, nights last a very long time, so you can fully enjoy the full variety of entertainment.  Here you will find not only a sandy beach with azure water, but also festivals that are held throughout the holiday season.  You can enjoy the performance of artists in the style of jazz in the open air, and classical music is also very much appreciated.  Therefore, if you are not only a lover of relaxing on the beach, but also respect classical music, then be sure to come to this heavenly place. </p><p>  In the daytime, the temperature does not drop below 35 degrees Celsius, get ready for this.  You will definitely get a beautiful tan, but if you are in the shade from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., you will be able to avoid sunstroke.  Of course, a vacation in Tunisia in August is famous for its nightlife.  Restaurants, bars, strip shows and much more await you in this unforgettable place.  Be sure to visit at least one sushi restaurant on the waterfront, where you will find not only a wide variety of dishes, but also very tasty food.  As you can see, you will not have to get bored in Tunisia, so pay attention to this direction. </p><h2>  Sea vacation, or How to take everything from vacation </h2><p>  There is nothing worse than a wasted vacation.  That is why it is better to fly south, where you can always relax well.  However, here you will certainly encounter a problem that will be the difficulty of choice.  You can go to Bulgaria, Montenegro, Egypt or Turkey, because all these places guarantee you a good rest.  Be guided by your budget.  If the amount of money is limited and you are looking for a budget trip, then without hesitation go to Bulgaria.  It should be noted that sea vacations in August are the most expensive, so get ready for the fact that housing and food will be of high cost.  At this time, almost all popular resorts raise prices by an average of 15% -20%, as an influx of tourists is expected.  Turkey will be the most expensive this month, while Greece, Montenegro and Egypt are slightly cheaper.  Although also a lot depends on how and how much you are used to relax.  As for the Crimea, here, a vacation at sea in August will be lovely, but again the price bites.  For the same money, you can fly to Greece for a week and still live in a 3 * hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="greece where to relax in august" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/486818.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We fly on vacation to Greece </h2><p>  In recent years, this area has become extremely popular.  This was influenced by several factors.  Firstly, there are reasonable prices.  As already noted above, they are almost similar to the Crimean ones, only the difference in the quality of rest is big.  In Greece, the service is at a higher level, and the beaches are watched much better, even if they are free and do not belong to any of the hotels.  It is worth coming here because of the wonderful sea, which is crystal clear and incredibly warm at the end of summer.  During the day, heat awaits you here, so at lunchtime it is better to be in a hotel or somewhere in the shade. </p><p>  The most popular islands are Rhodes, Corfu, etc. Corfu is very suitable for lovers of beautiful nature, since this island simply surprises with its landscape and is one of the most beautiful places on the Ionian Sea.  If you still do not know where to fly to rest in August, then pay attention to the resort of Filaraki - a paradise with busy beaches, the prices here are exactly the same as in Rhodes.  You will be pleasantly surprised not only by the sea, but also by the many entertainment programs, as well as sea activities that Greece will offer you.  You already know where to relax in August in this beautiful country, so let's move on. </p><h2>  Heading to the shores of Turkey and Egypt </h2><p>  Let's start with Turkey.  Much has been said about this resort, both good and not very good.  We will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of summer holidays in this country.  I would like to say right away that in August you can‚Äôt count on any discounts.  There are a lot of tourists here at this time, so the prices for everything are extremely high.  It is very hot all the time, it is recommended not to go swimming at lunch, as even in water you can easily burn out.  Do not forget to use sunscreens and, if possible, try to be as little as possible in the open sun.  In principle, here you can have a good rest in August.  In Turkey, you can also meet the popular stars of the CIS countries. </p><p>  As for Egypt, then here you can also have a great time.  In this country, in terms of service and entertainment, you will find almost the same as in Turkey, only here prices are lower by 10%.  Along the coast there are a huge number of bars and restaurants, where tourists mostly hide in hot weather.  The sea is very warm.  At night, the temperature does not drop below 25 degrees Celsius, so the water does not have time to cool.  Of course, it is quite possible to relax in Egypt in August and spend unforgettable time. </p><h2>  Budget holidays at the most popular resorts </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in egypt in august" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/486819.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  What to do if you really want to go to the sea, and money to spare?  In this case, you need a clear cost control and savings.  You already know where to relax in August, but all these places are not the cheapest.  However, with the right approach, you can spend not so much and have a great time.  Relatively inexpensive vacation in August offers Bulgaria.  The fact is that the resorts of this country are not yet fully developed, although the situation has changed a lot over the past few years.  Since the prices here are not high, more and more tourists come every year.  At about the same price you can have a good time on the beaches of Croatia, although it will be cool there in September, so this time is not suitable for bathing children.  Montenegro will cost tourists a little cheaper.  The climate in this country is mild and pleasant, there are a lot of tourists from Russia, and people are hospitable.  In principle, you can relax inexpensively in August in the Crimea.  The average price for a room this month is about 600 rubles, a day renting an apartment will cost you about 1000 rubles, and the week spent in the room of an average hotel is 7000-8000 rubles.  Although it is difficult to say something unambiguously, since prices, for example, in Yalta and Feodosia are very different. </p><h2>  Some useful tips for tourists </h2><p>  It is not necessary to spend all your vacation on the beach.  There are also many interesting places where you definitely need to visit.  What are only the countries of Scandinavia.  The climate in this region at the end of summer is the most favorable for travel.  You must definitely go to Germany and drink real beer there, and when you visit France, you can take a picture against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower.  Of course, there are those who like to visit the most unusual tours.  Such people should go to Chile, Cuba or Peru.  The beaches of Rio de Janeiro are simply magnificent, so lovers of sea holidays should definitely come here.  It is unlikely that somewhere you will find the same coral reefs, enchanting look, as in Peru.  As for beach holidays in countries such as Spain and Italy, it is better to go here in August, since this is the most favorable time for taking sand, mud and sun baths.  Exotics should not be ruled out, since at the end of summer there are very advantageous offers for trips to Iceland, Norway, etc.  Here you can enjoy natural wonders such as waterfalls, volcanoes, glaciers and fjords.  It is also recommended to visit Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Chile.  In these countries, tours of the cities of ancient civilizations, such as Mayans or Incas, are actively conducted.  Now you see that it is impossible to say unequivocally where it is better to relax in August.  Much depends on what you like best: the sea, exotic, history and architecture, educational excursions or extreme sports.  In many cases, you can combine several types of recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in greece in august" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/486820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to organize a family trip </h2><p>  It is rather difficult to decide where it is better to relax in August with your family.  The fact is that there are many nuances.  If you are going to rest on the sea with children, it is advisable that the coast is shallow, with well-warmed water and clean sand.  This will not only give a lot of emotions to the child, but also protect him from abrasions, bumps and dangerous bathing.  Of course, we must not forget that the attention of parents is the most important point.  If you are looking for a good beach resort for your child, the sandy <span>beaches of Bulgaria</span> or Spain are recommended.  Here you can not only enjoy the crystal clear sea waters, but also find a lot of entertainment, as well as attractions that are located on the coastal line. </p><p>  For travelers, a tour of the castles of the Loire, which are located in France, is suitable.  At the same time, you can see other attractions of this country.  In the fears of Scandinavia, in particular, in the northern part, there is also something to see.  Here and entertainment programs, and many informative and just interesting excursions.  If parents cannot travel with their children, then the only right decision is to send their son or daughter to the camp.  The choice of countries is quite large: Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, Malta or the United Kingdom.  It is possible that the child himself wants to choose a place where he should go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in August" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/486821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, spending time with your family is not at all a problem.  You can relax in Greece in August or visit Egypt.  By the way, the Egyptians themselves usually do not rest at the end of the summer in their country.  This is due to the fact that it is very hot here.  For example, in Hurghada, the temperature is kept at around 36 degrees, at the same time the water is warmed up to 28 degrees Celsius.  Despite the fact that there is no rain at this time and the air is very dry and hot, the heat is tolerated relatively easily, but you should not abuse the sun, since it is very easy to get a sunstroke or burn out very much.  You can also go to rest in Cuba.  At the end of the summer there are quite a lot of tourists, and there are also many locals on the beach.  Even though it rains quite often in August, about 2 times a week, this does not spoil the resort at all. </p><p>  Even if it is already the end of August, where to go for a vacation, you can find it without any problems.  If you want, use the offers of tour operators.  Although now more and more popular travel "savage."  Here you yourself get to the right country, live in tents, study the surroundings and just have a good time with loved ones. </p>
