    <p>  In order to get a full sense of comfort, you need a good speaker system.  Of course, in any technique there are built-in speakers.  However, they usually have low quality.  That is why many people tend to purchase additional devices for sound output.  What are the best <span>speakers for the home?</span> </p><h2>  Requirement criteria </h2><p>  How to choose a speaker system for home use?  First of all, you need to decide why it is needed.  Of course, a good <span>speaker system</span> for a sensitive music lover and for an ordinary housewife is a far from equivalent concept.  After all, their requests are fundamentally different from each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, you will need to make a real assessment of the capabilities of the premises.  Even if a good <span>speaker system,</span> but with high power, it is hardly suitable for a small room of nine square meters. </p>

    <h2>  Acoustic stripes </h2><p>  Sound reproduction systems are divided into five groups.  The first of them includes single-band acoustics, the second - two-way, etc.  How to choose a <span>speaker system</span> for this parameter?  For people who do not have special requests or are simply devoid of musical hearing, it is enough to purchase a single-band system.  All sounds of such speakers are issued from only one speaker. </p><p>  The best system is two-way.  In it, one of the speakers reproduces the sounds of medium and low frequencies, and the second - high.  This is a good speaker system for watching movies or listening to music, as deep bass is separately transmitted in it.  It uses a subwoofer.  This is a speaker that reproduces the low frequency range of sound frequencies.  A fairly powerful speaker is built into it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The most demanding students are advised to purchase four- and five-way systems.

Some buyers believe that the most powerful speakers deliver maximum volume.  However, it is not.  The power of acoustics does not mean the strength of the sound it produces. </p>

    <p>  This parameter indicates the mechanical reliability of the system.  The higher it is, the more durable the speakers will work.  When choosing acoustics, one nuance should be taken into account.  It will be better if the speaker power is higher than the same amplifier parameter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Active and passive </h2><p>  Acoustic systems on the market are divided into two types.  The first one is active.  In a similar system, the amplifier is in the column.  In the passive type, it is located separately. </p><p>  Speaker systems with an amplifier are simply plugged into an outlet.  At the same time, they immediately begin to make sounds.  Passive systems will not work like that.  In order to hear sound from such speakers, an amplifier connection is required.  Simply put, the active type of acoustics works like regular computer speakers.  The passive system is similar in principle to headphones that are not plugged into an outlet. </p><p>  Speakers with an active amplifier are a big plus.  It lies in the simplicity of their use.  In this regard, the entire system is quite mobile.  It is easy to put in another place or unmount.  Another advantage of <span>active acoustics</span> is that each of its strip, that is, the speaker, has a separate amplifier, at the output of which there are separation filters.  They are also active.  This filter is easy to adjust.  And this allows you to get high-quality sound. </p>

    <p>  The second type of systems also has some advantages.  First of all, they are in their relatively low cost.  At the same time, passive systems, as a rule, are more powerful than active ones, and they can always be combined with an amplifier available in the house.  In addition, a linear signal and voltage are not required for such speakers. </p><h2>  Sensitivity </h2><p>  A good speaker system capable of reproducing the loudest sounds has high sensitivity.  This indicator is measured in decibels.  Their quantity determines the sound pressure that the speakers are able to exert on the surrounding space.  The higher the sensitivity, the louder the sound.  For home use, speakers with a given value of 85 decibels are perfect. </p><h2>  Frequency </h2><p>  This option is also important for those who are interested in a good speaker system.  A person is able to hear only those sounds that are in a certain range.  It ranges from 20 to 20,000 hertz.  In this case, the frequencies are divided into the following: </p><p>  - low, ranging from 10 to 200 Hertz; <br>  - medium - from 200 to 5000 Hertz; <br>  - high - from 5000 to 20,000 Hz. </p><p>  An acoustic system purchased for a home theater may have a frequency in the range of 100-20000 Hertz.  Music lovers are recommended columns with a large interval.  The best for them will be speakers with a frequency of 20 to 35,000 Hz. </p><h2>  Type of shell </h2><p>  You should also pay attention to this parameter when choosing a speaker system.  The most popular are closed, as well as bass reflex speakers.  The case of the first of them is the simplest.  It can have a diverse design and satisfy the tastes of various categories of customers. </p>

    <p>  However, in closed space, the frequency of the lower resonance increases significantly.  This negatively affects the transmission of low frequencies.  In this regard, most speakers use a bass reflex type enclosure. <br>  It is an open box with perfectly selected dimensions.  There is a vent in the case that directs sound from the back of the speakers to the front.  This allows you to significantly increase the volume of the bass. </p><h2>  Material </h2><p>  On sale you can find speakers made of plastic, wood and chipboard.  Each of these materials has its own merits.  So, plastic allows you to implement the most daring design decisions.  It is quite cheap and light.  However, the sounds reproduced by such speakers are much simpler.  This is due to the rattling of plastic at high frequencies.  Such speakers, as a rule, find their application when using a computer.  They are not suitable for watching movies.  In such cases, the best option is the speaker system, made in a wooden case. </p>

    <h2>  Formats </h2><p>  For a small room, ceiling speakers are suitable.  They are quite compact, have a low cost and provide good sound.  Their main disadvantage is shallow bass.  In addition, ceiling speakers have a low sensitivity.  To play loud sound you need only 40 watts of power. </p><p>  A good <span>speaker system</span> for the hall is rack-mount.  In size, it is larger than the ceiling, but at the same time provides a sufficient depth of low frequencies. <br>  Very convincing bass sound thanks to the floor speakers.  It is also a great speaker system for the hall, capable of shaking the floor in the room.  These speakers produce good sound and do not need a heavy-duty amplifier. </p><p>  However, the dimensions of the speakers are the main reason because of which they must be attached to the floor to eliminate additional vibrations of the body.  In addition, when such speakers move away from the walls for better sound, the space they occupy increases significantly.  Such speakers are quite massive and attract attention.  And their cost is not so small. </p><h2>  Professional technology </h2><p>  According to some lovers of good music, such audio systems are of the highest quality.  However, in reality, everything is different.  Professional speaker systems have their own name not at all from the favorably different parameters.  They are simply used to carry out activities related to the reproduction of sound. </p><p>  Professional speaker systems do not have any design refinements, and expensive materials are not used in their manufacture.  Their main difference from amateur speakers is the use of some elements that can withstand a constant load.  After all, such systems work in stores or fitness clubs constantly, throughout the entire working time.  In addition, professional speakers have great power.  It is she who allows them to voice a fairly vast space. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Those who wish to purchase the best speaker system and have sufficient means should consider the equipment of those manufacturers who are leaders in the market for sound reproduction equipment.  And first of all I want to say about Bowers &amp; Wilkins (B&amp;W).  In the list of the best manufacturers of acoustic systems, it rightfully takes one of the first places.  The company specializes in producing the most advanced home theater systems.  At the same time, she offers her customers only the best acoustics that perfectly reproduce any music.  Such systems are expensive.  However, with their help you can hear an almost perfect sound. </p><p>  The <span>speaker</span> rating <span>of</span> the best manufacturers continues with Rotel technology.  It arose as a small family business, and today it is a solid company, professionally engaged in sound equipment.  The reviews of consumers who bought her equipment for home use confirm the high quality of the devices.  In addition, the company produces audio systems that are suitable for customers with different levels of affluence. </p><p>  Affordable and quality speakers are offered by Yamaha.  This Japanese manufacturer knows a lot about speakers.  Some departments of the company also produce classical and other musical instruments, which are highly appreciated by consumers around the world. </p><p>  Jamo's audio equipment is well known to many users.  The columns produced by her are of high quality and are in various price categories. </p><p>  Brands such as JBL, Magnat, Dali and HECO also produce products that are worthy of sound. </p>
