    <p>  Felix was born in Australia, in the city of Melbourne.  December 20, he turned 21 years old.  By the standards of the magnitude of his achievements, this is a very young age.  He came to his success in the cube assembly championships through tireless training.  In one of his interviews, Felix said that during the last 10 years of his life he spent a tremendous amount of time on training.  For more than 3,000 hours, he stacked Rubik's cubes and spent twice as many hours professionally doing speedcubing (this includes participating in championships, community meetings, and the like). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This hardworking guy was engaged regularly, devoting 1 hour a day to his hobby, making about 50 puzzle assemblies.  Only thanks to his perseverance and hard work in achieving goals, Felix Zemdegs has grown so rapidly, demonstrating more and more fantastic speed at championships.  And when someone gets things easier and faster, do not give up and complain about bad luck.  On the example of Zemdegs, we can safely say that everything is possible in our world, most importantly, not to lose faith in your strength! </p><h2>  Felix Zemdegs: records </h2><p>  "I propose creating new categories of world records, one for Felix with his unreal things and one for normal people. If this does not happen ... I will leave," wrote his predecessor, Eric Akkersdijk, after his defeat at the World Cup in 2011 year. </p><p>  Zemdegs's most amazing achievement on the world stage was in December 2016 at the HPOPS Open 2016 in his hometown of Melbourne.  At the age of 20, he finally assembled the cube faster than anyone else.  Felix Zemdegs became the new world champion in speedboarding.  He put together a 3 x 3 x 3 puzzle in 4.73 seconds and earned the title of world champion. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Felix Zemdegs 4 79" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45985/1549587.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Championships </h2><p>  Our amazing champion has won many competitions and continues to show the highest speed and intelligence to this day.  Here is a list of the most significant competitions for him: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  He collected a 3 x 3 cube in 6.54 seconds at the Cube day championship in Melbourne in 2013.  It was considered the average of 5 assemblies. </li><li>  A single attempt to assemble a 4x4 puzzle was successful, a result that subsequently became a world record - 25.34 seconds.  Installed in the city of Shepparton in 2013. </li><li>  At the Australian National Championships in 2013, he also collected a 5 x 5 x 5 cube in just 50.5 s. </li><li>  At the same championship, the average value of cube assemblies was a record value - 56.87 s. </li><li>  Another not-so-significant attempt in Melbourne to solve the 3 x 3 x 3 puzzle was made in 9.05 seconds. </li><li>  The huge size of the cube 7 x 7 x 7 did not surprise the child prodigy: on average, he coped with it in 2:52:09 min. </li><li>  He missed his most significant record due to a small oversight - in a hurry he scrolled one of the facets of the puzzle too much, and this final step decided his fate.  The best value in the assembly of the 5.33s cube was achieved by him in June 2014, on the 29th, but then Felix Zemdegs did not get the victory.  4.79 seconds is one of his best results, but he was shown <span data-mce-mark="1">outside of the official WCA competitions</span> . </li><li>  Despite this, at the next world championship in the United States of America, in Las Vegas, Felix was given the title of "Best Rubik's Cube Collector in the World". </li></ol>

    <p>  He continues to take part in the championships to this day and breaks his own records.  There is no limit to perfection! </p><h2>  Puzzle rubik's cube </h2><p>  The name of this amazing cube is due to the Hungarian professor of architecture and design, Erno Rubik.  It was created in 1974, and since then the fascination with a difficult toy has spread all over the world.  Probably everyone in childhood had such a puzzle, because it was at the beginning of the XXI century that a new wave of development of this hobby swept the world.  For many, a simple hobby grew into a sport and even got its name - speedcubing (that is, high-speed assembly of a cube). </p>

    <p>  The cube has several varieties: the classic puzzle has 3 faces (3 x 3 x 3), there are 2 x 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 x 4 options. There are enthusiasts who tried to create a giant-sized cube - from 12 x 12 x 12 to 17 x 17 x 17. There are many proprietary algorithms dedicated to assembling the Rubik's Cube (Morozov's method, for example).  Theoretically, it can be assembled in 52 steps from any state, but in practice - it takes a lot of training to carry out the plan.  But in any case, this is an excellent training of intelligence. </p><h2>  Speedcubing as a way of life </h2><p>  People who are fond of assembling the Rubik's Cube are called speedcubers.  Around the world, this is an active movement of teenagers and progressive youth.  There is also a community of cube lovers in Russia.  These guys participate in many festivals and even talent shows.  Here sports excitement rolls over, and speedcubing on sensations can even be considered a sport.  Although it‚Äôs not the muscles that work actively in humans, but the brain. </p><p>  Judging by the achievements of Zemdegs in this activity, every professional collector has a lot to strive for.  All records occur beyond human capabilities, but young and talented guys continue to prove time after time that nothing is impossible.  Speedcubing for them is not just a hobby, but a lifestyle. </p>
