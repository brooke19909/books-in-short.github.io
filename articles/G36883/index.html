    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  1 point - how many rubles? </h2><p>  Why aren't Sberbank "Thank you" bonuses credited?  Most likely, the client simply did not connect to this program.  Once this stage is completed, you can fully experience all the advantages of the proposal. </p><p>  The bonus accrual rate is simple: 1 point equals 1 ruble.  It is this arrangement that applies when paying for goods and services with "Thank you" bonuses.  And there is no other way to calculate points when using them. </p><h2>  What do they get </h2><p>  What are the "Thank you" bonuses from Sberbank for?  Everything is extremely simple - for cashless payments using used plastic from the mentioned financial institution.  The more people pay with cards, the more often they will receive "Thank you" bonuses. </p><p>  The promotion applies to almost all calculations.  You can pay by credit card for bills in cafes and restaurants, for mobile communications or for any other product.  Any spending = accruing bonuses.  But there are exceptions.  This is quite normal. </p><h2>  What does not bring bonuses </h2><p>  Where are Sberbank "Thank you" bonuses credited?  It all depends on what the client does with a credit card.  Almost all non-cash payments include replenishment of the bonus account. </p><p>  But as we already said, not all operations with bank plastic contribute to the transfer of "Thank you" points.  Bonuses are not credited during the following manipulations: </p><ul><li>  withdrawing money from a card; </li><li>  transfers from account to account; </li><li>  purchase of prohibited or illegal goods; </li><li>  payment of "communal"; </li><li>  when making the fourth and subsequent payments in the same store per day; </li><li>  reuse of the option "Auto payment" per day. </li></ul><p>  All other card transactions are profitable in the <span>form of</span> "Thank you" <span>bonuses</span> to one degree or another.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems.  And if you constantly pay for services and goods with a card, the proposal under study will be extremely attractive and useful. </p><h2>  Countries where the program works </h2><p>  Where are Sberbank "Thank you" bonuses credited?  It is important to understand in which stores you can pay for purchases with similar benefits. </p><p>  Fortunately, the bonus program works all over the world.  Regardless of the country in which the purchase was made, the person will be awarded the points.  The main thing is that the country accept plastic from Sberbank.  This is the only limitation. </p><p>  The conditions for accruing "Thank you" bonuses do not change in this situation.  They are one for all regions of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank bonuses Thank you in which stores are credited" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2059575.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Points accrual rate </h2><p>  How many "Thank you" bonuses are awarded from Sberbank?  This question is also of interest to many people.  As we have already found out, credit card payments require the accrual of points to a special account. </p><p>  Ideally, the accrual rate is 0.5% of the payment amount.  That is, if a person buys 3 thousand rubles, he will receive 15 "Thank you" from Sberbank.  It would seem that this is very small.  But if you regularly pay for purchases with plastic, you can quickly accumulate a good amount. </p><p>  In addition, Sberbank has certain partner stores.  They have increased tariffing when scoring points.  In Kari, 10% of expenses are charged for card payments, OZON.ru transfers up to 3% and so on.  Accurate information needs to be clarified in each region. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that from time to time Sberbank holds various kinds of shares.  With their help, at certain times, "Thank you" bonuses are awarded in increased sizes.  Therefore, accumulating points for profitable purchases is not difficult. </p><h2>  The specifics of operations </h2><p>  What are the "Thank you" bonuses from Sberbank for?  As we have said, for certain expenses with a bank card.  Now a little specificity. </p><p>  We learned about operations that are not part of the customer support program.  Thank you bonuses for the following expenses are awarded without any problems: </p><ul><li>  payment for mobile communications; </li><li>  operations in online stores; </li><li>  payment for goods at any retail outlets. </li></ul><p>  Everything is extremely simple and understood.  Which stores earn "Thank you" bonuses?  Sberbank allows you to receive returns in any retail outlets with bank transfer.  This is quite normal.  Therefore, it‚Äôs worth connecting to the program.  Over time, bonuses accumulate in large sizes.  And for some goods and services you can pay with points with a surcharge of 1 ruble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many bonuses are accrued thanks from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2059574.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cancellation </h2><p>  Many are wondering why Sberbank Thank You bonuses are not awarded.  This often happens because the person simply did not connect to the program.  Or due to the fact that the verification of accumulated points occurred too quickly. </p><p>  Sometimes bonuses received can be canceled.  This is possible if: </p><ul><li>  a person of 3 years did not use points; </li><li>  the client has not used bank plastic for 1 year or more; </li><li>  the contract for servicing a financial institution was completely closed. </li></ul><p>  If the client exchanges bank plastic or closes one of the cards connected to the "Thank you" program, do not worry.  For bonuses there is a single separate account.  He will be tied to all plastic cards with a full name of the citizen. </p><h2>  Accrual period </h2><p>  Ceased to accrue bonuses "Thank you" from Sberbank?  Such complaints are rare.  And they arise due to the fact that the client did not have patience. </p><p>  Points on the program are not awarded immediately.  Have to wait a bit.  How many "Thank you" bonuses from Sberbank are credited?  The answer depends on the costs incurred. </p><p>  If a customer makes a purchase for an amount of less than 15,000 rubles, the bonuses put to him will come in 5 working days.  Otherwise, you will have to wait up to 40 days. </p><h2>  Account Verification </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how long the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonuses from Sberbank are awarded.  And how to check the current balance of the corresponding account? </p><p>  This operation has several solutions.  Each participating client can: </p><ol><li>  Pay for your purchase with plastic and look at the check.  It will display information about how many points to accrue, as well as the current status of the account. </li><li>  Go to "Sberbank Online" in the "Thank you" section. </li><li>  Use an ATM.  To do this, open the "Bonus Program" - "Request Balance". </li><li>  Send an SMS request with the number "9" to the number 6470. The service is paid.  Its cost is 3 rubles. </li><li>  Call the number 8 800 200 3747. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  These techniques help to verify the accrued bonuses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many bonuses are credited thanks from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2059580.jpg"></div>
