If you want to stand out from the crowd of friends and relatives, fold out of paper and originalize the envelope with your own hands.  This is not difficult, and the materials for decoration can be used in a wide variety, depending on the age and individual qualities and preferences of the hero of the day. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make an envelope for money from paper in different ways.  This is folding origami, picking up from individual parts and gluing a pattern-cut shape.  Particular attention should be paid to the design of a beautiful envelope, because made even with your own hands, but from plain A4 paper, the product will show your indifference to the person who invited you. </p><p>  If you feel kindred feelings or respect for the hero of the occasion, then the effectively designed envelope will let him know.  The birthday boy will immediately feel how you tried, how much soul you invested in preparing the gift, and he will be unusually pleased. </p><h2>  Rectangular Envelope with Clasps </h2><p>  How to make an envelope for money out of paper can be seen on the frame under No. 1. On a sheet of A4 format (preferably with colored double-sided paper), a cardboard rectangle of the size necessary for the envelope is laid.  From all four sides, paper is bent on it, its dimensions are marked by folds.  Then measure the width of the lateral closing sides.  They should go a little on one another so that there is a strip for applying PVA glue. </p><p>  The lower flap is narrow and the upper flap is slightly wider to close the envelope.  Then the product is assembled using PVA glue.  A step-by-step instruction on how to make an envelope for money from paper with your own hands is clearly visible in the photo below.  When everything is glued together, get to work on the fasteners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="product with fasteners" class="if uuid-2765872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765872.jpg"></div><p>  You will need the following materials: two plastic circles of the same diameter with a hole in the center, kapron or thread floss to connect them (you can use a thin rubber band), two decorative nails with two pieces of wire at the end.  First, drill holes through the awl and, passing the nails in circles, insert them into the prepared places.  On the back side, slide the wire in opposite directions and firmly fix it with your fingers.  Finally, wind the thread or put on an elastic band to connect the valve to the envelope itself. </p><h2>  Heart craft </h2><p>  Let's figure out how to make an envelope for money with your own hands from cardboard with a color print.  First draw a stencil of a heart.  To make it symmetrical, fold the paper in half and only after cutting the arc, turn the sheet back.  When the heart along the contours with a simple pencil is transferred to color cardboard, cut it out with scissors.  This will be the blank for the future envelope.  The larger the size of the heart, the larger the result will be. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart envelope" class="if uuid-2765853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765853.jpg"></div><p>  Then visually divide the surface of the paper into three equal parts and make small bends to make it more convenient to work later.  The lateral round sides are bent inward to the bottom mark and smoothed with your fingers.  Then the workpiece is turned upside down with a triangular edge and the bifurcated side is raised at right angles, again carefully smoothing all folds with a finger.  It remains to lower the triangle down so that the upper and lower sides of the envelope are parallel to each other. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Work from circles </h2><p>  The next step-by-step explanation of how to make an envelope for money from paper will be a story about making crafts from four circles.  All of them should be the same size, but the color scheme may be different.  In the photo below, a sample of the envelope is presented from circles, one side of which is light, in a thin strip, and the other is bright red, with large white peas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.handimania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope of 4 circles" class="if uuid-2765885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765885.jpg"></div><p>  First cut according to the template blanks and fold all the circles in half in diameter.  Then they are pushed together so that the center lines form a square.  PVA glue fix them together, smear those parts of the circles that go one on top of the other.  When the craft dries, the envelope is closed, and after a bill (or several) is inserted inside, a satin ribbon is tied on a beautiful bow.  You can attach a flower collected from fabric or corrugated paper. </p><h2>  Origami envelope </h2><p>  A beautiful envelope with an original clasp in the center will look very impressive as a gift.  How to make an envelope for money with your own hands from A4 paper step by step is clearly seen in the diagram below.  It is necessary to make a square as a blank for working on the envelope.  To do this, on an A4 sheet, bend one corner to the opposite side so that the adjacent sides coincide.  Cut the excess rectangle from the bottom of the sheet with scissors.  After unrolling, you will see the shape of a square.  Now you can start folding the origami envelope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="hammdann.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami envelope diagram" class="if uuid-2766773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2766773.jpg"></div><p>  The first step is to bend the sheet in half diagonally.  Turn the workpiece with the fold down and bend one of the corners until it joins with a flat base.  In the figure under No. 4 it is seen to what level you need to wrap the sharp corners of the resulting figure.  On the upper half, bend the small end of the corner.  There is a cavity inside it.  Put your finger in the middle of it and push it down so that you get a square.  It needs to be carefully aligned and smoothed with fingers on all its sides.  It remains to lower the upper edge of the triangle down and insert it into the resulting fastener.  The envelope is ready! </p><h2>  What does the finished product look like </h2><p>  After you learn how to make an envelope for money from A4 paper, compare the resulting copy with the photo below, on which the square clasp is clearly visible.  This is the central part of the envelope that can be individually transformed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square clasp" class="if uuid-2765927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765927.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of decorative element depends on who the money gift is intended for.  It can be a heart if the congratulation is for the loved one.  The flower can be glued for presentation to a woman or girl.  It can be from satin ribbons, corrugated paper or lace. </p><h2>  Square crafts with a figured corner </h2><p>  You can create a homemade envelope of any size and shape.  This sample shows how to make an envelope for money out of square A4 paper, on one of the corners of which a heart-shaped hole is cut. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts with carved figured holes" class="if uuid-2765947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765947.jpg"></div><p>  For its manufacture you will need dense plain paper, a wooden board and sharp small scissors (you can use manicure with curved edges).  In order for the heart to be colored and attract the eye, it is necessary to stick a square of the selected color on the back of the envelope above the heart.  You can simply insert a sheet of colored paper of the same size over the entire area into the product.  Then glue is not needed. </p><p>  If desired, you can cut a hole of absolutely any shape.  Fantasy is necessary depending on the age and gender of the person.  For a gift to a man, you can draw the contours of a car, plane or tank, for a girl - a butterfly or a flower, for a boy - a train or an ice cream cone.  For women, you can cut a lace pattern on the entire cover page of the envelope.  The work is delicate and painstaking, but the result will be surprisingly beautiful. </p><h2>  Valve design </h2><p>  Let's look at how to make an envelope for money from A4 paper with our own hands so that it is strict and official, but at the same time original and unique.  In this case, consider the design of the valve.  This should be a symmetrical and ornate pattern, neatly cut with scissors along the contours.  Be sure to make a template first.  To ensure that the pattern is the same on both sides, it is created on a sheet of paper folded in half. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crafittie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope with flap" class="if uuid-2765954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765954.jpg"></div><p>  Once deployed, the picture will be clearly symmetrical.  For such work, be sure to use heavy paper.  On a thin sheet, a curly section will not look so voluminous and will not produce the desired effect. </p><h2>  Cover decoration </h2><p>  How to make an envelope for money from paper in different ways, you already understood, but a simple paper product is unlikely to surprise the hero of the day.  The main thing is not only to perform it well, but also to design it in an original way.  In the photo below you can see one of the possible options for decorating crafts, namely the manufacture of strips of quilling bright floral composition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="herecomesnidhi.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating crafts" class="if uuid-2765967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2765967.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs easy to work in this technique, you only need to purchase a set of multi-colored strips in the stationery store, prepare a thick PVA glue and a brush to smear it.  You can wind the strips with a toothpick or any thin needle.  The central pattern can be supplemented with stripes of lace ribbon around the edges of the envelope. </p><h2>  How to make an envelope for money from scrapbooking paper </h2><p>  You can do beautiful things with your own hands in different styles.  Recently, scrapbooking is very popular.  This is the manufacture of crafts, albums for photographs, design notebooks and book covers with newspaper clippings, photo collages and a set of needlework. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shabbybeautiful.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original scrapbooking" class="if uuid-2766000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2766000.jpg"></div><p>  The photo above shows how to make an envelope for money from paper in this style.  For work, take cardboard with printed print in the style of a manuscript or newspaper.  In several places, add a couple of clippings from glossy magazines, flowers from lace and fabric, several small pieces of satin ribbon pastel colors.  Using hot glue, strengthen several beads and artificial flowers, a piece of lace and a butterfly with rhinestones.  The more different objects, the more interesting the envelope looks.  But here, too, you need to determine the limit, so that the craft does not look tasteless and clumsy. </p><p>  Embody your creative ideas and delight your friends and family with new achievements! </p>
