In Russia, there are several successful systems of this kind.  One of them is the electronic payment system (EPS) Yandex.Money, which continues to develop and acquire new convenient features.  In particular, the ability to replenish the Yandex wallet with a credit card was added. </p><h2>  Replenishment of the Yandex.Money wallet: general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rozetked.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex.Money application" class="if uuid-3003703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/3003703.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to conveniently replenishing the wallet from the card, Yandex has other quite convenient ways to transfer money to the wallet.  You can replenish your Yandex wallet using a conventional transfer or by debiting funds from your mobile balance or by exchanging money from another payment system with Yandex.Money. </p><p>  However, all these methods, although they provide wider possibilities, are convenient for certain situations and do not require a significant investment of time, nevertheless they lose to the usual replenishment from the main cash account.  Most people want to replenish the Yandex wallet with a bank card, so the system offers several options for crediting at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crediting money through the payment system website </h2><p>  Of course, by introducing the ability to replenish the account in this way, Yandex provided customers with the opportunity to do this directly on their site.  To do this, just log in to your payment system account, click on the "Top up account" button and enter the details from your credit card. </p><p>  The transfer to Yandex Wallet will need to be confirmed.  To do this is quite simple: the system will ask you for a verification code that you will need to enter on the site.  This code will come to the phone number indicated during registration, therefore it is extremely important to indicate it correctly and have full access to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex.Money replenishment menu on the site" class="if uuid-3003706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/3003706.jpg"></div><h2>  Top-up via Sberbank Online </h2><p>  Through online banking services, you can also successfully replenish your account on Yandex.Money.  In this case, you can replenish the Yandex wallet with a bank card only if your bank has such an opportunity.  The most popular bank in the country provides the Sberbank Online service, which was created specifically to simplify online payments using the card of this bank: </p><ul><li>  After connecting, Sberbank Online should log in and go to the transfer section. </li><li>  It will have a separate subsection for transfers to electronic wallets. </li><li>  It is not necessary to enter Yandex details here: the system already has the required template.  It is enough to indicate your personal data: the electronic wallet number, which can be seen by clicking on the balance figure at the top (a small menu will drop out where the desired number will be indicated).  Also, if you prefer to credit money using the Yandex.Money card (Poison), you will need to enter its details. </li><li>  Next, we pass the security check using the code, and the translation is complete. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex.Money Map" class="if uuid-3003707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/3003707.jpg"></div><h2>  Transferring money from a bank card through the services of other banks </h2><p>  It is possible to replenish the Yandex-wallet with a bank card not only through Sberbank.  Many other financial institutions have introduced this feature in their online systems.  Using Alfa-Bank as an example, you can demonstrate how easy it is: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  First of all, you need to register in the Alpha-click system and enter it. </li><li>  Next, go to the payments section, where the possibility of replenishing the Yandex.Money wallet will be indicated. </li><li>  After clicking on the Poison icon, a form will appear where you will need to specify the same personal details that were required for Sberbank Online: wallet number or card details of the payment system, if you replenish the wallet using it. </li></ol><p>  It should also be said that in the same way you can top up with a credit card and someone else's Yandex-wallet.  It is enough to enter in the form the personal details of the account to which you want to deposit money. </p><h2>  Top-up via ATM </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.opentown.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM and card" class="if uuid-3004238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109573/3004238.jpg"></div><p>  However, if for some reason there is no possibility to replenish your wallet online, you can do this with the help of many terminals or at an ATM: </p><ul><li>  To do this, just find the "Yandex.Money" item in the terminal menu, click "Top-up" and enter the necessary details. </li><li>  After reconciling the data, you can click "Enroll" and the money will go to the wallet. </li></ul><p>  It is even easier to replenish the poison wallet through an ATM (and, in addition, partner banks can replenish the wallet not only without commission, but also with a small cashback, which is also pleasant for the user).  If the bank nevertheless charges a commission, a warning about this appears before the transaction.  The recharge scheme is similar to the scheme for the terminal: the Yandex.Money item is on the ATM menu, where you need to enter the details, after which the transaction will need to be confirmed.  When it is completed, the ATM will issue a check, and it will be possible to check the wallet balance. </p><p>  Replenishing the wallet through an ATM is also convenient because ATMs are located everywhere and do not require long searches, as is sometimes the case with terminals.  But it should be remembered that in this way no more than 15,000 rubles can be deposited into the account. </p>
