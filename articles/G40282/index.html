  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economic Theory: What is General Utility?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The law ‚Äúthe customer is always right‚Äù in the light of market relations can be rephrased somewhat differently: ‚Äúthe consumer is always right‚Äù.  That is, by and large, market production is guided by the needs of consumers.  Their needs, interests and needs determine which products, in what quantity, what modifications and even by what technologies should be produced by manufacturing companies.  In turn, the market also dictates certain rights and rules.  This process is dialectically interconnected and conditioned.  But it is the consumer that can be considered the "last resort", because  it is he who, with his own money, gives an assessment of the results of market actions. </p><p>  The so-called general utility of this or that product is connected with the choice of the consumer in terms of certain goods.  We buy things, household appliances, food in order to satisfy our needs and requirements.  From some purchases we enjoy, others are needed to satisfy hunger, still others to provide comfort and coziness in the house, etc. </p><p>  Almost every individual in society is engaged in a particular sphere of labor, services, and production.  Some from their work receive moral and material satisfaction.  Others are not entirely satisfied with the use of their forces, knowledge, abilities or the adequacy of payment for their services and labor. </p><p>  The total usefulness of the goods we acquire is equal to the degree of satisfaction of our needs that we receive when using goods, services or when engaging in one or another activity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Utility is considered a rather subjective category.  After all, what seems to one of high quality, worthy of attention, for the other may not be of any value.  Or, valuable at a certain point in time, under certain circumstances, some good ceases to be such when these circumstances change.  For example, when a person is very hungry, for him a stale piece of bread is more expensive than gold.  But, as it becomes saturated, bread loses its absolute value for it, and other benefits come to the fore. </p><p>  The economy distinguishes between general and marginal utility.  Marginal utility is incremental, it is added by each new consumed equivalent of the good.  If we have two televisions, then with the purchase of a few more, our pleasure and satisfaction will decrease with each next purchase.  Those.  a high assessment of the usefulness of the good was only in the first stages of the acquisition.  The greater the number of identical goods, the less their usefulness. </p><p>  The total and <span>marginal utility of the</span> good will be wounded to zero if there is an oversupply in the market and prices are high.  But if the price is reduced, the usefulness of the good will increase, and the volume of purchases or the volume of demand for the goods will increase again. </p><p>  Deficit of goods - an alternative to its overabundance to maintain its utmost utility.  Then the general utility will be saved, and the goods or services will be necessary, in demand. </p><p>  Since the money resources of most consumers are limited, a person always has to compare the usefulness of desired purchases and the possibilities of his budget.  The consumer is faced with a dilemma - to choose a combination of the things he needs, products, etc., which would satisfy him as much as possible within his limited budget.  And in this case, the choice will be influenced not only by the amount of marginal utility of the good that is contained in each subsequent units of the product, for example, A, but also by how much money, and therefore other types of goods, he will have to refuse to buy this product A And the general usefulness when purchasing goods or receiving certain services and other things will satisfy a person under such a condition when he allocates budget funds so that each banknote spent on the purchase brings the same marginal utility  . </p>
