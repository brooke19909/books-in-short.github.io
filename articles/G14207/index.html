The resort is dominated by the bizarre peaks of Ai-Petri Mountain, and around it lies the famous <span>Foros Park,</span> which was laid back in the 30s of the XIX century by the legendary General N. Raevsky.  Since then, the garden has grown to 70 hectares and today is one of the main attractions of the village of Foros.  Crimea has always been gifted by Mother Nature with magnificent landscapes and stunning landscapes, however, human intervention did not become destructive for her, but, on the contrary, turned this area into a real paradise.  Picturesque waterfalls and ponds, landscape constructions, sculptural compositions, bridges and arches, arbors, etc. - all this attracts thousands of tourists here. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Foros is located in the southwestern part of the peninsula, 97 km from Simferopol <span>(the capital of the Republic of Crimea),</span> 35 km from Yalta and 47 km from Sevastopol.  If you look at the map, you can see that the southernmost point of the peninsula is Cape Sarych, which is three kilometers from the village of Foros. </p><p>  Crimea in its location, climatic conditions and environmental friendliness is favorable both for living and for beach holidays, however, the southern coast (in particular Foros beaches) has always been and remains the most popular.  It is no coincidence that in these places there was a summer residence of the first secretaries of the CPSU, and after the collapse of the USSR - the cottage of the President of Ukraine. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Foros Crimea photo" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/462382.jpg" width="479"></div></h2><h2>  The story of Foros </h2><p>  The name of the village has Greek roots and, most likely, the ancient Greeks founded it 2500 years ago.  Since then, Foros has been under the rule of different nations: Romans, Genoese, Turks, Tatars, and from the end of the 18th century Russians.  All of them left evidence of their stay on the island in the form of various monuments of architecture, etc. </p><h2>  Attractions in Foros and the surrounding area </h2><p>  The <span>Central Museum of Tauris</span> in Simferopol presents numerous exhibits illustrating the national characteristics of the various peoples who have ever lived on the peninsula, including in the village of Foros.  Crimea, by the way, in ancient times was called Tavrida, and today on the peninsula you can find many establishments that bear this name.  As for the sights that are in the village itself, the most famous is the Church of the Resurrection of Christ of the 19th century.  It is located on a steep cliff of Kyzyl-Kaya, as if hanging over the Foros resort.  After accession to the Russian Empire, Crimea became a major Orthodox center in the south of the country, and many churches were erected here in just a few decades, although Christianity was spread in these places as far back as the Middle Ages.  This is evidenced by the remains of the VIII century Shaldan monastery, located 20-22 km from the village of Foros.  No less remarkable is the Genoese fortress, where the deposed Bakhchisaray khans were exiled.  There are many other natural historical sights in these parts, but nothing compares with the popularity of Foros Park (Crimea).  Photos of the landscapes of this picturesque corner often fall in the rankings of the best parks in the world.  And this is no coincidence, because not only gardeners, but also landscape painters worked on the breakdown of the park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Foros camp in Crimea" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/462384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Foros - the best resort on the Crimean coast </h2><p>  The first thing that comes to mind when mentioning the Crimean peninsula is rest.  Foros is associated with the phrase "respectable rest."  This resort can be called the most sunny, comfortable, environmentally friendly, etc. By the number of sunny days a year among the resorts of Crimea, this village occupies a leading position.  As for the comfortable conditions for relaxation, this is facilitated by the subtropical Mediterranean climate (with warm winters and mild summers), and the purity of the water off the coast is provided by two powerful underwater currents. </p>

    <h2>  Foros beaches </h2><p>  As on the entire southern coast of <span>Crimea,</span> Foros <span>beaches are</span> small pebble.  Most of them are public, admission is free.  All of them are well-groomed, equipped with everything necessary (sun loungers, changing cabins, umbrellas, etc.) for a comfortable beach holiday for adults and children.  There are private paid beaches, for example, in the sanatorium "Foros".  They are equipped with awnings with sunbeds, pool tables, bars, toilets and showers, etc. The most convenient for young tourists is the central beach of Foros.  Crimea has always been considered an ideal place for children's vacations, therefore, in Soviet times, pioneer camps and children's sanatoriums were organized on the territory of popular Crimean resorts.  Today, of course, they were renamed, but traditions have been preserved.  Every summer, hundreds of children from different cities of Ukraine and Russia come here to improve their health and relaxation.  Among the pupils of the camps you can sometimes meet citizens of other countries. </p><h2>  Children's camp "Foros" in Crimea </h2><p>  As already noted, the pioneer camps that operated in the Soviet years, today began to be called differently - DOL (children's recreation camp).  After the collapse of the USSR, some of them were closed, others were reconstructed and modernized, and today they fully comply with all quality standards.  Among them, the most popular is the children's health <span>camp "Foros".</span>  In Crimea, the attitude to children is special.  The emphasis is placed both on the organization of interesting and eventful leisure, as well as on various preventive and recreational activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crimea foros reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/463160.jpg" width="600"></div>
