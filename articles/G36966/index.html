    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Hotel "Gallery Park Hotel" is characterized by the following disadvantages, from the point of view of tourists: </p><ul><li>  in those rooms in which there are no windows, there is a constant smell of mustiness and dampness;  ventilation in the bathroom does not work well, because of which a harmful black fungus forms; </li><li>  the mattresses on the beds are old, with protruding springs;  if your windows overlook the courtyard, then be prepared for the fact that you have to constantly contemplate garbage cans, which also terribly stink; </li><li>  even in double rooms, bath and toiletries are provided only for one person (after treatment, the deficiency is corrected); </li><li>  some rooms do not have air conditioning. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  "Gallery Park Hotel" is a pretty attractive place to stay in the capital.  It is located in a quiet area near the metro station, as well as major attractions.  In addition, it is worth noting especially the architectural and design solution of the hotel.  Here, modern style, discreet classics and Baroque luxury are successfully combined, creating a unique atmosphere.  The food provided in the restaurant deserves all praise.  Of the shortcomings, it is worth noting, except that the dampness and mustiness in the rooms.  This problem should be solved by repairing the ventilation.  It would also be nice to remove garbage bins from under the windows, which not only spoil the view, but also emit an extremely unpleasant odor. </p>
