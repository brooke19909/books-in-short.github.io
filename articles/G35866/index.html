    <h2>  A bit of history ... </h2><p>  1934 is the year when it was planned to have a sanatorium in Sochi.  Sergo Ordzhonikidze, who was then the People's Commissar of Heavy Industry, personally chose a place for a future recreation center.  The planning and construction of the sanatorium was entrusted to the chief architect <span>Ivan Kuznetsov,</span> who organized a team of technicians and architects necessary to implement such a grandiose project.  Jung S.A. was appointed to the post of construction manager, and Zaretsky K.S. became the chief engineer of the project  Design took very little time, in 1935 the construction of the first buildings had already begun.  At the end of 1937, the sanatorium received the first vacationers.  A little later, a fountain was erected on the territory of the recreation center. </p><p>  The Great Patriotic War led to the cessation of the sanatorium.  However, in those years he not only stood idle, but served as a hospital, as he could provide the wounded with all the conditions for good treatment and rest.  Soon after the war, the activities of the sanatorium were resumed.  The construction of a funicular in 1952, which connected the Ordzhonikidze sanatorium (Sochi) with the city beach, also became a pleasant bonus for vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation in Ordzhonikidze </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the sanatorium Ordzhonikidze (Sochi) consists of 9 buildings, vacationers have the opportunity to choose the option that suits their wishes for their accommodation, regarding the equipment of the room, its area and cost.
