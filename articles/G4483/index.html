Kochubey is the first Minister of the Interior and an outstanding figure of the Russian Empire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1862, compiling a list of 120 most prominent figures of Russian history for the image on the monument dedicated to the 1000th anniversary of Russia, Alexander the Second included V.P. Kochubey among them.  This was absolutely true, taking into account the contribution that the latter made to the cause of public administration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myhistori.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey is" class="if uuid-2590512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2590512.jpg"></div><h2>  Descendant of the Ukrainian Cossack </h2><blockquote><p>  Rich and glorious Kochubey. </p><p>  His meadows are boundless. </p><p>  There are herds of horses </p><p>  Graze free, unguarded. </p></blockquote><p>  These Pushkin lines from the poem "Poltava" are familiar to us from school.  They are talking about the general judge of Left-Bank Ukraine Vasily Kochubey, executed in 1708.  A hundred years later, his great-grandson Viktor Pavlovich Kochubey became the first <span>Minister of the Interior</span> in the <span>Russian Empire.</span> </p><p>  He was born in a family estate near Poltava in 1768 on November 22.  It is not known how the fate of Victor would have developed, if not for his uncle's protection. </p><h2>  Budding protege </h2><p>  In 1775, A. Bezborodko A. summoned his nephews Apollo and Victor Kochubeyev to St. Petersburg.  This invitation predetermined their future fate.  One of his contemporaries recalled that in Victor, his uncle noticed an extraordinary mind, sharpness, and a wonderful memory.  Those qualities that, in the opinion of the childless Bezborodko, were necessary for his successor in the diplomatic field. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since that time, uncle spared nothing for the formation of a nephew.  Victor studied in a private boarding school, and at the age of eight he was recorded as a corporal to the guard.  Later, Bezborodko, who actually led Russian foreign policy, identified his nephew on the Swiss mission, where he was to study law and languages. </p><p>  This was followed by a service in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, studies at Uppsala <span>University (Sweden), the</span> first ranks and the honor to accompany Empress Catherine on her journey to the Crimea. </p><h2>  Young diplomat </h2><p>  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, not only a beautiful appearance, but also the ability to hide their shortcomings behind arrogant courtesy and silent thoughtfulness helped Viktor Kochubey to make a career.  In addition, the young diplomat was courteous, smart and knew how to get along with both Tsarevich Pavel and his mother‚Äôs favorite <span>Platon Zubov.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="uargument.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey Victor Pavlovich" class="if uuid-2590513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2590513.jpg"></div><p>  It is not surprising that already at the age of 24, Catherine II appointed Viktor Kochubei as plenipotentiary minister and ambassador extraordinary in Constantinople.  It was one of the most important diplomatic posts of the time.  And the Russian envoy, despite his youth, fully justified the trust placed in him by the empress. </p><h2>  Service in Russia </h2><p>  Having ascended the throne, Pavel made Kochubey a secret adviser and a member of the College in charge of foreign affairs.  Since 1798, he has been actively involved in the creation of the <span>anti-French coalition</span> as vice chancellor <span>.</span>  However, Paul I soon changed his foreign policy views, began to seek rapprochement with Napoleon, and Kochubey had to resign. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the autocracy's disgrace was also associated with the marriage of a diplomat.  Pavel found him a party - his favorite Anna Lopukhin.  But the vice chancellor dared to disobey, marrying the beautiful Maria Vasilchikova. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uargument.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey's wife" class="if uuid-2590518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2590518.jpg"></div><p>  After the accession of Alexander I, the diplomat returns to public service again.  In 1802, the tsar established the <span>Ministry of the Interior,</span> which was headed by Viktor Pavlovich Kochubey, and he was at this post for about 10 years.  The emperor appreciated him as an excellent organizer, manager and economist. </p><p>  The Minister actively participated in the work of the first official periodical in the empire - the St. Petersburg Journal.  Imperial decrees and orders of the Senate were published on its pages, and articles of the Minister of Internal Affairs V.P. Kochubey could also be read there.  These were reports on the work of his department, including crime statistics and other data that caused significant public outcry. </p><p>  Prince Kochubey V.P. died in 1834 from a heart attack. </p><h2>  Bar to the portrait </h2><p>  In 1805, Ivan Andriyanov fell under the hooves of horses of the Kochubeev crew of the fortress of Yaroslavl province on one of the streets of St. Petersburg.  The nobleman tried to make amends for his coachman by sending <span>Prince Golitsyn, the</span> Yaroslavl governor, a letter and 1000 rubles.  The money was deposited in the Provincial Order of Public Charity, from this amount the mutilated serf received up to the end of his life interest - 50 rubles a year, the amount at that time was considerable for the peasant. </p><h2>  Memory of the past </h2><p>  Several architectural monuments associated with the name of the outstanding statesman of Russia have survived to this day.  This, for example, is a triumphal arch in the village of Dikanka (now PGT) in the Poltava region, where the family nest of Kochubeys was located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interestingukraine.kiev.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubeev manor" class="if uuid-2590517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39409/2590517.jpg"></div><p>  It was built by Viktor Pavlovich in 1817 on the eve of the visit of Alexander I. Unfortunately, during the turbulent years of the Civil War the palace burned down, and the once prosperous estate was ruined.  Today, only the triumphal arch, the church and the lilac grove recall the former grandeur of the Kochubeev estate. </p>
