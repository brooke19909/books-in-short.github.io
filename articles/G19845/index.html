Thousands of tourists come here from year to year.  Some spend only holidays and weekends, others stop for a week or more.  Why is vacation here so popular?  The answer to this question can be found in the article. </p><h2>  Velier Lake: Description </h2><p>  Velho is a reservoir located in the northwestern part of the Russian Federation.  Administratively, this territory belongs to the Novgorod region.  The lake is part of the <span>Valdai National Park.</span>  To the north of it there is another famous reservoir - Lake.  Seliger. </p><p>  The veil has a fairly elongated shape.  The length from the northern extreme point to the southern one is about 25 km.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water mirror is 35 square meters.  km  The coastline is rugged, there are small bays, tributaries, islands.  The latter are only about 200, there are both large and very small.  The beaches are mostly sandy, mud deposits are less common.  Calculating these places is extremely simple.  Where the banks are overgrown with reeds and sedges, there will be silt.  It is in these areas that small fish are caught. </p><p>  Lake Velje (see photo in the article) is quite deep.  In 2004, bottom surveys were carried out that revealed large pits.  In one of them, the depth reached 42 m. The average figure is 10 m. </p><p>  The shores of the lake are distinguished by relief.  For example, it is almost impossible to travel to the south and east by transport, so they are completely uninhabited, unlike the north and west.  The water is clean, sandy beaches are chosen by tourists from different parts of Russia.  There are no large industrial and agricultural facilities in the vicinity.  That is why this area is environmentally friendly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Given the climatic features of the region, the lake freezes in November-December.  For the whole winter period it is covered with a thick layer of ice, thanks to which winter fishing thrives here.  The reservoir opens in the middle of spring.  By May, all the ice is completely gone. </p><p>  The water in Velha is flowing.  Several rivers flow into it.  The largest is Yavon.  It is through it that the natural flow of lake water is carried out.  Yavon flows in the western part of Velho.  At this place a dam is built that regulates the level in the lake.  Currently, it is raised by 2-4 meters.  An artificial canal has been built on the pond in the eastern part, thanks to which part of the water flows into the rivers Shlina, Libya and Lake.  Shlino. </p>

    <h2>  Lake Velie: how to get there? </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to the lake: by private car or public transport.  Let's look at each option in more detail. </p><p>  By car, traffic is carried out along the highway Moscow - St. Petersburg.  You need to go to the sign for the city of Valdai.  After it, after a hundred meters there will be a turn to Demyansk.  Then you need to drive about 25 km along the main highway.  The road will be asphalt.  Near Ivanteyevo it will be replaced by concrete.  At the fork, to which the distance is about 3 km, you need to turn left.  Continue on until the next fork.  Here, turn right and continue along the dirt road.  In 2-3 km B. Ukleina will be.  This village is located at the extreme northern point of the reservoir.  If you need to get to the west bank, then there will be a right turn near the village. </p><p>  Now about the trip to Lake Velha using public transport.  If for some reason there is no car, then you can use the train and bus.  Trains from Pskov run to Valdai.  Demyansk can already be reached by bus.  If suddenly there is no intercity flight, then you can stop along the way on the Moscow - St. Petersburg highway.  A great option would be a passing car to Osinushki.  There is a lake nearby.  The path, of course, is difficult, but a vacation on Velha is worth it. </p>
