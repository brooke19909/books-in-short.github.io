    <h2>  Kit </h2><p>  This device is positioned by the manufacturer itself as a premium gadget.  Accordingly, the equipment should be appropriate.  But still, there are certain comments on it.  In addition to the mobile device itself, the boxed version of the device includes such components and accessories: a battery, an interface wire for connecting to a personal computer, a charger, a stylus, and an instruction manual.  This list clearly lacks headphones, a protective film, a cover and a memory card.  In the first case, there is even a corresponding port, but there are no stereo headsets in the delivery set.  Although the front panel of the device is protected with 2nd generation Gorilla Eye glass, an additional film to preserve its original state would clearly not be superfluous.  The situation is similar with the sides and the back cover - they are also best protected, but only with the help of a cover.  Although the capacity of the built-in drive is equal to an impressive 16 GB, you can expand it by installing an external flash card.  This will allow more rational use of the memory subsystem in Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The characteristics (instructions indicate this nuance) of the external drive are as follows: the type of micro-SD card, and its maximum capacity is 32 GB.  This will definitely be enough to place the user's personal files (photos, videos, books, music) here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Typical design of Note 2, as for the device line "Galaxy".  Most of the front panel is occupied by the display.  In this case, its diagonal is 5.55 inches.  Above it, a conversational speaker, a <span>front camera</span> and ‚Äúwindows‚Äù of sensors are displayed.  At the bottom, strictly in the middle, is the main mechanical key to return to the main desktop.  Along the edges of it are the touch keys "Back" and "Menu".  As noted earlier, the front panel is fully protected by Gorilla Eye glass in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The specifications given by the manufacturer in the technical specifications indicate that its second generation is used.  The device‚Äôs lock button is displayed on the right edge, and a swing for adjusting the volume of the gadget is located on the left edge.  The micro-USB port is displayed on the back of the smart phone.  There is also a hole for stylus storage.  And the 3.5 mm audio port is brought to the upper edge.  On the back cover of the smartphone, in addition to the logo of the manufacturer, there is also a hole in the main camera with backlighting based on one LED and a loud speaker. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget Computing Heart </h2><p>  A very productive processor solution is used in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Exynos 4412 features such: 4 computing modules based on the "A9" architecture, which at maximum load can accelerate to 1.6 GHz.  Its semiconductor crystal was manufactured according to the norms of 32 nm of the technological process, and the maximum level of its energy consumption can reach 4 watts.  This is Samsung‚Äôs own development and this particular chip was used in the flagship device of 2012 - Galaxy S3.  And although by the standards of the industry of mobile gadgets 3 years is an impressive period, even now this processor can cope with almost any task.  For example, the same ‚ÄúAsphalt 8‚Äù will run on this device, even if not at the maximum settings.  For other tasks (viewing Internet portals, playing videos, listening to music), its performance level is excessive, and it will cope with them without problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Display and graphic solution </h2><p>  One of the main features of the device is the display diagonal, which, as mentioned earlier, is an impressive 5.55 inches.  It is made using SuperAMOLED technology.  Color reproduction, contrast and brightness are at an acceptable level.  The second important component of the graphics subsystem is the Mali-400MP4 video accelerator in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Features (this is the phone that thanks to them today allows you to solve most problems) this adapter is really impressive.  Its computational performance is equal to 15.8 GFLOPS with a chip operating frequency of 440 MHz. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras: what are they capable of </h2><p>  Two high-quality cameras are installed in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The specifications and photos of the main one are really impressive.  She has an 8MP sensor element.  At the same time, there is an autofocus system and LED backlight.  Also at the software level, a face recognition algorithm is implemented.  As a result, the quality of the photos taken with the main camera of this device is not satisfactory.  The video on it is recorded as "1080 p."  There are no questions about the quality of her videos either: the color reproduction is excellent, the picture is legible.  The front camera is based on a more modest 1.9 MP sensor element.  To obtain high-quality images, this is clearly not enough at the moment.  But for "selfie" and video calls, this is enough, and it is intended to solve these problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Device memory </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100 boasts a well-organized memory subsystem.  The amount of installed RAM in it is 2 GB.  The size of the integrated internal drive is 16 GB.  At the same time, the user can use only 11 GB to install his programs and store <span>personal data</span> .  This is quite enough for comfortable and normal work.  The rest of the space is occupied by system software.  If 11 GB of free space of the internal drive is not enough for the user, you can install an external flash card of 32 GB.  The corresponding slot is in this device.  This certainly will solve the problem of lack of free space in the device.  Well, the most valuable information is best stored on some cloud service.  This will allow it to be restored in the event of a breakdown or theft of the device without problems. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device are impressive (one display diagonal of which is only worth 5.55 inches) and with a small battery, it would not have been able to boast an impressive degree of autonomy.  As a result, the battery capacity is 3100 mAh in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The characteristic, of course, is far from outstanding today.  But this value is quite enough so that the device with an average level of load on one battery charge could last 2-3 days.  Taking into account the diagonal of the screen of the device and the hardware filling, this value cannot be significantly increased.  If you run some resource-intensive application (for example, Asphalt 8), then the battery life will be reduced to 6-8 hours. </p><h2>  Data exchange </h2><p>  An impressive list of ways to exchange data with the outside world is implemented in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Characteristics in this regard, he has the following: </p><ul><li>  Support for mobile networks GSM and 3G.  True, the device has only one slot for installing a SIM card, and it cannot work in the "DUOS" mode.  In the first case, you can only view unpretentious sites on the Internet and exchange messages on social networks.  But with the help of 3G technology, all these restrictions are removed, you can even watch online video. </li><li>  Korean developers have not forgotten about the "Bluetooth".  It is indispensable in cases where you need to connect wireless headphones to a smartphone or share small personal files with a similar mobile device. </li><li>  Also in the device there is a Wi-Fi module.  It, just like 3G, allows you to receive and send data to the global web in any quantity and at good speed.  In this case, the most "heavy" sites will load quickly enough. </li><li>  For navigation in the device provides two systems.  One of them is tied to satellites and can work with both JPS and GLONASS.  Well, the second is based on the use of the location of mobile communication towers and is called A-JPS. </li><li>  Among the wired interfaces, the presence of the previously mentioned micro-USB and audio port can be distinguished.  The first is for charging the battery or connecting to a PC.  The second is used in cases where you need to output an <span>audio signal</span> to an external speaker system. </li></ul>

    <h2>  System software </h2><p>  The ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù is the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100.  The characteristic of the system software component indicates version 4.1.  Additionally, on top of the system software, the ‚ÄúTouchViz‚Äù proprietary shell is installed.  With its help, you can easily and easily customize the smartphone software interface to your needs.  The smoothness and reliability of the system software is not satisfactory. </p><h2>  Application software </h2><p>  A typical set of pre-installed software is in the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Specifications (reviews indicate this) allow you to pre-place significantly more software on it.  Programmers on it pre-installed the standard set of mini-applications from Google, clients of social networks and built-in programs of the operating system.  Everything else will have to download the device owner from the application store.  But, on the other hand, you can more accurately configure the device to fit your needs. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100 is a premium device.  Hence the increased requirements for it, which is completely a gadget.  He has no weaknesses.  Certain comments are caused only by the device configuration.  But, on the other hand, the owner of such an expensive device can definitely afford to separately purchase a case, a protective film and an external drive.  And pick up any of these accessories exactly the way he really needs.  This smartphone has no more shortcomings. </p>
