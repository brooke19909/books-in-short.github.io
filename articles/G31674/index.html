  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the basis for teaching foreign languages?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Without knowledge of a foreign language, it is very difficult to get a job in a prestigious company, especially when it comes to international cooperation and foreign business trips.  English, Chinese, French, German, perhaps the most popular today.  Trying to ensure a bright future for their children, parents send their children to specialized schools, where they use traditional or modern <span>methods of teaching a</span> foreign language.  Of course, not only young children lend themselves to language learning, many adults acquire new knowledge of their own free will, because the main thing here is the right motivation to be not only useful, but also interesting. </p><p>  If we consider more scientifically what exactly is the methodology of teaching foreign languages, then the concept itself implies the following: <br>  1) it is a science engaged in the research and development of the fundamental theory of the product, <br>  2) subject <br>  3) a kind of tactic that allows you to operate with various teaching methods to achieve the final result. <br>  And all this applies not only to foreign languages, but also to every subject that they try to teach at school, higher education institution and so on. </p><p>  The methodology of <span>teaching foreign languages</span> consists of the following elements: <br>  - learning objectives, <br>  - content <br>  - pedagogical activity, <br>  - the effectiveness of student learning. <br>  Virtually all points can be characterized by the questions ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  Why?  How?  Is it worth it? ‚Äù </p><p>  It should be noted that for the methodology of teaching foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuggests the possibility of independent study.  In this case, it is very important to do this correctly and regularly, without delay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to engage in self-education, it is best to combine generally accepted and modern <span>methods of teaching a foreign language.</span>  We list the most effective ways to quickly learn and learn how to apply theoretical skills in practice: <br>  - reading books, magazines and newspapers in the language being studied (only after a minimal mastery of the theory), <br>  - memorizing words will help compiling associations for each new word, <br>  - it is useful to watch films in a foreign language with subtitles, which in addition allows you to remember the correct pronunciation of words (very useful for mastering the conversational style), <br>  - listening to audio books, songs and other things in a foreign language on the way to work, <br>  - listening to the radio is an ideal way to test your knowledge in practice, <br>  - in order to better memorize words, write them on separate sheets and paste them around the apartment (using this simple method you can start early learning a foreign language), <br>  - The most effective way to teach a foreign language is to communicate with a foreigner, at least using the Skype program. </p><p>  It is best to start learning a foreign language in childhood.  It is very good if a qualified teacher works at the school, who will be able to provide a minimal base for the further development of independent skills.  The task of the teacher is not only to begin early training in a foreign language, but also to create motivation, understanding the need to continue self-education in this area. </p><p>  Many parents try to get ahead of the development of children, literally shoving information into them, sending them to developing schools, the methodology of teaching foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which is strengthened and often aimed at learning several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once.  Child psychologists oppose this, since overloading the child‚Äôs brain can lead to the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders.  In this regard, it is not worth entering several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once, start learning independently and from the basics of one language, if a child wants to learn another foreign language, then let him do it himself in the future. </p><p>  A foreign language is very important for work, communication, new acquaintances and, of course, for tourism, which has recently been especially popular among residents of our country. </p>
