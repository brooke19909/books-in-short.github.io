This is a very interesting city, a trip to which can be safely considered incomplete if you do not visit at least one observation deck.  Many tall buildings in New York have special viewing platforms located on the upper floors or directly on the roof.  Obviously, these buildings offer amazing views of the city and its surroundings.

    <h2>  Start of construction </h2><p>  New York is one of the most populous cities in the United States.  However, long before receiving this title, a real race for the construction of skyscrapers began here.  For a while, the city stopped participating in this unusual race, which was connected with the tragedy of September 11, 2001, when terrorists destroyed the tallest buildings in New York - the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  For some time, high-rise construction was suspended, and the palm passed to the Arab countries and China.  Today, the situation is beginning to change in a positive direction: several skyscrapers were built after 2014, while the city built the highest residential high-rise in the world.  Typically, tall buildings are occupied by shopping centers, hotels, offices and similar establishments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the story of the construction of tall buildings in New York begins in 1890, when the construction of the 106-meter "New York World Building" was completed in the city.  It is worth noting that this is not the first skyscraper in the city, but it was she who overtook the Trinity Church in height, the spire of which reached 87 meters above sea level.  For a long time, World Bealing remained the tallest building in the city.  Only in 1899 did a higher construction appear.  It is worth noting that at present this high-rise building does not exist, since in 1955 it was demolished in order to expand the approach to the Brooklyn Bridge. </p><p>  After that, the city began a boom in high-rise construction, and much earlier than in other parts of the globe.  Since 1980, 11 <span>tallest buildings in the world</span> have been built here <span>.</span>  From 1910 to 1930, 16 skyscrapers "grew", all in all 82 buildings were built from 1890 to the present day.  The Empire State Building, TrumpBuilding, Vulvor Building, as well as the Chrysler Building appeared during this period.  Each of these buildings for some time held the title of the highest in the world.  The first of them was leading for about 40 years. </p>

    <h2>  The tallest building in the city </h2><p>  The second wave of construction began in the 1960s.  Since that time, about 70 buildings with a height of more than 183 meters have been built.  What is the tallest building in New York?  One of these was the towers of the World Trade Center.  The North Tower was the highest in the world from 1972 to 1973, and in the city until 2001.  All six buildings of the famous World Trade Center were destroyed during a terrorist attack in 2001. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is the tallest building in New York?  Currently, the <span>World Trade Center 1,</span> erected on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe destroyed shopping center, is in first place in height.  The height of the tallest building in New York was 541 meters.  It displaced the Willis Tower from the first place.  World Trade Center 1 is currently the sixth tallest building in the world, as well as the tallest office building in the world and the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.  The main building of the new shopping center is called the Freedom Tower, thereby emphasizing that the people of the United States did not bow their heads to the threat of terrorism.  The construction was completed on May 10, 2013 with the installation of a spire 124 meters long and weighing 758 tons.  How many floors are in the tallest building in New York?  104 floors has the Freedom Tower. </p><p>  After the tragedy in 2001, the US authorities for a long time could not decide what to do with the cleared territory.  On the one hand, it was obvious that it was necessary to build a new skyscraper, and on the other, it was to perpetuate the memory of the dead and show the whole world that the United States did not give up even after such heavy blows.  Initially, a closed tender was announced for the development of free space, but most of the projects were negatively perceived by the local population.  Then the competition was made open, and <span>Daniel Libeskind</span> won it <span>.</span>  However, even after the approval of his project, the architect had to further refine his main skyscraper for four years to make it less futuristic, as it was originally.  In addition, the government‚Äôs desire to make the construction as safe as possible was taken into account.  Currently, the World Trade Center complex (the tallest building in New York-2016) consists of five skyscrapers for various purposes, a memorial in memory of the victims, as well as an art gallery.  But that's not all!  Under the tallest building in New York, the Freedom Tower, special transitions were created to the subway and high-speed rail lines, which allow you to come and go from World Trade Center 1 to any corner of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Second place </h2><p>  The second place in our ranking "The tallest building in New York" (photos are presented to your attention in the article) is occupied by 432 Park Avenue.  The skyscraper has a height of 426 meters, although the original design was supposed to be only 396 meters.  For its construction, the Drake Hotel had to be demolished, the purchase of which cost the developer 440 million.  The total cost of construction reached 1.25 billion dollars.  This is currently one of the most valuable places to settle in New York.  In addition, this building is the tallest multi-story residential building in the world.  In the USA, it takes 3 place in height, in the world - 19 place. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that the roof of the Freedom Tower is lower by 9.8 meters, however, the first place was given to her due to the high spire.  The building has a unique design - it is a pure geometric shape, namely a square, when viewed from above.  The building has 85 floors, each area is 368 square meters.  Each side of the skyscraper has six windows.  The owner of this magnificent building and part-time developer is proud of his building and calls it the new symbol of New York, however, many famous architects and significant people of the country consider 432 Park Avenue to be just a "thin column". </p><p>  The cost of apartments in this tallest building in New York ranges from several million to several tens of millions of dollars.  The penthouse in the second tallest building in New York was bought for $ 95 million by a Saudi billionaire.  In addition to 104 apartments, the building will have a fitness center, restaurant, sauna, pool, golf course and other attributes of a successful life. </p>

    <h2>  Third place </h2><p>  It is categorized as the "Tallest Building in New York" and the Empire State Building, located on Manhattan Island.  It is an office building.  Height - 381 meters, built in 1931.  The tallest office building in New York has 103 floors.  The title of the highest in the world was retained by the Empire State Building from 1931 to 1970, which is also a kind of record.  The northern tower of the shopping center was able to overtake this skyscraper.  After its destruction, the title of the highest in New York returned to the skyscraper, but not for long. </p><p>  The architecture of the building belongs to Art Deco, in 2007 it received the title of the best architectural solution in the United States, and in 1986 it was included in the list of national monuments of historical significance of the country.  Currently, the building is the fourth highest in the country and 22 in the world. </p><p>  Today, the office center is being reconstructed to make it more environmentally friendly.  The cost of all work is estimated at 550 million dollars. </p><p>  The Empire State Billing has several unique facilities.  Here is the Guinness Hall of Unusual Records, a hall 30 meters long and three floors high, fully decorated with marble and decorated with panels depicting 7 wonders of the world.  By the way, the office center itself is called the eighth wonder of the world. </p><p>  Among other things, on the 102 and 86 floors of the high-rise building, observation platforms are open, which can be reached in the elevator in just one minute. </p><h2>  Bank of America Tower </h2><p>  The <span>Bank of America</span> Tower is 366 meters high and has the status of the fourth tallest building in the city.  When developing the project, the environmental friendliness and efficiency of the building were primarily taken into account.  All structural elements are aimed at the most efficient use of natural resources.  For example, double-glazed windows in a building partially absorb sunlight, but at the same time provide the necessary level of lighting.  In addition, they have low heat dissipation, which can significantly save on heating a skyscraper.  In addition, there is a system that collects and filters rainwater.  The air that enters and exits the building is subjected to special filtration.  When constructing the tower, the maximum amount of recycled materials was used. </p><p>  At night, ice accumulates here, which is used to cool the building in the morning and afternoon.  Even the urinals here are designed so that water is not required.  They can save up to 30 million liters of water per year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The building has its own electricity generator, which is able to provide part of the needs of the building, thus they were able to reduce the cost of delivering energy to the building, which is typical for central power supply. </p><p>  The building has 55 floors.  It is the first in the world to receive a platinum certificate for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly construction. </p>

    <h2>  World Trade Center 3 </h2><p>  Another building that will complement the ensemble of the new World Trade Center in the United States.  The construction of the building began in 2010, commissioning is expected in 2018.  According to the initial project, there will be 80 <span>floors, the height of the</span> structure will have to reach 378 meters.  The building will have an office character.  The construction is carried out in accordance with the gold standards of ecology and energy efficiency.  The original building, on the site of which the current one is being built, was damaged after a plane with terrorists crashed into the tower of the World Trade Center.  The landing gear fell off and fell on the building, damaging the upper floors, but it suffered the most damage during the collapse.  At the time of the crash, the hotel was about 1000 people.  Only three lower floors remained relatively intact. </p><h2>  Chrysler Building </h2><p>  One of the symbols of the city, which has the right to be called the tallest building in New York, more precisely, one of them.  It is the property of Chrysler Corporation.  It was built in 1930 and has a height of 320 meters.  About 11 months after construction, it ranked first in the list of the highest in the world.  Currently sold to new owners. </p><p>  Interesting is the history of its construction.  The project was commissioned by a former senator who lost his title before the end of work.  Then the project was sold to Chrysler Corporation.  The architect of the building is Craig Severance.  When erecting the building, he was guided by the fact that he overtook the former partner, and after the ardent enemy of Van Ellen.  To achieve the goal, literally a few feet were added to the building to get around the competitor.  At some point, the goal was achieved, but Van Ellen received permission to install a 38-meter-high spire on his skyscraper.  Without advertising this, he did the work and received a kind of satisfaction from the fact that he was able to still get around his former friend.  However, the joy of the rivals was short-lived, because 11 months later the Empire State Building was opened, which ‚Äúovertook‚Äù both buildings. </p><p>  When designing the building, the Art Deco style was used, but many elements were perplexing to eyewitnesses.  So, the upper part of the building is stylized as automobile caps of Chrysler cars of that time, in addition, there are decorations in the form of soaring eagles.  For a long time, the architect and owners of the building were criticized for frivolity, but now the Chrysler Building is considered the embodiment of the era of the 20s of the last century, and the building itself is nicknamed "handsome Manhattan."  In 2005, the Museum of Skyscrapers awarded him the title of the most beloved architectural solution in the United States, this title was obtained after a survey of more than a thousand residents of the country related to architecture and construction. </p><p>  On the upper floor for some time there was an observation deck, a little later it was converted into a restaurant. </p>

    <h2>  New York Times Building </h2><p>  The building of 52 floors was built in 2007.  The antenna height is 319 meters, which puts the New York Times Building in sixth place with the Chrysler Building.  The building was completely given to the needs of the newspaper and was built by order of the owners of the publication.  The Italian designer was engaged in architecture, the interior design was developed by the American bureau, and another company was engaged in the task of lighting at night.  Thus, the high-rise building is the result of the work of several eminent architectural bureaus. </p><p>  During the construction, energy-efficient materials were used.  So, special double-glazed windows absorb part of the sun's rays and do not allow the building to heat up.  Own power station serves 40% of the structure, while the heat during operation is aimed at heating floors. </p><h2>  Observation Decks </h2><p>  As mentioned above, a trip to the <span>largest city in the United States</span> will be incomplete if you do not visit the tallest building in New York with an observation deck with a magnificent view of the metropolis.  For a long time, the most interesting panorama opened from the Rockefeller Center, as well as the Empire State Building. </p><p>  You can climb these observation platforms by elevator, you must first go through several security posts and metal detectors, but when everything is settled, visitors find themselves on the platform from which a wonderful panorama opens 360 degrees.  Given that the observation platforms are located on the tallest buildings, nothing blocks the view, and if the weather permits, you can see the whole of New York as the birds see it. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the water towers.  Almost every building in the city has its own tower, which provides it with water.  In addition, on some roofs you can see divorced gardens, sunbeds for sunbathing and completely inhabited surfaces.  Someone uses roofs to fit their needs, growing pigeons or other animals, and sometimes not only them.  It is known for certain that on some roofs the real bee farms with houses for bees were equipped. </p><p>  In addition to the inhabited roofs, you can see interesting places of the city and its surroundings - bridges over the Hudson River, skyscrapers in central Manhattan, Styvesant Town - an unusual area with houses of strange architecture that grew in 1940, and on the other side of the Hudson you can see the satellite city of Jersey.  In addition, it offers an excellent view of New York's very first skyscraper, the 82-meter Flatiron Building, which was built in 1902. </p><p>  An interesting fact about the majestic Empire State Building is that in 1945 the US Air Force bomber crashed into it, but did not cause any damage, and the next day the building was again opened for visitors. </p><p>  The observation deck at Rockefeller Center also boasts excellent views, and it is worth a visit both at night and during the day.  The most interesting here will be a magnificent overview of the central park.  This building has several areas - fully open and glazed.  The Rockefeller Center was built in the 30s of the last century and is located in close proximity to another 30 high-rise buildings of the city.  In addition, the famous photograph ‚ÄúDinner at a Skyscraper‚Äù, which captured workers sitting on a beam at an amazing height, was taken during the construction of this high-rise building - in 1932. </p>

    <h2>  The first skyscraper in Manhattan </h2><p>  The very first skyscraper in Manhattan has, among other things, a very original design.  The structure was made in the shape of an iron, and if you look strictly from above, you can see a triangle.  It is no coincidence that the building was named <span>Flatiron Building,</span> which can be translated as "iron." </p><p>  The skyscraper is located at the intersection of three streets - Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23 Street.  The construction of the 82 meter high building was completed in 1902.   ,      :   ,          . </p><p>           (  ),     ,    .          : Fuller Building    ¬´¬ª. </p><p> An interesting fact is that due to the unique shape and connection of the streets next to the building, an air flow periodically arises upward.  He was given a special name - 23 skidoo.  They still talk about the fact that sometimes near the building you can see bored men who are waiting for this stream to pick up a dress or skirt of a woman passing by. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the building was famous for being transferred to the fictional city of Liberty City from the GTA4 game, and around it at different points you can see a full-length figure of a naked man. </p>
