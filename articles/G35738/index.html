Even if at the end of December there is no smell of slush on the street and doesn‚Äôt even smell like a fairy tale, you can create a unique winter extravaganza without leaving your home.  For this, it is necessary not only to dress up a Christmas tree, but also to decorate the apartment with paper snowflakes.  There are many ways to create these light and airy beauties. </p><h2>  Do not change traditions! </h2><p>  It is difficult to find a person who in childhood would not know how to cut a snowflake out of paper.  It will not be difficult for you to recall this manufacturing technology or learn it from scratch. </p><p>  So, to create an openwork decoration you will need: </p>

    <p>  How to fold and cut snowflakes, we figured it out.  Now we can proceed to the second, third ... and cut them out as much as the soul desires! </p><p>  Since in nature there are no two identical crystal princesses, in your house they should also be the most diverse. </p><p>  Design your own patterns or use patterns to cut snowflakes - the choice is up to you.  In any case, your work will give very interesting and beautiful results. </p><h2>  We create 3D in your home! </h2><p>  Now we will figure out how to fold paper for snowflakes not ordinary, but voluminous.  To make a 3D decoration for a window, a chandelier, a Christmas tree and any corner of the apartment, you will need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - 6 sheets of paper in the shape of a square (white or color - it does not matter; you can make either a classic snowflake or with colorful rays); </p><p>  - scissors; </p><p>  - the most common PVA or glue stick; </p><p>  - stapler. </p><p>  In order for the paper beauty not to tear when you hang it on a thread, it is better to use thick paper for its manufacture (or at least make a beam from it that you are going to attach the thread to).  In order not to suffer with measuring and plotting the sides of the square, you can bend a regular A4 sheet in the same way as at the beginning of creating a regular snowflake, and just cut off the excess. </p><p>  So, all the materials are collected and lie in front of you.  Now you can proceed.  Now we will figure out how to make voluminous snowflakes with your own hands. </p><h2>  So, we are working! </h2>

    <p>  Step one.  Once we bend the sheet in half diagonally.  We have formed a triangle. </p><p>  Step Two  On the wide side, we carefully make cuts with a herringbone, as shown in the photo. </p><p>  Step Three  Expand the sheet. </p><p>  Step Five  Lift the ends of the corners cut out in the center and glue them together. </p><p>  Step Six  Repeat the previous operation for all parts of the square in pairs, starting with those that are closer to the middle and ending with the extreme ones.  When all the parts are glued together, you will get the first ray of the future snowflake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Seventh step.  Repeat exactly the above steps for the remaining five sheets of paper. </p><p>  Seventh step.  Connect the resulting rays with a stapler (first fasten them in three, and then the two halves of the future decoration formed). </p><p>  Step Eight.  We give the product the final shape.  In places where pieces of paper come into contact, glue them. </p><h2>  Another voluminous option </h2><p>  If you want to make several types of 3D snowflakes, you can use the origami technique.  Dennis Walker‚Äôs world-famous handicraft, on which more than one paper art expert puzzles, is hardly suitable for everyone.  This, as they say, aerobatics.  To fold it, it will take a lot of time, reinforced concrete nerves, as well as a certain dexterity in how to fold snowflakes. </p><p>  For those who are not good at origami, but still want to please their family and surprise their guests with handmade jewelry, we offer a simpler version of how to make snowflakes.  Their manufacture is based on a principle similar to that which we described in the previous paragraph. </p><h2>  Easy peasy! </h2><p>  How to fold paper for snowflakes?  Now let's figure it out. </p>

    <p>  1) Cut out a square of any size from paper. </p><p>  2) Bend it diagonally.  The neighboring edges should be clearly superimposed on each other, and the sheet should acquire the shape of a triangle. </p><p>  3) Now fold it in the middle so that the shorter sides of the figure are in contact, and the long one is divided into two identical halves. </p><p>  4) Draw with a pencil a barely noticeable dash that does not completely intersect the triangle.  It should go from the fold line and not slightly reach the opposite side. </p><p>  5) Carefully walk the scissors to the marked place. </p><p>  6) Fully unfold the paper.  Before you again should be a square. </p><p>  7) Glue together the tips of the corners located in the center. </p><p>  8) And now in the same way connect the external parts, but at the same time turn them in the opposite direction.  That is, they should be like a mirror image of the first fragment.  The first ray is ready. </p><p>  9) Make six more parts in the same way and connect them in the center with a stapler. </p><p>  10) Fix the elements in contact with each other with glue. </p><p>  Everything, a beautiful snowflake-pinwheel is ready!  You can make it white or make each ray of paper of a different color.  And decorating the product with paints or felt-tip pens will be an excellent entertainment for children. </p><h2>  We continue to create New Year's 3D! </h2><p>  Colored paper is an excellent material for creativity.  A variety of applications and voluminous products are created from it.  How to fold snowflakes, even a small child can understand.  Most often they are simple to execute and do not require much time.  Such crafts look bright, festive, airy.  We present to your attention one of the most simple and beautiful options. </p><p>  To make beautiful snowflakes out of paper in 3D format, we need the following materials and tools: </p><p>  - double-sided color paper of light and dark shades in one color scheme (in our example, violet and lilac are used, you can take any other options that are compatible with each other: blue and blue, green and lime, red and pink, yellow and orange, etc. .); </p><p>  - White list; </p><p>  - any scissors; </p><p>  - a long ruler; </p><p>  - a simple pencil; </p><p>  - PVA glue. </p><h2>  Step-by-step manufacturing instructions </h2><p>  How to make snowflakes in stages? </p><p>  Step 1. We prepare materials.  Pick colored paper in the right shades.  You can use any colors you like.  Ideally, they should be similar to each other, but if you want to use any other combination, do not restrain your inspiration and do as you like. </p><p>  Step 2. Preparatory work.  Before folding the snowflakes, cut out </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fold snowflakes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/588417.jpg" width="286"></div>  identical strips of paper (their width should be 1-2 centimeters, and the edge of the sheet will become a guideline for the length).  How many such lines will you need?  Remember:

    <p>  - a dark shade (in our case - purple) - 4; </p><p>  - white and light (in the example of lilac) - 8 pieces each. </p><p>  Step 3. We collect the first element. </p><p>  Glue the strips of purple paper crosswise.  Then, at the edges near each of them, attach the lighter part as shown in the figure. </p><p>  Step 4. Add a new color. </p><p>  Fix 4 white fragments in the same way.  Pass each strip between those that run parallel to it.  If you do everything right, the lines will be intertwined with each other, like twigs on a basket. </p><p>  Step 5. We begin to make rays.  Bend and glue together the ends of the white stripes that are next to each other. </p><p>  Step 6. We work with lilac parts. </p><p>  Pass the ends of the light colored stripes into the white loops formed, fasten them together and fix on the ‚Äúwalls‚Äù of the beam.  How to fold paper for snowflakes correctly - see the figure. </p><p>  Step 7. Make separately one more same element according to this scheme. </p><p>  Step 8. Collect the snowflake.  Combine the two resulting parts of the decoration.  Fix the purple stripes of one part inside the loops of the other, and vice versa. </p><p>  Everything, one more 3D snowflake is ready!  It will be a great addition to the festive decoration of your home or workplace.  And now you know another way of making snowflakes. </p><h2>  Openwork magic from threads </h2><p>  What could be more beautiful and refined than a tree decorated in white colors?  Airy little angels, curly little sheep, <span>bearded Santas,</span> shining silver lights of garlands ... and how can you do without light, delicate snowflakes?  The color of purity, a new beginning, winter and the main holiday of the season.  It is impossible to imagine the New Year without white decorations!  And if they are also made with their own hands - such products become more dear to your heart. </p>
