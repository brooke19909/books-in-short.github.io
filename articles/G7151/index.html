Castles and fortresses of Ukraine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A castle is a medieval building that once served as the fortified dwelling of the feudal lord.  Usually this is a large complex, which includes household, domestic and defensive buildings. </p><h2>  Castles of Ukraine from the 11th to the 19th century </h2><p>  Castles began to be erected in Ukraine since the 11th century.  Originally they were built of wood.  Sometimes fortifications in the form of earthen ramparts were also used.  And only in the 13th century stone was used to build castles.  By the beginning of the 18th century, most of these fortified structures had lost their significance.  Their owners moved to much more comfortable palaces for living.  In the 19th century, the stone of deserted, neglected castles was actively used as a building material. </p><h2>  The most popular castles for tourists </h2><p>  The following castles of Ukraine are considered the most interesting of all such fortified structures that have survived to this day: </p><ul><li>  Kamyanets-Podilsky (Khmelnitsky region). </li><li>  Lutsk (Volyn region). </li><li>  Dubensky (Rivne region). </li><li>  Olesky (Lviv region). </li><li>  Skalatsky (Ternopil region). </li><li>  Khotinsky (Chernivtsi region). </li><li>  Palanok (Transcarpathian region). </li><li>  Akkerman (Odessa region). </li><li>  Uzhgorod (Transcarpathian region). </li><li>  Zolochevsky (Lviv region). </li><li>  Sch√∂nborn (Transcarpathian region). </li></ul><p>  These are the most beautiful castles in Ukraine, worthy of visiting tourists and the attention of the state. </p><h2>  Kamyanets-Podilskyi complex </h2><p>  This is perhaps the most famous fortified medieval building in Ukraine.  The Kamenetz-Podolsky castle was built in the XIV century.  Lithuanian princes.  Since 1434, the complex passed into the possession of the Poles and was actively used as a defensive structure in battles against the Turkish-Tatar troops.  Initially, the castle stood right at the entrance to the city.  It was built of wood.  Stone structures appeared in the XVI century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In the XIX century.  Kamensk-Podolsky castle lost its military significance, and a museum-reserve was opened in it.  This complex looks like many other castles of Western Ukraine, in full accordance with the ideas of <span>modern man</span> about a fortified medieval fortress, and therefore it is very often used when shooting historical films.  For example, it was here that the films "Taras Bulba" and "Old Fortress" were shot. </p><h2>  Lutsk castle </h2><p>  This complex was built by the Lithuanian prince Lubat in the XIV century.  on the site of an old wooden fortification, erected in the XIV century.  In 2011, <span>Lutsk Castle</span> was recognized as one of the wonders of Ukraine.  Over the entire period of its existence, this complex has never been taken by either the Polish troops or the Galician army. </p><p>  Like all other castles in Ukraine, Lutsky is fenced with a stone wall with towers in the corners, on which are visible arches that once served as entrances and equipped with drawbridges.  They were later laid.  An old princely house has been preserved on the territory of the complex. </p>

    <h2>  Dubensky castle </h2><p>  The construction of this fortified structure was completed in 1462.  The Dubensky castle was founded by Konstantin Ostrozhsky.  In the XVII century, the complex was rebuilt and reconstructed in the then Renaissance style.  On its territory the ancient palaces of the princes of Ostroh and Lubomir have been preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the attractions of the fortified complex of Dubens is an extensive system of underground passages.

    <h2>  Olesky castle </h2><p>  Many castles and fortresses of Ukraine in the past were the residences of kings, including Olesky.  This fortified complex was built over six centuries ago.  The first mention of it falls on the year 1327.  In this castle, King John III Sobieski and Mikhail Koribut Vishnevetsky were born.  In the XIX century, the fortress fell into decay, and during the First World War it was almost completely destroyed.  The restoration of the old ruins was carried out in our time at the initiative of the historian Boris Voznitsky.  Now the castle has a museum-reserve. </p>

    <h2>  Skalatsky complex </h2><p>  This castle was founded by the Polish swordsman K. Wichrowski in 1630.  It is a quadrangular structure surrounded by a deep defensive moat.  A pentagonal tower with loopholes was erected on each corner.  During its existence, the Skalat Castle has changed its owners more than once.  Its owners were J. Firlei, the princes of Scipio.  During the First and Second World Wars, this fortified structure was almost completely destroyed.  Its reconstruction was carried out recently.  Like many other castles in Ukraine, Skalatsky is currently a museum complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Khotyn castle </h2><p>  When exactly this ancient fortress was built, it is not known for certain.  According to scientists, they built it at the turn of the X and XI centuries.  In the middle of the XIII century, old wooden fortifications and buildings on the orders of Prince Galitsky were replaced by stone ones.  Almost all the <span>ancient castles of</span> Ukraine that have survived to this day have undergone major reconstruction in the past.  Khotinsky is no exception in this regard.  In the XV century, this fortress was radically rebuilt.  Its area was significantly increased by constructing thick stone walls and towers.  The yard was raised by almost 10 m. </p><p>  In 1918, Khotin was captured by the Romanians, and in 1940 moved to the USSR.  In this castle, as in Kamenetz-Podolsky, historical films are often shot. </p><h2>  Complex Palanok </h2><p>  This ancient fortress is located near the city of Mukachevo.  When exactly many interesting medieval castles of Ukraine were built, historians, unfortunately, are not known.  The Palanok complex is no exception in this regard.  Some researchers believe that these defensive fortifications existed in the IX century.  In any case, the first mention of this ancient fortress is in chronicles dated to the 11th century. </p><p>  Palanok Castle lost its military significance by the 19th century.  Subsequently, this building has long been used as a prison for political prisoners.  Later, military barracks were located here.  Currently, the Palanok fortress has been completely restored, and there is a historical museum open to visitors. </p><h2>  Ackerman Castle </h2><p>  According to some reports, the construction of this structure lasted more than two centuries (XIII - XIV centuries), and it received the main strengthening in the XV century.  Castles of Ukraine are both small and large in size.  Ackerman fortress is considered one of the largest in this country.  The length of its walls is about two kilometers, and their height in some places reaches 15 m. </p>

    <p>  At the moment, <span>Akkerman fortress</span> is a historical and cultural reserve.  On its territory various festivals, music and theater, as well as fencing championships are often held. </p><h2>  Zolochevsky castle </h2><p>  The construction of this defensive structure was completed in 1634 at the expense of King Jakub Sobieski.  Behind the thick stone walls, this monarch built a two-story palace in the Renaissance style.  In terms of equipment, this is perhaps the most interesting old castle in the country.  Ukraine (at that time part of Poland) did not differ much in terms of the convenience of residential complexes.  The premises of Zolochiv Castle were heated by fireplaces and stoves.  In addition, a sewage system was provided, which is generally considered a rarity for medieval Europe. </p><p>  After the death of Prince Jacob, the <span>Zolochevsky castle</span> for some time passed into the possession of the governor Tarle.  Later, the famous princes of the Radziwill became its owners.  In the second half of the 18th century, the castle, which lost its military significance, began to gradually collapse. </p><p>  In 1801, Count Lukasz Kamarnitsky took up its restoration.  In 1834, he sold it to the Austrian government.  For some time there were barracks, and later - a hospital.  In 1872, the Zolochiv fortress began to be used as a prison.  In 1953, vocational schools were placed in the castle.  The restoration of this building began only in 1986, after it was transferred to the Lviv Art Gallery. </p><h2>  Sch√∂nborn complex </h2><p>  Some castles and palaces of Ukraine are simply amazingly beautiful architectural structures.  An example is Sch√∂nborn, built in 1890-1895.  Its founder was Buheim Sch√∂nborn.  Previously, a wooden hunting lodge was built in the Beregvar tract, which later became the summer residence of the counts.  After some time, a magnificent palace grew up here.  Schonborn <span>Castle is surrounded by</span> 19 hectares of territory on which the most beautiful arboretum is divided.  Today this building is used as one of the buildings by the Karpaty sanatorium. </p>

    <h2>  The most beautiful temples of Ukraine </h2><p>  Of course, fortresses and castles are not the only architectural landmark that this country can boast of.  No less impressive are the ancient temples of Ukraine.  Very beautiful, for example, the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, located in the center of Kiev, founded in 1051.  St. Sophia Cathedral is also widely known throughout the world - the first large Christian church in Russia, built by the son of Prince Vladimir Yaroslav the Wise in the 9th century.  The most interesting sights of this state include the Dominican Cathedral of Lviv, Svyatogorsk Assumption Lavra and many other ancient religious buildings. </p>

    <p>  Ancient castles and temples of Ukraine - the most valuable architectural monuments, the great creations of human hands, places with amazing history and unique beauty - are certainly worthy of the attention of historians and tourists.  In connection with the latest events, it is unlikely, of course, that too many Russian travel enthusiasts will decide to go to a neighboring power to explore its sights.  However, we hope that this will not always be the case, and our tourists will be able to fully appreciate the beauty and grandeur of these ancient monuments. </p>
