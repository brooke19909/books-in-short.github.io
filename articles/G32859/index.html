This model appeared relatively recently, but it has already won the hearts of many buyers.  But why?  What do users think about this model?  We now have to figure it out.  In general, consumers identified several very important criteria for evaluating a particular technique.  And, following these points, we can conclude with you how good the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is.  But before that you will have to find out the characteristics of this model.  Without them, you can‚Äôt even begin to consider a smartphone as a product for purchase.  Let‚Äôs get down to speed with you on our topic today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 active" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951776.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The first thing that modern consumers pay attention to when <span>choosing a phone</span> is the screen.  Many people like to play through this gadget.  Therefore, the size of the display is extremely important for such buyers. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S4 Active screen is quite large.  And in general, the model of the phone itself can be called slightly cumbersome.  The screen size is 5 inches.  Basically, this is normal for a modern phone.  Also, this model has a pretty good resolution - 1920 by 1080 pixels.  On the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S4 Active, you can safely watch movies and videos in FullHD format.  And with all this, do not worry about quality.  But this is not the most important thing.  The main characteristics are ahead. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The touchscreen for Samsung (our model) was developed completely new.  He literally captures any movement on the fly.  And differs in special quality.  It is difficult to scratch it, and in principle, to damage, you need to try hard.  It's not for nothing that Samsung is famous for its displays and touchscreens.  For this brand, these elements are just exemplary, which was transmitted to the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. </p><h2>  Colors and quality </h2><p>  It is also important to pay attention to image quality.  Moreover, not about video - we are talking about the system color scheme.  The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active smartphone gives users vibrant colors that are clearly displayed on the display.  With all this, 16 million colors are supported here. </p><p>  If you take the model in your hands and see how good quality paints will be transmitted to you, you can only rejoice.  The thing is that even in sunny, clear weather you can see the inscriptions on the display without any problems.  The same goes for cloudy weather.  The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active display, according to the manufacturer, is of special quality.  It is better to see and feel it once, than just to reason.  Only in this case will you be able to understand what is at stake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 active gt i9295" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951777.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memory and processor </h2><p>  A few more important points are the phone‚Äôs memory and its processor.  Maybe a few years ago, these indicators were not so important.  But only modern consumers, as mentioned earlier, are very fond of playing on their smartphones.  And run a variety of applications.  All of them require resources.  Sometimes very large.  For this reason, it is now believed that a good smartphone should launch the latest news from the gaming world. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy S4 Active specifications in this regard received quite good.  It can be said worthy.  After all, this smartphone has a processor with a frequency of 1.9 GHz, as well as 2 GB of RAM.  Yes, now you can find more "RAM".  But, nevertheless, this amount is quite enough to maintain the phone‚Äôs operating system in working condition.  And to launch toys too. </p><p>  By the way, Samsung Galaxy S4 Active GT i9295 has 16 GB of internal memory for the operating system and its data.  Honestly, not every modern smartphone is equipped with such a standard space.  A few GB (approximately 2) is occupied by the system.  And the rest remains for your personal needs.  Plus, in modern smartphones, it is customary to insert a memory card for data storage.  This will save you from losing important personal information, as well as make it mobile. </p><p>  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has a slot for a memory card.  Even two.  You can insert MicroSD or MicroSDHC into your phone.  What is the optimal memory size?  It all depends on your personal needs.  But it is worth considering that this model supports memory cards up to 64 GB inclusive.  Perhaps, not every smartphone is able to give so much free space.  For a phone, this is a very large amount.  True, often more than half of the place is crammed with all kinds of ‚Äújunk‚Äù.  But this is no longer a problem.  The main thing is that there will be no shortage of space on the phone. </p><p>  In addition, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has a fairly new operating system.  This is exactly what modern consumers demand.  After all, the newer the system, the more games and programs will be launched.  In our current model there is an ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.2.  If desired, it can be updated using special navigation and the Internet.  And this fact is extremely pleasing to consumers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battery for samsung" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951778.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Model Dimensions </h2><p>  Another important point when compiling impressions of modern smartphones is the size of the phone.  Now it is generally accepted that the larger they are, the better.  And sometimes this is true - you will normally watch movies, browse the Internet, play and read e-books.  Just carrying such a "shovel" is sometimes extremely uncomfortable.  Yes, and talk on it - too.  Especially fragile girls. </p><p>  Only for many this is not a problem.  And good.  After all, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active GT i9295, as already mentioned, is a rather large smartphone.  Not only is the display close to the tablet version, but also the length-width is quite decent.  This smartphone is 139.7 millimeters long and 71.3 millimeters wide.  But you can‚Äôt call the phone model thick.  Despite its fairly wide dimensions, the smartphone still remains quite thin - only 9.1 millimeters.  In principle, these are average statistics for a modern phone.  Sometimes you can find more bulky models.  And the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, at least in the hand, is more or less convenient.  And talking on it is also quite comfortable, despite the size. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Also, for a modern consumer, such a factor as a camera is an important element in composing impressions of modern technology.  It is believed that the better it is, the more good a smartphone can be called.  And this is a normal phenomenon - modern models are able to replace the camera, phone, computer, tablet and many more other useful things.  So if it is important for you to take pictures on your mobile (this, in addition, is extremely convenient), then the camera should be given special attention. </p><p>  In Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, everything is in order with this case.  True, the camera in this model is slightly worse than in the Galaxy S4.  But, nevertheless, it is almost impossible to distinguish between the taken pictures in quality.  Is that by "weight".  The Galaxy S4 Active has a built-in 8 megapixel camera.  This is a decent quality.  Not every model is now equipped with such features.  In principle, if you are an ordinary buyer (not a photographer), then this will be more than enough for you.  It turns out quite high-quality images, as well as a very good video. </p><p>  But there is another very important point in the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active.  Now consumers are literally "sick" with selfies.  And for this, sometimes you have to refine yourself with the ways of holding the camera in front of you.  With our current model, you can forget about it.  After all, it has a front camera of 2 megapixels.  Not as much as we would like, but that‚Äôs enough.  With its help, you can make relatively good selfies, as well as speak normally using a video call in various Internet programs.  This is exactly what many buyers are chasing now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung galaxy s4 active" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951779.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, this smartphone has support for shooting video in FullHD format.  In truth, this feature is now only supported by a small number of phones.  But every buyer wants to get it. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has a flash.  In some models, it is absent.  In addition, it can be used as a backlight while shooting clips or as a flashlight.  Very comfortable and practical. </p><p>  Perhaps this model also has another very interesting criterion.  The thing is that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is equipped with a special "Water" mode.  It allows us to take pictures and videos underwater.  In truth, a very non-standard, but extremely useful feature.  Especially for those who prefer to take original pictures and videos. </p><h2>  Multimedia and Communication </h2><p>  There are two other extremely important indicators.  These are multimedia opportunities and communication on the phone.  Many buyers pay special attention to them.  So what do we have with our smartphone today? </p><p>  It supports a media player.  Very comfortable and multifunctional.  But such a "little thing" is in almost every modern phone.  Therefore, if it was absent, it would not be worth even paying attention to this model.  Sound tracks on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active can be played almost any - from WAV to AAC and MP3.  We can say that this smartphone is literally created for music lovers.  The model shows us very well that it is a real mobile music center.  A lot of video formats are also supported - from 3GP to WMV. </p><p>  There are no problems with communication so far.  After all, there is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  In addition, if you like to access the network from your phone, then you need not worry - you will be provided with excellent Internet quality.  After all, Samsung now supports not only GPRS and 3G, but also 4G-connection.  Just what modern buyers need.  Sometimes you have to give up some smartphones due to the lack of 4G support.  But now you do not have to do this at all.  Just purchase the Galaxy S4 Active and see what this phone is capable of. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Samsung battery was a real problem for a while.  Probably, many remember how the models of this manufacturer were not very popular due to the fact that the battery did not hold a charge well.  More precisely, it quickly ended.  And, according to the <span>law of meanness,</span> at the most inappropriate, emergency moment.  But over time, this problem slowly began to disappear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 active display" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951781.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And now Samsung batteries are considered one of the best.  This also applies to our current version of the smartphone.  After all, the Galaxy S4 Active has a very good battery.  In standby mode, she is able to work for about a month.  When using the gadget only for conversations - 2 weeks.  But in cases of active use, the time can vary from 3 to 7 days. </p><p>  How are things in practice?  To be honest, with the most active use of the smartphone, the battery will work without recharging for 3.5 days.  Then you have to connect it to the network.  At about 15% charge, the phone starts to notify you that an electrical connection will soon be required.  Like many Samsung models, the Galaxy S4 Active offers a switch to power saving mode.  This is a very good option if you are sorely lacking time to get to the charger and outlet.  In this condition, the phone can last about 8 hours.  And then it turns off.  When you try to turn it on again, you will again be offered to switch to power saving mode, and then (after a few minutes) the gadget will turn off again.  But the third time the inclusion will not happen.  Until you turn on the charger. </p><p>  In principle, the Samsung battery for this model has earned quite good reviews - this time, consumers are satisfied.  Plus, the charger is standard - you can easily recharge the gadget from the cigarette lighter in the car.  Or just take the ‚Äúcharger‚Äù with you on the road - it can easily fit even in the smallest handbag.  Very mobile and compact. </p><h2>  Panel </h2><p>  Also, modern consumers pay much attention to such indicators of gadgets as their appearance.  It's about the design and panels of the phones.  Sometimes you have to change them.  Often such an action is extremely inconvenient.  And how are things going with the Galaxy S4 Active? </p><p>  The thing is that this model is equipped with a plastic case.  It is very easy and simple to change.  Tired of the usual look of the smartphone?  We just went to the store, bought a pretty socket with a print or bright pattern, changed it and rejoiced.  But, unfortunately, such a phone needs a special protective case.  Of course, you can do without it.  But do not do this.  After all, if the touchscreen in the Galaxy S4 Active is quite high-quality, then the plastic panel can crack or break at all. </p><p>  Cases for Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is not such a big problem today.  Perhaps you can find the right one at any hardware store.  The only thing that slightly confuses consumers is nothing more than the price of a case.  Sometimes with this money you can buy a simple smartphone.  However, consumers know what they are agreeing to.  Sometimes it‚Äôs better to invest in a quality case once, than to constantly change the panels or buy new, but <span>cheap smartphones.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 active screen" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951782.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price tag </h2><p>  The price of the device also plays a very important role in choosing a modern means of communication with the outside world.  Nobody wants to overpay for low-quality goods or buy a cheap gadget that does not give the result that we would like.  So you have to carefully study the reviews and recommendations about all the new products.  Only after that make your choice. </p><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active price is quite reasonable.  If you take into account the capabilities and quality of the device, then it is normal.  In stores you can find this model for 12-15 thousand rubles.  In principle, for a modern universal smartphone, the wave is acceptable.  Only not everyone is ready to give so much money.  Yes, you can always find cheaper analogues.  Only if you want to buy Samsung, is it really worth paying attention to this model. </p><p>  On the Internet, such a gadget can be ordered several times cheaper.  The approximate "virtual" value of sales and stocks is 9,000 rubles.  Can afford many consumers.  And, of course, by purchasing this gadget, you will not regret the money spent. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  What are the overall reviews for the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active?  To be honest, they are rather ambiguous.  In principle, it is quite normal under the condition of great competition in the market of modern technology.  But from the numerous opinions, only one thing can be emphasized - this is a really worthy smartphone, which in terms of price-quality ratio is within reason. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy s4 active reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/951780.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Numerous features, stylish design, innovative and new features - all for the buyer.  In addition, the phone Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is distinguished by its "survivability".  If this gadget falls into the water, then it will still work fine.  Even when falling from a height, the quality of communication or the processing speed of the device will not be affected.  The maximum that can happen is the panel will crack.  Yes, you can break the phone as a whole.  But for this you will have to try very hard. </p>
