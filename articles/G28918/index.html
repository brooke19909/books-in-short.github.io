    <p>  The object of today's review is the Highscreen Spider smartphone.  Let's try to figure out what is the highlight of this gadget, and outline all its advantages along with disadvantages, taking into account the opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary users. </p><p>  The main feature of Spider is support for fourth-generation networks (LTE).  In general, the Spider model is a middle-class gadget with a price tag of 11,000 rubles, a five-inch screen, a four-core processor and a gigabyte of RAM. </p><p>  Judging by the characteristics, the offer looks more or less interesting, but let's try to find out in the Highscreen Spider LTE Black review how much it matches its price tag.  Reviews about the model are very flattering with a total score of 4.0 out of 5 from users. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The gadget comes only in black, and the company has not yet provided for other color solutions.  The appearance of the device is standardized - a rectangle with beveled corners, and there are no designer tricks for the Highscreen Spider model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Dimensions: </p><ul><li>  height - 145 mm; </li><li>  width - 72 mm; </li><li>  thickness - 9 mm; </li><li>  weight - 165 g. </li></ul><p>  Due to the wide frames on the sides of the smartphone, the device looks a little more than other smartphones with a similar diagonal.  You cannot call it light, and where such a mass comes from is not entirely clear.  If the whole thing is in the battery, the question would be removed, but given that the battery gadget is only 2000 mAh, you have to sin on the design features of the device.  Nevertheless, the Highscreen Spider lies well in the hand without any tilt and inconvenience - although the developers went too far with the weight, they distributed it evenly throughout the body. </p><p>  The case of the device is made of matte plastic, so you can not worry that as you use the smartphone will abundantly collect scratches and prints.  If you don‚Äôt work as a welder and your hobby is not clay modeling, then you can use the gadget without a cover at all. </p><p>  The back of the case is covered with a special soft-touch coating, so the device does not slip out of your hands and is pleasant to the touch. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  The overall build quality is at a high level: the gaps are minimal, the details fit one to one, squeaks, backlashes and crunches were not seen on the Highscreen Spider.  User reviews note a positive reaction to the assembly of the model: the dust does not fill in the cracks, because there are none, the cover is removed without any problems and is also installed in place, fingerprints can be left, but quite difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Some owners of the smartphone note problems with one-handed operation due to the size of the device, but after several weeks of use, the hands get used to the device, and the discomfort is reduced to zero. </p><p>  At the top of the Highscreen Spider, at the end, is a headphone jack, just below - a camera with LED flash.  At the bottom there is a microphone, and on the back there are the main keys for controlling the device.  The cover of the smartphone is removed without problems, and in order to gain access to the battery and SIM card slots, you don‚Äôt have to make any special efforts. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Highscreen Spider 5 is equipped with a 5-inch touch screen with IPS-matrix, supporting a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  The pixel density is quite high and amounts to 294 ppi, so it is visually impossible to see individual points even from a very close distance.  If you work with the device at a recommended distance of 30-40 cm, then the picture looks holistic and bright. </p>

    <p>  The touch screen of the device can support up to five points of simultaneous touch.  The sensitivity of the display is good, so the response to touch is true in more than 90% of cases.  The gadget has good viewing angles, which is characteristic of the entire Highscreen Spider Black line.  User reviews note minor problems with automatic brightness adjustment, sinning on the sensor in the stock firmware, but the manufacturer has already released a fix in 4.4x updates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In bright and sunny weather, there may be problems with the display of the display, due to the low level of maximum brightness.  The contrast of the device allows you to comfortably work with the gadget in a dark room.  The indicator is at the level of 900: 1 with an extensive adjustment range, which is very good for an inexpensive Highscreen Spider. </p><p>  The review of color channels revealed positive dynamics and stability, although the indicators do not reach the sRGB standard.  By sight, this drawback is almost impossible to notice, especially since the uniformity of the backlight eliminates any questions about overexposure. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8926 processor with a maximum clock frequency of 1.2 GHz and 8 GB of RAM.  For the graphic component, the <span>Adreno 305</span> accelerator with one gigabyte of memory is responsible. </p>

    <p>  Due to its technical characteristics, the smartphone is able to meet the requirements of the average user.  OS performance and menu navigation work without question, turning pages and changing desktops have no delays.  Also, web surfing does not cause any difficulties.  If you do not open more than 8-10 tabs at a time, the browser can easily cope with the load without twitching and additional time to switch between tabs. </p><h2>  Games </h2><p>  As for gaming applications, the gadget demonstrates the expected results.  With small and casual games, no problems were noticed at all: applications quickly start and install almost instantly.  With more ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games, the Highscreen Spider smartphone (reviews and results were examined by us on PlayMarket) proved to be more or less tolerable.  Modern games go without delays and subsidence on the FPS, but at low graphics settings.  At maximum settings, tangible delays and discomfort appear. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  To support multimedia, the smartphone has a regular audio player without any chips and other functionality.  The speaker has a very good sound quality without obvious complaints: the interlocutor's audibility is excellent, the location is convenient, you do not have to catch the ‚Äúconversation angle‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  The volume and characteristics of the main speaker are very mediocre and reach a moderate level with a stretch: there is a clear deficit of bass, but hoarseness and metallic shades are more than enough. </p><p>  Headphones, which are included in the device‚Äôs kit, are suitable only as a headset, but they are not suitable for watching movies or listening to music.  Alternatively, you can use third-party headphones or even connect speakers. </p><p>  The default video player, in the long tradition of Android, does not play flv and mkv formats, so it‚Äôs better to immediately install additional software in the form of any powerful player. </p><h2>  Autonomous work and battery </h2><p>  Highscreen Spider has a standard 2000 mAh battery.  The device is charged with a standard device in about two and a half hours.  If you use the USB interface for charging, then 2.0 will fill the battery in three hours, and 3.0 in two hours. </p><p>  If you use "Spider" only as a phone, charging lasts an average of one day with a little, music with headphones will discharge the device in a day, and without them in five hours.  You can watch video files continuously for no more than four hours, and play games for three hours.  Numerous user reviews that they lack the device‚Äôs operating time even before the evening recharge are not heard by the company for some reason, and the developer continues to equip his models with low-capacity batteries. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with two types of cameras: front and main with a resolution of 8 megapixels.  For the first work, no questions arise - the interlocutor is clearly visible in video chats and is easily recognizable, but the main camera, judging by the reviews, has some drawbacks. </p>

    <p>  If you can still come to terms with the quality of photographs taken in fine weather, then it‚Äôs difficult to do with problems in video filming.  Even if you hold the device motionless in your hands, autofocus is constantly lost, so there‚Äôs no need to talk about shooting in a dynamic state at all. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  In general, the Spider smartphone is a competitive, but highly controversial product.  One of its main advantages is stable operation in 4G networks.  This also includes a good design, tangible performance and high-quality HD display. </p><p>  Therefore, if you are outside the coverage area of ‚Äã‚ÄãG-networks or you do not need LTE at all, you can find a more interesting device with similar characteristics and a price tag from the same manufacturer (Alpha R, Thor or Boost 2 SE). </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  LTE and GLONASS networks; </li><li>  HD display and viewing angles; </li><li>  build quality; </li><li>  performance. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  low battery capacity; </li><li>  The quality of the main camera does not allow you to shoot decent video. </li></ul>
