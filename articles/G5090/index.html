    <h2>  Other communication methods </h2><p>  Having figured out how to call the operator of the MTS of Russia in Crimea, you need to know a few more methods of communication with company employees.  The list will show alternative methods, because it is not always possible to get through to employees due to an overloaded line or for other reasons.  Therefore, the following is used for communication: </p><ol><li>  Feedback form on the website of the MTS operator.  Having entered it, the subscriber will need to select a topic for contact from the list presented, then indicate contact details and enter the essence of the question or proposal.  After a certain time, the employee will contact the client independently, according to the specified data in the questionnaire. </li><li>  MTS Russia customers may not always call the operator in the Crimea, whose number is indicated in the article.  We are talking about those issues that can be solved independently, for example, to find out call details, your tariff or connected services.  To do this, register in your personal account and get a password for authorization.  After that, access to independent management and control of your number and all services will be open.  Additionally, subscribers in your account can find online chat, thanks to which you can correspond with a consultant and receive the necessary help. </li><li>  The last method that is used in extreme cases is a visit to the MTS branded communications store.  In the salon, subscribers will be able to get any help or advice, but to use this method, you will need a passport so that employees can identify themselves. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to call the operator on MTS Russia in Crimea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48731/1818183.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Tariffs in Crimea </h2><p>  If the user does not know how to call the operator of MTS (Russia) in the Crimea, then initially it is necessary to dial the help desk using the numbers above.  It is worth noting that in Crimea, after the inclusion of Russian communications, the only tariff plan called "Super MTS Crimea" is working.  In this regard, subscribers automatically no longer need to select a tariff from a large list.  All that is needed by different customers is in only one proposal.  If we consider the tariff in more detail, we can see that Krasnodar numbers work in Crimea (+7978).  Who does not know how to call the operator on the MTS (Russia) in the Crimea, you should use the country's unique number 8 800 250 08 90. </p>

    <p>  In addition, after purchasing a starter pack, each person can receive information about the tariff, methods of communication with employees and other data, since they are presented on the packaging from the starter pack on the reverse side. </p><p>  The tariff itself includes: </p><ol><li>  20 free minutes for on-net calls. </li><li>  Ability to send and receive messages. </li><li>  3G Internet. </li><li>  The ability to use additional options for the Internet and not only. </li></ol><p>  Clients can join unlimited offers in the event that free minutes are not enough.  The cost of the additional service is 1.5 rubles / day, but payment will be charged only upon delivery.  For a quick unlimited order, you need to send a message by dialing 111, and in the body of the letter specify the code 868. In addition, you can use the service request * 111 * 868 # and the call button.  After connecting, users receive confirmation in the form of a message, and the connection takes up to 15 minutes, less often up to a day. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The article presents the main points of <span>mobile communication in the Crimea,</span> as well as detailed information on how to call the operator of the MTS of Russia in the Crimea.
