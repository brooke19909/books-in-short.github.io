    <h2>  Origin history </h2><p>  In 1936, Fritz Walter, together with engineer Fritz Bartlemens, received a patent for a mechanism for locking the channel in the trunk.  The principle of its operation was the presence of a latch rotating in the vertical plane.  This development marked the beginning of the creation of a new generation of German military pistols under the Walter brand.  The first implementation of the system was embodied in the fourth version of the developed weapon.  However, the successful execution of the mechanism was far from immediate.  It was preceded by four unsuccessful assembly options, in which a trigger of a hidden type was used.  After that, the 1929 PP model was finalized.  It changed the design of the fuse and trigger mechanism.  Now she has become with the trigger open.  In 1938, the German Walter pistol was adopted by the German armed forces.  Its use became widespread and eventually almost completely replaced the Luger-Parabellum.  "Walter P-38" became the most massive weapon of the German army.  Its production, in addition to the territory of the Third Reich, was also established in Belgium and Czechoslovakia.  In order to reduce the complexity of the manufacturing process during the war, and especially in its 2nd half, the production technology of Walter P-38 was simplified.  The weapons of the war years had a rougher finish and design without a cartridge index.  As a trophy pistol, Walter P-38 was also used in the Red Army, by partisans and soldiers of several other countries from the <span>anti-Hitler coalition.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gun walter p38" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445704.jpg" width="550"></div>

The Walter pistol (combat) was not manufactured either.  Production resumed in Germany only in 1957. Under the brand name ‚ÄúP-1,‚Äù Walther was supplied for arming the Bundeswehr.  Since 1957, two models were produced: the Walter PPK and P-1 pistols.  Both post-war samples have a lightweight (per 100 g) cast frame of aluminum-scandium alloy.  While the P-38 pistol was intended for the needs of the police, the Walter P-1 was primarily made for the armament of the country.  The thirty-eighth model in small quantities was also produced with a steel frame.  However, it was used only for commercial purposes.  In 1976, Walter, the P-1 brand pistol, was significantly improved.  To increase the service life, as well as the ability to use cartridges with a more powerful charge, the following elements were added to its design: </p><ul><li>  In the frame, in the area between the gate delay and the gate closure, a transverse dowel was installed.  This part allows you to take the load from the barrel when fired.  Thus, it became possible to extend the life of the lightweight frame. </li><li>  In the trunks began to use a plug-in pressed liner made of stellite.  This material is characterized by high wear resistance.  Due to this, the service life of the barrels increased even with intensive use of the gun in army conditions.  Also, the refinement allowed the use of cartridges with a more powerful powder charge, such as 9 X 19 mm NATO. </li></ul>

The latch located between the tides in the trunk and performing vertical rotational movements, performs locking.  To disengage it from the shutter, the back of the latch must be lowered.  She, in turn, is spring-loaded with a longitudinal rod, which is located at high tide in the breech near the trunk.  The mechanism of action of the pistol "Walter P-38" can be described as follows: when performing the rollback of the barrel, the rod is stuck in the frame.  As a result, the latch pivots to the disengaged position.  After the compression of the two return springs.  They are located on the guides in the gutter rods in the frame (upper part).  Then, when the springs are opened, the shutter pushes the barrel, and the spring-loaded rod is installed in the same position, thereby releasing the latch.  That, in turn, under the influence of the bevel rises and interlocks with the bolt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Walter ppk s air gun" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445706.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  General design </h2><p>  The gun "Walter P-38" has 58 components.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Trigger mechanism (trigger) - has a double action, equipped with an open trigger.  A twisted combat spring of a cylindrical type is located in the handle.  Trigger pull when cocked in cocked position - 2.5 kg, and with self-cocking - 6.5.  The trigger rod is installed externally on the right side of the frame. </li><li>  Check box - used to manually control the fuse.  Placed from the shutter on the left.  When it is lowered, the trigger is cocked safely.  The drummer also locks.  The rotation limiter for the trigger is lowered, while he does not have the opportunity to return to its original position to the platoon state. </li><li>  Trigger. </li></ul><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  The constructional <span>device of the trigger</span> element of the Walter P-38 pistol creates certain inconveniences in its use, especially in the conditions of military operations.  This is due to the fact that the hook's hooked position is often associated with the fuse engaged.  The mechanism has the following nuances: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The trigger element is installed in the forward position when the fuse is turned off.  This is done by turning the flag up. </li><li>  If the fuse is turned off, the hook will remain in the same position in which it was before lowering the flag. </li><li>  In case of cocking the hook, the hook moves to the rear position. </li><li>  If there is no cocking or jerking of the shutter, then when the fuse is turned on, the trigger element will remain in the front position. </li><li>  If the fuse is in the on position, the shutter will not lock, it can be distorted.  In this case, the trigger is released from the lock, and the trigger moves to the rear position. </li><li>  In order to set the fuse even after turning it off when the trigger is in the back position, you need to cock the trigger.  After that, turn on the fuse. </li><li>  If the trigger is pulled manually by holding and pulling the trigger, the hook will take the front position. </li><li>  As soon as the fuse is turned off, you can fire a shot by self-cocking or after cocking.  In the second case, the descent will be softer and shorter. </li><li>  The role of the disconnector is played by the trigger thrust.  After the shot is fired, the shutter surface comes into contact with it.  From this, the latter goes down and thereby performs disconnection with the sear.  A single fire is possible if the trigger is lowered all the way.  In this case, he takes on the force from the pressed trigger. </li><li>  In order to prevent a premature shot at the moment of "non-profit" of the shutter in the locked position, it is necessary to lock the hammer using an automatic fuse.  He is above the trigger.  To unlock the drummer, you need to move the bolt to the front position using the lifting lever.  It is located on the same level as the trigger. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The magazine in the Walter P-38 pistol holds no more than 8 rounds.  Its latch is located on the rear (end) side of the handle.  The magazine latch function is performed by a combat spring.  Above the trigger, in the back plate of the shutter, is a pointer.  It can be used to determine the presence of a cartridge in the chamber.  The pointer has the form of a protruding edge of a thin rod.  Dismantling the Walter pistol is quite simple.  After all the cartridges are used up and the magazine is empty, the shutter must be moved to the rear position.  If it becomes necessary to return to its previous state, you can lower the delay lever for the shutter.  It is located flush with the trigger element in the frame on the left.  If there is no empty magazine in the handle of the gun, then in order to remove the bolt, it must be slightly pulled back.  Then it should be released.  If the magazine is already inserted, this action will send the cartridge into the chamber and will lead the Walter (gun) to combat readiness. </p><h2>  The specifics of the design of the pistol "Walter P-38" </h2><ol><li>  This firearm uses two small diameter return springs.  They are located parallel to each other in a frame, under the shutter. </li><li>  The ejector is located on the left, so the spent cartridges go to the left. </li><li>  In order to turn on the fuse, turn the flag down. </li><li>  The trigger rod has an external arrangement.  It is located on the frame to the right. </li><li>  A distinctive feature of the pistol "Walter P-38" is a short bolt with a large hole on top.  Such a shutter design was a mandatory requirement for military personnel.  Thanks to it, it is possible to shoot through the viewing gap located in the armored vehicles. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Varieties of the pistol "Walter P-38" and its modifications </h2><ol><li>  Walther AR - a prototype of 1936, HP - the second prototype. </li><li>  Pistol P-38 (Walter).  Years of production: from 1939 to the spring of 1945.  From the end of 1945 to 1946, a small number of pistols of this model were made from previously manufactured parts.  And then, from 1957 to 2004, weapons were manufactured in some quantities on the territory of Germany. </li><li>  "Walter P-38.K" - a more modern version of the gun with a barrel shortened to 72 mm.  It was ordered in 1944 by the Imperial Security Directorate to arm certain units of the SD, SS and Gestapo employees.  Spree-Werke GmbH has produced several thousand pistols of this model.  The fly here is made flush with the shutter-casing and is part of it.  But the pillar retained the adjustment function.  On P-38.K pistols, the Walther stigma replaces cyq.  After some time, this model was used to arm the Ministry of State Security in the GDR.  Between 1974 and 1981, Walter Waffenfabrik produced another 1,500 P-38.K pistols for the needs of German anti-terrorist special forces.  Moreover, 200 of them used cartridges with a caliber of 7.65 "Parabellum". </li></ol><h2>  Walther umarex </h2><p>  Umarex-Walter is a 4.5 mm air gun.  Manufacturer - German company Umarex.  In fact, this model is a copy of the P-38 self-loading firearm, which was produced in 1938 and became one of the most widespread weapons of the Second World War.  The appearance of modern weapons with accuracy repeats its old prototype.  <span>The air gun</span> "Walter PPK S" ("Umareks") is made of a metal alloy.  It uses the Bloback system.  She copies the actions of the automation of firearms brand Walter.  <span>The air gun</span> is equipped with a single-action trigger element.  It allows you to make a preliminary platoon.  Shop "Walter P-38" ("Umareks") holds 20 balls.  The shot has an initial velocity of approximately 115-120 m / s.  The size of the gun is 21 x 13 x 3 cm. The removable barrel is another characteristic feature that this weapon has. </p><h2>  Model "P-99T" </h2><p>  The "Walter" traumatic pistol is an improved version of this type of weapon.  This is not a Walther P-99 military weapon conversion.  This model appeared almost at the same time as the Walter PP <span>traumatic pistol</span> .  In this regard, there was a opposition of weapons to each other.  The comparative characteristics of these pistols are almost identical.  Both models use equally weak and ineffective ammunition.  The main differences are the appearance and the number of simultaneously loaded cartridges.  On the last point, the undisputed leader, thanks to a spacious magazine with 15 rounds, is the Walter - P-99T brand pistol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disassembly of the pistol walther" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/445707.jpg" width="420"></div>  However, this can not be called a significant advantage, since if one shot is not able to stop the enemy, then all 15 cannot be considered reliable defense in self-defense.  The appearance of the traumatic gun "Walter P-99T" is quite interesting and attractive.  Actually, it is precisely this side of it that is the most captivating, because by its practical characteristics this Walter (pistol) does not fully comply with the requirements.  For example, such as ease of maintenance and wearing comfort.  The Walter, P-99T brand pistol, is medium in size.  On the one hand, it cannot be called pocket, since it cannot fit in any standard pocket.  But it is also not possible to attribute it to large models.  The weight of the traumatic gun, due to the low content of the amount of steel alloy, is 600 g, which is 1.5 times the weight of the P-22T model.  The advantage of the Walter P-99T pistol is its durability.  This is due to the use of aluminum alloy in the manufacture of weapons, as well as the lack of holes in the casing shutter.  However, the trigger of the gun is also made of alloy, as a result of which it is especially sensitive to various kinds of dirt and cleanings, which, in turn, has caused a short duration of the trigger element.

    <h2>  P-88, P-99 </h2><p>  The Walter pistol (gas) is an analogue of the military model.  Deciding to purchase such a weapon, it is important to follow some rules.  First of all, before opening the package with gas cartridges, its external sides must be checked for the presence of a white or yellowish powder.  In case of detection thereof, it is not recommended to open the box, since the presence of plaque indicates leakage of cartridges.  In addition, when buying them, you need to check the manufacturer‚Äôs designation on the label and on the bottom of the sleeve, and also check the validity of the information on the package. </p>
