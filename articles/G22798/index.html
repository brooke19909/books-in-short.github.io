In any season, in any weather, lovers of travel and adventure come here.  They go skiing and walking into the fierce cold and the sweltering heat to see the famous Usvinsky pillars, to admire the beauty and grandeur of this unique natural monument. </p><h2>  Usva River </h2><p>  A shallow and winding river has a fairly rapid course.  Rafting along it, you can see many miracles.  The main cluster of rock stone formations are located on the site, a length of fifteen kilometers, immediately behind the village of Usva.  If you are lucky, then in the surrounding rocks you will find imprints of primitive mollusks and ancient flora. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvin Pillars" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322692.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are many islands on this small river that divide it into two branches.  These ducts can be dangerous, and travelers need to be extremely careful, especially in the springtime, over large water.  Across the river, trees often fall and block a rather narrow channel. </p><h2>  Usvinsky pillars (Perm Territory) </h2><p>  This amazing natural monument, on the Usva River, stretching for several kilometers in length and reaching a height of 120 meters, is very popular among lovers of extreme relaxation.  Usvinsky pillars (Perm Territory) are difficult to access in winter, however, it is not so easy to get here in the summer.  How to do this, we will describe below.  Nevertheless, Usvinsky pillars are the hallmark of the Perm region, as well as the well-known <span>Stone Town.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvinsky pillars Perm region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322691.jpg" width="600"></div>

Krasnopolsky in 1889.  Together with a group of colleagues, he determined the main components of the section, described the composition of the rocks in scientific work.  He attributed the limestones that make up the section to the upper part of the coal system (then the two-term division of carbon was used). </p><p>  G.A. Dutkevich agreed with this conclusion, having described the section in scientific works, and I.I. Gorsky.  In 1965, the support sections of the Western Urals (including Usvinsky pillars) were studied by the VNIGRI thematic expedition led by A. A. Sultanaev. </p><p>  Usvinsky Pillars were recognized as a natural landscape monument of regional significance in 1965. </p><h2>  Array description </h2><p>  This is a huge stone massif located on the right bank of Usva, which is composed of limestones.  On the stones there are prints of brachiopods, ancient corals, and other fossils that remind us that the sea was here millions of years ago. </p><p>  We already mentioned that the rocky section has an average height of 120 meters and stretches almost a sheer wall for several kilometers.  Only in some places from the cliff into the river are several pillars going to the sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvinsky pillars Perm region how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322688.jpg" width="600"></div>

The unique rock form has long attracted people to these places.  Numerous caves and grottoes aroused considerable interest.  Scientists were especially interested in those who served as a shelter for ancient people in the distant past.  For example, during the ascent to the rocks, tourists encounter Stolbovaya Grotto, which still attracts adventure lovers. </p><h2>  Grotto Pillar </h2><p>  This is a Paleolithic site and workshop of the ancient inhabitants of these places.  Here were found the remains of weapons and alloys, as well as an ancient bonfire.  Our contemporaries first learned about this grotto in 1965. </p><p>  Then two friends traveling in the forest, which covers the steep slope of the Usvinsky pillars, at a height of more than a hundred meters above sea level, managed to find a large grotto.  Its vault reached a height of about seven meters.  In the summer of the same year, the grotto interested archaeologists.  Excavations began on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than twenty square meters.  The work was supervised by a world-famous archaeologist - O. N. Bader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvinskie Pillars Perm Territory how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322687.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The research results confirmed the existing version of the scientist that in the grotto was a kind of workshop for the production of tools.  At the excavation site, pebble chippers with imprints of impacts on silicon nodules were discovered.  Many researchers are sure that at the top of the grotto in ancient times, signal lights were lit. </p><h2>  Fucking Finger </h2><p>  Regardless of weather conditions, thousands of tourists visit Usvinsky pillars (Perm Territory).  How to get here, still do not know many who want to see this natural miracle.  In this article, we fill this gap, but a little later. </p><p>  So why are these places attractive?  Most experienced travelers think the reason is the Devil's Finger.  A freestanding rock with such an interesting name, resembling the giant's finger in its shape, delights and fascinates with its beauty. </p><p>  First of all, its structure and size are impressive, and then, without exception, all tourists have the question: "How does it stay on such a thin foundation?"  A rock about seventy meters high seemed to separate from the main massif, demonstrating inaccessibility and independence. </p><p>  For climbers and climbers, this situation only fuels interest in the stone.  They argue that it‚Äôs difficult, but possible to climb a rock.  At the top, where there is a flat area of ‚Äã‚Äãa very modest size, you can get several routes.  But we warn you: overcoming them requires skills and equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvin pillars how to get there by car" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  More recently, a flag of tourists developed at the top of a cliff.  He symbolized that the <span>Devil's Finger</span> was subdued.  It is believed that the name of this rock was also due to the large number of injuries and accidents that occurred during the ascent to the top.  Despite everything, the Devil's Finger is very popular today with rock climbing enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Panoramic stone, Big log, caves </h2><p>  Usvinsky Pillars are located on a busy and popular water rafting route along Usva.  From the top of the cliff, around the bend of the river, you can see another massif - the Big Log and Panoramic stones.  If you happen to go rafting on this river, be sure to stop there. </p><p>  Surely tourists will remember visiting the mysterious Pervomaiskaya Cave, which is located on the right bank of Usva.  It is not visible from the river, so it is not easy to find it during the rafting.  The length of the cave is 160 meters.  It consists of several grottoes.  Please note that the walls of the last of them are covered with beautiful calcite growths and smudges. </p><h2>  Omutnaya Stone </h2><p>  It rises on the right bank of the river, sixteen kilometers from the village of Usva.  Its name is associated with a deep pool under it.  Shallow throughout Usva, it forms a very deep whirlpool (up to six meters).  The water here is always very cold, due to the many springs.  In summer, small streams run down from the stone, and in spring you can see magnificent waterfalls.  In winter, the rock is covered with picturesque ice floes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvinsky pillars Perm region in the winter" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1323423.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Usvinskie Pillars (Perm Territory): how to get there? </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists visit the unique natural complex during rafting along Usva, but there is a way to get here by land.  To do this, you need to come to the village of Usva and go down under the railway bridge.  Here you will see a camp site that you need to get around. </p><p>  Then you should walk five kilometers along the river.  In summer, the path is well trodden, although sometimes there are obstacles in the form of fallen trees.  After four kilometers, you will find yourself at the river, and then continue along the coast.  It is rocky, so take care of comfortable shoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Usvin Pillars" class="if" height="462" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1322686.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the left are excellent places for tourists, but in the summer they are almost always busy.  Your path continues until the river turns.  Here you will see a wooden arbor from which the fork begins.  Two paths lead to the summit itself - gentle, but longer, and steep, faster, but requiring good physical preparation. </p><p>  We foresee the question of motorists who want to see Usvinsky pillars: "How to get there by car?"  Just want to warn that the road (far from the highway) will submit only to SUVs.  From the village of Usva, before reaching the gravel descent, you need to turn right along the second, narrower power transmission line. </p>
