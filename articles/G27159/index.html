    <h2>  The history of the development of the village </h2><p>  Earlier in the 14-15th centuries (judging by ancient chronicles) in its place was the Mari village.  The village of Baki was first formed only in 1617. The official record of this was made by Moscow clerks.  According to some reports, the village received its name in honor of the Bokovka River, but there are other versions that history is silent about. </p><p>  The village of Red Baki was the center of the waterway and had the most important economic and geographical importance.  This has become a key factor in the development of the area rich in game and forests.  For several centuries, more and more new villages and temples were built, and the fishing industry was actively developing.  The main direction of the region was the transportation of wood. </p><p>  This prompted the authorities to build a railway.  Subsequently, the Vetluzhskaya station was formed, which after a while turned into a prosperous village.  In the 20th century, a wood chemical plant and a woodworking plant were erected.  In 1947, by order of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the</span> village was given the official status of a working-class <span>urban type settlement.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
