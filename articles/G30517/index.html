Often among these were stones with through holes that could not appear randomly in natural conditions.  They were popularly called "witch's fingers" or "damn stones."  Every person believed that happiness could smile after he found a mysterious ax.  If you hang it near the roost, then this will positively affect the performance of chickens.  In fact, everything was simple, such inventions and discoveries of primitive people helped to evolve. </p>

    <h2>  Mystery of stones </h2><p>  Charles Darwin helped clarify the origin of the mysterious objects.  According to his theory of evolution, which came to fame in the 19th century, the ancestors of modern man were monkey-like creatures with a primitive level of development.  Such important inventions and discoveries of primitive people helped to become primates developed and thinking people. </p><p>  Assumptions about stones that have been processed by ancient masters have been put forward by Lucretius Carus.  It was this ancient Roman philosopher who in the 1st century BC explained to his compatriots that they are the fruit of a long journey of improvement.  At the initial stage of their development, tools and weapons were made of stone by people, therefore, this period <span>of human history</span> Lucretius called stone.  Following the proposed principle, the author of the theory has also identified the bronze and iron periods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Who lived before Adam and Eve? </h2><p>  Alas, the power of Rome was not eternal, he could not resist the onslaught of numerous tribes of barbarians who mercilessly ravaged the city.  During one of these predatory raids, the scientific achievements of Lucretius Cara were irretrievably lost.  The inventions and discoveries of <span>primitive people</span> were again changed.  Each scientist wanted to contribute to the theory of the origin of strange objects. </p><p>  Already in the 16th century, ‚Äúwitch fingers‚Äù accidentally fell into the hands of the French public figure Isaac de Pereira.  The study of unusual stones became a hobby, and Pereira continued his search.  This topic even prompted to write a book in which the philosopher presented an interesting idea.  For many, many years before the biblical events associated with Adam and Eve, a certain race of people already existed on our planet.  In their daily lives they used made stone tools. </p><h2>  Domestication of Fire </h2><p>  From the moment that it was possible to tame the fire and make it home, a lot of time passed until the primitive man found a way to get it.  Somewhere, the fire had to be carefully protected all the time from adversity in the cave, fed, not allowed to go out.  History is silent about which of the primitive inventors came up with the brilliant idea that fire can be obtained by friction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Most likely, the discovery is spontaneous.  For example, in the process of creating some kind of wooden tool where the drilling operation was used.  However, gradually this method was mastered and adopted by many tribes and nationalities.  What inventions and discoveries of primitive people have changed the world and society can be found in this article. </p><h2>  How was the fire made? </h2><p>  The method of making fire could look as follows.  Any of us can use it: </p><ol><li>  You will need two dried wooden sticks. </li><li>  In any of them it was necessary to make a small depression (hole). </li><li>  Place a stick with a hole on the ground and fix it with a knee. </li><li>  Put the second stick vertically, hold it with the palms of both hands, after putting its end into the hole of the first stick. </li><li>  Very intensively move your palms relative to each other, forcing the wand clamped in them to make alternating rotational movements in opposite directions. </li></ol><p>  It is not surprising that during this process the hands of the fire-seeker gradually appeared in the lower part of the rotatable stick, which had to be pressed strongly into the hole.  Therefore, each time a person quickly transferred his hands to the starting position and started all over again.  This caused some inconvenience.  The most primitive discoveries and inventions of mankind in the end yielded special results.  Having learned to make fire, people stopped eating raw meat and were able to protect themselves from the cold and predators of that time. </p><h2>  Wheel Invention Version </h2><p>  Our distant ancestors arose the need to move heavy dimensional objects from one place to another.  It could be thick tree trunks, huge stones, swimming equipment.  Such work could be done not so exhausting, if you use primitive rollers.  The inventions and discoveries of primitive people continued to make their lives easier. </p>

    <p>  Surely, observing the rotating rollers that underwent rough processing, one could come to this conclusion.  The load along the cylinder will move smoothly without skidding to the sides if the shape of the roller is slightly changed so that the diameter in the middle part is less than at the edges.  This could be achieved by burning with a flame.  The result was a kind of "slope." </p><p>  Gradually, people realized that it was not necessary to lay a massive log, but only need to cut it into rollers of the same width and pair it with an axis.  In the future, the rollers began to be manufactured separately until they turned into full-fledged wheels, which were adapted to the wagons.  Such inventions of <span>primitive society have</span> allowed us to enjoy car driving. </p><h2>  Background of the invention of writing </h2><p>  At the dawn of its development, millions of years ago, people communicated not only through sounds and gestures.  They also tried to communicate something or warn each other by arranging branches or arrows in a certain order, making fires with thick smoke.  In a word, conditional signals were given.  Over time, warning systems have been perfected. </p><p>  In different parts of the world, human imagination has been refined in methods of storing and transmitting information.  So among the ancient Incas, <span>nodular writing</span> became widespread <span>.</span>  Multi-colored knots served as its elements.  For this purpose, woolen laces were used, which were knitted in different ways on a special stick.  In the described way it was possible to fix this or that law, "write down" a poem or describe a specific event.  Nodal writing was used for some time by the distant ancestors of modern Mongols and Chinese.  In various fields, inventions and discoveries of primitive people were created.  History is the only source of information about this.  Archaeologists carefully study all objects, explaining the origin of things that are familiar to us. </p>

    <p>  About four millennia BC, people decided that it was much more convenient to transmit and store information in drawn characters that vaguely resemble elements of modern writing. </p><h2>  Bow and arrow - a brilliant invention </h2><p>  For a man who lived in the <span>Stone Age, a</span> bow seemed to be a complex type of weapon, the invention of which could only have occurred to a brilliant weapons designer.  Based on the fact that other devices and tools of labor became more perfect gradually under conditions when a person had to deal with them every day.  These inventions and discoveries of primitive people allowed hunting in a more fruitful way. </p><p>  A bow with arrows does not fit into such a model.  Also not too convincing is the version about the parallels between the bow and the bent branch, which, when straightened, throws the arrow at a great distance.  In this case, the inventor must have a good mind, fine observation, considerable experience in the manufacture of various devices.  Moreover, the prototype of the arrow could serve as a light spear, which could hunt birds and small animals.  Historians carefully study the inventions and discoveries of primitive people.  The list of significant homemade items is great, but an ax, bow, writing, fire and clothing occupy a special place.  These items allowed humanity to survive. </p>

    <h2>  How to create a bow? </h2><p>  The invention of the bow was helped by observing how a bent branch or a young tree behaves.  As a modern physicist would explain, the energy of elasticity, freed from the holding force of a branch (tree), ultimately turns into kinetic.  Primitive people used this principle in passive hunting with the help of spring snares.  Be that as it may, the very first bow could be created in the following way: </p><ol><li>  Bend the branch, giving the shape of an arc. </li><li>  Tie it to the opposite ends with woven animal veins or long hair. </li><li>  After pulling the bowstring all the way and then releasing it, the arrow acquired enough energy to defeat the animal. </li></ol>
