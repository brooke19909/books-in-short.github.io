It‚Äôs not necessary to have any special skills to create jewelry - just stock up on some necessary tools, accessories for making jewelry and take the time to master a few simple tricks that will help you quickly and easily make bracelets from beads and beads with your own hands in the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/596944655/8mm-manmade-cat-eye-glass-round?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=bracelet%20beads&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-5"><img itemprop="image" alt="beads on a string" class="if uuid-2391732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391732.jpg"></div><h2>  Beadwork &amp; Bead Bracelets </h2><p>  It is best to start creating jewelry with the choice of a specific project, and then go to the store and purchase the necessary accessories and tools.  In order to make an ordinary bracelet from beads, it is enough to purchase the beads themselves, sip and choose one of the types of fasteners.  Bead bracelets require a more detailed approach. </p><p>  Depending on the type of decoration, not only clamps and fasteners may be needed, but also other accessories: </p><ul><li>  carnations (pins); </li><li>  connecting rings; </li><li>  connectors </li><li>  cups for beads; </li><li>  bails; </li><li>  carbines; </li><li>  delimiters. </li></ul><p>  Of the tools you need jewelry nippers and pliers, pliers, needles, files - to expand the holes in the beads.  For storage and work with beads you will need special containers with lids, transparent bags or pouches.  Beads are very easy to spill and it is almost impossible to collect from the floor or bed, because all the jars for it should be easy to open and securely close.  It is worth thinking about packaging for a bracelet in advance if it is created as a gift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": 4petessake, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/231579185/beaded-loom-bracelet-tutorial-pdf"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weaving bead and bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2391727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391727.jpg"></div><h2>  Weaving - a technique for creating jewelry for beginners </h2><p>  If you are new to beadwork and unsure of your abilities, it is best to start by mastering the weaving technique.  The only difficulty that may arise in the process is the acquisition or independent production of a special machine that facilitates the weaving of the web.  The machine will definitely be needed when working in this technique, and with it it will be much more convenient and faster to weave wide bracelets from beads and beads.  You can choose a convenient option for you in stores that sell goods for needlework.  Most often, large woodworking machines are found on sale, on which not only small ornaments are woven, but also large panels of beads.  There are also cheaper and less practical plastic products.  It makes sense to purchase them if you are going to make many bracelets from beads and beads.  But if you plan to make only one - it is worth trying to make a <span>beadwork machine</span> yourself. </p><h2>  The benefits of weaving beads and beads on a loom </h2><p>  In the weaving technique, you can create jewelry with a certain ornament or even with inscriptions.  Choosing the right pattern, it is easy to make a gift with your own hands, not only for a woman, but also for a man.  The thickness and length of the bracelet can be chosen independently.  This method is suitable for the manufacture of accessories of various shapes - rectangular and with sharp corners.  The finished fabric can be glued to a metal base or sewn onto a leather product.  One of the main advantages of this method is the high strength of the finished product.  Due to the fact that the thread passes through the beads several times, it is rather difficult to break such an ornament.  In the weaving technique, both beads and beads can be used to make the bracelet, but these materials cannot be combined - for an even cloth, all beads must be the same size. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using the machine to create jewelry </h2><p>  To work in the weaving technique you need a machine.  You can make it from improvised materials.  Some needlewomen use for this the usual foam container made from eggs or other products, in which they cut at the equal distance the required number of holes on both sides of the container and pull the threads through them.  You can make bracelets from beads on an elastic band, but they usually use isonia or cotton thread.  The number of slots depends on the braiding pattern and the number of beads in a row.  To this quantity, you always need to add one for an additional thread.  That is, if there are 10 beads in the pattern, 11 threads are pulled onto the machine.  On machines in this way not only jewelry is made, but also more complex products - bags, wallets, belts and decorative panels. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself bead making machine </h2><p>  When using such a budgetary way to create a weaving machine, one detail should be remembered: if you use a container with too thin walls, they can break when the material is tight.  Then some part of the product is deformed.  For work, it is best to use strong containers or to fix the threads on opposite sides using ordinary stationery clips.  Another option is to connect two wooden slats between each other and hammer in them several carnations, on which it will be possible to fasten the threads, or use one board, sawing grooves in it from both sides. </p><h2>  Preparing for weaving a bracelet: choosing a pattern </h2><p>  Before you make a bracelet from beads or beads using the weaving technique, you first need to decide on the weaving pattern.  You can use any liked ready-made version or draw it yourself.  Creating a scheme for a <span>personalized bracelet</span> made of beads and beads will not be difficult even for a novice - just mark the letters on a regular sheet into a cage, counting each cell as a bead, select the required thickness of the jewelry - and you can get to work.  The weaving process will become more complicated if the pattern is too shallow and fuzzy.  It is advisable to number the rows so as not to stray while counting the right number of beads of different colors to create a pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to choose the right material for beadwork </h2><p>  The choice of colors depends on the preferences of the master or the wishes of the customer.  Men's bracelets made of beads and beads are usually made of muted and dark colors, but there are exceptions.  Having decided on the scheme, color scheme and preparing the machine for work, you can proceed with the acquisition of the necessary materials.  For bracelets made from beads and beads, it is very important to choose a smooth, high-quality product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": MAYASGoods, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/510610303/christmas-gift-beads-kit-beads-pack-diy?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=bracelet%20beads&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-38"><img itemprop="image" alt="beads set" class="if uuid-2391734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391734.jpg"></div><p>  Cheap, non-calibrated beads and jagged beads will greatly complicate the process.  Defective beads can not be used for the manufacture of products.  Their use may lead to an unsatisfactory result.  Due to the difference in the shape of the beads and beads, the pattern is deformed, which causes the bracelet to become distorted and the ornament to be broken.  Time for making jewelry can be wasted, and everything will have to be redone.  Time costs are especially important if the bracelet is made to order.  It is better to save your strength and immediately acquire the material more expensive, but better. </p><h2>  Bead Bracelet: Weaving Workshop </h2><p>  For weaving jewelry on the machine using the weaving technique, you will need beads No. 10, a special thread for beadwork, or thin cotton yarn for crocheting, for example, the Iris brand, as well as bead needles.  Beads and beads are conveniently placed in small plastic containers, which can be purchased separately or use any small boxes for cosmetics.  Making bracelets from beads with your own hands begins with pulling the thread on the machine.  It is fixed with a knot in the first cell of the slats, and then stretched to the opposite side from the calculation: the number of beads in a row + one additional thread.  You can adjust the thread tension using the top rail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": Zagovor, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/473173455/loom-weaved-bracelet-with-ancient?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=for%20weaving%20bracelets&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-46"><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving bracelet" class="if uuid-2391753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391753.jpg"></div><h2>  Weaving a bracelet </h2><p>  The sieve, on which beads or beads will be strung, is tied on top to the leftmost thread stretched on the machine, and the right amount of beads or beads is gathered on the needle.  Beads stretch to the end of the thread, to the nodule, the thread itself is held under all the others.  Each bead needs to be distributed between the threads stretched on the machine.  The row is fixed as follows: while holding the beads with your fingers, you need to pass through them a needle and thread in the opposite direction over the pressed threads and pull it out.  The first row is ready.  Subsequent rows are performed in the same way.  In the process of weaving a bracelet of beads with your own hands, it is very important to correctly calculate the location of various shades of beads so as not to spoil the pattern.  Each new row should be tightened so that the canvas is even.  Having finished weaving a bracelet of beads with your own hands, you need to remove it from the machine and fix the clamps at the ends or weave the remaining threads into bundles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": AhyokaAfrica, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/557949511/native-weave-bracelet-stack-bracelets?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=for%20weaving%20bracelets&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-40"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2391746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391746.jpg"></div><h2>  Carnation Bead Bracelet </h2><p>  An elegant and uncomplicated bead bracelet can be made using special cloves or pins.  On one side of such a clove there is a loop - it holds a bead on a pin.  The other end of the clove is sharp.  It can also be turned into a loop using special pliers.  To create a bracelet, you need to make a lot of blanks, putting beads on the cloves and twisting the loop on the other side.  This is painstaking and monotonous work, but the result is worth the time and effort.  To assemble a bracelet from beads with your own hands you will need a fishing line.  The blanks are strung on it, and clamping beads are fixed at the ends with the help of round-nose pliers.  It remains only to add locks - and the bracelet is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": glasspearlstore, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/205991267/teal-pearl-braceletglass-pearl?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=pears%20bracelets&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-10"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead bracelet" class="if uuid-2391749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391749.jpg"></div><h2>  Memorial Wire Bead Bracelet </h2><p>  Another simple way to make a bracelet from beads and beads is using memorial wire, or memory wire.  To create such an ornament, you can use any set of beads, combining different ones.  Bales or separators can be placed between the beads.  To outline the sequence of stringing beads, you can first use the wire for training.  Having decided on the scheme, you need to re-arrange all the beads in the same sequence on the memorial wire, after making a loop on the tip so that they do not fly off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": BridgeTollBeading, " data-source="https://www.etsy.com/listing/571915660/silver-memory-wire-bracelet-silver-wrap?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=memorial%20wire&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-4&amp;plkey=b27c59806661ac70140e921f682f245fcb8128da:571915660"><img itemprop="image" alt="memorial wire bracelet" class="if uuid-2391759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2391759.jpg"></div><p>  When all the beads are in place, using a pair of pliers on the end of the wire, you need to make another loop.  Give the product a finished look will help additional beads at the ends.  To fix them, you need cloves that need to be twisted on one side, as in the previous version.  The easiest way to connect blanks to a bracelet is with rings.  Their tips are pulled apart by pliers, and then fastened with the same tool.  In a similar way, you can make bracelets from beads on an elastic band. </p>
