It is this model that has become quite popular among the average user.  She was not particularly impressed with the players.  But why did this happen?  After all, Sony has always been famous for its smartphones.  It is the study of this topic that we will take up now.  In truth, to understand this question, you have to carefully understand the characteristics of the Sony Xperia Ion.  They are responsible for the basic features of the phone.  Let‚Äôs start with you to study the topic as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  System </h2><p>  Let's start with what many users pay attention to first of all - from the phone‚Äôs operating system.  To be honest, it is she who often makes some potential buyers abandon one or another smartphone model.  How are things going with Sony Xperia Ion? </p><p>  Quite positive, but could have been better.  The thing is that the Android operating system is installed on this model.  Everything seems to be normal - the buyers got used to it and even fell in love.  But the main catch here is in the build version.  This is 4.0.3.  At the moment, it is considered quite old.  In principle, this is not so critical.  After all, you can easily and simply update the operating system using the Internet and a special menu item.  Do not want to update yourself?  Then yes, a slightly outdated operating system will become a problem for you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Ion is more than just a phone system.  It is also a good hardware.  And the main thing here is such a thing as a processor.  It is he who is responsible for the power of the device.  It is believed that the better it is, the faster the phone model will become.  And how is that with our smartphone? </p><p>  It‚Äôs quite good.  The Sony Xperia Ion processor has 2 cores with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz.  This is a pretty good indicator for a regular phone.  Of course, this model will not work as a gaming smartphone.  But for calls and work with the device in the "business" format - completely.  So if you are looking for a gaming smartphone, you will have to give it up.  But otherwise, pay attention to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958641.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, a fairly powerful processor allows us to simultaneously run up to 10 applications and work comfortably with them.  Sometimes it is very useful.  Especially if you are a business person and you need to constantly work with the phone.  The Sony Xperia Ion, a review of which is presented to our attention, is just what suits you best.  This option is considered quite a good phone. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  In its composition, a modern smartphone is somewhat reminiscent of a computer.  He has many similar components.  For example, such a part is RAM.  For the functioning of the smartphone, it is quite important.  And there is nothing to be done.  This type of memory is responsible for the performance and speed of the smartphone.  It must match the processor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>At Sony Xperia</span> Ion, the characteristics in this regard are quite good for the average phone.  After all, the RAM here is set to 1 GB.  Modern innovations, as a rule, offer us from 2 to 4 GB.  So, "Eksperiya" is really that smartphone that will be "no frills" and is more suitable for business purposes than for modern entertainment.  So it all depends on your needs.  According to them, you will have to decide how good or bad the model is.  Only here in its characteristics Sony Xperia Ion is really worthy of attention.  1 GB of RAM goes well with a processor with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz.  And this, in turn, helps to ensure the speed of the operating system on the device.  Just what all potential buyers need in general.  Nobody likes a ‚Äúbraking‚Äù smartphone. </p><h2>  Personal File Storage </h2><p>  Also, a rather important point here is such an item as free space on a smartphone.  It is responsible for the amount of valid data to store.  And any modern buyer, regardless of their purchase goals (games or work), wants to get a model with a large indicator.  The bigger, the better.  And this is quite normal.  Especially if you take into account the volume of modern documents and multimedia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958640.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sony Xperia Ion phones are equipped with 16 GB of memory.  Of these, approximately 1.5 go to the operating system.  The result is about 14.5-14 GB.  In principle, for many this is enough.  Only by the <span>"law of meanness",</span> this space will soon begin to be missed.  And in this case, you have to look for a way out of the situation.  Fortunately, he is. </p><h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  The thing is that with a shortage of space in the phone's memory, you can install an additional card.  It is inserted directly into the device, after which it is used without problems.  Unfortunately, modern phone models are sometimes made without this feature.  And this fact is very upsetting.  In addition to expanding free space, the memory card has another plus - it makes data mobile.  Have you changed your phone?  We transferred the memory card to a new device and use our personal data further.  No problem! </p><p>  And the <span>Sony Xperia</span> Ion smartphone allows us to take this opportunity.  This model has a slot for a microSD memory card.  To be honest, this is the most common option.  The maximum allowed card size is 64 GB.  But it‚Äôs better not to completely slaughter her.  Otherwise, crashes and malfunctions in the operating system.  Therefore, it is better to limit the filling of approximately 63 GB from the memory card.  This will avoid unnecessary problems.  After all, otherwise you can find the phone just awful.  Although in reality this is not at all true. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Of course, for modern customers, the size of the phone matters.  It is generally accepted that the larger the device, the better.  Yes, if you want to play the latest news of the gaming industry on this device, then this is true.  But just wearing such a smartphone is not very convenient.  And to hold in hands - too.  There should be harmony in everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958639.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Sony Xperia Ion receives very positive reviews for its screen.  Its diagonal is 4.5 inches, and the resolution is quite high - 1280 by 720 pixels.  To be honest, this should be enough to watch movies in high quality directly on the device.  Just what a modern user needs so much. </p><p>  In addition, the smartphone <span>Sony Xperia</span> Ion gives us a bright, clear and unforgettable picture.  After all, this device is capable of showing up to 16 million colors and shades.  Do not admire this indicator - this is normal for a modern phone. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the "Experia" has a <span>capacitive</span> touch <span>screen,</span> which is well protected by a special glass.  This makes the touchscreen resistant to damage, drops and scratches.  Try to use this model, and you will be pleasantly surprised. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Sony Xperia Ion has great photos and videos.  And this feature is often paid attention to.  After all, for a modern person it is important that the smartphone replaces many other gadgets.  For example, a camera or a real camera for shooting video.  This is especially true for expensive models. </p><p>  There are two cameras in this model.  And do not be surprised at this.  Now many phones are equipped with a front and rear camera.  And this is normal.  The first type is for taking selfies, as well as for video calls and related calls.  The quality thereof will not be particularly good.  For example, in our case - 1.3 megapixels.  For the front camera, this is a good indicator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion review" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rear camera is a type of device familiar to everyone.  It is needed for photographing and video.  The quality of the image we receive depends on the quality indicators of this part.  And, therefore, this moment is very important.  And here things are very good.  This model is equipped with a 12 megapixel camera.  It also has autofocus and flash - very useful additions that will make your pictures better and sharper.  If you want to get a fairly inexpensive phone that will be suitable for photographing, then the Sony Xperia Ion is a great option for you. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Also a pretty important detail is the phone‚Äôs battery.  It's no secret that modern customers are often tormented by the fact that their phones are quickly discharged.  And so you have to look for more universal smartphones in this regard.  Just such is the Sony Xperia Ion.  The lithium-ion battery allows you to work with the device for a long time without recharging. </p><p>  A bit of specificity.  For example, in standby mode, this model can lie about 1 month.  With regular conversations - 2 weeks.  And if you want to play on your smartphone and actively use the Internet, then you can count on about 3-4 days of the device‚Äôs operation without recharging.  It is a decent indicator, which can only please. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Communication support is also included in the Sony Xperia Ion.  The characteristics of this indicator are good.  This phone allows you to use 2G and 3G-connection.  Just what a modern buyer needs so much.  True, 4G is not supported here.  And it sometimes scares.  Do not be afraid - even without this new network, your smartphone can provide good and reliable communication. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that there is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  These two features enable you to receive and send data wirelessly at high speed.  And that means that with the help of Experia you can quickly exchange data.  Sometimes it is very useful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia ion" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958637.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  When buying, it is important to know the complete set of the device.  The standard package includes: headphones for Sony Xperia Ion, user manual, warranty card, receipt, battery and charger. </p><p>  To be honest, without these components, you can begin to suspect the store of selling fakes.  It is on the bundle that many determine how good a product is in front of them.  However, in order to leave the store in full "combat readiness", you will additionally have to purchase a phone case and a protective film.  Sometimes these components can be extremely useful. </p><h2>  What is to be repaired </h2><p>  Unfortunately, despite all the advantages of the model, buyers quite often carry out repairs on some Sony Xperia Ion components.  Doing this yourself is not worth it.  It would be better to take the device to a specialized service.  There, for a small fee, you will eliminate all the problems that have arisen. </p><p>  What components most often break?  For example, a touchscreen.  Sony Xperia Ion, whose photo is presented to our attention, quite often it stops responding to touch.  In this case, replacing the screen will help. </p><p>  Also among the main problems of the model are the battery and speakers.  Fortunately, repair is not required if you handle the device very carefully. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, we both learned what Sony Xperia Ion is and also understood which components are most often to be repaired.  In addition, we also figured out the reviews about the model.  And now it's time to decide whether this smartphone is suitable for us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia ion instruction" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/958636.jpg" width="600"></div>

Are you planning to play the latest mobile games?  Then it is quite possible to consider the Experiment Aion as an option.  But lovers to play it is better to look at another model. </p>
