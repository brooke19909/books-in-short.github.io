Therefore, people do not even manage to have lunch. </p><p>  In a series of comments, employees say that they have to sit on calls to customers too often.  Also, customer dissatisfaction and their incorrect behavior towards bank employees are sometimes reported, which requires great stress resistance. </p><p>  For the rest, it is said that in the team everyone is responsible only for himself, there is no any help or support from colleagues, there are also many complaints about the instability and futility of the work. </p><p>  Thus, in many comments, Promsvyazbank employees advise others not to get a job in this organization.  It is also emphasized that almost half of those who already work in it are looking for a new place and really want to quit faster. </p><h2>  Positive comments </h2><p>  In contrast to the negative reviews, some write that their work at Promsvyazbank is quite satisfactory.  People call their work in this institution stable and interesting.  Positive comments also note that reports about low wages are untrue, and those who really want to earn money can always do this at Promsvyazbank.  Also, a plus is that wages are paid to people white and a full social package is provided. </p><p>  The following are the reviews of Promsvyazbank depositors. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Promsvyazbank deposits reviews of investors" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2223086.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Based on the reviews, it can be said that the client audience is not so categorically opposed to Promsvyazbank as its employees, but they also have a lot of discontent.  We will talk about this a bit later. </p><p>  So, customers note the friendliness of the staff, as well as its competence.  In particular, it is reported that bank employees always behave very responsive and try to help.  Customers also like the fact that Promsvyazbank gives people a mortgage when other financial institutions refuse to help.  Customers also like the fact that the organization is a large institution and, in many respects, causes trust.  What other feedback are there from depositors about Promsvyazbank? </p><h2>  Negative comments </h2><p>  In general, there is a high-quality and fast customer service, without any queues.  Attractive deposit conditions are mentioned in comparison with other similar organizations. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, a very small number of offices in Russian cities are often called, which is why it often takes a long time to get to the office.  The feedback of the Promsvyazbank depositors of Volgograd is mainly about this. </p><p>  Frequent errors on the part of the bank are also reported, and in addition, when closing a credit card, a receipt may be sent to the client with the amount of excessive debt that is simply taken from the air.  It tells about cases in which customers are often called from an overdue debt service, demanding payment of a certain amount of money, while he is sure that he owes nothing to the bank.  Therefore, according to customer reviews, Promsvyazbank is an unprofessional and fraudulent organization. </p><p>  There are also complaints about broken and malfunctioning ATMs, as well as the fact that equipment in branches also often breaks down.  The company cannot boast of a high level of remote service.  So, for example, in some reviews, people complain that they have to go straight to the organization‚Äôs office to connect certain services.  Feedback from depositors about deposits at Promsvyazbank confirms that opening a profitable business, but not lending much. </p><p>  People also don‚Äôt like the fact that the bank does not work on weekends, and therefore the transfer of money should be planned taking into account a certain schedule.  In addition, through Promsvyazbank, customers are not able to pay fines and taxes.  The obsession of services with regular calls and messages about various offers is also not pleasant to customers. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank reviews promsvyazbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59177/2223085.jpg"></div>

Still many do not become obsolete that in a given financial institution it is impossible to close your deposit online if it exceeds one million rubles.  There are also complaints that Promsvyazbank deducts a fee for incoming payments from individual entrepreneurs.  Large fees are also charged as part of transfers from other banks. </p><p>  Reviews of Promsvyazbank depositors in St. Petersburg in this regard are available. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, despite the stability and ten-year history, when reading reviews from both customers and company employees, we can say that the organization still has many shortcomings that need to be fixed in order to continue to stay afloat against such a powerful background. competition. </p><p>  We reviewed the feedback from Promsvyazbank customers and employees. </p>
