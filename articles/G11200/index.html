  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crop a SIM card for iPhone 4 or iPad</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple generally makes technical decisions in accordance with the views of its management.  In certain cases, some of the nuances in the development of corporation products can even lead consumers to wonder.  This, in particular, happened when Apple representatives announced at one of the presentations that almost all of the company's products would be designed for use with MicroSIM cards. </p><p>  Of this tragedy, none of Apple's fans did.  Looking ahead, it should be said that after reading this publication to the end, its readers will learn how to trim a SIM card in IPhone 4. In fact, of course, the release of SIM cards of the appropriate format was established.  It is also no secret that not every user of such products is always up to date on any innovation. </p><p>  You could even say that when buying an iPhone or iPad, some consumers came across a very unpleasant surprise, because they needed a non-standard-sized SIM card.  Our consumers managed to find a way out of this situation.  This article discusses how to trim a SIM card for the iPhone 4, but it‚Äôs easy to guess that the issue is solved similarly for the iPad, the release of the Apple company under consideration. </p><p>  The good news is that we will talk about standard SIM cards of any operators.  The described method of solving the problem is suitable for absolutely everyone.  How to cut a SIM card for iPhone 4, turning it into <span>MicroSIM (micro SIM),</span> now any reader will know.  This is a really simple process, after the correct execution of which, it will be possible in a few minutes to start operating the brand new IPhone or iPad. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, how to trim a SIM card for iPhone 4?  If you pay attention to the slot in which MicroSIM (micro SIM) should be located, you can easily notice that the standard SIM card is clearly large and not suitable.  It turns out that the question is solved so simply that at first it is even somewhat surprising.  You will need ordinary scissors (a sharp boot knife will do) and, of course, some skill. </p><p>  You should also familiarize yourself with the dimensions of <span>MicroSIM (micro SIM)</span> : </p><ul><li>  Length - 15 mm. </li><li>  Width - 12 mm. </li></ul><p>  To get started, you just need to markup with a regular ruler and pencil.  In general, it is even better if there are old, unnecessary SIM cards that you can train on.  What is it for?  The fact is that there will be only one attempt, so if you carelessly perform this operation, it will be almost impossible to fix anything.  Further actions are performed in the following order: </p><p>  Step One: The SIM card is carefully trimmed along the previously applied contour using scissors or a boot knife. </p><p>  Step Two: The SIM-trimmed card should be placed in a specially designed slot for it in the iPhone or iPad.  It may not fit, and then you will have to gently trim it additionally, and again try to place it in the slot. </p><p>  Step Three: After the SIM card is adjusted to the required size and placed in the slot, you should naturally check the device for operability - check the connection.  Suppose everything works.  In this case, everything is in order and you can enjoy using the iPhone or iPad, because MicroSIM (micro SIM) is made correctly.  If after installing the newly manufactured card, the iPhone still did not start working, then something might not have worked with the cropping, or it‚Äôs an ‚Äúold-fashioned‚Äù SIM card. </p><p>  But that is not all, since there is another way.  Now we‚Äôll talk about how to trim a SIM card for the iPhone 4 even more simply.  It turns out that a special tool similar to a stapler was developed for this purpose.  You don‚Äôt have to buy it specially, because they should be in service centers.  There, for a nominal fee or for free, they quickly cut off a SIM card, insert it into an iPhone, and even make the appropriate settings. </p>
