The Baths of Emperor Caracalla: photo, history, reconstruction, how to get there?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The dilapidated old building, located in the capital of Italy, was once called the <span>eighth wonder of the world.</span>  The man-made historical monument now testifies to the greatness of the ancient empire, turning into the stage of the world famous Roman opera. </p><h2>  The Baths of Caracalla: History </h2><p>  Before you start talking about one of the main attractions of the Eternal City, you need to explain <span>what the terms are.</span>  The inhabitants of ancient Rome living before our era experienced tremendous problems associated with water.  Therefore, officials often faced the question of building aqueducts that would deliver life-giving moisture to the city.  Each new fountain or water supply system became a real event of that time. </p><p>  Gradually, the first baths began to appear, access to which was exclusively with the rich and noble Romans.  We can say that bathing in terms played an important role in public life, it became a kind of informal communication for those in power.  Famous citizens did not just wash themselves, but discussed issues of concern to all.  The baths did not only offer body washing services, they also included a whole cultural complex: sports halls, libraries, rooms for theatrical performances.  So the bathing process turned into a special aesthetic pleasure. </p><h2>  Complex for bathing and entertainment </h2><p>  Naturally, there wasn‚Äôt enough baths at all, and in the 3rd century AD, the emperor Caracalla was puzzled by this question.  The baths built on the territory of Rome at his command were a huge bath complex, which was second to none.  The colossal construction, accommodating 1,500 people, was under construction for 11 long years.  The monumental attraction erected in the prestigious <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRome</span> included several bathing and relaxation rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The record of the chronicler Spartian is known that he left behind an unusual complex the size of a city Emperor Caracalla.  The terms really surprised the whole world with their size and rich decoration.  High walls were built of pebbles and sand, cement was poured between the stones, and the facade was decorated with marble slabs - this created the effect of visual fragility of a beautiful structure with an amazing amazing fortress of the complex as a whole. </p><h2>  Building architecture </h2><p>  Occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11 hectares, the baths of the Emperor Caracalla were a gigantic building with an amazingly beautiful frame.  From all sides it was surrounded by a picturesque park with huge columns.  A large number of rooms inside the complex were built symmetrically, and all the corridors were designed in a special, curved manner to prevent the release of heat. </p>

    <p>  On the one hand there was an amphitheater, in which various competitions took place, on the other, there were libraries built specifically for bored Romans.  So ordered the emperor Caracalla.  The baths included 64 rooms with huge cisterns, into which clean water from mountain springs was supplied through the aqueduct.  And after bathing, the Romans went out of the territory of the baths and in the park zone rested in cool gazebos in the fresh air. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Therm complex structure </h2><p>  A wonderful <span>cypress avenue</span> led to the entrance to the bath complex.  The main building, which served as a bathing place, was divided into several rooms. </p><p>  The main hall, illuminated by golden soft light due to transparent beige plates inserted into the windows, was astonished by the incredible height of the vault, in which marble walls seemed to dissolve.  And through the hole in the dome of the building, daylight entered inside.  The luxury of the decoration was simply amazing: the hall was decorated with numerous sculptures, and the floor was paved with multi-colored mosaics depicting scenes on mythological themes. </p>

    <p>  The hot bath (caldaria) was a rotunda with relaxation rooms after water procedures.

    <p>  A cold bath (frigidarium) allowed the heated Romans to cool off in a huge pool. </p><h2>  Hygiene Prohibition </h2><p>  Well-built buildings of the term were considered a unique structure, but after the fall of the great Roman Empire, the baths erected during the reign of the emperor named Caracalla fell into decay.  Researchers believe that the main role in forgetting hygiene procedures was played by Christianity with sermons on the insignificance of the body and the greatness of the soul.  It was believed that moisture washes away the holy water into which a person was dipped at baptism, and church officials recognized sin as bathing in the bathhouse, which impeded spiritual development, and all buildings of the term were considered pagan. </p><p>  The preachers who pacified their flesh did not wash themselves, in all the monasteries the bathrooms became a sign of special effeminacy, which has no place in a spiritual institution.  Mud was revered as one of the Christian virtues, and now shocking stories of modern man are even known about lice found, unequivocally recognized as a sign of holiness.  The result was various epidemics that raged in the Middle Ages in Europe and killed millions of people. </p><h2>  World famous landmark </h2><p>  In the XVI century, on the site of the ruins of the once majestic bath complexes, archaeological excavations began to be carried out in order to decorate the Pope's palace with building material left over from the term.  And when amazing objects of art were discovered, this place was given the <span>status of a local</span> cultural monument. </p>

    <p>  Only at the end of the 19th century the thermae of Caracalla, the photos of the ruins of which are made by tourists admiring the former greatness of Rome, become a recognized Italian landmark.  Huge ruins are open daily for visits, and nowadays they generally become the stage of the opera house.  The former warm bath has been converted into a huge hall, designed for almost 20 thousand spectators.  The opera season, which began in 1937, continues now, and the most famous event was the performance in Roman baths of three world-recognized tenors - Domingo, Carreras and Pavarotti. </p><h2>  Reconstruction of a Russian artist </h2><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, Sergey Ivanov was sent to Rome from Russia in order to restore the architectural appearance of the monumental structure.  Even the outbreak of revolution did not frighten the industrious young man, and he continued his work, regardless of the circumstances.  Soon in Italian published an essay by Ivanov, who studied in detail the terms of Caracalla.  The reconstruction, which was presented by the Russian artist, consisted of 43 drawings showing the central part of the building, as well as the premises in the context. </p><p>  He not only meticulously reproduced all the decorations of the grandiose complex, but also indicated rooms with warm and cold water, locker rooms, gyms and other parts of the main building.  The work of the Russian scientist is invaluable to all researchers of ancient ruins, it testifies to the luxury of a giant imperial building. </p><h2>  Terme Caracalla: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the opera house, which is now located on the site of the bath complex, by metro or shuttle bus.  The address of the term, located in the center of the capital of Italy, is: Via delle Terme di Caracalla, 52. The entrance to the ruins is a few euros, but visiting the opera will have to fork out, because the cost will depend on the status of the performer.  But the scale of the extraordinary beauty of the spectacle taking place under the open sky at night is really worth it. </p>
