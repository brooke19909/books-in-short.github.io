Perception, communication and interaction are the parts that make up the psychology of communication. </p><p>  The exchange of information occurs through a communicative function.  Interaction involves a set of specific actions or actions of interest to everyone who takes part in communication.  Perception is one of the key parts that make up the psychology of communication.  After all, it is precisely on how the interlocutor perceives his opponent that the quality and, consequently, the result of communication depends. </p>

    <p>  The concept of social psychology of communication </p><p>  One of the important tasks that the social psychology of communication is called upon to study is the psychological aspects of communication.  This discipline arose at the intersection of psychology and sociology. </p><p>  After all, any phenomenon that occurs in society has psychological aspects, since it is associated with the <span>activities of people.</span>  Human life in society is impossible without communication.  And it is governed by the rules of relationships between people.  Therefore, the <span>social psychology of</span> communication considers communicative communication as a social phenomenon. </p>

    <p>  What determines the model of human behavior </p><p>  Of great importance during communication is the model of behavior that a person adheres to during communication.  At each stage of his life, he has to play a certain role, which depends on what position he occupies - the leader or subordinate, - his marital status - husband or wife, - age.  In everyday life, everyone has to play several different roles, depending on where he is - at work or at home, at a party or on vacation.  Communicating, a person manifests himself in different ways. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often the behavior model depends on the goals of communication and the impression that people in contact want to make on each other. </p><p>  How a society will evaluate a person‚Äôs image often depends not on his moral qualities, but on those norms of behavior that are established in a given society, the level of culture of the people who make up the majority.  Therefore, public opinion has a significant impact on the behavior model. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the psychology of communication includes four main models of behavior: individual, formal, interpersonal and intragroup. </p><p>  The formal role provides for the system of behavior that society expects of a person in connection with his status. </p><p>  Intra-group models of behavior are built on the basis of relationships that have developed within a particular social group.  Such groups are divided into large and small. </p><p>  Interpersonal behavior depends on the expectations and perceptions of opponents about each other.  Close to the truth are the individual roles of behavior.  They are based on the inner sensations of a person, his personal values, internal assets, goals. </p>

    <p>  Group Behaviors </p><p>  Within groups, the psychology of communication provides for the following behavioral models: a savior - a victim, a leader - a follower, a mediator, a friendly person, a brawler, a persecutor, a hermit, and many others. </p><p>  In large groups, the determining role in the formation of a model of behavior is the status that a person occupies in society.  Therefore, they are usually formal.  In <span>small groups, the</span> behavioral role depends on the relationships established between their members. </p>

    <p>  Psychological nuances when dealing with children </p><p>  It should be noted that the psychology of communicating with children has its own characteristics.  With the growth of the child, his attitude to everything that surrounds him, as well as to communication as an integral part of life, changes.  This happens because by the age of three the little man has developed his own character, idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis "I", a personality is being formed. </p><p>  The child tries to communicate with others long before he learns speech.  First, using gestures, behavior, attempts to say something.  Even such communication cannot be ignored.  The kid needs to answer, talk with him, show different objects.  This will help in the future to educate a person who will not suffer from complexes and deficiencies. </p><p>  Often the statements of children are veiled, they require decryption.  Therefore, communication with them is akin to art, which is built on special laws and has its own hidden subtexts.  You must be able to listen to the child and try to understand him, and if there is a need, then support.  If a child talks about an event, from the side of adults the right thing is not the reaction to what happened, but the response to children's feelings associated with it. </p><p>  Also, the psychology of communicating with children involves the ability of parents to think positively.  Then the life of the younger generation will be filled with colorful paints and happiness.  After all, inheriting parents, children themselves will create it this way. </p>
