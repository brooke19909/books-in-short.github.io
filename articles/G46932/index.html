This is a box or even a small panel that allows you to show movable pictures.  It is hard to imagine that just a little over a century ago there was no such technology in principle.  Only thanks to the huge amount of research we have the opportunity to enjoy television. </p><p>  About people who gave us the opportunity to transmit images at a distance, and will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  At the source </h2><p>  Who invented television and in what year?  Many people asked this question, but not everyone could give an exact answer to it. </p><p>  The question of where television was invented is still open.  Answers cannot be unambiguous.  This is because more than one person invented the first television.  This is the <span>painstaking work of</span> many people. </p><p>  Where was television invented?  Many countries of the world are fighting for this right, in each of which a whole army of scientists has been working on this issue.  But first things first. </p><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  The very first who invented television can be considered a Swedish chemist, whose name was Jens Berzelius.  The scientist set up many experiments in his laboratory, as a result of which he discovered a previously unknown chemical element, which was called "selenium". </p>

    <p>  The importance of this event cannot be overestimated.  It was noted that this element conducts an electric current depending on the amount of light acting on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Without it, image transmission would not have been possible. </p><h2>  From theory to practice </h2><p>  Boris L. Rosing, who invented television, will be argued by historians.  And they will not be far from the truth. </p><p>  The biography of this physicist and inventor, who actually gave us the opportunity to spend evenings at the blue screen, is worth exploring more deeply. </p><p>  Boris Lvovich Rosing was born in the year eighteen sixty-ninth in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  He devoted almost his entire life to work at the institute.  This is St. Petersburg Technological, Arkhangelsk Forestry, and many others, where he was invited as an honorary lecturer.  The scientist defended his thesis. </p><p>  His works were devoted to the studies of magnetism, radio engineering, electricity, the molecular field, ferromagnets, quantum physics, and dynamics. </p><p>  The idea to transmit the image to a distance came to Boris Lvovich in the year 1898.  He could not imagine his experiments without the cathode ray tube, which had just been invented, as well as studies of the <span>photoelectric effect of physicist</span> Alexander G. Stoletov. </p><p>  His success in studying the subject was great.  Already in the nineteen-seventh year, the world was introduced the technology of creating images using a cathode ray tube with a fluorescent screen and rotating mirrors.  The inventions of the physicist were patented and recognized in the <span>United States of America,</span> Great Britain, and Germany.  The experience was a display of gray stripes on a black screen.  It seems so simple.  But for that time it was a grand breakthrough.  They talked about a talented scientist all over the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In just four years, the physicist managed to transmit the image at a distance.  Most likely, none of the readers had any doubts as to who invented television. </p><p>  In the same nineteen eleventh year, Rosing made the transition from mechanical to electronic systems. </p><p>  Until his death in nineteen thirty-third, the physicist did not stop creating and improving his instruments, developed new modulation methods, tube designs, and circuits. </p><h2>  The first experiments with a picture </h2><p>  Who invented television first is the famous American inventor, Mr. Kerry, many researchers believe.  The results of his experiments were the first working system with which he was able to transmit an obscure, but still image. </p><p>  About the one who invented television, the descendants of the inventor Paul Nipkou may argue.  His experiments were much more advanced, although the principle of operation of the device was identical to the equipment of Mr. Kerry.  Paul gave his invention the name "expanded image."  In the yard stood a thousand eight hundred eighty-fourth year. </p><h2>  New term </h2><p>  The term "television" is ascribed to the Russian engineer Konstantin Dmitrievich Persky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before that, scientists used complex expressions such as "far vision" or "electric telescope." </p><p>  It is believed that he was the first to introduce it in everyday life in August 1900.  This was done as part of the International Electrotechnical Congress in Paris.  The participants really liked the word, and they quickly spread it in their circle of friends upon returning home. </p><p>  The report on vision from a distance was conducted in French. </p><p>  A year earlier, Konstantin Persky received a patent for one of the methods of image transmission.  Inspired by his success, the engineer enthusiastically told his European colleagues about the tremendous opportunities that his technology could give humanity. </p><p>  A lot is known about the scientist himself.  Konstantin Dmitrievich came from a noble family, his ancestors served the greatest prince Dmitry Donskoy. </p><p>  Before devoting his life to inventions, Persky managed to graduate from the Mikhailovsky Artillery Academy, after which he applied his knowledge during the Russo-Turkish War, where he was even awarded the Order for Courage. </p><p>  After returning from the battlefield, Konstantin Dmitrievich chose to combine a military track with science and at the same time become an active member of the St. Petersburg technical and electrical communities. </p><p>  The most striking achievement in his work was an extensive report entitled "The current state of the issue of electro-vision at a distance", which he successfully presented in various educational institutions within the country and abroad. </p><p>  Although the study of physics did not prevent the scientist from improving in the military field.  In particular, he received the Chicago World Exhibition Medal for the warning device from attempts to secretly enter the premises. </p><p>  There was no inventor in 1906. </p>

    <h2>  Upbeat results </h2><p>  When asked about when John Logie Byrd invented television, there will be fans of his talent who will confidently say that this is one thousand nine hundred and twenty-third.  It was then that the scientist was able to transfer the image via the laid cable to his colleague, Charles Jenkins, in the United States of America. </p><p>  But television is not only the transmission of electrical impulses by wire.  In order to launch them, first of all, you need a television camera. </p><p>  Connoisseurs will say with confidence: the Russian scientist, whose name was Vladimir Zvorykin, invented television in 1931 at the facilities of his enterprise Radiocorporations of America.  But this is a moot point, because almost at the same time, another inventor, Phil Farnsworth, is constructing a similar device. </p><p>  The name of the sponsor of a Russian scientist who believed in his very futuristic and incredible idea - David Abramovich Sarnov, an American communications specialist and businessman, has been preserved in history.  It was thanks to his financial support that the world saw most of the inventions of Vladimir Zvorykin. </p>

    <h2>  Color tv </h2><p>  Many people believe that color television was invented by Soviet engineer Hovhannes Adamyan. </p><p>  In the distant nineteen eight year, the inventor received a patent for the signal transmission device he created.  The invention could convey at that time only two colors. </p><p>  But still it would be more correct to consider John Logie Brad to be the one who invented television in color.  It was this man who connected the green, blue and red filters in such a way that they could broadcast various combinations. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting facts about television </h2><p>  Black and white television speakers used green lipstick.  The red color on the screen looked very light and faded.  After much experimentation and testing, we came to the conclusion that it is green that is most harmonious for color reproduction. </p><p>  As for where and which particular transmission in color came out on the screens first, there is debate.  Most often, the opinion is that it was an English league football match. </p><p>  Full-fledged continuous broadcasting began in the nineteen forties in the United States. </p>
