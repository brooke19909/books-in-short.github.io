    <h2>  Man-made and natural dungeons </h2><p>  Before starting the conversation, we clarify the meaning of the word "catacombs".  In Russian, it is derived from the Italian catacomba, as well as the Latin catacumba, which in both cases means "underground tomb."  And it‚Äôs no coincidence, because the catacombs are nothing more than extensive dungeons, sometimes of natural origin or, which happens very often, of artificial origin. </p><p>  They can be abandoned quarries with long complicated paths, or natural caves connected by a complex system of corridors and galleries.  It was them who were chosen for the burial of their deceased tribesmen by the inhabitants of the era called the Middle <span>Bronze Age,</span> covering the period XXV-XX century BC.  e. </p><p>  It should be noted right away that in archeology, in addition to the concept of "catacomb culture," there is the term <span>"pit culture",</span> also associated with the nature of ancient burials.  It is easy to guess that the peoples whose culture falls under this definition did not use underground labyrinths as pits, but pits where they placed the deceased, and a grave hill was erected on top - a mound that reliably protected the grave from plunder. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Proceedings of the Russian archaeologist </h2><p>  In archeology, the concept of "catacomb cultural and historical community" is also known.  It is based on the similarity of cultures of nationalities that inhabited the steppe and forest-steppe zone in that long historical period, extending from the lower reaches of the Don to the North Caucasus and the Urals.  For the first time this term was put into circulation by the Russian scientist V. A. Gorodtsov, who studied the ancient burial places in the early years of the 20th century. </p>

    <p>  Excavating mounds in the region of the North Donets, the scientist discovered burial sites made in the catacombs.  These very specific funerary structures consisted of a vertical shaft leading to a horizontal corridor and tombs.  It was the design features of this method of burial that made it possible to call the culture allocated by him a catacomb. </p><h2>  The many faces of the catacomb culture </h2><p>  Later studies showed that this community is very heterogeneous in structure and consists of separate <span>archaeological cultures,</span> which are local, that is, local variants.  For example, the catacomb culture in the Kuban, determined by local natural and climatic features, is significantly different from what can be found in the Caucasus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that historians do not have a common opinion about the origin of the catacomb culture.  A number of researchers believe that the Caucasus is its homeland; in the opinion of others, it appeared along with the tribes that came from Cyprus at the beginning of the Bronze Age.  However, there are no serious arguments in favor of any of these theories.  The hypothesis of its kinship with the ancient pit culture hardly stands up to criticism. </p><h2>  Catacomb Culture Characterization </h2><p>  As studies show, the settlements of peoples belonging to the catacomb community were located mainly on high river capes, fortified by cliffs.  The river banks were convenient pastures, which made it possible to engage in cattle breeding, which was the basis of their economy.  Another important component of the well-being of the ancient inhabitants was fishing.  This is evidenced by excavations, as a result of which in the places of ancient settlements many bones were found, both fish and belonged to domestic animals - cows, sheep and horses. </p>

    <p>  The catacomb culture of the Bronze Age is characterized by a fairly high level of manufacturing tools and weapons.  According to the results of the analysis of products found at the excavation site, they were made of bronze smelted in the Caucasus.  These were axes, daggers and sheet knives.  However, along with them, stone tools, such as maces, axes and arrowheads, were found in a rather large number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Despite the fact that the catacomb culture was based on cattle breeding and fishing, agriculture also played a certain, albeit secondary role in the livelihoods of the villagers.  This is evidenced by a rather small amount of rather primitive agricultural tools ‚Äî horn hoes, sickles, grain graters, and sickle-flint knives.  Millet grains were also found repeatedly in burials. </p><h2>  Travels to the Rhine and to Italy </h2><p>  Among other finds, special attention is drawn to axes made of bronze, and having a drilled hole for mounting them on wooden handles.  In those days, this could already be attributed to high technology.  Something similar could be seen then among the peoples of Central and Northern Europe. </p><p>  A number of researchers believe that the steppe inhabitants could bring them, making long journeys, reaching Italy and the banks of the Rhine.  By the way, they had transportation means - in one of the catacomb burials of the Rostov region during excavations a four-wheeled wagon was found, and next to it were horse bones, which, in general, were found in many. </p><h2>  The social stratification of ancient society </h2><p>  Catacomb culture is also characterized by clear inequalities of the inhabitants of that era.  This is evidenced by the difference that is observed in the number of all kinds of things put together with the deceased in the burial chamber, and intended for his stay in the underworld.  Along with very rich burials, apparently belonging to leaders or elders, there are graves practically devoid of any funerary equipment. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the significant level of social stratification of peoples belonging to the catacomb community is evidenced by the impressive size of burial structures and barrow mounds above the graves of people holding a high social position.  In them, as a rule, the largest number of objects accompanying the burial was found.  Often up to several dozen horse skeletons were found in such graves.  Obviously, the horses were intended for the solemn entry of the deceased into the afterlife.  All this speaks of the complex structure of society and the high level of its social organization. </p><h2>  Graves of tribal leaders </h2><p>  The characterization of the catacomb culture will be incomplete if we do not dwell in more detail on how high the position in society was occupied by leaders.  As a rule, their power extended to several tribes and clans.  How great was their social status can be judged by the height of the mounds poured over the graves, as well as the huge size of the graves themselves and the abundance of things that accompany them. </p><p>  Entrance mines, as a rule, were laid to a considerable depth, and in them one could often find skeletons of servants, forcibly mortified and obliged to serve the master in the other world.  Burials are known in which the walls of the burial chambers were richly decorated with carpets and mats, and next to the remains of the deceased leader lay attributes of his power - ceremonial wands and precious weapons. </p>

    <h2>  Social groups closest to the leaders </h2><p>  The warriors occupied the next step of the social ladder.  Their burials, although less magnificent, are also replete with all kinds of things that they need in the land of the dead.  These are various weapons - bronze and <span>stone axes,</span> knives and flint arrowheads. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but in those ancient times, which were more than four thousand years away from us, privileged people included artisans who made chariots.  When such a master died, he was also buried with all sorts of honors - he was appreciated in those centuries by a working man. </p><h2>  Graves of worshipers </h2><p>  A special place among the graves is occupied by the graves of priests, who constituted a numerous, but extremely closed caste.  The fact that the remains belong to a member of this particular social group is eloquently evidenced by the shape of his skull.  The fact is that future priests were prepared to fulfill their high mission from the first days of life.  Even in infancy, they tightened their heads with tight bandages, which led to improper development of the cranial bones.  As a result, over time, the heads of the priests took the form of a melon, which was considered a sign of elitism. </p>

    <p>  In their graves mainly religious objects are found - braziers with coals for sacrifices, as well as various incense burners made in the form of bowls on legs and covered with rich ornaments.  Catacomb cultures of the Northern Black Sea coast abounded primarily with such burials. </p><h2>  The similarity and difference of funeral rites </h2><p>  Today, there are many monuments that the catacomb culture left behind.  Most of them were discovered in the territory stretching from the Lower Danube to the Volga.  All of them are characterized by a common method of burial, in which the deceased was placed in a chamber located offshore from the entrance shaft.  But in this case the similarity in most cases ended, since each nationality living in a particular region had its own funeral rites and rituals. </p><p>  In a number of cases, trepanized skulls filled with a mixture of clay with ocher, as well as bones of the deceased wrapped in plant stems, were found in the graves.  In other graves, the empty sockets of the skulls were filled with tinted clay.  We also had to find paired graves where skeletons of a man and a woman were placed on one bed, as if they wanted to remain inseparable even after death. </p><h2>  Details of the funeral ritual </h2><p>  Since the catacomb culture is, first of all, the similarity of different nationalities in the method of burial of the dead, then, concluding the article, we dwell on this in more detail.  The essence of this ritual was as follows: the relatives of the deceased, before filling the mound, dug a rectangular deep mine in the ground, to facilitate the descent into which, ledges or steps were made along the edges.  Then a horizontal passage was dug at the bottom of the mine, at the end of which a funeral chamber-catacomb was arranged. </p>

    <p>  The deceased was placed in it on a special bed, giving him a crooked pose, resembling the position of the fetus in the womb.  If the family of the deceased had a financial opportunity to supply him with things necessary for staying in the country of the dead, then they were also brought into the burial chamber.  Following this, the entrance to it was closed with a stone slab or logs.  After which the deceased became the property of eternity. </p>
