It is 5 km wide, with a length of 8 km.  Aslykul is a lake, which is one of the largest lakes in Europe, and it is really beautiful!  At night, the tender expanse of water reflects the dark sky, strewn with stars, the waves at sunrise and sunset are painted with a scarlet tent, and in the daytime the aroma of steppe grass spreads over the surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aslykul lake" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521302.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <p>  Most tourists have the feeling that they were on the sea, not on the lake, where the amazing beauty of the surrounding landscapes leaves an indelible impression on people.  This impression especially appears in windy weather - at this time huge waves of the reservoir beat against the shore, due to which the sound of the surf is clearly audible.  And since Lake Aslykul on the map of Bashkiria is the largest, this feeling only intensifies. </p><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Aslykul is translated from Bashkir as ‚Äúbitter‚Äù or ‚Äúevil‚Äù lake.  Its water actually has a bitter taste.  If you believe the legend, not the chemists who talk about mineral salts, then in the lake it became so because of the anger of the Black Horseman, who owned the reservoir in time immemorial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He earned his living by raising crowds - magic horses.  But Olo-Telyak, the batyr, stole such a horse from him.  He did not plan to commit crimes, he simply did not have time to ask the Black Rider for permission.  Olo-Telyak in the crowd was able to free his country from enemies, marry the written beauty Aikhil.  Only in the evenings he was tormented by conscience, since he could not return the horse.  Batyr came to the Black Horseman to repent.  He had mercy, saying that Olo-Telyaka forgives, because he stole a horse not for profit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aslykul rest" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Batyr was delighted and returned to his homeland, but the Black Horseman harbored anger at him and sent sickness and famine to the country.  Aikhylu also fell ill.  After that, the children of Olo-Telyak went to the Black Horseman to ask the crowds for rent, but he did not give the horses, and locked his sons in the waters of the lake.  After this, Olo-Telyak went to the Black Horseman himself.  The wizard admitted that the batyr hates, as well as his entire family, because the young man dared to steal a horse, thereby making the powerful wizard feel humiliated. </p><p>  Batyr was so struck by the wizard's anger that he turned into stone.  But evil did not triumph on earth.  Warriors came, cured his wife, freed children from the lake, revived Olo-Telyak, and also defeated the great wizard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern history </h2><p>  Aslykul (lake), as well as the territory adjacent to it, have had the status of a National Park since 1993, and were also under federal jurisdiction.  However, the campaign further began to bring regional and federal legislation in order.  Then it only became clear that Aslykul is a lake that cannot be a National Park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aslykul Lake Map" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521309.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since 2004, it was referred to its territory as a cluster site, and then it was decided to turn it into an independent entity with the status of a natural park.  Its lake Aslykul, the photo of which is presented in this article, was received in 2011, in other words, the object was finally transferred to the Ministry of Nature Management and Ecology of Bashkortostan. </p><p>  While the preparatory work was going on, many vacationers began to complain about the lack of comfortable conditions for rest and paid entry.  Charges after prosecutorial checks were recognized illegal, after which they stopped.  But the moment was not taken into account that tons of garbage were taken out of here with these funds.  Now the cleanliness of the territory is monitored by the park administration.  It is not yet known what innovations await holidaymakers, since the innovation began to work only at the end of this season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The story of the appearance of this reservoir is fascinating.  In this place there was previously a <span>karst failure.</span>  For many hundreds of years it was filled with rainfall and groundwater, and now anyone can enjoy a vacation here.  Since Aslykul is a lake that belongs to closed Russian water bodies, mineral substances useful for humans are collected in it, and the water at the same time has, as already mentioned above, a salty aftertaste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aslykul Lake photo" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The vegetation of this zone is diverse and rich.  There are many rare plants that are listed in the Red Book.  An amazing picture of nature arises before our eyes: 7 peaks of the Ulutau, Tabulak, Nuratau mountains and others rise on the horizon, while right in front of them you can see a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsteppes blooming in summer and spring, and mixed forests. </p><p>  The world of animals, birds and insects is also famous for the variety of species living here.  There are also red-throated goose, common apollo, peregrine falcon, <span>black-throated loon</span> and <span>steppe horn.</span>  Graceful swans, serious pelicans and noisy geese made Lake Aslykul (a map of it presented in this article) a habitat, while birds chirped in the forests. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The northwestern coast of Lake Aslykul is very picturesque and unusual, where Mount Nuratau breaks abruptly into the mirror surface of the water with its dark cliffs.  Near the village of Yangi-Turmush, there is an Alga spring with calcium sulfate, mineral water.  The spring is considered a natural monument.  And just 4 km from the lake from a height of 20 m falls the Sharlama waterfall. </p><h2>  Lake Aslykul: rest </h2><p>  He is positioned here as exclusively family.  Here you can stay at the camp sites (there are a lot of them, of different price categories, and it‚Äôs better to reserve a place in the season 2 weeks before check-in), there are also places for ‚Äúsavages‚Äù.  But there are less and less places for tents, in addition, they will have to get to their cars, since they don‚Äôt take hitchhikers here, all the cars are loaded by themselves to the eyeballs ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on aslykul lake" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth considering when coming to Aslykul (lake) - the weather here in the summer is just perfect for both relaxation and outdoor activities.  Winds on a hot afternoon bring coolness, and also guarantee pleasure to windsurfers, para - and hang gliders. </p><p>  The lake Aslykul is densely surrounded by low picturesque mountains.  Rest here makes it possible to book an excursion to them or to climb independently.  So, in a couple of hours you will have time to collect healing water from the Gulbekey spring, to hear legends from the epic of Bashkortostan and from the top of Ulutau to appreciate amazing views of the Bugulminsko-Belebeyevskaya Upland. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities on Lake Aslykul </h2><p>  All large camp sites have their own beaches with fine, clean sand, brand new sun loungers, changing rooms, umbrellas and other amenities.  You can spend the whole vacation stretched out on the shore of the lake, but there are opportunities for active pastime.  For example, take a ride on a rowing, motor or <span>sailing boat,</span> as well as go diving: at large bases there are rental centers for the necessary equipment, while experienced instructors will help beginners to join this popular entertainment.  It is worth noting that the lake for diving is ideal, because its visibility is excellent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aslykul lake on the map of Bashkiria" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The main share of camp sites is located near the village of Kupoyarovo, from here lovers of hiking have the opportunity to reach Fr.  Mossy.  This small lake is overgrown with legends and secrets, which locals retell with pleasure.  They will tell you where the ancient apple orchard and the Sharlama waterfall are located. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  We recommend booking a tour to Aslykul with the transfer included.  Davlekanovo, the nearest settlement, is located thirty kilometers away, while public transport does not go to the lake from here.  Car owners get to this village, then they follow the signs.  There is no main road, each vacationer chooses his own route. </p><p>  The village of Kupoyarovo is a very popular place.  This place has parking and camp sites.  Another way is through Burangulovo, especially since there is a Sharlama waterfall four kilometers from here.  If you do not want to ruin a car on the road, you can drive to Aleksandrovka, then take the dirt road to Alga, a village located near the lake.  Nearby, near Yangi Tormosh, there is a mineral sulfate-calcium source Alga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aslykul lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the tourists are horseless or master the hitchhiking, or in Davlekanovo they hire a taxi or "GAZelle".  It is interesting that local drivers adapted themselves to leave vacationers in a clean field, far from the lake, so it is better to immediately clearly state the desire: to unload near the camp site or parking lot. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  There are no hotels in the traditional sense on Lake Aslykul, rest on it involves a stop at a camp site or in a tent.  But there are a lot of those very bases: the cost of accommodation is 300-1500 rubles per day per person.  It is advisable to book rooms 2 weeks before entry.  And be sure to ask about food: unfortunately, not all bases have their own cafes, therefore, you may have to buy products on the spot or take them with you. </p><h2>  Tourists note </h2><p>  There is no firewood in Aslykul, since all the dry trees have already been fired at the stake by tourists who have come here earlier.  In addition, the status of a natural monument does not allow felling of trees in this place.  Firewood can be bought from local residents, at kiosks (about 150 rubles. Knitting) or bring with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aslykul rest" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23318/521315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local features </h2><p>  It is impossible not to say that rest on Lake Aslykul also involves fishing, and here it is a different story.  In this place in the 1990s, large pikes, breams, burbots were caught.  After stocking, zander also appeared.  Either this predator violated the ecosystem, or pollution from permanent vacationers affected the ecology, but today fishermen with fishing rods are mostly unlucky.  So, if the purpose of your trip is fishing, then in the summer it is better to hire a boat and go to the middle of the lake.  It is also worth considering that you need to go on a fish hunt on weekdays, when there are not so many tourists here.  In Aslykul, in winter they enjoy fun ice fishing. </p>
