However, this statement is false, since satellite phones and DECT devices are still relevant in the world market.  Unlike mobile communications, a <span>satellite phone</span> can work anywhere, there would be a visible connection with space.  And cordless phones are popular among home and office users, because wired telephony is still considered the cheapest. </p>

    <p>  The focus of this article is one of the best representatives of the market, working according to the DECT standard - Panasonic.  Cordless phones under this brand are known throughout the world.  The reader is invited to get to know the legendary brand better and learn a lot of interesting things about the products of the Japanese manufacturer: specifications, reviews, descriptions, and an overview of the best models. </p><h2>  To the pinnacle of fame </h2><p>  At the dawn of the 21st century, radiotelephone manufacturers around the world have a real problem with the use of radio frequencies of national importance.  The fact is that there was no single standard for the used <span>frequency range</span> among different manufacturers.  Panasonic (radio telephones) were the first to enter the market with the DECT standard (1880-1900 MHz).  This range is allowed for use without a license in hundreds of countries around the world, including Russia.  Now all other manufacturers are guided by this standard, and the Japanese brand is considered the best-selling in the world, only thanks to research on the search for allowed frequencies in all countries of the world, literally a decade ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About modifications </h2><p>  The Panasonic radiotelephone, regardless of the modification, has a single basic configuration.  We are talking about the configuration, power system, settings and functionality.  All tubes have almost identical sizes and differ only in design and color.  As for the batteries, here the manufacturer did not begin to breed a zoo - two AAA-size finger-type batteries and a capacity of at least 900 mAh are suitable for all cordless phones. </p>

    <p>  Color display or monochrome - there is no difference, because they have an identical menu.  The difference is only in functionality.  A fairly convenient solution for both office and home use.  As for the base, here you can already observe the differences, because each product has different functionality. </p><h2>  Japanese customer approach </h2><p>  The Panasonic KX cordless telephone manual is detailed and will help to reveal to the user all the functionality of the Japanese product.  Yes, the manual is large and requires a lot of free time and perseverance from the owner, but many buyers insist in their reviews that it is extremely necessary to familiarize themselves with the instructions.  Each menu item and its settings are described in the instructions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting manner of describing the functional.  The reader at each point is invited to produce the action algorithm proposed by the manufacturer and compare the result with the image that is present in the instructions.  As for localization, there is no reason to worry, because the manufacturer, exporting its products all over the world, knows for sure which country the phones are for, and, accordingly, it is equipped with the necessary guidance. </p>

    <h2>  Remove all competitors from the market </h2><p>  Of particular note is the design and color of the <span>base station</span> and handset.  It‚Äôs easier to list which palette is missing than to count the colors and shades that stand out on the Panasonic KX wireless telephone.  It is worth paying tribute to the sellers who dared to present all the modifications of the Japanese concern on the shop window.  As for the quality of the paint, it is impeccable.  Many users generally get the impression that the case was originally molded from plastic of the desired color.  Only when disassembling the phone does the real color of the workpiece become clear. </p><p>  Users also have no complaints about the design, judging by their reviews in the media.  Each modification of the Panasonic product has its own shape and differs from other models.  Many sellers claim that they can determine the model of the radiotelephone by touch, which means that all devices are unique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hot sale </h2><p>  The product with the KX-TGB210 marking is the best-selling Panasonic radiotelephone in the world.  A photo of him is always present on the manufacturer's billboards, and in all electronics stores it has the lowest cost.  Its peculiarity is that, being in the budget class, this unit is not much inferior to its more expensive brothers in the world market. </p>

    <p>  In fact, for any price of 1200 rubles, any customer purchases a radiotelephone with a built-in alarm clock, caller ID (Caller ID must be supported by the operator), an address book with 50 numbers and many useful adjustments, which can be found in the instructions.  Even a monochrome display is difficult to attribute to disadvantages, because it is thanks to it that the Panasonic radio telephone is able to work longer <span>offline</span> than its expensive color counterparts. </p><h2>  Actual offer </h2><p>  With real Japanese quality, the buyer begins to get acquainted in the initial segment of the business class.  He is invited in the <span>price range of</span> 2500-3000 rubles to purchase two tubes that can work with one base (model KX-TG2512).  Firstly, the devices support the Intercom function, that is, users can communicate for free within the same basic device (analogue of a PBX).  Accordingly, there is call forwarding between the handsets and the possibility of organizing a three-way conference, which is very convenient when working in the office. </p>

    <p>  A full-featured automatic caller ID, in addition to the Caller ID, is a nice bonus for all users who have looked for such a Panasonic radio telephone.  The instruction, which is included with the product, describes in detail all the functionality and offers the user several algorithms for setting up the base and handsets. </p><h2>  When you want more </h2><p>  In the price range of 4000 rubles, customers are invited to choose between the versatility of a monochrome device and the convenience of working with a color display.  A rather strange step to the buyer was made by Panasonic.  Cordless telephones vary greatly in functionality and, as many users note in their reviews, it is better to give preference to the monochrome representative of this segment.  A detailed study of the two devices gives the impression that the manufacturer changed the design of the cheapest tube, provided it with a color display and, having tripled the cost, introduced the finished product to the world market. </p>

    <p>  The telephone directory of the monochrome device KX-TGJ320 expanded to 250 entries, there is a call log.  Of the conveniences, the handset of the Panasonic radio telephone will please you with the Do Not Disturb mode, the availability of backup power when the power source is turned off, and the Radio Nanny functionality. </p><h2>  Image is everything </h2><p>  It's quite interesting to watch the electronics market in the last few years.  Trying to attract customers, many manufacturers begin to create products that are unusual for them, which are very reminiscent of the products of brands promoted on the global market.  In the ranking of the most useless devices from the manufacturer Panasonic, KX-PRX120 cordless phones have become leaders, because many potential buyers are not quite clear why they should give money (about 10,000 rubles).  The fact is that the Japanese concern released a DECT-phone in the Iphone 4 case from the famous Apple company. </p><p>  A color LCD with a resolution of 320x480 dpi, a <span>capacitive touch screen</span> and the Android operating system do not dock with the functionality of an office radiotelephone that works within the range of the signal that the base device broadcasts.  Only the presence of Wi-Fi and a built-in browser allows you to use the device for communication on the Internet and entertainment. </p><h2>  Error handling </h2><p>  But the Panasonic KX-PRX150 RUB cordless telephone in the price category of 10,000 rubles is considered the best model among all DECT devices existing on the world market.  The manufacturer realized all the dreams of users who often have to use both a regular phone and a mobile device.  Yes, the Panasonic product supports 3G / GSM. </p>

    <p>  Let the cordless telephone externally be a copy of the famous Apple Iphone 4, it works with Android OS and has a lot of entertainment content - these are all trifles compared to the realization of the dream of millions of users.  With such a device, you never miss important calls, it independently finds the base station and allows you to use the internal communication, listen to the answering machine and even send messages within the DECT network. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The products of the Japanese manufacturer have been on the global market for several years and have already managed to win the hearts of millions of users.  After all, there are many reasons for which the Panasonic telephone is purchased: instruction, ease of use, design, color and decent functionality.  As practice shows, many buyers generally prefer the brand, realizing that all the necessary functionality is already inherent in this wonderful device by default. </p>
