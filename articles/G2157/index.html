It was opened for mass visits in 2005. Its creation was sponsored by the travel agency Kolmas Karelia.  Ruskeala is very popular today.  This place for a reason has become so famous.  Tens of thousands of tourists visit it every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quarry marble ruskale" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473121.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  The monument is called "Marble breaking Ruskeala XVII - early XX centuries."  At present, the creation of such a complex is a positive and rare occurrence in Russia.  This example demonstrates how, with the help of private funds, it is possible to revive an object of cultural heritage.  The place itself is unique.  It was possible to recreate the rare symbiosis <span>of the mining museum of</span> past centuries and the natural attractions that Karelia is famous for.  Ruskeala is a truly unique ensemble.  You can admire its natural beauty at any time of the year. </p><h2>  Special atmosphere </h2><p>  Three quarries were formed here as a result of marble mining.  They are located next to the left bank of the Tohmajoki River.  Careers are interconnected by adits.  Soon, stone mining ceased.  Careers were abandoned.  In place of the old quarries, picturesque <span>mountain lakes</span> arose <span>.</span>  They are white marble thickets that are filled with clear blue-green water.  Currently, the inactive adits and mines resemble mysterious grottoes and caves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Marble quarry "Ruskeala" is the main attraction of the complex.  This place is a monument of industrial culture of the XVIII-XX centuries.  Ruskeala Park is officially included in the list of cultural heritage of the Russian Federation.  This monument is unique.  There is no second such complex anywhere in Europe.  This is a kind of man-made "bowl" of a solid marble massif.  It is permeated by systems of drifts, adits and mines.  Cladding blocks for many architectural structures of the city of St. Petersburg were mined here.  The majestic St. Isaac's Cathedral is also no exception.  A variety of buildings were decorated with Ruskeal marble.  It has a stunning color: white with greenish flashes.  Some marble metro stations are still adorned with this marble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala quarry" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473122.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Quarry marble "Ruskeala" </h2><p>  Its length is about four hundred and fifty meters.  He is quite deep.  The quarry is currently flooded.  Water rises to the upper underground horizon.  This was done by the Finns before the war began in the 40s.  Under water is the majority of adits that were formed in the first half of the last century.  Only one of them is located above this level.  This adit was formed in the bowels of the mountains in the 30s.  Inside it was built a path along which trolleys with marble moved.  It is connected to mine No. 2. It was along it that workers moved.  The mine goes deep into the mountains at a distance of about two hundred meters.  The embankment of the railroad along which the trolleys moved was still preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scenic views </h2><p>  Externally, the marble quarry "Ruskeala" makes a tremendous impression.  Gray-white colored rocks descend to the <span>turquoise lake.</span>  Its shores are heavily indented.  Rocks go deep into a huge distance.  A regular excursion to "Ruskealu".  The canyon has its own pier.  Here guests can hire and rent a boat.  While traveling, you can look at the canyon from the water on it.  A certain part of the blocks hangs over this space at a negative angle.  Travelers can also enjoy views of the grottoes.  They were formed in sheer cliffs.  The play of light on the marble ceiling attracts tourists for a long time.  The grottoes really look very picturesque.  The calm water surface reflects the white <span>marble walls</span> and arches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marble quarry karelia map" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473123.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  There are also dry adits.  However, tourists are strictly forbidden to visit them.  To do this, you need to be accompanied by a geologist.  The heat outside means that the marble adit is cold.  You can feel the chilliness as you go deeper into the formation.  It is hard to imagine what it was like to be a worker.  Career management provided some data of that time.  During periods of heavy load, mining was carried out year-round.  The drilling process did not stop day or night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Principal differences </h2><p>  There is the main, most famous and most visited quarry of Ruskeala.  Around him were several more abandoned.  Currently, activities are underway to develop them.  Most quarries are different from each other.  This applies not only to coastal species.  This also applies to the color of water.  For example, in one career, it may be gray, and in another - blue.  The main one is slightly different from the rest.  The water in this quarry is bluish-green.  Over time, the walls here darkened and weathered.  This happened during the time when the quarries were not developed.  However, this does not prevent tourists from seeing their true color.  It can be seen on freshly chipped marble pieces.  They are quite common.  The old blocky quarry is special in this regard.  Here you can see the most striking manifestations of the picturesque stone.  It was in this quarry that marble was mined in large blocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala marble quarry how to get" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473124.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Underground research </h2><p>  The speleological commission of St. Petersburg was engaged in the development of a multi-year expeditionary project.  It is called "Underground Karelia."  Speleologists studied in 2010.  The Ruskeala Mountain Park and the Marble Failure have become the main objects of research.  The latter is located very close to the place where the main excursion route runs through the complex. </p><h2>  Complex Features </h2><p>  In winter, the marble quarry Ruskeala looks no less attractive.  At this time of the year the ice fetters the lake.  Therefore, it is very easy to get to the mysterious grottoes and adits.  One of these places is called musical for its unusual acoustic properties.  In winter, the Ruskealsky Failure impresses with its splendor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marble quarry karelia map" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/473299.jpg" width="345"></div>  It becomes like an ice castle, whose columns have the most bizarre shapes.  There is artistic lighting.  It helps the majestic canyon to light up in bright colors with the onset of darkness.  Marble quarry (Karelia) (the map of the area is given in the article) is a favorite place where divers love to conduct their training.  As a rule, they do this in the most remote corners of the quarry, so that they do not interfere with the bulk of visitors.  Several quarries are flooded here.  The adits connecting them also appeared in the water.  Ruskeala Canyon (the map clearly demonstrates this) included only three functioning underground horizons that were used for mining.  Diving enthusiasts will find this place a paradise.  Tempting labyrinths will not leave anyone indifferent.  At the very bottom of the canyon, some technique is still preserved.  For example, motorcycles, cars and even a crane.  All this attracts those involved in techno-diving.  The water here is clear.  Virtually no muti.  Aquatic vegetation is also absent.  In autumn, however, leaves that drop birch trees can fly in. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruskeala recreation center" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/473125.jpg" width="322"></div>  Local staff keep the marble quarry Ruskeala clean.  Workers periodically make outings on the lake and clean it of debris.  Everywhere there are traces of people staying: pieces of paper, plastic bottles and the like.  However, visitors are quite littering little.  The guests must be mesmerized by the majestic beauty of the flooded quarry.  Consciousness does not allow polluting a picturesque mountain lake.  On the territory of the mountain park, not only ancient <span>marble quarries</span> have been preserved <span>.</span>  Other historical sites are also located here.  For example, an old office building.  It is made in the style of classicism.  The construction consists entirely of Ruskeala marble.  On the territory of the complex there are monuments of industrial architecture of the XIX century.  They are kilns that were designed for calcining lime.  Their brick pipes are conical in shape.  The current quarry will also be of interest to tourists.  You can observe the process of mining large marble blocks.  Currently, these facilities are not included in the mountain park.  For this reason, they are poorly adapted for tourist excursions.
