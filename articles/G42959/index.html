Complemented the commemorative collection and a series of coins "Artek" and "Defense of Sevastopol."  The event took place on December 23, 2015.  The circulation of the issue amounted to only 20 million banknotes.  Obviously, the new bill will not be in circulation, but will remain in the album as a souvenir and a reminder of the event of the recent history of Russia.  In the article, we consider the characteristic of an unusual hundred-ruble. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  In 2015, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation received information about the possibility of a new bill dedicated to the Crimea and Sevastopol.  The design of the scoop was not hidden.  Initially, it was known what it was planned to depict on the banknote - the sights of the republic and the <span>city ​​of military glory of</span> Sevastopol. </p>

    <p>  The new 100 rubles ("Crimea") are significantly different from ordinary bills.  The drawing on them is made not horizontally, but vertically.  Outwardly, the banknote is much more beautiful than the usual tickets of the Bank of Russia.  By design, the issue is similar to 2013 banknotes dedicated to the Winter Olympic Games.  The new 100-ruble banknotes of Sochi-2014 were made on high-quality paper with a predominance of blue colors, the drawing on them was arranged vertically.  “Crimean” banknotes became the second original issue of the Central Bank of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About design </h2><p>  The 2015 rubles were made in a standard size - 150 mm long and 65 mm wide.  The color of the notes is olive green.  The front side is dedicated to Sevastopol.  The main image on it is the Monument to the Scuttled Ships - a fragment of the famous painting by I. K. Aivazovsky, “Russian Squadron at the Sevastopol Raid”.  In addition to this picture on the banknote you can see: </p><ul><li>  city ​​plan; </li><li>  architectural and historical monuments in the form of a schematic drawing; </li><li>  fragment of the 1941-1942 Memorial dedicated to the heroic defense of Sevastopol. </li></ul>

    <p>  On the reverse side of <span>100 rubles of</span> Russia in 2015 there are thematic images “Crimea”.  The main drawing is The Swallow's Nest.  In the background is a view of Mount Ayu-Dag and the rock of Parus, a schematic representation of the mosque of the Khan's Palace, the RT-70 radio telescope, and a vine. </p><p>  At the bottom of the bill, you can find a QR code that encodes a link to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation website.  As a <span>watermark</span> on the banknote is a portrait of Catherine II in profile. </p><h2>  Historical background of drawings </h2><p>  On the banknote of 100 rubles "Crimea" you can see architectural monuments, inventions that are associated with the republic and the city of Sevastopol.  Not everyone is strong in history to understand the meaning of banknote design.  Consider the characteristic of each object of the new hundred-ruble note: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Empress <span>Catherine II,</span> whose <span>portrait</span> is depicted as a watermark, by the Manifesto of April 8, 1783 secured the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula to the Russian Empire.  A little less than a year later she issued a decree on the foundation of the Sevastopol fortress. </li><li>  The monument to the scuttled ships was built in 1905 on the anniversary (50 years) of the defense of Sevastopol.  This is a key event of the Crimean War.  For 11 months, Russian soldiers and sailors heroically defended the city, blocking the entrance to enemy ships. </li><li>  The memorial of defense of Sevastopol in World War II - during the fascist occupation, the Crimean peninsula was very interesting to Hitler.  Already on November 5, 1941, the first hostilities began on the outskirts of the city.  Soviet troops courageously repelled three German offensives, which lasted until July 1942, after which Sevastopol was still captured.  The memorial looks like three bayonets resting in the palm of a soldier, which means two repulsed attacks and a tragic occupation. </li><li>  The Swallow’s Nest castle was built in 1912 on the spur Monastery-Burun, designed by engineer L.V. Sherwood.  It has become a symbol of the Crimea and its main attraction. </li><li>  Khan's Mosque - the first building of the Khan's Palace, was built in 1532.  One of the largest religious buildings. </li><li>  RT-70 radio telescope - was made in 1978 near Evpatoria.  The largest device in the world with a mirror diameter of 70 m. </li><li>  Cathedral of Prince Vladimir in Sevastopol - an architectural and historical monument, made in the Neo-Byzantine style.  Before the construction of the temple, a crypt with the graves of admirals who died in the Crimean War was located on the territory (V.I. Istomin, V.A. Kornilov, P.S. Nakhimov). </li></ol><p>  New 100-ruble bills convey the history of the peninsula and mark the main event of 2014 - the return of Crimea to Russia. </p><h2>  Signs of Authenticity </h2><p>  Any banknote put into circulation by the Central Bank is reliably protected from counterfeiting.  Insignia allow you to verify the authenticity of the bill.  The easiest way to check is clearance.  When looking at a banknote under bright lighting, you should pay attention to the following distinguishing features: </p><ul><li>  in the upper part on a bright field there is a watermark - a portrait of Catherine II; </li><li>  the security thread, embedded in the paper of the scribbler, looks like a dark strip on the lumen, on which light images of the symbol of the ruble currency are repeated. </li></ul>

    <p>  In addition, the objects with increased relief have the original 100 rubles of 2015: the text “HUNDRED RUBLES” and “TICKET OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA”, the digital designation “100”, a label for people with low vision, and strokes. </p><p>  You can check the authenticity of the bill with a magnifier.  About what can be seen in the original with an increase of 8-10 times, we will consider further in the article. </p><h2>  Banknote micro images </h2><p>  The new 100-ruble banknotes, like many familiar CB tickets, are protected by thumbnails.  It is difficult to fake them, so it is important to check the presence of trace elements in case of doubts about the authenticity of money.  Using a magnifier that magnifies the image by 8–10 times, you can see the following micrographs: </p><ul><li>  part of the banknote background is made of small graphic images; </li><li>  on the upper edge of the balcony of the castle "Swallow's Nest" is a repeating microtext "CRIMEA"; </li><li>  under the memorial of defense of Sevastopol, the word "SEVASTOPOL" is repeated; </li><li>  on the border of graphic images on the left and right of the bill, the number "100" is repeated. </li></ul>

    <p>  When you change the angle of view, you can also observe the characteristic signs of the authenticity of the banknote, including: a change in the color of the denomination digits, the ruble symbol on the ornamental strip (visible at an acute angle), the effect of shifting the digits of the repeating number "100" on the sides of the bill. </p><h2>  Crimean coins </h2><p>  In addition to banknotes, the Central Bank issued several types of coins with thematic design.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  3 rubles “Artek” - dedicated to the children's camp, which celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2015.  On the back you can see the panorama, Mount Ayu-Dag and the color Artek logo.  The circulation amounted to 1000 pcs. </li><li>  A series of five rubles dedicated to the memory of the Second World War and soldiers who fought on the territory of the Crimean Peninsula.  The circulation amounted to 10 million pieces. </li></ul>

    <p>  The chance to get change by "Crimean" money is small - the circulation of coins and banknotes is too small to enter the circulation.  In addition, they are too unusual, beautiful and memorable to pay for their purchases.  Banknotes and coins can be purchased at commercial banks and numismatists.  The purchase price will cost at least 2 times more expensive than the face value of the "Crimean" money. </p><p>  The new 100-ruble banknotes dedicated to the Crimean peninsula were issued in December 2015.  Second-tier banks were engaged in the sale.  Banknotes are recognized as legal tender and are accepted at face value throughout the territory of the Russian Federation. </p>
