Its territory occupies part of two large peninsulas - Indochina and Malacca.  The geography of the country has created all the conditions for a comfortable holiday for tourists.  There are plains and mountain ranges, many beaches and attractions. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.5582501" data-lng="101.45109109999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/3/9/4/15394.png"></div><h2>  What is Koh Samet </h2><p>  The island is located in the Gulf of Thailand.  Its total area is slightly more than 13 square kilometers.  This is enough to settle the village of Nadan and several hotels on a small plot of land.  Batami is paid here <span>(Thai money).</span>  You can change them at special points or remove them from an ATM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tourismthailand.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thai money (baht)" class="if uuid-3131999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131999.jpg"></div><p>  The distance from the famous resort of Pattaya to the island is about 80 kilometers.  By local standards, this is very small.  This piece of land in the middle of the ocean is located quite close to the mainland (a little more than 6 kilometers).  This is the middle of the road between Bangkok and the city of Koh Chang.  Therefore, on weekends, the island is filled with locals from the nearest megacities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  It‚Äôs best to plan your trip to the island on a weekday.  On weekends and holidays, renting a room or a house is almost impossible. </p><p>  Samet Island in Thailand is part of Khao Laemya National Park.  This is a national treasure of the country.  That is why the entrance to this land is paid.  Money is collected by soldiers who guard the entrance to the park.  By what principle the local military controls the availability of tickets for guests of the island is not known.  Therefore, there are several options for how to get to the beach without a ticket.  For example, tourists advise you to calmly and confidently just pass by, as if you were not here for the first time.  You can also bypass the checkpoint on the reverse side (this option is not always successful).  The easiest way to stay quietly in the Samet territory is to pay 200 baht for an adult (about 420 rubles) or 100 baht for a child (210 rubles).  This fee gives you the opportunity to visit all the beaches and the park on the island throughout your stay here. </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Thailand is famous for its climate.  You can relax here almost all year round, except for the rainy season.  At this time, the number of tourists decreases sharply. </p><p>  Samet Island is favorable for recreation in that even in the rainy season the weather here is much better than on the mainland.  Precipitation falls mainly at night.  Therefore, some vacationers are happy to spend their holidays here. </p><p>  Weather on Koh Samet island in Thailand pleases with its relative constancy.  The water temperature remains the same almost all year round and does not fall below 28 degrees.  The air warms up on the island to 30-32 degrees, at night the temperature drops to 24-27 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The path to the island will take no more than an hour.  At the same time, by ferry you can reach the main pier of the island in 40-50 minutes.  This fascinating journey costs 70 baht one way (about 150 Russian rubles).  Many tourists choose this option, because during the movement of the ferry you can enjoy beautiful views of the sea and nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="island pier" class="if uuid-3131987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131987.jpg"></div><p>  From the mainland, tourists are delivered to any beach on Samet Island in high-speed motor boats.  Travel time is 15-20 minutes.  Such a trip costs much more: 200 baht one way (420 Russian rubles) or 350 baht (730 rubles). </p><p>  All transport to the island leaves from the pier of the small village of Ban Phe.  You can get to it from anywhere in the mainland.  There are several options: taxi, bus, minibus and transfer.  Each will differ in cost and comfort.  The cheapest way is a regular bus.  However, tourists need to adapt to the time of its movement in this case.  Taxi is one of the most common ways of traveling for tourists with children and luggage.  Renting a car will cost about 1300 baht (about 3000 Russian rubles).  By the standards of the country, this is a little expensive, but for those who first time in Thailand and appreciate comfort, this is the best way to travel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transport on the island </h2><p>  Many tourists resting on the island believe that you can move around freely on foot.  As a result, this is difficult to do.  Although Samet Island in Thailand (the review of which was higher) is small (5 kilometers long and 2.5 wide), there are no footpaths (specially equipped) on its territory.  Walking along the sidelines is very dangerous.  You can walk along the beach - this is useful and pleasant, however, in some places the rocks block the path, and it is impossible to pass. </p><p>  There are green taxis with benches inside.  Such vehicles often surprise visitors to the island.  In fact, this is an ordinary small truck, in the back of which there are benches and handrails are made.  The fare between the beaches is from 10 baht (21 rubles).  However, this is provided that the taxi is full.  If there are no people, you will have to pay from 100 to 400 baht depending on the distance (210 - 850 rubles). </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rental car" class="if uuid-3131984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131984.jpg"></div><p>  You can also rent a bike for the whole day.  If you decide on this type of transport, then you need to rent it near the pier, in other places it will be more expensive (250-350 baht or 550-750 rubles per day). </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The Buddhist temple - the main shrine of this land - is hidden from prying eyes.  The culture of this country is very revered by the locals.  In order to admire this temple, you need to turn into the forest right behind the police station (on the way to the beach).  The road is not quite noticeable, there are no signs.  A large Buddha sculpture will immediately indicate that you are in place.  There will be buildings in a traditional style around. </p><p>  You can admire the sunset and nature from the observation deck.  It is located next to Apache (Lung Dam) beach.  Free admission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kohsametproperty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="island view" class="if uuid-3131966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131966.jpg"></div><p>  On the way to Ao Prao Beach, there is also a viewing area.  It is called Sunset Viewpoint.  It offers wonderful views of the sea and cliffs. </p><p>  An observation deck in the south of the island attracts tourists with its wild beach.  It offers a view of untouched human creations of nature.  The only thing that gets out of the whole composition is the frame from the "Instagram".  It is set here especially for travelers. </p><p>  Samet Island in Thailand (the description was above) is famous for its statue "Mermaid and child."  This is one of the most famous on that earth.  Perhaps there is no tourist who rested on Samet and was not photographed with this composition.  It is located on the right side of the main beach of Sai Keo.  And if you go a little higher, you can see a more colorful and modern composition in the same marine theme.  "A mermaid and a local who plays the pipe." </p><h2>  Koh Samet Island (Thailand): beaches </h2><p>  This small piece of land in the middle of the salty sea has more than 20 beaches.  All of them are specially equipped for vacationers.  Some are hotel property, others are for general use. </p><p>  Most of the beaches are located on the east coast.  It is more comfortable to relax.  On the western side of the island there is only one place for cultural recreation.  The northern coast of Samet has three beaches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zastavki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wild beach" class="if uuid-3131969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131969.jpg"></div><p>  The largest and most popular on the island is Sai Keo.  It is popularized thanks to the purest turquoise water and soft white sand.  The entrance to the water here is uniform and gentle.  One of the minuses is a large number of people at any time of the day.  The beach is located in the peak resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  There are many hotels, restaurants and entertainment venues.  Therefore, you should not count on a calm, quiet vacation.  Also, vacationers notice that often on the beach it smells strongly of gasoline.  Perhaps this is due to the numerous transport boats.  However, this fact spoils the overall impression of the rest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveltipsor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="south beach" class="if uuid-3131975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131975.jpg"></div><p>  For those who love a civilized cultural holiday, but without the hustle and bustle, it is worth giving preference to the beaches of Ao Pai and Wong Duan.  They are located right behind the rock with a figure.  Moreover, there are several shops and cafes on the territory.  It also offers a variety of activities for the whole family.  You can take masks for snorkeling, do a full body massage or just enjoy the sea view while sitting in a cafe on the beach. </p><p>  Ao Cho, Ao Wai and Ao Prao are considered the most beautiful beaches on Samet Island.  By the way, Ao Prao - this is the only beach on the west coast.  It is so wonderful and beautiful that, resting on it, it seems that you are alone on a desert island.  All these beaches are quiet and calm.  There is little entertainment and travel services.  But the water is just clear.  The big plus is that the beaches are in small bays.  It offers a beautiful view of the evening sea. </p><p>  Complete unity with nature can be found on the deserted beaches of Ao Lung Dam, Ao Tubtim (Puds), Ao Thian and Ao Nuan.  Here you can find only a few buildings (a couple of cafes and bungalows). </p><p>  The beaches of the southern part of the island are the property of hotels.  Only residents can relax on them. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  This small island has 120 hotels, bungalows, guesthouses and other accommodation options.  Many tourists come to Samet Island in Thailand, reviews of which will be described below, for the weekend and book rooms or lodges directly upon arrival.  Do not do this.  After all, when booking through sites, the cost of living is cheaper.  Yes, and a guaranteed place will be for an overnight stay.  Otherwise, you can be left without housing if there are many tourists. </p><p>  Hotels on Samet Island in Thailand are mostly concentrated on the east coast (near the beaches).  As it became clear, the farther south the hotel, the fewer people you will meet on the beach.  The same applies to infrastructure.  On the southern shores of cafes, shops and restaurants can be counted on the fingers of one hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="true-beachfront.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boats off the coast" class="if uuid-3131980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131980.jpg"></div><p>  The most budget accommodation options are between the village of Nedan and the main pier.  There is a sea and infrastructure nearby.  The cost of living from 1000 to 3000 baht per day (2100-6600 rubles).  For example, 4 * hotels on Samet Island (Thailand) always have a price of 2000 baht per day (about 4200 rubles).  They are located right on the coastline. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Thai food is specific and not every tourist will like it.  However, after a few days on the island, each guest will be able to select for themselves a certain list of dishes.  Most hotels on the island offer tourists breakfast only.  However, in restaurants at hotels you can always order additional dishes or set meals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krluke.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lunch with sea view" class="if uuid-3132005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3132005.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, guests of the southern beaches will not have to choose especially, but the guests of the central recreation area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island have plenty to choose from.  In the evening, the beaches of the island are literally buried in the lights.  From cafes and restaurants, tables are put right on the sand, lights and candles are lit.  People come not only to eat tasty food, but also to enjoy the views. </p><p>  The easiest and cheapest option for lunch or dinner is the ready-made dishes from the shops.  They are sold already packaged, from the refrigerator, and at the checkout they offer to warm up.  The average cost of a dish is 40-60 baht (85-130 rubles).  If you want a cheap and tasty meal in a cafe, then you need to go to the Nadan pier.  All catering establishments here have the lowest rates. </p><p>  According to reviews, Samed Villa Restaurant is one of the most favorite places in Europe.  It serves not only national dishes, but also classic European ones.  You can pay in cash and by card.  The waiters are friendly and very fast.  They speak English.  Samet Island (Thailand), reviews of which will be lower, gives all guests an unforgettable experience. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krluke.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dishes in a cafe" class="if uuid-3132004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3132004.jpg"></div><p>  For family holidays, the Banana Bar is the place to go.  It is located on the road.  Delicious curry is prepared here (according to tourist reviews). </p><p>  But a beautiful view of the sea can be enjoyed from the restaurant Buddy Bar &amp; Grill.  It also serves delicious steaks and many other original dishes.  Prices are slightly above average, but worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tourismthailand.asia" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local food (seafood)" class="if uuid-3131998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/3131998.jpg"></div><p>  The Funky Monkey Bar &amp; Restaurant are classic European dishes and everyone's favorite fast food.  You can look here for those who miss the usual food of megacities. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Tourists coming on vacation, of course, want entertainment.  Idle lying under the scorching sun for a day very quickly bothers.  And here travel agencies come to the rescue, which offer parachutes, kayaking, snorkeling and much more.  Boat trips along the coast of the island and excursions to memorable places are popular with vacationers.  Samet Island in Thailand (attractions described above) is rich in its cultural history. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Samet Island is often visited by tourists from other cities.
