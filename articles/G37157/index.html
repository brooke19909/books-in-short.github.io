    <h2>  Title "Hero of the Soviet Union" </h2><p>  In April 1934, the highest award was established, which was given for special merits.  It was the title of Hero of the USSR, and along with it they gave a material award - the Golden Star medal.  The latter was made of gold, had the appearance of a <span>five-pointed star,</span> on its back was written ‚ÄúHero of the USSR‚Äù.  Also had a red ribbon (20 mm wide). </p><p>  The list of heroes of the <span>Soviet Union</span> who received this star was launched much earlier than the award itself was approved.  By the time of its appearance (October sixteenth, 1939), several hundred people had already received this degree of distinction.  Also, along with the gold medal of the Hero of the USSR, the Order of Lenin was also awarded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  For what they gave the title of Hero of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  In order to receive this medal and title, it was necessary to accomplish a feat for the state or society - personally or collectively.  A person could be awarded more than once (those who received the star four times were recorded).  Of course, there were few such heroes. </p><p>  Those who performed the feat twice received the second star.  And also in the homeland of this man a bronze bust was installed.  Since 1973, the second Order of Lenin was also awarded at a second award. </p><p>  Those who were awarded this title and star for the third time received another, third star.  In addition, the decree wrote about the construction of a bust already in Moscow.  However, this paragraph has never been implemented. </p><p>  The first awards took place before the war.  This happened on April 20, 1934, when seven pilots provided significant assistance in rescuing the Chelyuskin icebreaker.  After that, every person who did something unusual and outstanding, showing courage, ingenuity, received this award.  Thus, the heroes of Russia performed all feats when they were required to do something for the good of the country or society.  Of course, this does not mean that everyone who received the award performed these actions in order to receive a star.  They all just did their duty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  The list of heroes of the <span>Soviet Union is</span> quite large.  Of course, most of those who received the award received it only once.  It was 12,617 people.  However, there are people who have been awarded this award two, three and even four times.  Since the award was established during the war, very many received it for their services posthumously. </p><p>  USSR citizens who received the award four times, only two.  The first on this list was <span>Georgy</span> Konstantinovich <span>Zhukov</span> .  He received his stars in 1939, 1944, 1945 and 1956.  The first award by Zhukov was received in the rank of commander, and the other three were already in the rank of marshal of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Also four times was awarded Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich.  He received his awards in 1966, 1976, 1978 and 1981.  The first was received in the rank of lieutenant general, and the subsequent ones in the rank of marshal of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Three times awarded the "Golden Star" are only three people.  This is Marshal of the Soviet Union Semyon Budyonny, as well as pilots Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub and Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin.  Kozhedub and Pokryshkin received the award during the Second World War, and Budyonny after it. </p><p>  Twice awarded the Golden Star was 154 people.  Also, the twelve cities were given the status of "hero city", and the Brest Fortress - "fortress-hero". </p>

    <h2>  Appearance of the Hero of the Russian Federation award </h2><p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, this award was replaced by another.  On March 20, 1992, the title of Hero of the <span>Russian Federation</span> was established <span>,</span> as well as the corresponding award - the Gold Star medal.  The latter is made of gold, looks like a five-pointed star, on the back of which there is an inscription ‚ÄúHero of Russia‚Äù.  Also, the medal has a ribbon of colors of the flag of Russia.  The award is presented by the president only once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first heroes of bourgeois Russia, whose feat is unknown to the masses, received their medal on April 11, 1992.  There were two of them, one of them received this award and the insignia posthumously.  Medal number one was issued to S. Krikalev.  for the fact that he spent a long time at the Mir orbital station.  In his time, it was a record.  The award at number two was handed down posthumously to Sulambek S.O.  for the fact that at the cost of his life he saved the village from the crash of an airplane because of equipment that had failed in it. </p><p>  One nuance in the order of awards: although Krikalev received the number one medal, the decree on awarding the star to Sulambek was earlier.  Some say that management did not want the first award to be presented posthumously. </p>

    <h2>  For what merits can you get the Hero of Russia award </h2><p>  Heroes of Russia and their exploits are quite numerous today, about a thousand people (according to official figures).  This medal is awarded for special services to society and the country.  Most of the awarded received it for military merits.  They were also participants in the Great Patriotic War (about a hundred people), who at one time were not awarded this title.  Almost everyone got it posthumously. </p><p>  Also, a large number of those who received the title of Hero of the Russian Federation were participants in the war in Chechnya (about five hundred people).  By the way, many citizens had an ambiguous attitude to the war, therefore, perhaps, the award itself is treated the same way.  At least in the Soviet Union, this title had a different attitude. </p><p>  Also, the title of Hero of the Russian Federation was received by intelligence officers, the military, who performed the feat not in hostilities, as well as citizens working as rescuers, testers, and astronauts. </p>

    <h2>  Liaison officers who received the award </h2><p>  The army of Russia has many brave people.  Heroes and exploits here occupy a special place, since almost everyone received a star on the battlefield, many were awarded posthumously.  We list some of them: </p><ol><li>  Dmitry Vorobiev.  Received his award at twenty-five, in 2000.  This happened during an operation in Chechnya. </li><li>  Oleg Tibekin.  Received the award posthumously in 2000.  He covered the retreating children with his chest, and he was shot at close range near Grozny. </li><li>  Valentin Padalka.  The award was received in 1994, when terrorists captured schoolchildren in Rostov and demanded a helicopter.  He was at the helm.  Thanks to his ingenuity, all the hostages survived. </li></ol><p>  Of course, this is not all those liable for military service who committed a heroic deed.  There are many brave people in Russia who will do everything possible to save the lives of others. </p>

    <h2>  Civilians who received the award </h2><p>  The title "Hero of the Russian Federation" can be obtained not only by a military person, but also by an ordinary person who does not have a military rank.  To date, 134 people have been awarded. </p><p>  The first owner of the Golden Star of civilians was Nurdin Usamov.  In 2003, he was awarded a reward for courage and heroism during the performance of official duties.  It was under his leadership that the restoration of energy began in post-war Chechnya.  All work took place with a risk to the life of power engineers, and two attempts were made on Usamov himself. </p><p>  These are the real heroes of Russia, and their exploits make us think about the life and fortitude of a person, about the actions that we could do, but for some reason did not. </p><h2>  People who have been awarded prizes of two countries (Russia and the USSR) </h2><p>  At the junction of the times of the existence of the two countries, when one award had already ceased to exist, and the second was only installed, some received a double award - the Hero of the USSR and the Hero of the Russian Federation.  There were few such citizens, only four. </p><ol><li>  Sergey Konstantinovich Krikalev.  World famous astronaut who has many professional awards.  In 1989, while the Soviet Union still existed, it became its hero and was awarded the Golden Star medal.  In 1992, he became the first owner of the same medal in a new country - the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Valery Vladimirovich Polyakov.  Although he is a doctor by training, he received awards as an astronaut.  The first in 1989, becoming the Hero of the Soviet Union.  In 1995, he made a record flight at the Mir orbital complex, the duration of which was 437 days.  Today it is a record.  It was for him that he received the Hero of the Russian Federation award. </li><li>  Nikolai Sainovich Maidanov.  He was a famous helicopter pilot who received both awards on the battlefield.  In 1988 he was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR.  In 2000, received the Hero of the Russian Federation award, but already posthumously. </li><li>  <span>Arthur Nikolaevich Chilingarov.</span>  Famous polar explorer.  He also engaged in political activities for some time.  In 1986 he received the title of Hero of the USSR.  The award was awarded for completing a difficult task.  In 2008, he already received the Hero of the Russian Federation for conducting a deep-sea expedition. </li></ol><p>  All Heroes of the Soviet Union, Heroes of Russia are truly courageous and brave citizens of their country.  Each of them performed a feat in special extreme conditions, showing his heroism and resourcefulness. </p>

    <h2>  Feats that ordinary people do </h2><p>  Many citizens, although they have not received the Hero of Russia award, are nonetheless.  These are the true heroes of our time.  The exploits of ordinary people are often invisible, but remain in the hearts of loved ones forever.  For example, Zhenya Tabakov, who is the youngest hero of Russia and the owner of the Order of Courage.  He received it posthumously when he defended his sister from a criminal.  In 2009, he was awarded the order that his mother received. </p><p>  Heroes of Russia and their exploits are numerous.  You should remember them, do not forget.  Remember and know not only the heroes of the past, but also those who live in the present, those who give their lives to future generations.  Only then can we become a truly great power worthy of all our heroes. </p>
