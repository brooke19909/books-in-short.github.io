    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Hotel Christabelle Hotel 3 * has a convenient location in relation to urban infrastructure, as well as cultural attractions.  Nevertheless, if you are a fan of sea recreation, the institution will not suit you, because it is located quite far from the beach.  Thus, this hotel is good for those who come to Ayia Napa for sightseeing purposes. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of the institution is its focus on noisy youth.  The music plays until late, and there are no restrictions on the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Thus, in the afternoon you can meet a lot of drunken guests on the territory.  This institution is absolutely not suitable for families with children. </p>
