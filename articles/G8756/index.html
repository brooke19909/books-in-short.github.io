    <p>  What beach vacation can the Badawia Resort offer?  Sharm el Sheikh is famous all over the world for its luxurious beaches.  And two of them are very close to the hotel.  You can get there on foot, but the road takes 20-30 minutes, which is not always convenient.  Therefore, a bus runs from the hotel during the day, delivering residents to the sea and back. </p><p>  The beach here is very convenient, the entrance to the sea is gradual and thoroughly cleaned of algae.  But, since there are corals nearby, tourists are still recommended to wear special shoes.  You can use sun loungers, mattresses and parasols.  Clean <span>beach towels are provided</span> free of charge at the hotel, but on bail. </p><p>  Naturally, tourists can have fun and engage in various sports.  For example, you can rent a boat or a catamaran, ride a banana, <span>water skiing,</span> go windsurfing, try out the charms of parasailing. </p><p>  Near the shore there is a large coral reef.  Traveler reviews suggest that the underwater life here is incredibly diverse and beautiful.  You can snorkel, and those tourists who want to study the local flora and fauna more deeply are engaged in diving.  By the way, here you can not only rent equipment, but also take a short training course and get a certificate. </p><h2>  Additional services on site </h2><p>  Of course, at the Badawia Resort you can count on additional service.  For example, tourists can use free parking (you can rent transport without problems at school).  You will also be able to hand dry your clothes and laundry - the prices for these services are very low.  In the hotel you can change the currency at a favorable rate.  There are also several shops selling household items and nice souvenirs. </p><h2>  Leisure of tourists: how to have fun at the hotel? </h2>

    <p>  For the most part, travelers leave positive reviews.  The hotel can offer truly comfortable living conditions, especially considering the relatively low cost of living.  The territory is cozy and beautiful, the rooms are quite spacious, the furniture and appliances may not be new, but everything is in good condition.  Hot and cold water is supplied constantly, towels and hygiene products are replenished every day. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage is the proximity to the beach.  Yes, walking a little far on foot, but the bus runs back and forth all the time.  The seashore is very beautiful, and you can even enjoy the bright colors of the underwater world with a mask.  Naturally, there are some shortcomings, as in almost any other hotel.  For example, some guests celebrate the monotonous menu in the restaurant.  On the other hand, nobody is starving here, as the food is always fresh and in sufficient quantity. </p><p>  Hotel Badawia Resort 3 * is perfect for travelers looking for options for a budget holiday on the Egyptian coast. </p>
