    <p>  Why then does the "Home" button not work for the iPhone 5S?  Most often you have to deal with system crashes and malfunctions.  You can eliminate them both independently and by contacting service centers.  It all depends on the specific owner.  What advice and recommendations can be given to those who decided to correct the situation on their own? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About repair methods </h2><p>  It all depends on the specific situation.  Of course, without clarifying the cause of the failure, it will not be possible to repair the Home button.  If you describe in general the possible solutions, then they come down to some actions. </p><p>  Replacing the <span>Home button on the iPhone</span> 5S is rare.  It has already been said that mechanical damage occurs on smartphones, but not so often.  Usually the struggle with a broken button comes down to: </p><ol><li>  Calibration keys.  No additional programs will be required, all operations are carried out directly in the gadget. </li><li>  Correcting the position of the connector.  It does not always work.  Inaccurate handling of the phone can lead to mechanical damage to the button. </li><li>  Clean the device.  Pretty effective way to deal with the problem.  It helps if the "Home" button on the iPhone 5S crunches. </li><li>  Substitution of the component at the hardware level.  You can simply refuse to use the button on the iPhone and transfer functions to that display. </li></ol><p>  In fact, all of these methods to implement in life is not difficult.  The main thing is to know how to act.  Further, each method will be considered in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacing home button on iphone 5s" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Calibration </h2><p>  The easiest solution is to calibrate the button.  This option helps in most cases.  It is recommended to start a fight with the phenomenon under study.  Especially if the Home button on the iPhone 5S sticks.  In fact, everything is simpler than it seems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Instructions for calibrating the Home key are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Turn on your mobile device.  It is important to wait until it is fully loaded. </li><li>  Run any regular application.  It can be an organizer, a calculator, a calendar and so on. </li><li>  Press the "Power" button.  Hold it until the smartphone‚Äôs shutdown menu appears.  As soon as the appropriate window appears, release Power. </li><li>  Click on "Home".  Keep the button in this condition until the menu disappears. </li></ol><p>  That's all!  This technique is called calibration!

    <h2>  Connector position </h2><p>  But what if the Home button completely refused to perform its functions?  It is with such circumstances that many smartphone owners often face.  Replacing the "Home" button on the iPhone 5S (or any other phone) in this case is not needed.  In any case, it is necessary to postpone this process. </p><p>  To return the Home button to life, it is proposed to adjust the position of the connector.  The proposed method can be called non-standard.  But, as practice shows, it is effective. </p><p>  The whole procedure is reduced to the following actions: </p><ol><li>  You need to connect a USB cable to the iPhone. </li><li>  Put your finger on the plug in the smartphone connector. </li><li>  Gently push from bottom to top on the cable near the connection connector.  After that, you must click on "Home". </li></ol><p>  If, after the procedure, the button does not work, it is recommended that you stop trying to adjust the connector.  Exerted efforts can harm the mobile phone.  And in addition to the idle button, you can also get a damaged connector for connecting the gadget to a PC. </p><h2>  Cleaning and lubrication </h2><p>  Home button on iPhone 5S crunches?  It is likely that correcting the situation will help cleaning the component and its lubrication.  This process is not so difficult.  Even a novice will be able to master it. </p><p>  An idle button can be lubricated with cleaning agents.  For example, alcohol or WD-40.  The second substance is often used in everyday life.  He is recommended to give preference to problems with smartphones.  But caution should be exercised!  WD-40 has high fluidity.  Excess substance applied to the smartphone can harm the iPhone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="home button on iphone 5s sticks" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650664.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Lubrication is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Apply a little WD-40 (or any other cleaning agent) to the Home button. </li><li>  In successive movements, press the key several times.  About 15 times will have to repeat the procedure.  This is done until the lubricant penetrates into the gap between the smartphone panel and the Home button. </li></ol><p>  No further action is required.  If alcohol has been applied, you will have to wait until it evaporates.  This usually takes no more than 2 minutes. </p><h2>  Button Duplication </h2><p>  The last way to fix a button is to duplicate it.  It has already been noticed that the iPhone can refuse the Home button by transferring its functions to the display. What needs to be done? </p><p>  The <span>iPhone 5S button does not work "Home".</span>  In order to correct the situation, you can do the following: </p><ol><li>  Go to "Settings" - "General".  This must be done with the smartphone turned on. </li><li>  Open the "Universal Access" menu. </li><li>  Select AssistiveTouch in the window that appears.  Set the switch to on. </li></ol><p>  A translucent button will appear on the screen, clicking on which allows you to work with the "Home" button without using it directly. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In fact, there is nothing difficult in fixing the "Home" key.  Some users are interested in <span>how to change the</span> "Home" <span>button</span> on the iPhone 5S.  It is not recommended to engage in the replacement of a component yourself.  Therefore, it is very difficult to familiarize yourself with such information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change the home button on iphone 5s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650665.jpg"></div>
