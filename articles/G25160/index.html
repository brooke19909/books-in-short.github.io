Self-service devices work around the clock and are located not only near offices, but also in popular places: shopping centers, stops, clinics.  If the client does not know how to get the details at the Sberbank ATM, he should take a card with him and read the tips of experienced users. </p><h2>  Features of Sberbank ATMs </h2><p>  Self-service devices in the largest bank in the country work without interruptions, with the exception of cases of reboot and technical work.  Therefore, before finding out how to get the bank details of Sberbank at an ATM, you should check the operation of the machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can take the details at the Sberbank ATM" class="if uuid-3219534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219534.jpg"></div><p>  The absence of warning messages about technical work, a freeze and a blue screen is proof that the ATM is in working condition.  You should pay attention to whether there are any suspicious objects near the card reader - the place where the credit card is inserted.  Fraudsters can install readers to steal card details and customer funds. </p><p>  If the ATM is in order and there are no visible signs of its malfunction, in this case, you can take the details from the Sberbank ATM.  The operation will take no more than 5 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Methods for obtaining details </h2><p>  Card account information is available online.  The client can see it on the terminal screen.  If desired, the owner of the credit card has the opportunity to print the document on the check. </p><p>  Printing a check takes no more than 10 seconds.  You can get an unlimited number of copies for each account for free.  Such a document is accepted even in bookkeeping in order to credit wages to a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  How to get the details of a Sberbank card through an ATM? </h2><p>  If the client has never received a certificate with details, he can spend time looking for the desired section in the device menu.  The process of obtaining details is simple and does not require special skills.  But you should know in which section of the menu information about card accounts is presented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.canyoubelieve.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details at the sberbank ATM" class="if uuid-3219537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219537.jpg"></div><p>  The ATM menu is regularly updated, and customers are not always aware of <span>how to get the card details at the Sberbank ATM</span> after the update.  In ATMs of the old type, the process of searching for details is different. </p><h2>  Differences between Sberbank ATMs </h2><p>  How are new Sberbank ATMs different from old ones?  Firstly, stylish design.  They are not mounted on the wall and look more mobile.  Secondly, a touch screen.  The era of "push-button" devices is gradually coming to an end, but they are still found, especially in rural areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thecoolgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get card details at a sberbank ATM" class="if uuid-3219533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219533.jpg"></div><p>  There are mixed-type ATMs: you can print the details in them, using both the touch screen and buttons.  But such devices are even less common. </p><p>  Sberbank regularly updates ATMs so that customers can experience the benefits of working with new devices.  As a rule, after updating the program, the menu in ATMs changes, which can cause difficulties for some users. </p><p>  In order not to waste time exploring new opportunities, you need to know how to get the details at the ATMs of Sberbank of Russia of the new and old type.  The "path" to the details is different, as is the appearance of the check.  But any of the options contains relevant information on the account and is suitable for presentation when calculating transfers. </p><h2>  Instructions for obtaining help at new ATMs </h2><p>  If a client uses the services of a new Sberbank ATM, he can search for details using the touch menu.  There is nothing complicated in how to get the details at the Sberbank ATM: </p><ul><li>  Insert a credit card into the card reader, enter the code. </li><li>  Find a section on customer products.  It is called "My accounts, deposits, cards, loans." </li><li>  Click on the card on which you want to get the details. </li><li>  Find the section of the same name - "Details". </li><li>  Print the check by clicking on the appropriate button. </li></ul><p>  Details printing occurs immediately after clicking on the ATM screen.  If the client needs a document on several cards, he should not take the payment instrument from the card reader, but return to the main menu and repeat the path. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.protim.si" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details of a sberbank card through an ATM" class="if uuid-3219531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219531.jpg"></div><p>  Only a cardholder can get a certificate with details.  Sberbank customers can not worry about a lost check: it does not contain any data on which fraudsters could gain access to the account.  The card number and full name of the client are not indicated for security reasons. </p><h2>  Issuance of details at old ATMs </h2><p>  Getting a check with details at old ATMs is just as quick and easy.  If the menu of new devices resembles the functionality of Sberbank Online, then in old ATMs it differs from Internet banking. </p><p>  How to get the details from an old-style Sberbank ATM: </p><ul><li>  After entering the card into the card reader, find the section "Information and Services" </li><li>  In it, go to the "Regional Services" window. </li><li>  Next - "Search for services and organizations, my services." </li><li>  A window will open with the desired service - "Print card details". </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.gazetem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get bank details of a sberbank at an ATM" class="if uuid-3219535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219535.jpg"></div><p>  The difference between the ATMs of the old model is the black and white menu.  It is not always convenient for the client to figure it out if he is already using the updated version of the device. </p><h2>  When is it impossible to print details? </h2><p>  Sometimes the cardholder may run into a problem: the ATM refuses to print out a certificate with the details.  Even if the client knows how to get the details at the Sberbank ATM, it is not always possible to get a printed version of the document. </p><p>  At Sberbank ATMs, printing of checks is carried out on special paper, which needs to be changed periodically.  If the paper in the device has run out, printing the details will not work.  But, in general, this will not affect the operation of the device. </p><p>  To find out that the ATM does not issue checks is easy: after the customer inserts the card into the device, a warning message will appear on the screen.  If there is no need to print out the details, you can continue to work at the ATM and get an electronic version of the card account. </p><h2>  If you have problems with an ATM: tips for cardholders </h2><p>  Devices do not always work correctly, even with external signs of full functionality.  Cases where Sberbank ATMs ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù customer cards are common.  And many owners of credit cards do not know what to do in such a situation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.crimerussia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get the details at an ATM sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-3219536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3219536.jpg"></div><p>  What should I do if the ATM ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù when I print out the details? </p><p>  Firstly, you should wait 10-15 minutes.  Temporary failures can cause a remote update, which leads to a "freeze" during the operation.  If the ATM is working, it will return the credit card at the specified time. </p><p>  Secondly, contact support if the card remains inside the device.  Operators will block the card and issue a reissue.  The term for the manufacture of a new Sberbank card is not more than 14 days. </p>
