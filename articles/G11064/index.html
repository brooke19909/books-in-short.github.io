BC  e.  The reign of the kings of Saul, David and Solomon belongs to this period.  With them, the Jewish people lived in a single powerful <span>centralized state.</span> </p><h2>  Age of Judges </h2><p>  The history of Palestine of those distant times is associated with many myths and legends, the veracity of which continues to be argued by historians and researchers of ancient sources.  The Hebrew kingdom is best known for the Old Testament, which describes the events of this era. </p><p>  Before the emergence of a single state, Jews lived under the leadership of judges.  They were elected from among the most authoritative and wise members of society, but at the same time did not have actual power, but only resolved internal conflicts between residents.  At the same time, the Jews were in constant danger from the aggressive nomadic neighbors.  The main threat was the Philistines. </p>

    <h2>  Election King of Saul </h2><p>  Around 1029 BC  e.  the troubled people demanded that the prophet Samuel (one of the judges) elect the king as the most worthy candidate.  The sage at first discouraged his fellow tribesmen, convincing them that the power of a military leader would turn into dictatorship and terror.  Nevertheless, ordinary people moaned from the invasion of enemies and continued to insist on their own. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Finally, according to the Bible, Samuel turned to God for advice, who replied that the young man Saul from the tribe of Benjamin should become king.  It was the smallest of the Jewish families.  Soon the prophet led the aspirant to the thirsting people.  Then it was decided <span>to cast lots</span> to confirm the correct choice of the king.  He really pointed to Saul.  So the Hebrew kingdom appeared. </p><h2>  The Prosperity of Israel </h2><p>  The first years of Saul's reign were a time of relief for all his people.  The military leader gathered and organized an army that was able to defend the fatherland from enemies.  In the course of armed conflicts, the kingdoms of Ammon, Moab, and Edom were defeated.  The confrontation with the Philistines was especially fierce. </p><p>  The sovereign was distinguished by religiosity.  He dedicated his every victory to God, without which, in his opinion, the Hebrew kingdom would have long perished.  The history of his wars against neighbors is described in detail in the Bible.  The character of young Saul is also revealed there.  He was not only religious, but also a very modest person.  In his free time, the sovereign himself cultivated the field, showing that he was no different from the inhabitants of his country. </p>

    <h2>  The conflict of the king and the prophet </h2><p>  After one of the campaigns between Saul and Samuel, a quarrel occurred.  Its cause was the blasphemous act of the king.  On the eve of the battle with the Philistines, he himself made a sacrifice, while he did not have the right to do so.  Only clergy, or rather Samuel, could do this.  There was a gap between the king and the prophet, which became the first signal of the onset of difficult times. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Samuel, who left the courtyard, became disillusioned with Saul.  He decided that he had placed the wrong person on the throne.  God (whose remarks are often found in the Bible) agreed with the clergyman and offered him a new candidate.  They became young David, whom Samuel secretly anointed to reign. </p>

    <h2>  David </h2><p>  The young man possessed many talents and amazing traits.  He was an excellent warrior and musician.  His abilities became known at the court of the king.  Saul at this time began to suffer from bouts of melancholy.  Priests advised him to treat this ailment with the help of music.  So David appeared at the court, playing the ruler on the harp. </p><p>  Soon the king‚Äôs close associate glorified himself with yet another feat.  David joined the Israeli army when another war broke out against the Philistines.  In the camp of the enemy, the most terrible warrior was Goliath.  This descendant of giants possessed gigantic growth and strength.  David challenged him to a personal duel and defeated him with the help of his dexterity and sling.  As a sign of victory, the young man cut off the head of the defeated giant.  This episode is one of the most famous and quoted in the entire Bible. </p><p>  The victory over Goliath made David a favorite of the people.  There was a conflict between him and Saul, which grew into a civil war that shook the Hebrew kingdom.  At the same time, the Philistines again operated in Palestine.  They defeated the army of Saul, and he committed suicide, not wanting to be in enemy captivity. </p>

    <h2>  New king </h2><p>  So in 1005 BC.  e.  David became king.  Even at the court of Saul, he married his daughter, thus becoming the monarch‚Äôs son-in-law.  It was under David that the capital of the Hebrew kingdom was moved to Jerusalem, which has since become the heart of all people's life.  The new sovereign patronized urban planning and ennoblement of the provinces. </p><p>  The location of the Hebrew kingdom of that time remains a matter of debate.  If you refer to the Bible, it can be assumed that the borders of Israel ran from Gaza to the shores of the Euphrates.  Like other rulers of the Hebrew kingdom, David waged successful wars against neighbors.  Nomads, time after time, were thrown back from the borders when they started another campaign with robberies and bloodshed. </p><p>  However, not all of David‚Äôs rule was cloudless and calm.  The country again had to survive the civil war.  This time, David's own son, Absalom, rebelled against central authority.  He encroached on the throne of his father, although he did not have a right to it.  In the end, his army was defeated, and the prodigal son himself was killed by the royal servants, which contradicted the orders of the king. </p>

    <h2>  Solomon </h2><p>  When David grew old and decrepit, the question of succession again sharply arose.  The king wanted to transfer power to one of his youngest sons, Solomon: he was distinguished by wisdom and ability to govern.  The choice of the father did not like the other eldest offspring - Adonius.  He even tried to organize a coup, appointing his own coronation during the life of an incompetent father. </p><p>  However, Adonia‚Äôs attempt failed.  Because of his cowardice, he fled to the Tabernacle.  Solomon forgave his brother after his repentance.  At the same time, other officials and close associates of the conspiracy were executed.  The kings of the Hebrew kingdom reliably held power in their hands. </p>

    <h2>  The construction of the Jerusalem temple </h2><p>  After the death of David, the actual reign of Solomon began (965‚Äì928 BC).  This was the heyday of the Hebrew kingdom.  The country was reliably protected from external threats and steadily developed and grew rich. </p><p>  The main act of Solomon was the construction of the Jerusalem Temple - the main shrine of Judaism.  This religious building symbolized the unification of the whole nation.  David did a great job of preparing materials and creating a plan.  Shortly before his death, he handed over all the papers to his son. </p><p>  Solomon began construction in the fourth year of his reign.  He turned for help to the king of the <span>Phoenician city of</span> Tire.  From there came the famous and talented architects who supervised the immediate work on the construction of the temple.  The main religious building of the Jews became part of the royal palace.  It was located on a mountain called the Temple.  On the day of consecration in 950 BC  e.  The main national relic, the Ark of the Covenant, was moved into the building.  Jews celebrated the completion of construction for two weeks.  The temple became the center of religious life, where pilgrims from all Jewish provinces flocked. </p><p>  Solomon's death in 928 BC  e.  put an end to the prosperity of a single state.  The successors of the sovereign divided the state among themselves.  Since then there has been a northern kingdom (Israel) and a southern kingdom (Judea).  The era of Saul, David and Solomon is considered the golden age of the entire Jewish people. </p>
