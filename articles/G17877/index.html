Photos of this reservoir, which are in this article, can not fully convey all its charms.  Every summer thousands of vacationers come here in search of peace.  It is said that Lake Senezh is rich in fish and is a favorite place for anglers.  They can be seen here at any time of the year, even when the pond is covered with a thick layer of ice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senezh Lake" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/449396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description and location </h2><p>  Senezh Lake is an artificially created reservoir.  It is located about 60 kilometers from Moscow, on the outskirts of the city of Solnechnogorsk.  The coastline is 16 kilometers long and has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately nine hectares (maximum width is three kilometers and length is about 5 km).  The greatest depth of the lake is 6 meters, and the average is about three meters.  The reservoir is irregular in shape, as numerous bays form uneven outlines of the coast.  In the bay, which forms at the mouth of the Sestra River, there are small islands (with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2 hectares).  At sunset, they turn a bright crimson color.  Because of this, they were called Malinov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bottom of the lake is silty, along the coast there are many algae.  From Senezh, the Sister River originates.  There are many settlements on the lake: cities, villages, villages, etc. Here are the names of some of them: Talaevo, Osipovo, Reino, Timonovo, Vertilino, Zagorye, Gigirevo, Senezh, Bogorodskoye, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Senezh, fishing" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/449397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Senezh Lake - a source of inspiration </h2><p>  Since olden times, the surroundings of this beautiful reservoir were chosen by creative people.  A riot of colors and a beautiful landscape attracted poets and writers, artists and musicians.  At the end of the nineteenth century, in search of inspiration, the great Russian painter I. Levitan came to the village of Bogorodskoye.  He was so struck by the beauty of these places that he decided to temporarily settle in the village and painted his painting "Lake. Russia", which later became one of his best works.  Ten kilometers from Lake Senezh, the estate of the genius of feather Alexander Blok was located.  The poet often took walks to the pond.  His stunning look at different times of the day tuned Blok into a creative mood.  Full of creative ideas, he returned home and took up his pen. </p><h2>  The best place to rest in the suburbs </h2><p>  In Soviet times, in search of a beautiful place for the Artists' Rest House, a commission consisting of builders and architects, artists and party workers arrived in Solnechnogorsk.  Everyone liked Lake Senezh, or rather its shores.  Soon, the construction of the new Senezh Russian Artists' Rest House began on this site.  Due to environmental cleanliness and fresh air around the perimeter, the lake is very popular, various sanatoriums and pensions have been built on its shores.  In addition, during the summer months on weekends there is an influx of Muscovites to Lake Senezh.  Rest here is relatively cheap, especially if you rent a house in the village.  As for the vaunted purity of water, this is certainly true.  After all, there are no motor boats on the lake that would pollute the water.  But Senezh is a favorite place for windsurfers, kayakers, fans of sailing, etc. By the way, the lake is completely unprotected from the winds, so you can often see waves on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  Until the beginning of the 19th century, Senezhsky Lake was not in sight.  In its place was a small lake Gushchino.  However, when an almost 9-kilometer canal was dug between <span>the Sestra</span> and Istra <span>rivers</span> , more than 30 locks were erected (13 on Istra, more than 20 on Sestra), dams and bridges were built, then upstream of the Sestra, having absorbed the Gushchinino lake, as a result of the increase volume of water formed a new artificial reservoir - Lake Senezh.  Two rivers feed on it: Sister and Mazikha. </p><h2>  Lake Senezh.  Fishing for the patient </h2><p>  In this artificial pond, fish of rather large sizes are found.  Here you can find a wide variety of aquatic inhabitants: zander, perch, crucian carp, pike, carp, roach, bream and even a royal ruff, named in this way because of its large size.  Recently, eels have also been bred here, which in the clear water of Lake Senezh reach two meters in length.  From the above it follows that from the types of passive recreation the best that Lake Senezh can offer is fishing.  What could be nicer than settling down on the shore of a beautiful reservoir, armed with fishing rods and waiting, listening to the silence of these places?  Probably, many wondered whether it is possible to find uninhabited and quiet places on the popular lake.  Do not forget that the coastline of the lake stretches for almost 20 km, and at such a great distance there is always a secluded place where no one bothers you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Senezh photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/449394.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of fishing on Lake Senezh </h2><p>  The best time for fishing is windy weather, especially when blowing from the south.  However, after the north and west winds in the central part of the reservoir and to the Malinovy ‚Äã‚ÄãIslands abundant fishing begins.  In autumn, in sunny weather, you can hunt for a lake predator - a pike.  The end of pike fishing comes with the first formation of ice.  This period lasts until the ice crust disappears completely.  But in winter you can catch perches, ruffs, gaits, etc. With the onset of spring, bream and ruffs are especially active.  Locals say fishing on these fish is especially successful on the full moon.  In addition, according to old-timers, in these places it is best to fish from the middle of the lake, sitting in a boat.  Coastal fishing is possible only at night or in spring. </p><h2>  Base of fishers in Senezh </h2><p>  Since fishing on Lake Senezhsky is very popular among residents of nearby settlements, as well as visitors from Moscow and other cities, a base has been created on the island, which belongs to the Society of Athlete-Fishers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Solnechnogorsk, Lake Senezh" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/449393.jpg" width="375"></div>  On the territory of the base there is a guest house with excellent cuisine.  At the request of the fishermen, they are provided with a separate refrigerator for storing the catch or a stove if they want to cook a dish from their prey on their own.  Many vacationers come here in their own cars, but from Moscow to Solnechnogorsk there is a train that will take amateur fishermen to the shores of Lake Senezh in an hour and a half.
