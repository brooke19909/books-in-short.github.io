    <p>  Active development of the reservoir began in the 70s of the XIX century.  In 1979, Lake Abrau in the Krasnodar Territory received the status of a natural monument.  Its greatest depth is 11 m. Area - 0.6 km <sup>2</sup> .  The name of the village of Abrau-Durso for many is associated with champagne.  It is here that the famous winery is located, the history of which began back in the 19th century. </p><h2>  Vineyards in Abrau-Durso </h2><p>  The royal estate was founded in 1870.  At the first land surveying, its area was quite large and included forests, steppes and meadows that belonged to it.  Grape farming began in 1872.  It was then that the local agronomist bought breeding varieties abroad, namely: “Portuguese” and “Riesling”.  In the seventies, an area of ​​30 thousand square fathoms was allocated for grapes here.  Over time, such varieties as Pinot Fran, Sauvignon, Pinot Gris, and Traminer began to be cultivated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first crop in Abrau-Durso was harvested in 1877.  Then they equipped a special basement.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation" data-mce-mark="1">After</span> 5 years, vintage table wines appeared in stores.  Champagne production began in 1891.  And at the end of the century, a plant began operating in Abrau-Durso, which included several buildings, including basement tunnels.  Around this time, they built a road leading from Novorossiysk.  In Abrau-Durso, specialists who previously worked at the plant in Sudak were transferred.  Production continued to expand. </p><p>  In the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography" data-mce-mark="1">1920s, a</span> plant located near Novorossiysk was nationalized.

    <h2>  Picturesque lake landscape </h2><p>  The area where Lake Abrau is located is in some ways unique.  She did not leave indifferent any traveler who visited these places.  Here, a mountain serpentine is surrounded on both sides by vineyards and mountain slopes.  After turning off the highway, the road rises to the hills.  From here, a beautiful view of Lake Abrau (Krasnodar Territory) and its surroundings opens.  There are many legends about the origin of these places.  Two of them are described below.

    <h2>  Origin of the lake </h2><p>  According to the most <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="51" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">common</span> version, it arose as a result of ancient seismic phenomena.  Initially, a basin was formed here, which was gradually filled with waters from mountain rivers.  There is another point of view: the lake is supposedly the remnant of a freshwater sea that existed millions of years ago. </p><p>  And <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="82" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation" data-mce-mark="1">finally, the</span> third version.  Lake Abrau in the Krasnodar Territory arose after an earthquake that occurred in antiquity.  The mountains moved, thereby squeezed the river bed among themselves.  This assumption <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="53" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">provides an</span> explanation for the question of where the water disappears from the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="52" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">lake</span> .  After all, evaporation cannot explain this.  A rather large amount of water from mountain rivers flows into Abrau.  In addition, wetland vegetation is completely absent here, which indicates its connection with the sea. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Lotus Lake</span> (Krasnodar Territory) </h2><p>  In Abrau-Durso, there is another interesting reservoir.  Namely, the Lotus Lake.  It is located near a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="80" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar" data-mce-mark="1">small</span> <span data-annotation-idx="1" data-annotation="80" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar" data-mce-mark="1">village</span> .

They grew, and a little later covered the entire water surface.  When the time comes for their flowering, the reservoir turns into a surprisingly romantic lake.  It seeks vacationers from hotels located in Abrau-Durso.  Where you can stay in order to visit wonderful places, we will certainly tell you.  In the meantime, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="55" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">back</span> to the most famous lake in Abrau-Durso (Krasnodar Territory). </p><h2>  First legend </h2><p>  There is one beautiful and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="83" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic" data-mce-mark="1">romantic</span> story about <span>how the lake originated</span> .  The Adyghe <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">village was</span> once located on the site of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="56" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">reservoir</span> .  Some lived here in abundance, while others could barely make ends meet.  The daughter of one of the richest locals once fell in love with a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="10" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-mce-mark="1">newcomer</span> shepherd.  Parents, for obvious reasons, forbade her to communicate with the poor.  Then she began to meet with the shepherd in secret.  Once the girl went on a date, and the rich, meanwhile, had a big feast.  This celebration ended very sadly.  Fun for the sake of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="81" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar" data-mce-mark="1">rich</span> threw <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">cakes</span> and other dishes at the poor.  God looked at it, and punished the highlanders.  The village suddenly fell underground, and a lake formed in its place. </p><p>  The girl, returning from a date, was upset when she saw a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="59" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">pond</span> in the place of her native home.  And then, as befits a legend, she rushed into the lake from a cliff.  But <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="60" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">her</span> , unlike her parents, there was nothing to punish.  The lake did not accept the unfortunate.  Then she went in tears along the surface of the water.  Then she sat for a long time on the shore of the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="61" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">lake</span> and grieved.  Since then, where the girl went, you can see the lunar path.  This <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="64" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">is</span> another mystery of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="63" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo" data-mce-mark="1">Lake</span> Abrau in the Krasnodar Territory.
