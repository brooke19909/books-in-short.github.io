    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Special complaints about the quality of service at East Sea Resort Paradise 4 * guest reviews do not contain.  True, some tourists complained that sometimes the cleaning of their rooms was not very thorough.  However, there is always the opportunity, in case of dissatisfaction, to contact the reception and ask, for example, to clean the floor, replenish supplies of personal hygiene products or replace towels.  In general, the staff of East Sea Resort Paradise are very friendly, welcoming and attentive.  All employees are always ready to help you in resolving any issue. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This item, according to many of our compatriots, is, as they say, a weak link in the hotel in question.  So, the cost of living here includes only breakfast.  They are not held in buffet format, as is customary in most <span>hotels in Thailand.</span>  In the morning you will be offered scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs or boiled eggs, sausages, toasts and pancakes.  Moreover, the menu is the same every day.  In this regard, few of the guests had breakfast daily at the hotel.  Many preferred in the morning either to eat food purchased at the mashinakh (mobile stalls), or a snack in one of the nearby cafes. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  According to tourists, from East Sea Resort to the nearest beach can be reached on foot in about seven minutes.  Here you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas.  True, the bottom near the shore is quite rocky, so you can injure your legs.  Our compatriots advise going a little to the left to the wild beach.  Sun loungers are not available for rent here, but swimming is quite comfortable.  In general, experienced travelers warn that Pattaya is not the place where you should count on an unforgettable beach vacation.  Swimming here vacationers mainly go to nearby islands. </p>
