    <h2>  <span>Mysterious incidents</span> in Shushmore </h2><p>  The Shushmor anomalous zone became famous as the ‚ÄúBermuda Triangle of the Moscow Region‚Äù, where people disappear annually.  The tract is located in forests and swamps on the border of the Moscow and Vladimir regions, named after the river flowing nearby, and is one of the secrets that remain unsolved to this day, attracting the attention of scientists, tourists and lovers of the unknown. </p><p>  Many seek to solve the riddle and mystery of the Shushmore tract to understand the reasons for the inexplicable deaths and disappearances of people, strange and incomprehensible incidents.  Many of those who dared to visit this place have not returned.  Others, who were more fortunate, returned without discovering anything.  And today more and more expeditions are sent there, however no one has yet been able to find exact answers. </p><h2>  The history of the tract Shushmor </h2><p>  According to one version, the name of the tract was in honor of the river;  according to another, many ‚Äúdead‚Äù places have a similar root in the name.  The first mention of Shushmore dates back to the 12th-13th centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the strangeness of this place was first discovered only in 1885, when people began to disappear near the forest, during the repair work on the Kolomensky tract.  Then the district Pokrovskaya police could not find anything.  Surprisingly, the carts, trade and resettlement carts also disappeared: in 1887, four carts with people disappeared, in 1893 - the postman, in 1896 - a surveyor with a cart and charioteer, and after a year - 2 peasants.  According to some reports, from 1885 to 1920.  at least 20 disappearances have occurred on various roads. </p>

    <p>  After the 1917 revolution, they stopped using the tract, paved the way in another locality - for some period of disappearances no longer occurred.  However, already at the end of the 50s of the XX century a group of tourists disappeared without a trace in the same place. </p><p>  In 1971, geophysicists discovered a magnetic anomaly here, and it was then that comparisons with the Bermuda Triangle began to appear. </p><h2>  Natural anomalies </h2><p>  The forest in which the tract itself is located is filled with plants and mutant animals.  A large number of trees in the Shushmor tract (photo below) has a strange curved shape, giant snakes are found in the forest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in the 1970s, teacher N. Akimov, along with his students, went in search of tracts that were unsuccessful, but they saw square birch trees, aspen trees and two-meter ferns, trees that had grown over the trunks, which struck them with size.  Even the greatest skeptics cannot refute the existence of the secret of the Shushmore tract, taking into account the evidence of eyewitnesses. </p>

    <p>  According to the stories of local residents, here you can meet black snakes of gigantic proportions, but so far no one has managed to photograph them.  Therefore, despite the existence of natural anomalies, strange and inexplicable incidents, material evidence was not found. </p><h2>  Sanctuary </h2><p>  One of the secrets of the Shushmore tract is the existence of an ancient stone structure consisting of a granite hemisphere up to 6 meters wide, surrounded by megaliths.  By external signs, it is often compared with Stonehenge. </p><p>  One of the first geographers who described this area was the famous traveler and explorer Pyotr Semenov-Tyan-Shansky who visited these places in the 19th century.  However, he did not indicate the exact location of the sanctuary, and so far not a single scientific expedition has been able to find it. </p><p>  The appointment of Shushmore megaliths has not yet been established, but according to scientists, they could be used for several purposes: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  sacrifice (including human); </li><li>  conducting magic rituals; </li><li>  the implementation of pagan rites. </li></ul>

    <p>  Megaliths of the tract are classified according to the stories of witnesses into three types: </p><ul><li>  stone hemisphere of unknown purpose, clearly made by human hands measuring 6 m; </li><li>  poles with inscriptions resembling pagan deities and snakes; </li><li>  A snake stone is a lump located in the middle of a swamp, which is credited with magical properties. </li></ul><h2>  Theories and Legends </h2><p>  The megalith complex is considered an ancient pagan temple.  According to the local historian V. Kazakov, stone pillars in the tract Shushmor (Ushmor) in the suburbs were erected in 2000 BC.  people of the tribe of the lake.  Inside the complex was an altar where the people worshiped the serpent god Ur, who owned magic and forbidden knowledge. </p><p>  This theory was created by V. Kazakov, and scientists consider the ritual "Serpent Stone", which they found not far from the village, to be its confirmation.  Shatur ("Shat" is translated as "a small hill", and "Ur" is the ruler of snakes).  However, this theory is not capable of explaining all the mystical and <span>mysterious phenomena</span> . </p><p>  According to local legend, in these forests there is an ancient burial in the form of a hill made of stones, in which one of the commanders of the famous Batu Khan, along with the soldiers, rests.  The army died in the Shatursky swamps on the way to Vladimir, and from that time the spirit of the khan was angry and mosque furious lightning.  Perhaps this legend explains some mysteries and the existence of dark forces in Shushmore? </p><h2>  Shushmore tract: a few more secrets </h2><p>  In addition to natural mutants, mysterious buildings and disappearances of people, there are other riddles in the tract Shushmor.  One of them is the glow that is most often seen somewhere between the Wasteland and Baksheev. </p><p>  For the first time in 1964, a traveler walking through a forest witnessed the appearance of a spherical glow in the night sky.  After some time, the light began to gradually fade, until it finally went out, revealing the starry sky.  Another witness saw this phenomenon in 1968. Later it turned out that the famous traveler Thor Heyerdahl and his team in the Atlantic Ocean became eyewitnesses of a similar mysterious glow. </p><p>  In the last decade of the 20th century, several more tourists and locals talked about the mysterious glow in the area. </p><p>  Another attraction is Lake Smerdyachy (the name is given because of the terrible hydrogen sulfide smell of water), near which the compass always shows an inaccurate direction: the arrow deviates 15-20 degrees alternately to the east or west. </p>

    <p>  Of great interest to scientists is Lake.  White, in which they still can not find the bottom: attempts by divers and underwater explorers have not yet been crowned with success.  Ufologists explain this by the presence of a deep crack formed as a result of the fall of a space object on the Earth (meteorite or alien spaceship). </p><h2>  Shushmore researchers </h2><p>  Mystery always attracts people, therefore it is not surprising that many travelers and scientists were interested in these mysterious places.  Those who traveled to the Shushmore tract were always amazed and returned with amazing stories in which they described a mysterious and frightening atmosphere. </p><p>  Akimov's expedition in the 70s of the twentieth century combed the forests of Shatura.  There is evidence that they found a mysterious megalithic complex.  However, in the official records there is no description of the temple, altar, boulder or pillars.  But it is often said that the closer they came to Shushmore, the more they met abnormal plants, and the harder it was to go because of the strange depressing atmosphere of the place itself.  And this is not the first and not the last evidence that Shushmore himself seemed to be trying to prevent the traveler from coming close. </p><p>  In 1998, a group of researchers led by A. Lipkin was looking for a mysterious tract, they were helped by local ufologists (A. Perepelitsyna‚Äôs group from <br>  Sergiev Posad), however, did not achieve positive results. </p><h2>  Shushmore Press Publications </h2><p>  For the first time, the Shushmore tract as an anomalous place in Russia appeared on the pages of newspapers and magazines back in the 1990s thanks to the popular ethnographer <br>  A. Lipkin, who collected all the materials on this issue.  The information that he published was subsequently included in most ethnographic encyclopedic dictionaries of Russia.  At the end of the XX-beginning of the XIX century a number of articles on this subject were published. </p><p>  To date, there have been many tourists.  There are various research groups that may even try to solve the riddle once again.  For example, a team of enthusiasts with the name "Geo Shushmor", with the leader D. Barskov, a local historian by education: they walked the entire forest length and breadth, found different stones, boulders, which may be fragments of a pagan temple. </p><h2>  Other <span>mysterious disappearances</span> in the forests </h2><p>  The Shushmore tract itself is not the only <span>mysterious place in Russia.</span>  So, at the beginning of the XX century on the Volokolamsk-Tversky tract, located near <span>the Lama River,</span> similar losses of people were recorded (the number of victims was about 20 people). </p><p>  Among those who disappeared here are carriages with carts and several carts.  Local justice authorities searched every neighborhood every time, but not a single trace of the missing or guilty was found.  Local residents answered all the questions of the police, and later the police, that the missing people most likely went to the Shushmory marshes, and there "death happened to everyone." </p>

    <p>  Most likely, the coincidence in the names arose for a reason.  Some scholars suggest that the word "Shushmor" in ancient times became the name for all the terrible and fatal places where unexplained incidents occurred, bringing with them the death or disappearance of people. </p><h2>  Explanations of mysteries by scientists </h2><p>  Esoteric and scientific figures have been trying for many years to explain and express their views on the events taking place in the tract Shushmor.  So, back in the 90s, geophysicists described abnormal fluctuations of magnetic fields in this territory.  A powerful geomagnetic zone was recognized as the epicenter of all mysterious phenomena (glows, natural anomalies, etc.). </p><p>  In the stories, the old-timers of these places mention strange optical and natural phenomena (gigantism and ugliness of plants, the appearance of huge snakes, etc.), the existence of a mysterious temple dedicated to pagan gods among impassable swamps and forests.  The last evidence of the existence of the stone hemisphere was the story of a hunter from Shatura, who in the 1990s described the stone itself and the image on the pillars of a winding huge snake. </p>

    <p>  Official science explains the <span>disappearances of people by the</span> fact that in ancient times there were "robber shelters" in these places, which robbed rich wagons and killed people.  Also, the loss of people could happen due to the fact that in the anomalous zone they had a clouding of reason and a loss of landmarks on the ground, which led to death in peat bogs. </p><p>  Some esoteric scientists, trying to unravel the mystery of the natural boundary, explain the oddities by the presence of aliens, while others are convinced of the existence of a parallel world in the natural boundary Shushmor, which sends the devils, evil spirits and the king of snakes Ur.  One of the legends interprets the presence of a stone hemisphere as a place of storage of treasures of the ‚ÄúGorynych snake‚Äù. </p><p>  Ufological and exploratory expeditions in this area have been going on since the 1970s, however, they could not find any temple either. </p><h2>  Location of the tract </h2><p>  The mysterious tract Shushmor is not marked on any of the geographical maps of Russia.  An article in the Encyclopedia of Mysterious Places of Russia (2006) does not indicate its exact location.  According to publications in the press, this place is designated as a vast territory on the border between the Moscow and Vladimir regions on the right bank of the river.  Klyazma.

    <p>  According to approximate coordinates given by travelers, the tract is the territory of a square 10-15 km in size on each side, located north of the village of Pustosha.  Closest to this zone is the village.  Urshelsky, which can be reached by train from the Kazan station (go to Cherusey).  Then you need to go by bus or minibus to s.  Wasteland, then - on foot to the north 10 km. </p><p>  The mystery of the Shushmora tract has not yet been solved, but maybe the next generation of travelers and scientists will be able to discover it. </p>
