    <p>  How to weave a rubber phone case?  To make it smooth, without recesses and crevices, it is recommended to use thin and even elastic bands.  To make the pattern and color the same, at first it is better to choose one-color elastic bands.  Today, a cover can be woven using a hook or a machine - in each case, the product pattern will be different, since different weaving techniques are used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What you need to prepare for weaving a cover on the machine </h2><p>  How to weave a rubber phone case on a machine?  This manipulation is carried out quickly and easily.  But before you start, you should prepare the necessary accessories in advance.  These include the following: </p><ul><li>  hook; </li><li>  a machine that does not contain a central (main) row; </li><li>  elastic bands of any color (preferably 3 colors). </li></ul>

    <p>  After preparing the necessary materials, you can start weaving the cover. </p><h2>  How is weaving a multi-colored cover </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to correctly install the machine so that the product turns out to be smooth and dense.  Its recesses located in front should look forward, and the rear hooks - back.  Then it is necessary to make a basis from plain rubber bands: for this we fasten them obliquely, after which we grab it with a hook - you need to do this immediately in 3 pieces.  After that, we fix the base with a loop so that the middle turns out to be a little tightened.  If the manipulation was carried out correctly, gaps should be formed on each column, which must be filled.  To do this, rubber bands of a different color are used, fixed by the ‚Äúeight‚Äù. </p><p>  Now you should string in a circle a layer of rubber bands of a different color, and then place the bottom layer in the center.  After that, alternate any 2 colors until weaving reaches the 18th row.  Once it is finished, repeat the manipulation until the 11th row, which is formed on the other side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a cover is woven strictly according to the pattern, where the weave of the rubber bands are necessarily on one side.  As soon as the product is ready, it must be turned out and fixed on it a pendant, rope or keychain. </p>

    <p>  How to weave a rubber phone case?  To do this, you must follow the weaving pattern, so as not to make a mistake in the loops. </p><h2>  Crochet Weaving Technique </h2><p>  How to weave a rubber phone case without a machine?  To do this, you need to prepare everything you need for work, and then be patient and have a good mood for creativity. </p><p>  We take the hook in our hands and wind the first elastic band in 2 turns on its base.  Then we take one more (you can have a different color) and also hook the elastic through the previously made loop.  With this scheme, you need to make as many loops as you need for your mobile phone.  In order not to be mistaken with the number of loops, the base of the cover should be attached to the phone.  The length is excellent if the loops fit tightly around the base of the gadget. </p>

To do this, it should be fixed, as in the previous case, using a ring on which the loops will then be fixed.  The first gum should be fixed with 3 rings. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The last loop is also fixed 3 times.  If the circuit was executed correctly, you will get one side of the cover (lower or upper).  Now in the same way we braid the second side, using the same colors of the elastic bands.  You need to round the corners of the product in the same way as the creation of the series begins. </p><p>  As soon as both blanks for the cover are ready, they can be fastened with similar chains, only in this case the side loop is not fixed 3 times to make the product smooth.  The links should be fastened together with elastic bands threaded as lifting fasteners. </p><h2>  How to understand that the cover is gossiped correctly </h2><p>  To do this, consider the following nuances: </p><ul><li>  the gum does not stick out; </li><li>  the product is smooth; </li><li>  silicone material does not stick out and does not create sagging; </li><li>  the resulting product looks beautiful, the result pleases; </li><li>  the cover is slightly stretched, however, no cracks appear on its base. </li></ul><p>  Such a cover will serve faithfully for a long time, so you can not be afraid that silicone rubber bands will quickly tear. </p>
