The powerful resort infrastructure existing in the city is self-sufficient.  Therefore, the administration of the hotel in question, relying on it, can not afford universal, but specialized activities, such as an apart-hotel.  Here, vacationers are greeted by a well-functioning reliable service with an optimized transfer, quick pick-up and check-in, reliable service and easy delivery.  And of course, the surrounding society leaves its mark on the hotel‚Äôs appearance, the atmosphere of the global youth party.  As you know, unofficially the city of Ayia Napa is called the youth capital of Cyprus.

The boys and girls who arrived in Ayu Napa plunge headlong into the bustling local nightlife.  They themselves come up with entertainment for themselves, abundantly realizing their plans in urban resort clubs.  And fall asleep already in the morning.  Accordingly, wake up for a late breakfast.  A hotel, as we have already mentioned, is classified as an apart-hotel, i.e. its service has clearly defined boundaries.  Evabelle Napa Apts Class A 4 provides its guests with shelter, food, leisure services and access to the rest of the resort infrastructure.

And planning it in Ayia Napa is a pleasure, because the Evabelle Napa Hotel is located almost in the heart of the youth capital of Cyprus and not far from its main recreational resources.  The sea here is like in a fairy tale: azure, transparent, with picturesque lagoons and sandy beaches. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The two-storey textured white building Evabelle Napa Apts Class A 4 decorates Nissi - Avenue of Ayia Napa.  The hotel is located a twenty minute walk from the sea and from the entertainment infrastructure: clubs, restaurants, bars, discos.  It welcomes guests 91 rooms, a restaurant, two bars.  The rooms of the hotel complex by their design are divided into two types: studios and single.  The hotel has an outdoor pool with a children's section, a gym, tennis courts, and a sauna. </p><h2>  Room decor </h2>

    <p>  The hotel rooms are quite compact, practical.  Their design and furnishings are more likely to correspond to the economy class than to the classic class.  The simplification is obvious.  However, young people living in a hotel are tolerant of such savings.  Two types of rooms are offered to visitors: studio (area - 25 m <sup>2</sup> ) and single rooms (area - 45 m <sup>2</sup> ).  They are equipped with a small kitchen, bathroom, toilet, balcony.  The standard Evabelle Napa Apts 4 room is furnished with a pair of bedside tables, beds, armchairs, half tables, large and coffee tables.  In the kitchen - a compact kitchenette, stove, refrigerator, electric kettle, a set of pots, plates.  On the balcony there is a plastic table with chairs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Paid services for guests include air conditioning, Wi-Fi, laundry, dry cleaning. </p><p>  In general, the decor in the Evabelle Napa Apts Class A 4 rooms corresponds to a solid economy-class hotel.  The overall style of interior design is minimalism. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Catering for visitors is multivariate in mode.  Although a hotel restaurant can provide three meals a day, that is, half board for everyone, often two or even <span>one-time meals</span> are practiced <span>.</span>  Young people, for example, prefer only breakfast at the hotel, and lunch and dinner at the restaurants of Ayia Napa.  The reason is the large-scale public catering infrastructure of the city. </p>

The price of one restaurant dish is 10-20 ‚Ç¨, but the portions are very large.  A positive point for tourists is about the same prices in cafes and restaurants.  Therefore, in conditions of such a developed gastronomic infrastructure, guests of the Evabelle Napa Hotel Apartments 4, like real gourmets, try various dishes at different points of public catering.  Not far from the hotel is McDonald's.  However, children prefer it.  Adults often choose exotic Mediterranean dishes.  Cooking enthusiasts buy products at the nearby Plus supermarket (recall that each hotel room has a small kitchen).  A wide range of fruits and vegetables are offered at nearby fruit shops.

    <p>  A kilometer from the hotel, on the coast, is its beach.  He is not big.  When it works hotel bar.  However, the undoubted advantage of the Evabelle Napa Apts 4 hotel is its 15-minute proximity to the world famous Nissi Beach.  This is the best beach in Cyprus. </p><p>  It is like a white ribbon (the sand of the beach differs in just such a color), stretches along the coast for 2 km.  Guests of Cyprus are eager to get here.  The crystal clear sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach in this white frame creates a memorable impression.  The entrance fee to the beach is 2.5 ‚Ç¨, and the price for using a shower is 1 ‚Ç¨. </p><p>  Nissi Beach itself is divided into separate segments equipped with sun loungers with umbrellas, each with its own infrastructure, including very attractive bars. </p><h2>  Foamy discos - the pride of Ayia Napa </h2><p>  There is always a lot of music and light.  The best local and visiting DJs and animators support the special bright and attractive aura of this beach </p><p>  And Nissi Beach is a famous place where foam discos are held.  Such parties are very original.  People dance waist-high in foam, flying out of special installations in abundance.  The atmosphere of universal fun, carefree, flirting reigns.  Young people feel in such an environment as a fish in the water.  Perhaps that is why most visitors to Evabelle Napa Apartments 4 are regulars on this beach.  Although some vacationers who value silence prefer a small, calm hotel beach, located 500 meters away. </p><h2>  Diving </h2>

    <p>  In Cyprus, vacationers have the opportunity to join the diving.  The uniquely transparent Mediterranean Sea allows you to view the water column to a great depth!  The Ayia Napa area (close to the hotel) has numerous private diving clubs.  Russian-speaking instructors conduct thematic courses for beginners, practically practicing scuba diving, breathing under water, diving skills, diving in the sea, actions in various situations, overcoming the risks of diving.  For experienced divers, more specialized training is provided for various types of diving: from a boat, to sunken objects, night <span>dives, deep sea diving,</span> professional underwater photography. </p><h2>  Outdoor activities </h2><p>  It is unlikely that you will find a person in Cyprus disputing that the sea is the main component of this resort holiday.  However, for many vacationers, the therapeutic effect on the body of the sun, air and water is organically supplemented by moderate physical activity, for which the hotel has its own infrastructure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="evabelle napa apts class a 4 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/472609.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Aparthotel guests like Evabelle Apartment Ayia Napa 4 are free to choose from for guided tours.  There are many offers.  In particular, guests of Ayia Napa visit historical sites: a local monastery built in the 16th century.  The strange ghost town of Famagusta, left by the inhabitants more than thirty years ago, does not go unnoticed.  Excursions to the ancient city of Salamina are popular.  The monasteries in the Troodos mountains enjoy success, the trained family dolphins of the Marine Park are a hit of family excursions.  The local water park, equipped with many attractions, is in demand by young people. </p><p>  All of the above tours take place directly in the Ayia Napa region, that is, near the Evabelle Napa Apts Class A 4 hotel. Cyprus, being a fairly compact island, has much greater sightseeing potential.  Of particular interest to tourists are Paphos (the place where, according to legend, Aphrodite was born), the remains of the Greek-Roman amphitheater near Limassol, the palaces and cathedrals of Nicosia, the lace industry of the village of Lefkara, famous throughout the world. </p><h2>  Ayia Napa Clubs </h2><p>  The impression of being in Ayia Napa will be incomplete without the impressions of the club life of the ‚Äúsecond Ibiza‚Äù.  The summer castle club is impressive with 3 dance floors and 14 bars.  World famous DJs work here.  Fans of discos of the 70s and 80s prefer the Carwash club, which is quite stylish and in demand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="evabelle napa apts class a 4 cyprus" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/472727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Music in the style of soul, swing and R&amp;B is typical for the stylish club "Black and White" (Black and White).  River Reggae Club also specializes in reggae and hardcore styles.  Foam parties and a stunning light show - these are the "chips" of the Ice Club. </p><p>  It is in such institutions that young people who come to Evabelle Napa Apts Class A 4 every year hang out. Reviews about the rest in Cyprus of such young people for the most part relish the impressions of the club life. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The compact apart-hotel considered by us promises for its guests the possibility of an inexpensive and quality vacation.  Its proximity to both the famous Nissi Beach and world famous resort nightlife centers is a know-how that attracts a steady stream of guests.  Perhaps that is why the hotel evaluates youth most positively.  Middle-aged and older people are more critical.  ‚ÄúIt could have been better!‚Äù  they think. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="evabelle napa apts class a 4" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/472732.jpg" width="600"></div>
