    <p>  First, the child should be asked to choose exactly what leaves he wants to make for the exhibition.  Think about how they will be related.  These can be garlands that can be hung on the curtains in the group room, or you can make wreaths by fastening them together. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then the child must draw the contours on a sheet of cardboard and cut out the stencil.  Further along the stencil, the contours on the felt sheet are outlined.  Then you need to cut each leaf carefully with sharp scissors separately.  They can be sewn onto a garland or tied to a string. </p><h2>  Autumn tree </h2><p>  Another interesting option for making autumn crafts from felt to kindergarten is a big picture.  On a sheet of whatman paper you need to glue a tree trunk and twigs cut from felt.  Next, the work on the manufacture of leaflets described earlier is performed. </p>

    <p>  Then, using glue, you need to attach the leaves on the tree, placing them beautifully so that on each branch there are colorful leaves of autumn flowers.  It can be green, and yellow, and orange.  The picture is colorful and will attract the attention of all visitors to the exhibition. </p><h2>  Oak fruits </h2><p>  As autumn crafts from felt, you can make beautiful wavy oak leaves and attach the fruits of this tree to them.  It is convenient to make the leaves according to the template, cutting it out of paper, but for the manufacture of acorns you will need to buy a filler.  It can be simple vata or synthetic winterizer.  Take a piece of filler and roll a tight ball out of it.  Next, you need to take a felt of light green color and wrap it around the cotton wool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the resulting ball of felt material, you need to tie a knot with threads, and cut off the excess material with scissors.  Then the same thing is done for the acorn head.  The only thing that makes a hat different from the acorn itself is that the hat should not be rolled out with a ball, but flattened to make a ‚Äúpancake‚Äù.  At the end, the hat is sewn to the acorn itself so that the seams are inside the product.  Outside, they should not be visible. </p><p>  For autumn crafts in the garden of felt, you can make several branches of oak with two or three leaves, on which to sew two acorns.  Make one big and the other smaller. </p><h2>  Mushrooms in a basket </h2><p>  Everyone knows that autumn is a mushroom season.  So, if a child wants to perform autumn crafts made of felt in the form of mushrooms, this is quite suitable for the exhibition.  Mushrooms can be stacked in a small basket, "collecting" in the forest various species.  For example, mushrooms and boletus will look beautiful.  The legs can be made of white felt, and the hats are made of brown and red or pink material.  You can add champignons.  These are porcini mushrooms with a brown bottom of the hat. </p>

    <p>  To make the legs, rectangles are cut out in which the width is equal to the thickness of the leg and the length is its height.  Next, the rectangle needs to be sewn, and into the resulting pipe, push cotton wool or synthetic winterizer.  The bottom of the mushroom is sutured.  Next begins work on the hat.  To do this, cut two circles.  One white is the bottom of the hat.  And the other - color - the upper part.  It should be more than a white circle.  Cotton wool is placed on a white circle, covering the entire surface of the lower part.  We put a brown or red circle on top and sew both sides.  It remains only to connect the leg and the hat.  You need to make several such autumn crafts from felt to fill the space of the basket. </p><h2>  Carrots </h2><p>  Autumn is the time for harvesting in gardens and kindergartens, so it would be logical to make crafts for vegetables, such as carrots, at the kindergarten exhibition.  You will need a felt of two colors: orange and green.  First you need to draw a pattern of carrots.  To do this, you can first draw a rectangle of the desired length, and then the upper corners of it a little distance from the main sides at an equal distance.  Get a trapezoid.  Then the two sides are sewn together, forming a cone.  It is necessary to push the filler with the help of improvised material into it.  You can use a pencil. </p>

    <p>  The bottom hole of the cone is sutured, while the top is not yet.  First you need to cut out the template by drawing a carved leaf on cardboard.  Then you need to circle it on a green sheet of felt and cut along the contour.  So make a few leaflets.  Then the whole bunch of greens should be inserted into the upper hole of the carrot cone.  Only now the top of the cone is carefully sewn up.  For beauty, you can use a marker to draw strips on carrots or small dashed lines, as on a real vegetable.  All autumn crafts made of felt, made with your own hands, are ready! </p><h2>  Vegetables </h2><p>  In the store you can buy sheets of felt of any color, so you can make not only carrots, but also other vegetables.  For example, consider cabbage, eggplant, artichoke.  This is quite difficult to make crafts, so that mothers can help children by flashing parts on a sewing machine. </p><p>  For the manufacture of autumn crafts in kindergarten felt vegetables are very welcome.  It is easy to make cabbage, just roll a large ball of filler and light green felt.  To make it look like folded sheets, in the middle you can make several seams in random order.  Top sheets do this.  You need to cut a large circle of felt and wrap them in a finished ball of cabbage.  Leaving a small shuttlecock not sewn on, the rest of the circle is outlined with stitches. </p>

    <p>  The artichoke is made from the main part and leaflets.  First, the material is rolled around a filler cone.  Then round leaves are cut out and glued or sewn around the cone in a checkerboard pattern. </p><p>  Eggplant is made on the principle of carrots, only instead of a trapezoid draw rounded sides.  You need to draw eggplant on cardboard, and then draw the contours on the felt yellow or purple.  Make the tail green. </p><h2>  The apples </h2><p>  Apples can be the last variant of autumn crafts made from felt, made by oneself.  You can make them voluminous, or you can cut them, as in the photo below.  To do this, buy red or yellow felt, white for the middle, green for the leaf and brown for the stick. </p>

    <p>  According to the pattern, identical apple shapes are cut out.  Of red matter of a larger size, of white felt - of a smaller one.  White felt is sewn on top of red.  There are seeds in the middle of the apple.  They can be cut out of brown felt and glued in the middle.  Then a leaf and a thin stick are cut out.  All this is sewn with threads in the upper recess of the apple. </p><p>  Thus, you can perform any fruit: pear, plum, quince.  There are a lot of grapes in autumn.  Make it easy too.  Create and fantasize, because with felt it's easy and simple! </p>
