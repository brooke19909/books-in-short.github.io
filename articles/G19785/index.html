But for this you need to use data transfer.  And this, in turn, requires additional knowledge from the user.  For example, how to connect a smartphone to a computer. </p><h2>  For what? </h2><p>  Cloud storage is actively gaining popularity.  Thanks to them, you can quickly transfer files to the server and have access to them from any device.  But not everyone trusts such methods, and many simply do not know how to use the cloud.  Therefore, they prefer to transfer files from the phone directly. </p><p>  But you can connect a smartphone to a computer not only for data transfer.  Many people know that thanks to this, the device receives a certain charge and can recharge the battery.  And although the phone is charging in this way much slower than from an outlet, this option can be useful. </p><p>  Also, the smartphone can be used as a modem.  This option is great for laptops.  If everything is set up correctly, you can secure an Internet connection on your laptop on trips and trips.  The only important thing is the presence of such a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessnewsdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless connection" class="if uuid-3043217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043217.jpg"></div><h2>  How to connect? </h2><p>  To connect a smartphone to a computer, you can use the easiest way - through the USB interface.  To do this, just take the phone itself, the cable that came with it, and also a PC or laptop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is an option to use a wireless connection, for example, Bluetooth.  This option is suitable mainly for laptops, as they always have the appropriate model.  The method can be used for PC only with a bluetooth adapter. </p><p>  Wi-Fi connection is also a good option.  Most often it is used to establish an Internet connection.  But via wireless Internet, you can transfer files from your smartphone.  You just need to install a special program that supports this option. </p><h2>  Classic method </h2><p>  At present, everyone can connect a smartphone to a computer via USB.  In fact, this method is already somewhat outdated.  It requires the installation of drivers, sometimes it encounters errors, and also takes extra time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerrepairslogan.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect smartphone via cable" class="if uuid-3043216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043216.jpg"></div><p>  What are the advantages of this method?  Firstly, if the user is going to transfer large files, then this option is the fastest and most reliable.  The connection can only be disconnected if the cable is disconnected. </p><p>  Secondly, in addition to connecting for data transfer, you can use the smartphone‚Äôs camera separately.  For example, the method is suitable for those who do not have a webcam, but want to use video calling. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thirdly, thanks to the USB connection, you can get to the root folders, as well as use programs for administration.  For example, during a device flashing, only this method will work. </p><p>  There are drawbacks to this option.  For example, at this moment it is practically impossible to use the phone for calls, since it will be in special mode or simply ‚Äútied‚Äù to a PC.  A cable may not always be at hand.  There is a possibility that all USB ports will be busy, so connecting a smartphone to a computer will fail. </p><h2>  USB connection </h2><p>  So, what needs to be done in order to connect a smartphone to a computer?  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to use a cable, phone and PC.  But sometimes the user may run into problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yocore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect the phone via USB" class="if uuid-3043221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043221.jpg"></div><p>  If this is the first connection of a smartphone, then most likely the system will start searching for drivers.  Sometimes she does it herself and automatically installs them.  Or need help.  After you connected the smartphone to the PC, a notification will appear in the lower right corner that the system has started the search for "firewood".  However, she may notify you of the successful completion and installation, and may ask for help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the computer could not install the drivers, you can search them on the Internet.  To do this, you need to enter a smartphone model in the search.  Usually on the official website of the manufacturer there is a database of the necessary files.  It will be enough to download and install them. </p><p>  After connecting the smartphone, the mode selection will appear on the screen: </p><ul><li>  media device - allows transferring files to a PC; </li><li>  camera - transfers only photos; </li><li>  charging - stops all USB functions and starts to recharge the battery; </li><li>  built-in CD-ROM - connects a virtual drive. </li></ul><p>  After selecting all modes except ‚ÄúCharging‚Äù, a new autorun window will appear on the computer screen.  Here you can also select the connection mode: </p><ul><li>  media synchronization; </li><li>  viewing and transferring files; </li><li>  import image and video. </li></ul><p>  If you want to transfer files from a smartphone to a PC, you need to select the ‚ÄúMedia device‚Äù mode on the phone, and enable ‚ÄúView files‚Äù on the PC.  After that, a folder with all the files that are stored on the smartphone, including the system ones, will appear. </p><h2>  Using bluetooth </h2><p>  You can connect your smartphone to a computer using Bluetooth.  For this, the PC must have an appropriate model.  It can be integrated into the motherboard, but most often it needs to be purchased separately.  Since now Bluetooth is losing its popularity, this option for connecting to a PC may be inconvenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect a smartphone via Bluetooth" class="if uuid-3043222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043222.jpg"></div><p>  But in the case of laptops, the method still seems relevant.  Almost all laptops have a Bluetooth module, so you can not search for a cable, but quickly transfer files. </p><h2>  Bluetooth connection </h2><p>  So, in this case, you need to enable the Bluetooth function on both the smartphone and PC.  After you need to run on one of the devices search for connected devices.  Next, you need to connect so that the system remembers the smartphone or PC.  Depending on the version, you may need to enter a passkey.  Usually this should be done once. </p><p>  After that, you can select a file or several on the phone, activate the ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù option in the properties and use Bluetooth.  In the list of connected devices you need to select a laptop and enable the connection. </p><p>  Sometimes the transfer may be canceled if one of the devices does not allow access.  This can be checked in the settings.  If you are afraid that someone else will connect to you, you can give access with a password or for a specified time. </p><h2>  Using Wi-Fi: File Transfer </h2><p>  If you need to connect a computer to the Internet via a smartphone, then this method is suitable.  It is also used for data transmission. </p><p>  Usually all devices are connected to the same network.  This is an important condition in order to get the correct connection.  You need to install a program on your smartphone that allows you to transfer files over Wi-Fi.  You can use the file manager "ES Explorer". </p><p>  You need to run the application and swap to the right.  An additional menu will open, in which you need to find the "Network" item.  Next, select the "Remote Access" section.  On the screen you will need to run the option.  The system will indicate the wireless network to which the smartphone is connected, and below the address at which you can access from a PC. </p><p>  Now you need to use a computer.  We pass to "My computer".  At the top, you can enter the address that is listed on the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect your smartphone via Wi-Fi" class="if uuid-3043225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043225.jpg"></div><p>  It may take a few seconds for the computer to connect to the phone wirelessly.  In a new dialog box, all folders of the smartphone system will appear. </p><h2>  Using Wi-Fi: Modem </h2><p>  How to connect a smartphone to a computer via WiFi, you need to know not only in order to transfer data.  This method will also help provide an Internet connection if one is not. </p><p>  In this case, you need the PC to be connected to a Wi-Fi router or have an appropriate adapter.  You also need to configure the phone to connect. </p><p>  How to connect a smartphone modem to a computer?  Go to the device settings.  Depending on the model of smartphone, you need to find the item ‚ÄúModem and access point‚Äù.  Next, enable access to the mobile network and configure it.  The smartphone model is set as the network name.  Below you need to select the WPA2 PSK and specify a password so that the connection is secure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mi-box.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect your computer to the Internet" class="if uuid-3043227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3043227.jpg"></div><p>  After you need to go to the PC.  In the lower right corner of the panel there is an Internet connection icon.  Opening it, we will see all the wireless networks to which we can connect.  We select the name of the smartphone model, enter the password and use the mobile Internet. </p>
