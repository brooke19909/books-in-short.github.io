  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to invest in a crisis: optimal and risky options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Investments are a guarantee of financial stability, the welfare of modern man.  Money must generate income.  But how to ensure this if the country is in a state of crisis?  Where to invest in a crisis? </p><p>  <strong>Ways to invest</strong> </p><p>  By the method of investing money, three types of people can be distinguished: conservatives, "extremes" and something in between these types.  And if we are talking about a crisis in which the economic situation in the country is unstable and even analysts are not taken to make any forecasts, then it is better to follow the example of conservatives and invest only in reliable sources.  So, let's figure out what can be considered a reliable investment and where to invest in a crisis? </p><p>  <strong>"Eternal values"</strong> </p><p>  You should always invest in "eternal values", but in material terms it is real estate and gold.  It is such property that will always be in value; a fall in prices in this category of investments is not significant.  An apartment, for example, can generate <span>rental income.</span>  And gold can be purchased not only in the form of jewelry, but also <span>anonymized metal</span> bank <span>accounts</span> .  In the latter case, income is generated when the value of gold in the metals market increases.  Such a contribution is considered a more reliable alternative to ‚Äúgames‚Äù in the stock market and is well suited in times of crisis. </p><p>  <strong>Deposits</strong> </p><p>  Where to invest in the crisis, secondarily?  Bank accounts, called deposits, allow you to save and accumulate money.  If you open a deposit without the ability to withdraw money within a year or two, then you will increase your savings by 6% per annum, and in Sberbank of Russia - by 8.5%.  Of course, there are proposals in 13-14%.  Each is worth considering: pay attention to the terms, the possibility of replenishment, the conditions of the deposit and the consequences if you suddenly withdraw money ahead of schedule. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But here another question arises, in what currency should I open an account?  Dollar, euro, rubles - they are constantly changing their value.  Despite the fact that the crisis in the USA has led to a stable <span>growth of the euro</span> and a depreciation of the dollar, the ruble, it is not worth translating all the savings into euro.  Experts advise storing money in deposits in all these currencies, so you reduce losses (somewhere you win, somewhere you lose, and as a result, your savings are saved and increase by the interest rate per annum).  This option is simpler than trying to calculate the benefit: take into account inflation, depreciation and interest rates on deposits in rubles (6%), dollars (2%), euros (3%). </p><p>  Give the bank an order to transfer from your savings account, which receives monthly payments (salary, allowance, pension), an automatically determined amount to a <span>deposit account</span> in the amount of 10% of income.  True, to open an account you will need a significant amount, although banks are ready to open an account for you for 1000 rubles, but then a little will accumulate over the year. </p><p>  <strong>Mutual Investment Funds</strong> </p><p>  "Professional" investors who are used to investing in a promising business project, in developing areas of the country's life <span>(shared construction)</span> will tell you where to invest in the crisis <span>.</span>  Mutual Funds - a common fund of investors, emerged from the same direction.  And with the development of this form of investment, many expert analysts began to equate them with storing money in bank deposits, thus declaring the reliability of mutual funds.  However, investments in mutual funds bring big profits, but at the same time it is a more risky way to invest, especially in a crisis when stocks of funds all fall in price and no one can accurately predict when they will start to grow again.  But ... numerous Internet services on banks' websites help to calculate possible risks, in addition, banks offer the services of their managers to manage your investments on trust.  The minimum contribution to the mutual fund is 15 thousand rubles.  And this means that, if desired, such a method of investing can become available to every Russian. </p><p>  <strong>Securities</strong> </p><p>  A completely different way of investing is in securities (certificates and bills).  Purchased to store savings.  They can be used as collateral for loan obligations.  But if you are looking for where to invest a lot of money so as not to lose it - this is the best option.  You will need the help of a reliable expert in the securities market to figure out which bills or certificates today are ‚Äúin value‚Äù. </p><p>  So we answered the question of where to invest money in the crisis: in things that will always be of value, in deposits of reliable banks with a stable income of 6%, in mutual funds and securities.  Choose what is closer to you ... </p>
