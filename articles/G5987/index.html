You have already come up with a costume, but you have no idea how to make a hat?  Then this article is for you.  We collected six patterns of red hats and added a variant of one costume as a bonus.  Interesting?  Then read the article. </p><h2>  Simple little red riding hood </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/527484175089377474/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Riding Hood Pattern" class="if uuid-2233749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233749.jpg"></div><p>  The headdress of a fairy-tale heroine can be done quickly.  But it is not necessary to make a hat at a time.  After all, if you try, you can sew a hat, in which the daughter will be able to go through more than one season.  Moreover, she will wear a hat with pleasure, because after the matinee she will become almost magical in her childhood imagination.  How to make a hat?  First you need to print a pattern of a red cap.  And do not forget to scale it, based on the parameters of the child‚Äôs head.  Now you should transfer the pattern to the fabric.  You can sew a hat both from natural woolen fabric and from artificial, for example, from fleece.  The headgear can be made monochrome, or the lining can be made of white material. </p><p>  How to sew a red hat with your own hands?  The pattern is transferred to the fabric and all the details are cut out?  Now you should sew the top of the cap and lining one by one.  Sew a rectangle to the side of the headgear, and sew another side to the opposite side of it.  When two parts of the product are ready, you should connect them together.  In order for the cap to be well fixed, you need to sew a button on one part of the headgear and make a hinged loop on the other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hat with zipper </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/381046818457461434/"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY hat pattern for Little Red Riding Hood" class="if uuid-2233754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233754.jpg"></div><p>  To make such a hat even easier than the previous one.  How to sew a hat for a red <span>cap?</span>  <span>The</span> product <span>pattern</span> is attached above.  It needs to be cut and adjusted to the dimensions of the child.  Such a hat is made without lining, so immediately you need to choose a dense fabric.  But this only applies if you plan to make a hat for walking along the street.  If the headpiece is done at once for the matinee, you can choose a beautiful and delicate material, for example, satin. </p><p>  Did you print and cut out the pattern of the red cap?  Now you can start collecting the product.  Sew on a button to the two sides of the workpiece, and then fasten them with threads or ribbons.  Detailed instructions are given above. </p><h2>  Bonnet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/699113542124935070/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of a red cap for a girl" class="if uuid-2233760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233760.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of the red cap may not be quite standard, and even old-fashioned.  And why not actually send the fairy-tale heroine to the past centuries, when the girls wore bonnets?  The daughter will only be glad of such a transformation.  How to sew an extravagant headpiece?  The first step is to print the pattern.  Now 6 parts need to be cut out of red fabric.  Then we sew them one by one.  First you need to assemble the occipital part.  To better keep it on your head, you should insert an elastic band.  Now you need to make the edging.  We sew the parts in pairs, and then attach to the edge of the finished base.  To make the headdress look prettier, you can trim the edge of the bonnet with beautiful braid or thin lace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Warm red hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/511299363930092239/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hats pattern" class="if uuid-2233770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233770.jpg"></div><p>  Such a headdress will not be very appropriate to look at the matinee, but for everyday wear it is perfect.  Above is the <span>pattern of the cap</span> for the red cap.  With your own hands, such a hat will be easy to build.  We print out the pattern and scale it.  Now you need to take artificial or real fur.  If you found red material - good, but if not, then you should not worry.  The fur is well tinted with fabric dyes.  You can repaint both the finished product and the material itself before you start cutting it. </p><p>  Transfer the outline from the paper pattern to the fur, cut out the details.  It is advisable to sew a hat on the lining.  So it will be warmer, and the headdress will look prettier.  First you need to grind the upper parts, and then sew the blanks of the cap together.  The finished product can be decorated with a pompom and ties. </p><h2>  Town hat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/397090892128308249/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a red hat" class="if uuid-2233775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233775.jpg"></div><p>  Above we talked about how to sew a cap, now it‚Äôs the turn to tell how to make a headdress for a city dweller of the XIX century.  Above you will find a pattern for the Little Red Riding Hood.  Do it yourself will be able to make such a product not only by an experienced craftswoman, but also by a beginner needlewoman.  We print out the pattern and scale it.  To sew such a hat is best from a beautiful smooth fabric, for example, from satin.  We cut out the details from the fabric, and then duplicate the bottom and the margins from cardboard.  What for?  To better keep the headgear in shape.  Glue the blanks to the cardboard.  Now you can sew a hat.  Sew on the tulle to the bottom, and then we attach fields to it.  To make the hat more decorative, you can decorate it with lace, ribbons or flowers. </p><h2>  Hood </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/473159504581143118/"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew a hat for Little Red Riding Hood" class="if uuid-2233779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233779.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to make a hat for Little Red Riding Hood is to copy it from a Disney movie.  Probably everyone remembers that there the main character walked in a cloak with a hood.  But after all, a head-cover can also be sewn separately, without a cloak.  The pattern of a red cap for a girl of such a plan is attached above.  You should print the picture and fit it to the dimensions of the child's head.  The coquette is done at will.  If you do not plan to attach the hood to the clothes, then you need to make a decorative overlay on the bottom, otherwise the headdress will look unfinished.  We cut out the details from red fabric.  Optionally, you can cut and lining.  Now you should sew the two parts of the hood together.  If you made a lining, we sharpen it.  If the headgear is unlined, then the edges of the product should be sharpened.  We pass to the coquette.  Sew it to the bottom of the hood on both sides.  You can decorate this element with buttons or beautiful ribbons. </p><h2>  Little Red Riding Hood Costume </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/500955158538171618/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Costume pattern for a girl" class="if uuid-2233801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233801.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to collect a daughter for a matinee is to make her an image from a cloak.  Little Red Riding Hood is just that character to whom the cloak is very suitable.  How to sew a hood we told in the previous paragraph, and now we will tell you how to make the cape itself.  Above you will find a pattern of a costume of Little Red Riding Hood.  Do it yourself even a woman who rarely sits at a sewing machine.  We print a pattern or draw it based on our image. </p><p>  The raincoat must be done on a lining, so there must be two blanks: one will be red and the other can be any color.  Now we cut out the details and sew them together.  A hood should be sewn to the upper edge of the product.  We attach ties to it so that it is easy to fix the cloak on clothes.  Now you can do the decoration of the product.  For example, sew patch pockets and sew a number of buttons.  An elegant dress and black boots or boots can complement this costume.  Do not forget to give your daughter a basket in her hands - an indispensable attribute of any Little Red Riding Hood.  It is not necessary to put pies in it, but still the child will be pleased to find them there. </p>
