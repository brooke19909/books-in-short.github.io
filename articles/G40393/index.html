Hero city, shield city, key city - all this about him, about Smolensk.  The climate here is mild, warm, and therefore the city attracts more and more residents of the northern and distant regions considering the issue of resettlement.  Not all visitors come, the same applies to the residents of Smolensk, they want to live in suburban homes.  Many of them prefer an urban environment with a developed infrastructure.  The city’s developers, given the demand, are offering Lermontov Park in Smolensk, a residential complex designed for a whole microdistrict. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Color scheme" class="if uuid-3170825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3170825.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  A fairly close distance from Smolensk to the capital of the country, the presence of many manufacturing and processing enterprises, good climatic conditions, and a favorable geographical position explain the attractiveness of the city for many people.  The population is growing steadily, and with it the number of new buildings erected. </p><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="smoldaily.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress" class="if uuid-3170834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3170834.jpg"></div><p>  The hillside reliably protects Lermontov Park in Smolensk from the wind and creates a natural fence.  The complex is a whole microdistrict located in the northern part of the city, between the Korolevka and Sitniki districts.  His address is Aviatorov Street and Marshal Eremenko Street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Real estate company </h2><p>  The Garant-Housing company is building the indicated residential complex.  Its history began in 2001, and during its work, this organization has established itself as a reliable developer, fulfilling its obligations.  More than 40 objects have already been commissioned, which is more than 250,000 square meters. </p><p>  Today, this developer leads the construction of new buildings in Smolensk.  This situation is promoted by annual high ratings among city enterprises, participation in Russian and international exhibitions.  The company helps ensure the implementation of federal and regional housing programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Color pleases the eye" class="if uuid-3170835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3170835.jpg"></div><p>  Since 2015, a new project has been launched - the Lermontovsky Park residential complex.  It is attractive to future residents due to its low price: approximately 30,000 rubles per square meter of housing.  The company gives a guarantee for five years on the facility under construction, which provides for the elimination of possible shortcomings within the specified period. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility of the complex </h2><p>  Lermontov Park in Smolensk is located near a major transport highway - Marshal Eremenko Street, along which numerous public transport routes pass.  Departure to this street allows owners of their own cars to quickly and easily get to the city center or to any of its areas.  Travel time to the city center will not take more than twenty minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="smoldaily.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great choice" class="if uuid-3170837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3170837.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure internal and external </h2><p>  The project LK “Lermontov Park” involves the construction of 14 ten-story houses, the facades of which will be made in a single bright color style.  All houses are planned panel, with individual heating, which will not depend on the central boiler rooms.  In the premises, double-circuit boilers are installed, allowing residents to regulate the temperature of heating the water and premises themselves. </p><p>  In the apartments of the complex, the developer decided not to finish the job in order to save the strength and resources of future residents on its dismantling.  After all, everyone will still make repairs in accordance with their taste and budget.  The cost of an apartment with this option is much cheaper than with a finished finish. </p><p>  The courtyard area will be landscaped and landscaped, park zones will be created.  For the convenience of persons with disabilities, the entrances are equipped with ramps.  Children will be able to play in new playgrounds and sports fields, basketball and soccer fields.  There are even tennis tables for ping-pong fans.  Owners of their own cars will be able to leave them in spacious house parking lots. </p><p>  Little residents of Lermontov Park in Smolensk will be able to go to kindergarten, built on the territory of the residential complex.  And their parents - to get everything they need in their own shopping center. </p><p>  While the microdistrict is under construction, residents of already completed houses will be able to take advantage of the nearest infrastructure facilities located within walking distance from the complex.  This applies to schools, kindergartens, shops and shopping centers, clinics, which are a sufficient number nearby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Already built house" class="if uuid-3170861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3170861.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about the residential complex </h2><p>  To date, two houses have already been commissioned, commissioned and settled.  The final construction period is 2021.  The first reviews of residents of the complex are already appearing on the Global Network.  These are mostly positive reviews.  People like the location of the residential complex, its location in an area with clean ecology.  An important role is played in the general mood and the above good transport accessibility.  The road - Marshal Eremenko Street - is free to travel at almost any time of the day.  The number of parking spaces in the yards pleases car owners and guests of the complex. </p><p>  Some negative reviews are related to the incompleteness of construction and the fact that currently there are no declared infrastructure facilities directly in it - a kindergarten, a shopping center.  But such objects are being built after the completion of the construction of residential buildings, therefore, these reviews are probably incorrectly called negative.  It is just an expectation. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The Lermontov Park residential complex is an excellent solution for those who choose their own housing in Smolensk or simply want to improve their living conditions.  Being close to the pine forest provides excellent environmental conditions, fresh air and the opportunity to take a walk in the forest and near Soldatsky Lake. </p><p>  This complex is an economical solution for choosing middle-class housing.  You can buy an apartment, not only making the full amount at once, but also using various loans, mortgages.  In connection with the construction of the microdistrict, it is planned to expand traffic flow, create new routes, increase the network of trade and infrastructure facilities. </p>
