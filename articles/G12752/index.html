It is understandable.  The MFP combines three devices: a printer, a scanner, and a copier.  That is, this device can not only print.  This is what attracts users.  Epson Expression Home XP-342 Inkjet MFP, reviews of which we will consider a little later, is one of the most prominent representatives of the class.  This device can even print in color and is excellent for printing photos.  However, first things first.  First, a few words about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mercedesamgf1.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 reviews" class="if uuid-2978826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978826.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about Epson </h2><p>  Seiko Epson Corporation was founded in 1881 in Japan.  At first, she did not produce anything and was engaged exclusively in the sale of watches.  In 1912, its own watch division was created.  Japanese watches were appreciated all over the world.  During World War II, watch production in Japan slowed.  At that time, watch mechanisms for bombs and mines were much more valued.  The company was able to achieve the pre-war level of sales only in the second half of the fifties. </p><p>  The world's first mini-printer was launched by the company in 1968.  In the same year, their mass production began.  From that moment began the history of the company as a manufacturer of printing devices.  Epson has brought a lot to this industry.  To this day, Epson products are considered the highest quality.  Proof of this can serve as a share in the market of office peripherals.  That's how the watch company has grown into a major supplier of office equipment.  But the company's products are widely used at home.  For example, the <span>Epson</span> Expression Home XP 342 <span>printer.</span> Let's begin to consider this model in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.epson.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 ink" class="if uuid-2977670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2977670.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  This multifunction device is delivered in a box of recycled cardboard.  At the most noticeable place is a colorful image of the MFP itself and the company logo.  The main technical characteristics of the product are printed on the side walls of the box in small print. </p><p>  Inside, everything is Spartan simple: a disk with original drivers and other necessary software, Epson Expression Home XP 342 itself, an instruction manual and a warranty card.  All.  There is not even a cable to connect to a computer.  This move of the company is generally incomprehensible.  Apparently, they are hoping that everyone will use Wi-Fi.  No matter how.  Speaking of instructions.  The latter is executed quite qualitatively.  Translation into Russian is by no means a curve.  Yes, and in the instruction itself, almost everything is painted.  To the smallest detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 cartridge" class="if uuid-2977672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2977672.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  So, what about the appearance of this multifunctional device?  The device looks stylish and strict.  Matte plastic alternates with glossy, and this gives the device a rather interesting look.  On the front panel (which is highlighted separately) is a color LCD screen and printer controls.  Everything is done in a minimalist style.  Therefore, even a child will understand the management.  The top panel is the scanner cover.  It is made of high quality plastic.  Also in front there is a special slot for mini-SD memory cards.  Direct printing supported.  On the back wall there are connectors for connecting to a computer and an electrical network.  In general, the Epson Expression Home XP 342, the review of which we started here, looks pretty impressive.  However, the time has come to consider the main technical characteristics of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="digitalpromo.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 printer" class="if uuid-2977674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2977674.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  What is interesting in this multifunctional device?  So, the device is based on inkjet technology and uses four-color cartridges for this process.  The MFP also has a Wi-Fi transmitter and the ability to directly print from a smartphone or tablet.  Connection to a PC is carried out using a USB cable or Wi-Fi transmitter.  Epson Expression Home XP 342, reviews of which we will discuss a bit later, also supports the inclusion of a continuous ink supply system.  Without it, paint consumption is not entirely acceptable.  But to activate this option, in no case should you update the driver for the device.  Otherwise, the firmware of the multifunction device is updated.  And it already prohibits the inclusion of CISS.  One has to be careful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.epson.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 driver" class="if uuid-2977678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2977678.jpg"></div><h2>  Printing Features </h2><p>  So, what offers the user Epson Expression Home XP 342, the characteristics of which we are analyzing here, in terms of printing?  A piezoelectric head is used as a printing element.  On the one hand, this has a positive effect on quality.  But on the other hand, it can lead to problems if non-original cartridges are used.  Monochrome print speed is 33 pages per minute.  For an inkjet printer, this is a great result.  Only a laser printer prints faster.  But there a completely different technology is used.  Color images are printed at a speed of 15 sheets per minute.  The size of the drop is only 3 pl.  This means that it is impossible to consider individual drops on the finished printout without a special device.  And this cannot but rejoice.  Now consider some other features of the multifunction device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 instruction" class="if uuid-2978326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978326.jpg"></div><h2>  Scanner features </h2><p>  Now let's turn to the scanner of the multifunction device Epson Expression Home XP 342, reviews of which we will analyze in the following chapters.  The scanning element has a tablet architecture and is based on the CIS sensor.  This allows you to quickly and accurately scan images of any degree of complexity.  The maximum resolution of the scanner is 5700 by 1470 pixels.  This is a great result for a budget device.  Many owners of this MFP note that the scanner quickly copes even with complex images.  In this case, the depth of the flowers practically does not suffer. </p><p>  And many are happy that with the help of this scanner the multifunction device can be used as a copier.  Without connecting to a computer.  And it is really impressive.  More recently, this option was the destiny of powerful professional machines.  However, let's move on to other features of the Epson Expression Home XP 342. The cartridge, for example, is worth a separate mention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ciberdirect.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="epson expression home xp 342 specifications" class="if uuid-2978323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2978323.jpg"></div><h2>  Cartridge Features </h2><p>  This multifunctional device is equipped with original Epson cartridges in the factory.  And the IFIs will be great at printing as long as they stand there.  However, it is worth replacing them with cheaper options, as print quality will drop dramatically.  Moreover, various artifacts in the form of smeared drops will be noticeable on the prints.  And if you try to fill in the ink yourself in Epson Expression Home XP 342, the result will be even worse. </p><p>  This device simply does not tolerate supplies that are not certified by Epson.  This is a peculiar method of dealing with non-original consumables.  Say, use the original ones.  No problem.  If only they had reduced the price to adequate. </p><p>  A separate story with <span>the continuous ink supply system.</span>  There is no original module of such a plan.  I have to put a third-party.  But in this case, print quality falls below the plinth.  And the original cartridges do not help.  With the CISS installed in Epson Expression Home XP 342, ink can spill directly onto the paper, leaving blots and streaks there.  Well, who needs this?  And without CISS, the cartridges are depleted after a couple of days.  So users have a difficult choice: to use the printer for a long time, but to be horrified by the quality of prints, or to use a little, but enjoy the picture. </p><h2>  Features of connection interfaces </h2><p>  This multifunctional device can be connected to a computer in several ways at once: using a standard wired connection and using a Wi-Fi transmitter.  Apparently, the manufacturer relied more on the second, since there is no classic USB cable in the package. </p><p>  But it is worth considering that the wireless connection is extremely unstable.  This is such a feature of Epson Expression Home XP 342. The drivers that come with the device on the bundled disk will not work properly until you update them.  But in this way, it is possible to lose the ability to install the CISS module, since the firmware of the device can also be updated.  What is interesting: direct printing from a smartphone and tablet occurs without any problems, even without drivers.  Apparently, the manufacturer also made a bunch of errors in the firmware of the multifunctional device. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  And now it's time to consider the reviews of those who have already managed to acquire this miracle of engineering.  It is worth noting immediately that the reviews are mixed.  Positive and negative among them are approximately equally divided.  But we will start with the positive. </p><p>  Many owners of this device note that the multifunction device provides incredibly high print quality.  A bit strange.  Apparently, those who use original cartridges wrote this.  Only with them the print quality does not deteriorate.  Also, users note that black and white pages are issued at a very high speed.  But this is the perfect truth.  Only laser models work faster than this printer.  The device‚Äôs scanner was especially praised by users.  It is he who makes the device multifunctional.  And it is he who makes it possible to use the device as a copier (copier). </p><p>  Individual owners can not get enough of the built-in Wi-Fi-transmitter.  It allows you to directly print directly from your smartphone or tablet.  This option is very useful.  And the MFP can directly print from a USB flash drive.  Without using a computer.  Almost all users (even those who left a negative comment) note the high quality of assembly and materials.  And indeed it is.  Still, Epson.  Japanese quality. </p><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  And now the opinions of those who for some reason were disappointed by this multifunction device.  And there are quite a few of them.  The first thing that upset the owners was the inability to use third-party cartridges.  This is really not good.  That is, you can use them, but the quality of the image on the printout will be disgusting. </p><p>  The second problem that was discovered by the owners is related to the notorious CISS.  Many have noticed that after installing this module, Epson Expression Home XP 342 prints in red.  This means that the diaper of the printer is clogged to the very top.  You need to either drop it yourself (which is not easy), or carry the MFP in the service.  By the way, after installing the CISS, many noticed that all images are printed with a green tint.  This is the feature of this multifunctional device.  It does not tolerate non-original components.  And it just infuriates many.  Still would.  After all, this completely and completely blocks the ability to print normally when using third-party components. </p><p>  The notorious Wi-Fi transmitter also received unfavorable comments.  The connection is extremely unstable.  The multifunction device is constantly losing sight of the computer.  But with smartphones it works fine.  In any case, users have to look for a USB cable, as it is not included in the package. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So what can be said about this printer?  Is it worth recommending it for purchase?  This is a very interesting question and needs to be answered.  So to speak.  If you plan to use exclusively original consumables with this multifunction device, then it is definitely worth buying.  The quality of the printed material will be at the highest level.  If you want to somehow customize the device, use cheaper cartridges or install a CISS system, then it is better to choose a less capricious model, since nothing good will come of it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the color inkjet multifunctional device Epson Expression Home XP 342. Reviews of this device do not give a definite answer to the question of whether this is a good purchase or not.  Nevertheless, its price is such that for such money it is difficult to purchase anything with the same characteristics.  And if the MFP has some shortcomings, then they are leveled precisely by the cost. </p>
