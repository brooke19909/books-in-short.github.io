If you like Turkish beauty, then you can recommend to go to Sorgun.  Perhaps the name of the village itself will not tell you anything, but it is part of the famous Side.  The main feature of the small resort is its beautiful nature.

The hotel complex consists of a number of five- and two-story buildings. </p>

    <p>  The entire resort is surrounded by pine forests.  The cleanest air, sea breeze, the aroma of pine needles - all this creates a special atmosphere.  In addition, a huge advantage is the absence of noise from nightlife.  But at the same time, the village is located near Side. </p><p>  Sorgun is incredibly popular for families with children.  Many hotels have all the necessary conditions for kids: water parks, attractions, playgrounds.  The coast seems to be created for children in the village, it is gentle and very comfortable, so parents can not worry about their children. </p><p>  But shopping lovers in Sorgun can not find a decent lesson.  There are no shopping centers, and local shops are not of interest.  Therefore, shopping is worth going to Side, which is famous for its retail space. </p><p>  The sea coast in Sorgun stretches for three kilometers.  Local beaches have a sand and pebble coating.  Some hotels have built platforms for their guests to descend into the water.  The beaches of the resort are very gentle and comfortable for swimming.  The only moment is that not everywhere there is sand, in some places there is small pebble.  You can go snorkelling and diving in Sorgun. </p><p>  Almost all the entertainment is in the hotels themselves and in their territories.  Guests can also enjoy horse riding or jeep safari.  There are no significant sights in the village.  But the rest in Sorgun is filled with tranquility and peace.  If you belong to the category of tourists who like to see the sights, then you should go to the ancient city of Side.  The journey takes only twenty minutes. </p><p>  Sorgun is an incredibly beautiful place, it is surrounded by coniferous forest.  Therefore, there is always clean air, which is filled not only with coniferous aromas, but also with sea breezes. </p>

    <p>  The climate of the village belongs to the Mediterranean, so the holiday season here lasts from March to October.  Forests reliably protect the village from the winds, so the sea here is almost always calm.  From May to October, the water temperature ranges from +22 ... + 27 degrees, so at this time it is very comfortable to swim. </p><h2>  Photos and reviews about Blue Waters Club Resort 5 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of those vacationers who managed to visit it.  Numerous positive reviews give reason to recommend the institution only from the best side.  It is difficult to find such a complex, which would have been written so many kind words. </p><p>  The Blue Waters Club Resort is located on the coast and has a very large territory, which is surrounded by greenery and very reasonably thought out.  The hotel complex consists of a number of buildings that are in the shade of trees.  Which building to choose for your stay is up to you.  However, according to guests, any bungalow is convenient, you can also book apartments in the main building.  Many tourists are wondering which room is better at Blue Waters Club Resort 5 *?  Guest reviews are equally good about all apartments, but all experienced travelers recommend taking family apartments that are equipped with several separate bedrooms, separated by a living room.  This number is simply indispensable for a large family.  Children have their own separate room and private bathroom.  Since the schedules of parents and their children are different, adults can spend time in the living room or on the large terrace.  In general, absolutely all apartments are good.  Club bungalows on the territory is a place where silence and tranquility reign, although the main building is not noisy.  It is worth noting that the hotel rooms have very good sound insulation, so you can sleep at any time of the day, and even in the morning you do not wake up from the sounds from the corridor. </p>

    <p>  The hotel complex is located in a stunningly beautiful place, which is simply immersed in the greenery of coniferous and exotic plants.  The spacious area is beautifully decorated and very well maintained.  It can be seen that it is constantly cleaned and taken care of by plants. </p><p>  Special attention should be paid to the swimming pools of the complex, equipped with children's and adult slides.  Near each reservoir there is a recreation area.  The pools are kept clean and even take water samples.  The territory of the complex can be safely called shady, due to which there is absolutely no feeling of heat. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend visiting the spa, where you can really relax, and at this time send the children to have fun in the mini club.  The work of the animators deserves all praise.  Activities skillfully occupy children of all ages.  And animators do not forget about adults.  Sports activities, games and entertainment throughout the day will not let even the most active tourists relax.  And the evening program is always filled with bright and colorful performances, in which not only local, but also invited artists take part. </p><p>  The advantages of the hotel include a beautiful beach, located right next to the main building.  Despite the fact that the coast has a beach-pebble coating, there are practically no pebbles on the beach.  Pleasant fine sand pleases not only adults, but also kids who like to poke around in it.  There is a bar on the beach that serves fine drinks.  The sea off the coast of the resort is clean and almost always calm, because forests protect the village from the winds.  The best place to stay is simply not to be found. </p>
