    <p>  In the northernmost part of the capital, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe River Station, there is a beautiful <span>Park River Station park.</span>  Friendship <span>Park</span> is located in the immediate vicinity.  These two places for recreation represent a single forest park zone, which is located on the east coast of the Khimki reservoir and is divided into two parts by the Leningrad highway.  Before starting a walk in these parks, it is recommended to inspect the River Station itself, the building of which is built in the form of a large ship.  Fountains South and North are installed on the station's terraces, which symbolize the connection of the waterways of these continents in Moscow. </p><p>  A small park adjoins the station building with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 hectares.  It is decorated with unique chimes installed in the tower of the station after they were brought from the Resurrection Cathedral.  This is the River Station Park.  Friendship Park is located on the territory of the Left Bank region of the northern part of Moscow.  Its area is 51 ha.  For vacationers, there are all conditions for a safe and comfortable family vacation.  The territory is equipped with many playgrounds, there is a large sports field.  Alternatively, take a stroll around the neatly equipped ponds.  An amusement park is open daily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="friendship park at the river station" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/269463.jpg" width="600"></div>

Friendship Park and its <span>interesting places</span> will be left for later, as it is located a little further. </p><p>  At the entrance there is a white stone sculpture representing a woman who holds a sailboat in her hands raised above her head.  Cast iron anchors are installed on both sides of the entrance.  The fence of the park itself, established in 1937, is of architectural value.  Children's attractions are located on the left side and are surrounded by tall trees that create shade on summer days.  Here, on one of the alleys, a small fountain is installed, which brings freshness to the general atmosphere of this site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="friendship park photo" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/269460.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  After the territory is fully explored, we leave the River Station Park.  Friendship Park is the next destination.  After exiting, you must go through the <span>underpass.</span> </p><p>  One of the attractions is the sculpture of a rider.  This is a monument to Manas the Magnanimous, mounted on a hill.  An interesting monument of red granite with a beautiful inscription, which is located in the depths of the park.  In addition, the sculpture of the Spanish writer Megel de Sarvantes Saavedra is also installed in the Friendship Park.  For those who don‚Äôt know, he was the author of the famous Don Quixote novel. </p><p>  The Friendship Park at the River Station is famous for other monuments, including a three-woman sculptural composition, installed near the monument to Sarvantes.  Closer to the Leningrad highway, between the birches, there is a small granite stele.  In the depths of the park rises a pedestal of yellow stone.  A little further there is a monument donated by India.  He depicts a man with a long beard, in a robe to the heels. </p><p>  Another attraction adorning the Friendship Park, a photo of which is presented here - Festival Ponds.  In fact, this is one body of water, since the ponds are interconnected by narrow isthmuses.  This is a pretty picturesque place.  In addition, the park has a rainbow circus tent. </p>
