  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to disable "Mobile Bank": the main ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank card holders have the opportunity to use the Mobile Banking SMS informing service.  The service allows you to receive information on the card account, pay for goods and services, send transfers to relatives and friends, and is also a safe means of confirming transactions in the Internet bank.  A full fee for the Mobile Bank is charged.  If the client does not want to pay for using the service, he must know how to disable the Mobile Bank. </p><h2>  Information about the Mobile Bank service </h2><p>  Sberbank‚Äôs service is a service that provides customers with access to account management by sending SMS notifications.  Mobile Bank operates under two tariffs: </p><ul><li>  <em>Economical.</em>  This is a free version.  It includes the ability to receive codes from Sberbank Online, sending transfers, replenishing the balance of your mobile, paying for utilities and the Internet. </li><li>  <em>Full.</em>  In addition to the possibilities of the "Economical" tariff, in the full version of the service, the client receives notifications of income-bearing transactions from the card online.  This is a paid rate.  Cost - 30 or 60 rubles per month.  Depends on the type of card. </li></ul><p>  At any time, the client can change or disable the service.  The change and deactivation of the service occurs within 24 hours from the moment of sending the request to the bank.  When connecting the full tariff for the first 2 months, the client can use the "Mobile Bank" for free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abbyy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable mobile bank" class="if uuid-2921043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921043.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get rid of paid SMS? </h2><p>  The main reason why customers want to know how to disable Mobile Bank is the need to pay a full monthly rate.  Contrary to the opinion of some users, Mobile Bank does not turn off, even if the funds on the card are not enough to charge a commission. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the absence of funds on a bank card, the service is suspended, but after replenishment of the balance it becomes active again, and a monthly service fee is deducted from the card account. </p><p>  There are several options on how to disable Mobile Banking: </p><ol><li>  Come to the bank office with a passport. </li><li>  Call customer service. </li><li>  Block the service by the number "900". </li><li>  Change the tariff to "Economy". </li></ol><h2>  Deactivation of a service at a branch of Sberbank </h2><p>  Most customers prefer to solve problems at the bank‚Äôs office by contacting a branch employee.  The presence of the largest branch network in Russia allows bank cardholders to choose a branch of Sberbank near their home or work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank personal account disable mobile bank" class="if uuid-2921055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921055.jpg"></div><p>  How to disable "Mobile Bank" through Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  Choose a branch convenient for visiting. </li><li>  Take along your passport and card. </li><li>  Take the ticket using the electronic queue or contact the first free window (if there is none). </li><li>  Give the operator a personal identification document and a bank card to which the number is attached, dictate a mobile phone. </li><li>  Check the application to disable the service and sign it if the information is correct. </li></ol><p>  Banking operation takes no more than 10 minutes.  After signing the application, the service will be disabled within 24 hours.  The client can disconnect one or several numbers from different cards at the same time.  Disconnection is carried out without commission. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Call to the contact center of Sberbank </h2><p>  Another option on how to disable Mobile Bank is to call the company‚Äôs support service.  Sberbank has 2 free lines for individuals.  Numbers are indicated on the back of any bank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank mobile bank" class="if uuid-2921059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921059.jpg"></div><p>  When making a call, the client goes through the mandatory identification procedure.  To do this, he must name his F. I. O., address, plastic card number, code word and passport details.  After identification, the cardholder must inform the purpose of the application, as well as the phone number that needs to be untied from the bank card. </p><p>  The service will be disconnected during the day. </p><h2>  Blocking the "Mobile Bank" using the USSD command </h2><p>  The Mobile Bank commands allow the user to temporarily block the service for subsequent disconnection at the bank‚Äôs office or through the support service.  This is the safest and fastest way to block the service if the card was stolen or ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù by an ATM. </p><p>  How to disable "Mobile Bank" via phone: </p><ol><li>  Dial * 900 * 04 # and press the call button. </li><li>  Check the information that will be received in the reply SMS from 900. The message will indicate that the Mobile Bank service is temporarily blocked. </li></ol><p>  If the client wishes to regain access, he must repeat the same command.  SMS alerts will be restored within 24 hours after the request. </p><h2>  Change of the tariff plan to "Economical" </h2><p>  An alternative way to disable Mobile Bank is to switch to a new free tariff.  The option will be relevant for those who check the balance of the card in the terminal or Sberbank Online.  Such customers do not need to pay a fee for using a paid tariff. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable mobile banks" class="if uuid-2921046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921046.jpg"></div><p>  How to disable "Mobile Bank" by switching to a free service: </p><ol><li>  After entering the card and PIN, you must select on the terminal "Information and Services". </li><li>  Next, go to the "Mobile Bank" tab, select the "Connect" section. </li><li>  The next step will be to select the "Economy" tariff, then enter the phone number. </li><li>  After completing all the steps, you need to confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  The tariff plan will be changed within 24 hours from the moment of data entry in the terminal.  The client will receive a check in which the transfer to the "Mobile Bank" savings package will be indicated. </p><h2>  Sberbank Online: is it possible to disable SMS alerts through your personal account? </h2><p>  Customers who regularly use the Internet Bank use SMS alerts to confirm transactions and log into the system.  Active users do not need to connect the full version with paid notifications, so they often ask employees whether it is possible to disable Mobile Bank in Sberbank‚Äôs personal account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smashfreakz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable a mobile bank through sberbank" class="if uuid-2921052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2921052.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, Sberbank Online does not have the opportunity to issue a request to turn off notifications.  But the bank‚Äôs services are regularly updated, expanding opportunities and services for users of plastic cards.  Therefore, it is possible that customers will soon have such an opportunity. </p>
