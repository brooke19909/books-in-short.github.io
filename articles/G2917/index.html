Beautiful parks, ancient architecture and spectacular landscapes will forever remain in the memory of every guest of Ivano-Frankivsk. </p><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  Acquaintance with each city most often begins from the station.  So, Ukraine, Ivano-Frankivsk.  Photos can be taken as soon as they descend on the platform.  The station building is one of the architectural monuments of the city.  Built in the Renaissance style using elements of the <span>Moorish style</span> - cast iron, ribbed columns and semicircular windows - it immerses each visitor in an atmosphere of antiquity and a fairy tale that will not leave a person for a minute while he is in this wonderful city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivano Frankivsk Attractions" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35618/841781.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The streets of the town </h2><p>  One of the sights of the city is the first pedestrian street in the history of the Soviet Union almost half a kilometer long, which contains the best hotels and shops of the city.  The streets of Ivano-Frankivsk retained the splendor and charm of various historical eras.  You should be careful when going for a walk in a city such as Ivano-Frankivsk: you can meet the sights at almost every step, because every house is unique, every building is a whole work of art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The central part of the city, its streets and temples are the embodiment of ideas about the "ideal city" of the Baroque era.  Ivano-Frankivsk, whose sights “breathe” mystery and grandeur, is sometimes referred to as Small Lvov for the originality of its architecture.  Various bas-reliefs, small statues and caryatids decorate each house in the old part of the city, and the warm and pleasant breeze brings the aromas of flowers.  This combination of nature, weather and architecture helps to mentally travel a couple of centuries ago, to feel like a resident of the 19th century, who is rushing to the market to make some successful purchases, and then note this in a small tavern. </p><p>  Old low-rise buildings, magnificent temples, cozy squares - this and much more is fraught with Ivano-Frankivsk.  Sights, photos of which are stored in the albums of many tourists, are located in the historical part of the city.  Sightseeing tours take place here, helping those who wish to get to know the city and its memorable places better. </p><h2>  Town Hall and Market Square </h2><p>  In the heart of the city is Market Square.  Like all similar areas of European settlements, it is surrounded by numerous shops and souvenir shops.  Ivano-Frankivsk, whose sights we are now considering, like many large cities in Europe, has its own Town Hall, located in the middle of the central square of the city.  It is noteworthy that this is the fifth consecutive House of City Government, erected in this locality.  The Town Hall building has a cruciform shape and is crowned with a small dome 47-meter tower.  A few years ago, a watch appeared on it, playing 12 different melodies.  The Town Hall Museum is located in the Town Hall building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivano Frankivsk Attractions Photos" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35618/841788.jpg" width="449"></div>

What else will show us Ivano-Frankivsk?  The sights of the city in the vicinity of the town hall are represented by three churches of different religious directions: the Ascension Cathedral, Trinity Church and the Church of Josip. </p><p>  <span>The architectural ensemble,</span> consisting of the Trinity Church and the Church of Josip, is located near the bridge near the central artery of the city - Independence Street.  From the church, built of dark stone, it blows romance and Gothic, and the Trinity Church, despite the huge belfry and thick walls, on the contrary, looks very airy and bright. </p><p>  The Greek Catholic Ascension Cathedral was built in the Baroque style in the mid-18th century.  Until the mid-19th century, the building belonged to the Jesuit fraternity.  High spiers, graceful lines and aerial windows are closely intertwined in this building, giving it grace and harmony. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ivano frankivsk city attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35618/841789.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Metropolitan Andrey Sheptitsky Square and the Church of the Virgin Mary </h2><p>  To the right of the Ascension Cathedral is the square of Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, which, despite its small size, is not inferior in beauty to the architectural ensemble of the city center.  The sights of the square are the old buildings around it and the Church of the Virgin Mary, one of the most beautiful and most valuable buildings in the city.  Two styles, the Renaissance and the Baroque, intricately intertwined in the appearance of the Church, giving the building a unique and originality.  Now in the building of the Church is located the Art Museum of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Armenian church </h2><p>  The Armenian Church is another <span>architectural monument of</span> Ivano-Frankivsk.  It was built in the middle of the 18th century on the site of a wooden church in which a miracle happened - the icon of the Virgin Mary was pacified.  After several reconstructions, the church underwent significant changes, however, it continues to amaze the parishioners with grandeur and beauty.  The decoration used wooden sculptures and compositions, the dome of the dome and the walls are decorated with magnificent paintings and beautiful frescoes. </p>
