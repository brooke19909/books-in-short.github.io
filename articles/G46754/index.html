The ethnic composition is mainly represented by Ukrainians, Russians and Jews. </p><p>  There is a legend according to which the name of the city was given in honor of a brave young girl.  She secret paths led the Slavs from the settlement besieged by the Tatars.  Thanks to her, the enemy was defeated.  However, the girl died from the Tatar arrow. </p><p>  The city of Smela (Cherkasy region) was first mentioned in the annals of the XVI century.  At that time, this place belonged to the Commonwealth.  In 1795, the territory on which the city was located was transferred to the Russian Empire.  After that, its industrial development began.  A sugar factory and a mechanical factory were founded here.  In 1876, the laying of the railway began through Smela.  This fact was a powerful impetus for the further economic development of the city.  Today Smela has a well-developed food industry and mechanical engineering.  The city has a milk-canning factory and the largest Ukrainian manufacturer of cabinet and upholstered furniture.  This is the LIVS factory.  Near the city, aluminum is mined. </p><p>  Guests of Smela can visit the Museum of Local Lore, the Orthodox <span>Cathedral of the</span> Intercession <span>, the Roman Catholic</span> Church and the Memorial of Remembrance.  An interesting attraction is the museum car.  Its exhibits will acquaint visitors with the history of the railway development of the town. </p><h2>  Kamenka </h2><p>  The history of the city goes back to ancient times.  For the first time these places were described by Herodotus.  According to one of the existing hypotheses, the ancient city was located on the site of the present Kamenka.  Over the years, this territory belonged to the King of Poland Casimir, Jerzy Lubomirsky - the Polish magnate, Ukrainian hetman Khmelnitsky and Field Marshal of Russia Potemkin-Tauride.  Further, by inheritance, the area passed into the possession of Davydova. </p>

    <p>  Kamenka (Cherkasy region) was the place where Pushkin and Tchaikovsky stayed.  Today, the main attraction of the city is the historical and cultural reserve of Ukraine.  On its territory there are several museum expositions, which include a memorial manor house, architectural buildings, a park, broken in the XVIII century, sculptures, monuments, as well as library and archival funds.  The reserve holds Pushkin poetry celebrations and children's music competitions dedicated to the memory of Tchaikovsky. </p><p>  After the discovery of a groundwater field with unique natural properties, the construction of one of the first distilleries in the region began in Kamenka.  And now, for the production of Kamensky vodka, water is taken from a well with a depth of 220 m. </p><h2>  Vatutino </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1947. In the post-war years, it was necessary to solve the problem of providing residents with local types of household fuel in order to replace straw and Donbass coal.  And on the outskirts of the village of Yurkovka discovered a brown coal deposit, on the basis of which a new city arose.  Equipment for open and closed mining used trophy exported from Germany. </p><p>  For the construction of residential buildings and structures of the town, a woodworking plant and a brick factory were built.  The coal complex was closed by the beginning of the 90s.  Today in Vatutino (Cherkasy region) operates a bakery and several small enterprises. </p><h2>  Kinel-Cherkasy </h2><p>  In 1744, immigrants from Ukraine arrived in the fertile area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Middle Volga.  Forty-six Cossack families founded the Kinel-Cherkasskaya settlement near the Bolshoi Kinel River.  Initially, it was a security and guard settlement.  Its foundation was associated with the need to strengthen the borders of the Moscow state in the east. </p><p>  Now it is the Kinel-Cherkassky district of the Samara region, and the small village founded in ancient times by the Cossacks is the largest village in Russia and the administrative center of the region. </p><p>  Today in this village there are three schools and the same number of libraries.  A district hospital, a sanatorium and a boarding house in which elderly people live are open here.  In Kinel-Cherkassy there is a House of Culture and Youth Organizations, a local history museum and a sports school for children and youth.  The attraction of the village is the Church of the <span>Ascension of the Lord,</span> which is already more than one hundred and fifty years old. </p>
