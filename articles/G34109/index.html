    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Scientists are currently considering several options for the origin of the name of this state.  Without a doubt, it was borrowed from the language of one of the Aboriginal tribes that lived here many centuries ago.  Based on the main version, the name translates as "dark and bloody land."  Researchers believe that it appeared in the thirteenth century.  Then many local tribes were driven out of here by the Iroquois Indians as a result of numerous and bloody wars.  At the same time, some researchers are inclined to believe that the name means "the land of a new day."  No less popular is the theory based on which Kentucky is a state whose name is of Iroquois origin and translates as ‚Äúprairie‚Äù or ‚Äúmeadow‚Äù. </p><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  Kentucky lies in a region that is known as the Upper <span>South of the United States.</span>  It borders states such as Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, Missouri, Illinois, and Tennessee.  An interesting feature of the region is that its western, northern and eastern borders pass along the <span>rivers (Mississippi,</span> Ohio, as well as Tag Fork and Big Sandy, respectively).  A significant part of the state is the Appalachian Mountains.  Since a lot of <span>meadow bluegrass</span> grows here <span>,</span> it is often also called the edge of blue grass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kentucky USA" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/899382.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist attraction </h2><p>  Tourism is considered one of the fastest growing industries in Kentucky.  This is not surprising, because the state boasts not only numerous historical sights, but also unique natural beauty.  It is here that the world famous Cumberland Waterfalls are located - one of the largest in the country.  Quite interesting are the limestone caves washed by the Kentucky River.  The longest of them has a length of 630 kilometers and is known as the <span>Mammoth Cave.</span> </p><p>  Horse racing, which is held annually at the Louisville Hippodrome, is also considered quite popular.  There is also a museum dedicated to them.  Thirty kilometers from this city is located "Fort Knox", which is the repository of the country's gold reserves.  Many tourists come to the historical park "Lincoln's Birthplace."  Kentucky is the state that is home to American corn whiskey.  For lovers of this drink, special thematic tours are constantly organized, which include not only tasting, but also interesting stories about the history of its occurrence and the development of production. </p>
