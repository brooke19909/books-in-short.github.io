This reasonable question is asked by any Russian as soon as he has additional income.  After all, it is well known that money should not lie just like that.  They are obliged to make a profit for their owners, to work for them.  If in the Soviet Union, in fact, there was only one bank, so then no options existed, now so many players have entered the market that it is not so easy to decide which organization to entrust your money with.  In addition, it is no secret that in recent years there has been a certain crisis in the banking sector, the victims of which were even very large players.  For example, the bank "Discovery".  In this article, we will try to understand all the existing nuances, advising where it is best to invest our savings. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which bank to invest at interest" class="if uuid-3025722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025722.jpg"></div><p>  If you decide which bank is profitable to invest in, then you should know what criteria you should pay attention to first.  Remember that attractive and high deposit rates can be deceiving.  Often, they are trying to hide behind their unstable position in the market, and in some cases, outright scammers do this.  However, you should be prepared that you will not be able to fully protect yourself from any unforeseen troubles.  The only thing that is determined in which bank is it profitable to invest is, give preference to reputable and prestigious financial institutions.  Even if they have lower interest rates than in commercial banks, you can be calm about the safety of money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are several options for investing savings.  You can draw up depersonalized metal accounts, invest in investment companies, mutual funds or purchase a savings certificate.  However, the most common and reliable is still the discovery of the usual contribution.  This option is trusted by most Russians when it is determined which bank is profitable to invest in. </p><h2>  How will we choose? </h2><p>  To make a profitable deposit, decide in which bank to invest at interest, several important parameters must be taken into account.  We have already said about reliability.  It is worth recognizing that this parameter remains one of the key.  Even if the interest rate is very high, but the bank itself is very doubtful, you should not contact it.  Choosing a financial institution with an established reputation, customers receive guarantees that they can return their money with interest.  Currently, the largest banks in the Russian Federation are Sberbank, VTB, Alfa Bank, and Rosselkhozbank.  In reviews of which bank to invest in, most current and potential customers are advised to choose from this list.  It is these financial institutions that have the largest client base, as well as open offices in all major cities of the country. </p><p>  The next parameter to which you should pay close attention when deciding which bank <span>to invest money at interest</span> is the size of the rate itself.  It is worth recognizing that in large banks, as a rule, you will not find really attractive and high rates.  They charge at the expense of reliability.  Less well-known, who have nothing more to offer, attract customers as much as possible profit.  So do completely new banks that have not yet had time to declare themselves.  So, when you are offered a high interest rate, this does not mean that you are definitely deceived, but it is worth fearing for your savings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Carefully study all the parameters of the contribution.  The size of the bet will also be affected by its duration, special conditions present in the contract. </p><p>  Another parameter can be called controllability.  It is very important in determining which bank to invest in.  There are deposits without the possibility of replenishment or partial withdrawal of the amount until the expiration of the contract.  In this case, you can get the full amount with interest only at the very end.  Of course, it is more convenient when there is the opportunity to replenish the account and withdraw money from it, if necessary, in order to more or less freely dispose of their funds.  But in this case, the rate is likely to be slightly lower.  There are also options with capitalization of the deposit, which also affects the decision on where to invest, which bank to choose. </p><p>  Finally, it is worthwhile to find out from an employee of a financial organization whether your savings will be insured, whether the bank is cooperating with the Deposit Insurance Agency.  At present, in Russia, a deposit is automatically insured if it has an amount of not more than 1.4 million rubles. </p><p>  This is another important point to consider when deciding which bank to invest in.  You need to understand that this will include both the amount you originally contributed and the interest accrued on it.  Of course, a deposit will be insured only if the financial institution cooperates with the Deposit Insurance Agency.  Then you can not worry about the fate of your money, even if the bank “bursts” or the Central Bank withdraws its license. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The best way to decide which <span>bank is best</span> to invest in is to make a list of financial institutions that you trust the most, and then compare what conditions they offer.  As a rule, the sites describe in detail all the details, program conditions, interest rates and tariffs for each deposit.  If necessary, you can get additional advice in any department that is within walking distance from you. </p><h2>  Central Bank Rating </h2><p>  When deciding <span>which bank is best to invest in,</span> we recommend <span>that</span> you refer to the reliability rating for opening a deposit drawn up by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Please note that if you invest in a state financial institution, you will receive a relatively small rate.  This is explained by the fact that such companies have huge client bases in which there are many millions of people, therefore they do not need to additionally attract investors, promising them high profitability.  People will come to them, focusing on status, name and fame. </p><p>  Also, the decisive factors for many when deciding which bank it is more reliable to invest in are the presence of their branches in small towns, their prevalence in the country, and transparency of the deposit conditions. </p><p>  If you take the most popular banks, then in Sberbank, the most common in the Russian Federation, you will be able to offer the maximum rate of only about seven percent per annum.  At VTB and Rosselkhozbank, you can count on about the same profit.  About interest on deposits in each of these financial organizations, as well as about the conditions we will discuss in this article. </p><p>  Answering the question of which banks to invest in, many experts advise to opt for state financial institutions, since most of them belong to the state.  This means that if any problems arise, the company will still be provided with the necessary support.  So the likelihood that they will go bankrupt is close to zero.  In 2018, Sberbank of Russia was the leader in the rating of bank reliability by the number of assets.  VTB is in second place, and Gazprombank in third.  The top ten also included Rosselkhozbank, Moscow Credit Bank, Unicreditbank, Alfa Bank, Raiffeisenbank, Otkritie, and the All-Russian Regional Development Bank. </p><p>  It is on this list that everyone is advised to focus on when you decide which bank it is safer to invest in. </p><h2>  High interest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realestaterph.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which bank is better to invest money in" class="if uuid-3025724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025724.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, when a person invests, first of all, he expects to earn as much as possible.  Therefore, no one will reproach you if you carefully examine all kinds of interest rates that offer you. </p><p>  It is important to remember that, in addition to the rate itself, you need to carefully study all other terms of the contract.  After all, if you focus only on advertising, then you can be misled.  In the videos they talk about the maximum rates, but you should always remember that there are also minimum rates, and the final value depends on various factors.  When determining which banks are the best to invest in, it is important which program you choose, for how long, whether you can withdraw money from your account or replenish it, how often you earn income (monthly or only at the very end of the term).  Please note whether you belong to the category of privileged customers (as a rule, those who have a credit card in this bank or who receive a pension through it).  All this will affect the final deposit rate, which bank to invest in. </p><p>  Carefully analyzing the existing market, we can highlight several of the most attractive offers.  This should help you decide which bank is best to invest your money in.  For example, in Sovcombank there is a record interest deposit.  If you have a Halva card, the rate can reach 8.65%.  True, there is no possibility of early termination, provided that the interest received on the deposit is maintained. </p><p>  It is important that throughout the term you have the right to deposit additional amounts not exceeding the original amount.  Interest is paid upon expiration of the entire term directly to the Halva card. </p><p>  Traditionally, profitable deposits are offered to be opened at Zenit Bank.  The Leadership Strategy deposit offers a yield of up to 9.5 percent per annum with a minimum amount of one hundred thousand rubles.  It is noteworthy that this deposit can only be opened in conjunction with the issuance of an investment life insurance policy for a client at a credit institution. </p><p>  We emphasize that all these deposits are accepted only in domestic currency.  This is the most profitable bank to invest in rubles. </p><h2>  Reminder for contributor </h2><p>  Before giving your money to one or another financial organization, it is important to remember several important things.  When deciding which bank you can invest your money in, it should be understood that small firms, which, moreover, are often represented in only one region, often attract depositors with higher deposit rates and other favorable conditions.  At the same time, they lack sufficient operational experience in this market, and also lack stability and reliability to ensure guaranteed preservation of your money. </p><p>  Therefore, when determining which bank to invest in, experts recommend, first of all, to pay attention to those organizations that have significant experience and a high reliability rating. </p><p>  In addition, do not forget that it is possible to receive a profit, albeit small, with the help of debit cards, with the ability to save available funds.  For example, you pay with this card wherever possible, pay for services, purchase some goods, and for this you are regularly charged certain percentages.  In this case, the larger the amount in your account, the more substantial commission you can expect.  Periodically, banks hold promotions in order to get more customers, for this they can, for example, offer increased interest on their debit cards. </p><p>  Further, to help you figure out where to invest money, which bank has more interest, consider the offers that the largest banks on the domestic financial market offer today. </p><h2>  Sberbank of Russia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sochi-express.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits in Sberbank" class="if uuid-3025725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025725.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank has never been famous for high interest rates on deposits, but at the same time it is always considered among the applicants when they do not know where to invest the money.  This happens because it is the most popular bank in the country, its branches are even in very small settlements throughout our country.  In addition, he is considered one of the most reliable, it is simply impossible to imagine that he is going bankrupt. </p><p>  A new offer from Sberbank - “Without a passport” deposit.  When placing from 50 thousand rubles for a period of one year, you will receive a rate of 7%.  You can open a deposit for only five months.  In this case, the rate will decrease to 6.5%.  The attractiveness of this proposal is that you do not need a passport and do not need to personally come to the bank branch.  You can open it at an ATM or through Sberbank Online.  In this case, partial withdrawal and replenishment is not provided.  All interest is accrued only at the end of the contract.  At the same time, interest itself can be transferred to other accounts or withdrawn without hindrance. </p><p>  The “Save” deposit is primarily intended to preserve your savings, the bank says.  It can also be opened online, while receiving a rate of up to 5.15%.  Amount - from one thousand rubles, term - from one month to three years.  In this case, partial withdrawal and replenishment are not provided.  You need to understand that you can only count on a 5.15% rate if you open a deposit in the amount of 400 thousand rubles for a period of one year.  The minimum option is four percent per annum. </p><p>  On the “Replenish” deposit, it will be convenient for you not only to store, but also to save your savings.  Partial withdrawal in this case is also not provided, but you can regularly replenish your account.  The rate on this deposit is up to 4.7 percent per annum, the amount is from one thousand rubles, and the term is from three months to three years. </p><p>  The “Manage” deposit attracts many customers today, often they choose it, deciding which bank to invest their money in.  It is important that he offers a partial withdrawal of profits without loss of interest.  The amount of 30 thousand rubles, a period of three months to three years.  It is also rechargeable.  Depending on the conditions, customers can expect a rate from 4 to 4.4%. </p><p>  There are specialized deposits in Sberbank.  For example, "Social."  It is intended for disabled people and veterans of World War II, children left without parental care.  Unlike previous deposits, it can only be opened at a bank branch.  Doing this remotely fails.  This is a <span>replenished contribution</span> with partial withdrawal, which opens in the name of the veteran or the child himself by his legal representative.  The minimum amount is 1 ruble, the term is 3 years, the interest rate is 4.25%.  This is a <span>replenished contribution</span> with partial withdrawal. </p><p>  The “Give Life” contribution is designed to help children with hematological, oncological and other diseases, which, as a rule, require expensive treatment.  The minimum amount is 10 thousand rubles, the deposit term is one year, the interest rate is 5.05%.  This is an irreplaceable contribution without the possibility of partial withdrawal.  Its main feature is that every three months Sberbank transfers an amount of 0.3% per annum of the amount of the contribution to the Give Life charity fund. </p><p>  There is also a special offer for pensioners - the contribution "Pension-plus of Sberbank of Russia".  It involves retirement income.  It is rechargeable with the possibility of partial withdrawal.  It opens for three years at 3.5%.  The <span>minimum minimum balance</span> must be 1 ruble. </p><h2>  VTB </h2><div class="photo" data-original="72.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contributions to VTB" class="if uuid-3025720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025720.jpg"></div><p>  To determine which bank to invest in, we’ll talk about the conditions offered by VTB Bank. </p><p>  Here are the most popular options.  “Maximum” deposit is a deposit with a maximum rate for a fixed term.  Amount - from 30 thousand rubles.  The client receives a rate of up to 8% per annum, but at the same time he cannot replenish the account or withdraw money in advance.  The term of the deposit is three years. </p><p>  The “Profitable” deposit is designed to increase <span>your money resources,</span> helping you to get a fixed income.  This will make you feel confident.  The maximum rate for this proposal is provided in the amount of up to 7.16% per annum.  The term is from three months to five years.  Withdrawal or replenishment is not provided. </p><p>  The “Replenishable” deposit also does not imply a preliminary withdrawal of funds, but it allows you to replenish your own account.  The term is the same as in the previous version.  The maximum rate is up to 6.32%.  There are monthly payments or capitalization of interest. </p><p>  The “Comfortable” deposit is intended for convenient management of your money.  The maximum rate is provided much lower - only up to 4.16%, and the deposit amount starts from 30 thousand rubles.  At the same time, multiple withdrawals and replenishment of the account, as well as interest capitalization or monthly payment are provided.  Access to funds on deposit is available at any time.       ,      .    ,      ,      15  ,   ,   -,   .        . </p><p>   ""      -  " ".      ,        ""    - ,  8  .    ,    "",     "".     .       ,      .             ,       ,  ,   . </p><p>             8 % .  ,               8,5 %. </p><p> With this option of placing funds, you will be provided with increased income when using multi-cards, withdrawing and replenishing an account without restrictions, the possibility of auto-replenishment of an account, money is insured at the Deposit Insurance Agency.  As part of this offer, a special rate on this account will be offered only if a multi-card with the option "Savings" is opened.  It consists of a percentage premium and a base interest rate.  It is worth emphasizing that the basic rate directly depends on the time you place the funds in the corresponding savings account.  Initially, there is a percentage premium of four percent per annum, effective in the first month of using the multi-card for the client’s new money in the savings account.  Moreover, the rate does not depend on the amount of purchases made on a multicard.  In the following months, an addition to the base rate for the current savings account is carried out, which is carried out when processing multi-card transactions in the amount of five thousand rubles or more. </p><p>  Clients of VTB Bank admit that this offer is very attractive in order to place their funds on these conditions. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.plusworld.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits at Alfa Bank" class="if uuid-3025723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025723.jpg"></div><p>  Interesting offers have been developed by Alfa-Bank specialists who seek to attract as many customers as possible.  They have two types of deposits - with the possibility of replenishment or withdrawal, as well as with maximum income without the possibility of withdrawal and replenishment.  Consider all existing options. </p><p>  The Premier deposit implies a steadily increasing interest rate.  The client has the opportunity to replenish his deposit.  In this case, the more money is in his account, the higher the final percentage per annum will be. </p><p>  Now more about the conditions of the Premier deposit.  The expected yield is up to 6.7%, the interest rate in this case directly depends on the category, package of services, universal line of cards.  The rate increases depending on the level of customer service.  The starting amount on the deposit is ten thousand rubles, and the term for the placement of funds is from three months to one year.  It is possible to increase the interest rate, replenish the account.  <span>You can open a deposit</span> not only in any of the bank's branches, but also in the Internet bank and mobile application. </p><p>  The "Potential" deposit promises customers an individual approach to the terms.  In this case, the interest rate is up to 6.2%.  The minimum amount is exactly the same - ten thousand rubles, the deposit term - from three months to three years.  The possibility of withdrawal and replenishment is present. </p><p>  Two deposits at Alfa-Bank can be opened for maximum income, but without the possibility of preliminary replenishment and withdrawal.  On the deposit "Big jackpot" customers are offered the maximum income on condition that the deposit is opened before January 31, 2019.  You can open an account in a mobile application for a period of one to three years.  Depending on the period for which you open a deposit, the rate can be from 7.1 to 8.18 percent per annum.  At the same time, the minimum deposit amount is 50 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Finally, with the Victory deposit, customers are offered the highest possible income.  If interest is capitalized for a period of three years, the interest rate will be 8.01%.  Moreover, the client has the opportunity to independently choose the method of calculating interest.  Ultimately, the percentage is also affected by the bank card in your hands and the connected service package. </p><h2>  Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dag.life" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits at the Agricultural Bank" class="if uuid-3025719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025719.jpg"></div><p>  Several interesting offers on the market are made to Rosselkhozbank customers.  There are options for almost any wallet and opportunity: for those who have very few funds, for those who have significant amounts for which they want to get the maximum percentage.  Moreover, special attractive deposits are provided for senior citizens. </p><p>  Interest rates themselves differ not only in the amount and terms, but also in the methods of opening deposits.  When making a deposit online, the yield is higher than when opening a similar deposit in a bank office.  You should definitely remember this so that you can choose the best contribution for yourself. </p><p>  Currently, the "Profitable" deposit is available for customers.  This deposit involves a very high percentage, even if you do not have a lot of money on hand.  You can open a deposit remotely.  If your account will be worth at least 50 thousand rubles, then you will still receive a free card "Amur Tiger - deposit card". </p><p>  The minimum deposit amount is only three thousand rubles, the term is from one month to four years.  Expense operations and replenishment is not provided.  Interest is paid monthly or at the end of the term.  The interest rate in rubles is up to 8%. </p><p>  Opening a deposit "Safe Future" is possible when applying for an investment life insurance policy at one of the partner companies of the Agricultural Bank.  When opening a deposit for a year, the interest rate will be 8.4%. </p><p>  The investment deposit is intended for individuals.  It enables clients to receive income not only from the amount of money placed on deposit, but also through the implementation of investments in mutual investment funds.  The minimum amount is 50 thousand rubles, the rate, depending on the term, varies from 7.75 to 8.45%. </p><p>  If you focus on the feedback of the Russians, who today choose where to invest their money, or have already made such a decision, it is worth recognizing that the majority still prefer large state-owned banks.  In addition, it is strongly advised not to make a deposit in the amount of more than 1.4 million rubles protected by the Deposit Insurance Agency in each individual bank.  In the past few decades, the inhabitants of our country have repeatedly had to face situations where they could lose all their savings at once.  Therefore, today they prefer not the opportunity to earn a lot and quickly, but the desire to save their money, even with minimal profit. </p><h2>  Currency deposits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.achievalife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deposits in foreign currency" class="if uuid-3025726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3025726.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that today interest rates on foreign currency deposits are much lower than on ruble deposits.  This situation exists in all banks without exception.  However, if you are still interested in which bank to invest the currency in, you can find some interesting suggestions. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that there are many offers from small and little-known financial institutions that seek to attract customers with favorable interest rates.  Choosing which bank it is better to invest dollars in, it makes sense to pay attention to Metallinvestbank.  Here the maximum dollar deposit rate is 2.9%.  At the same time, there is no possibility of partial withdrawal or replenishment, but early preferential termination is possible.  This is the best bank to invest in.  At the same time, on all deposits, the rates on deposits in euros in this bank are 0.1%. </p>
