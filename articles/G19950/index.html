So the long-released <span>Asus</span> Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB <span>smartphone</span> received good ratings from users and gadget lovers.  Despite the fact that its sales have been going on for a long time, it is still relevant. </p><p>  Zenfone Go is a whole line of inexpensive, but at the same time productive devices for its price.  In general, they are a reduced version of Zenfone 5. The main characteristics of the series are two SIM cards, a quad-core processor and good memory capacity. </p><h2>  Device description </h2><p>  Although the phone is designed for the average budget of the owner, its performance is quite stylish.

There is a rare version of the red Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB, reviews of which are much less common. </p>

    <p>  On the front panel there are no special fanciful elements.  Everything is quite classic - a camera, a speaker, a company logo, a set of buttons - ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù - standard for ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù -martphones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Productivity of the device and its device </h2><p>  ‚ÄúUnder the hood‚Äù of the smartphone is the quad-core Qualcomm <span>Snapdragon 410</span> MSM8916.  This processor is an ARM chip designed for mid-range devices.  By the way, he became the first 64-bit model from Qualcomm.  The cores have a Cortex-A53 configuration.  Adreno 306 is used as a video accelerator, which, of course, is not top-end, but it occupies a worthy place among all graphic modules.  The processor itself is made using 28 nm technology and contains an LPDDR2 / 3 memory controller. </p><p>  The internal memory in the smartphone is declared at 8 GB.  However, the user is usually available about 4. The total volume can be expanded up to 128 using an SD card.  There is a lot of RAM for a budget smartphone - 1 GB.  This amount should be enough to simultaneously run several applications of moderate severity. </p><h2>  Display and its characteristics </h2><p>  It is interesting that in the official specifications the screen type is not indicated anywhere, however, judging by customer reviews of the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB, it is an IPS.  Multiple touch supported, type - capacitive.  Viewing angles are small, but budget explains a lot.  The diagonal of the display is 4.5 inches with a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels.  The total number of pixels per inch is 218. The screen is a standard of simplicity: in direct sunlight, the display will have to peer. </p>

    <h2>  Multimedia device </h2><p>  As is customary on modern smartphones, Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB has two cameras - rear and front.  The first can take pictures with a resolution of 8 MP, and the second - at 2. The rear can be highlighted with an LED flash.  To adjust the clarity there is an autofocus function.  You can successfully use various barcode scanners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of the sensors on the device, there is an accelerometer that catches the position of the smartphone, a compass, probably so as not to get lost in the forest, a proximity sensor for a comfortable conversation and an ambient light sensor, which with this screen is very relevant. </p>

    <p>  The device can play MP3 and FM radio files, which is standard for many modern smartphones and is not particularly surprising. </p><h2>  Communication and communication components </h2><p>  The phone can work in all known protocols of cellular networks, including 4G.  Which, in turn, has five ranges.  Two slots for SIM cards differ in form factor - micro SIM and nano SIM.  Their operating mode is alternate. </p><p>  The built-in Wi-Fi module allows you to connect to a wireless network using the latest 802.11n standard.  To communicate with devices there is Bluetooth 4.0 with backward compatibility support. </p><p>  For navigation, GPS, Russian GLONASS or Chinese BeiDou are used.  As an auxiliary satellite search engine, A-GPS is implemented. </p><h2>  Battery autonomy and capacity </h2><p>  Among the reviews on the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB there are many about the battery, which has 2070 mAh.  Both positive and negative.  Based on them, we can conclude that the battery holds an average of one day of use.  For some, this is not enough, but someone is already used to such energy consumption.  At the same time, the developers announced 16 hours of conversation and 13 in the mode of surfing websites over Wi-Fi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Software and Interface </h2><p>  The smartphone has Android 6.0 installed.  But this is not a feature of the phone.  And the fact that inside is an exclusive ZenUI shell.  It is optimized specifically for ASUS devices.  It is an add-on for the interface.  Improves the appearance and control of the device.  Implemented gesture technology and special button combinations. </p><h2>  Features of the first use </h2><p>  Before use, it is worth giving some recommendations on the proper setup and use of the smartphone.  Some of them are based on reviews of the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB, and some are taken from official manuals. </p>

    <p>  When installing SIM cards, it is important to remember that even though both slots support 4G, only one of them can work with the technology at the current time. </p><p>  Zen UI has its own unique applications and features: </p><ul><li>  Power and acceleration.  This mechanism closes unused processes and applications, thereby freeing up RAM and battery life.  It is especially relevant after prolonged use of "heavy" applications. </li><li>  Startup manager.  It also optimizes processes and RAM by removing from the list of applications loaded at startup. </li><li>  ASUS Mobile Manager.  This is a set of tools for managing application settings and various characteristics, collected in one place.  Setting permissions for programs, power saving, virus scanning, notification properties. </li><li>  Blue filter.  This tool gives the screen soft, calm tones that are optimal for reading. </li></ul><p>  As for installing firmware or obtaining root rights, this device is not provided for such actions.  The fact is that its bootloader is locked, and it is currently impossible to remove this protection.  Standard updates are installed normally or through recovery. </p>

    <p>  By the way, starting recovery mode is quite unusual.  First you need to turn off the smartphone, then hold down the volume and power buttons.  In the menu that appears, select Recovery.  After the picture appears, you need to press the power button again, and then the volume up. </p><p>  Also, when buying this smartphone, an additional 100 gigabytes of space for a period of 2 years was allocated to an account in the Google drive. </p><h2>  Comparison with nearest competitors </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> 2016 has similar characteristics to the hero of the article. The processor is slightly different with the same architecture, number of cores and frequency.  It also supports 4G mode, has 2 SIM cards, RAM and built-in memory of 1 GB and 8 GB, respectively.  The difference lies in the price, which on Samsung is more than 1000 rubles.  Also the version of Android in J1 is 5.1. </p><p>  The LG K3 LTE K100DS is more similar to the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB.  The same version of the operating system, resolution and screen size, supported communication standards and even price.  A slight difference is noticed in the used processor, the cores of which give a slightly lower frequency of 1100 MHz, and the video adapter, which is presented here in the form of the Mali-T720 MP2. </p><p>  In its own line, ASUS has a similar device - Asus Zenfone Go ZB452KG.  All the main characteristics are no different.  Here are just a version of the operating system one older.  As for the cameras, everything is a little worse: the front - 2 MP, and the rear - 8 MP. </p>

    <p>  The Lenovo brand also has a similar copy in its assortment - Vibe B A2016.  The screen is equipped with the same resolution of 854 by 480 pixels with a size of the same 4.5 inches.  True, a TFT matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled here.  The processor is less efficient, 4 cores have 1000 MHz each.  The memory is the same.

Build quality was at a decent level.  True, there is uncertainty here.

When making only calls, the smartphone can stretch out on a single charge up to a whole week, according to the assurances of one of the respondents. </p><p>  The screen showed itself at its best: in the cold it responds well to pressing through gloves. </p><p>  The review of Asus Zenfone Go ZB452KG black revealed that in this color the phone looks very stylish and elegant.

    <p>  Many users were pleased with the autofocus mode on the camera, which allows you to take pictures close to macro photography. </p><p>  In general, from all customer reviews of the Asus Zenfone Go model presented in the article, one can identify the positive aspects of the device: </p><ul><li>  good build and stylish design; </li><li>  low price; </li><li>  battery, with simple use, able to withstand a long time; </li><li>  the presence of autofocus; </li><li>  stable navigation function; </li><li>  the presence of sensors; </li><li>  not the worst performance; </li><li>  convenient and functional Zen UI; </li><li>  Android 6.0. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  An unpleasant discovery for a large number of users was the inability to obtain root rights due to a locked bootloader.  And this will not allow you to install many applications, firmware and "custom" recovery.  In addition, without root rights, it will not be possible to delete pre-installed programs to free up space. </p><p>  Someone seemed to have little internal memory.  This reduces the ability to use the phone for games. </p><p>  The review of the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB White smartphone indicated an increased lightness mark. </p><p>  The screen, which seemed to some a plus, at the same time became a minus.  In sunny weather, using a telephone to read or search for information on the Internet becomes problematic.  The situation is a bit saved by the presence of a light sensor that adjusts to external light. </p><p>  The internal memory is often not enough.  Constant "brakes" and "freezes" in this phone are not uncommon. </p><p>  As for RAM, then everything is not so smooth, even though it is 1 GB.  In practice, about half is spent on maintaining the system itself.  This means that launching heavy applications will be difficult. </p><p>  Summing up, you can get a lot of minuses: </p><ul><li>  with the active use of the smartphone, the battery is not enough even for a day; </li><li>  low-quality screen; </li><li>  small amount of memory, both built-in and operational; </li><li>  the inability to get a root, which closes many prospects; </li><li>  uncomfortable access to the inside of the device - the cover is removed quite peculiarly; </li><li>  In the easy mastering mode, there are problems with listening to music, as one of the buyers noted in the review of the Asus ZB450KL Go 4.5 smartphone. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In general, the phone was not bad.  Most reviews of the price of the Asus Zenfone Go ZB450KL 8GB smartphone are positive.  But still, many users agreed that it is better to dig into a more reliable and efficient phone, since this model is suitable only as a temporary ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with a minimum of simple functions and applications.  Or it can serve as a first step in the big life of smartphones to a growing child.  In addition, in the line of Asus phones there are also more advanced models that can be selected for the amount of interest.  Analogs from competing companies can also take part in the ‚Äúrace‚Äù for superiority, because there are even cheaper, but no less productive copies on the market. </p>
