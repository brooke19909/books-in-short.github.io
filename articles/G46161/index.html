    <h2>  Emblem Acceptance </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 15th century, the rulers of the Prussian Duchy and Elector Brandenburg decided to unite in one state.  So, in 1417, Germany appeared on the map of Western Europe, which turned into an empire.  Its capital was Berlin. </p><p>  It is hard to imagine that a solid city lacked its own official symbols.  The modern coat of arms of Berlin has existed since 1954, when the city authorities made a corresponding decision. </p><h2>  The image of state symbols </h2><p>  What is depicted on the emblem of Berlin, all Germans know.  This is a bear. </p><p>  Despite the fact that brown bears are usually found in nature, they painted on the coat of arms of a predator in black.  The beast stood on its hind legs, menacingly sharpened its mouth, from which a red tongue would stick out.  The claws on the hind and forepaws are also red.  With his entire body, he is deployed to the left in relation to the viewer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The upper part of the stamp, the crown is the traditional gold crown of the autocrat.  The artist depicted the rim of the symbol of <span>absolute power</span> in the form of masonry, which during the Middle Ages was used in the construction of castles and some types of towers.  In the central part of the masonry - securely closed gates.  From above, over the entire length of the crown, teeth are completed in the amount of 5 pieces.  A carved leaf is attached to the end of each of them. </p><p>  Any organization, institution or ordinary citizen, at his discretion, has every right to demonstrate the described image of the coat of arms of Berlin. </p><h2>  A look into the distant past </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdepicting a black bear bear on a white (silver) background is not new.  Experts in history are ready to cite facts in favor of the fact that this character has long been adorned with the main symbol of the capital.  The coat of arms and flag of Berlin appeared for a reason, they were state symbols back in ancient times.  Over the course of many years, they have been modified and even interpreted a little differently. </p>

    <p>  According to historical information that has survived to this day, in 1280 the coat of arms of Berlin appeared.  The sources are prints on documents of those times that are found when viewing archives.  However, there are some external differences between modern and old versions.  First of all, then on the heraldic shield two predators were painted: one - a black bear, and the other - a brown one.  In addition, on the coat of arms there was an image of an eagle.  A sign of the inviolability of power and a strong connection between the present and the distant past was the Margrave helmet.  So the emblem of Berlin asserted its position.  Photos of old state symbols can be found in the archives of Germany. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another version of the origin of the coat of arms also has the right to exist.  The middle of the 12th century was marked in the history of Germany and the <span>Holy Roman Empire by the</span> crusades of German knights to the east, the colonization of the territory, which was inhabited by the Slutic Lutits.  A huge merit in this is the feudal prince Albrecht, who was given the nickname "Bear".  It can be assumed that the bear and helmet on the coat of arms of Berlin were painted in honor of the first Margrave of the eastern land of Brandenburg, annexed to the empire. </p><h2>  The emblem of Berlin </h2><p>  In the middle of the 15th century, only one bear remained on the seal of the city of Berlin, without its second comrade.  On the back of the beast, an eagle piled up, clutching its fur claws tightly with its claws.  A bird of prey was present on the coat of arms of the Princes of Brandenburg, who were vested with the right to elect the emperor (electors).  The fact that Berlin came under their rule was thus ‚Äúencrypted‚Äù in the figure described above.  Until 1709, this version of the coat of arms of Berlin was still used. </p>

    <p>  In 1588, the eagle was absent on the small seal of the magistrate, only a drawing of a bear was applied.  At the beginning of the 18th century, a black bear "rose" on its hind legs, and there were two feathered predators.  One of the birds represented Prussia, the second - Brandenburg.  These lands united around the administrative center, the role of which was assigned to the modern capital of Germany.  The coat of arms of Berlin changed with the history of the state. </p><p>  In 1835, the picture of the heraldic shield finally found its final form, and after almost four years the golden crown was on top. </p><h2>  Berlin flag </h2><p>  At the end of May 1954, the flag of West Berlin was approved, or rather that of its territory, which was under the control of the Western allies - the USA, Great Britain and France.  The flag cloth had three stripes: two are red at the edges and one is white in the center.  The extreme red stripes occupied one fifth of the height. </p><p>  In the middle of the white strip is a small coat of arms of Berlin, which was mentioned above.  This version of the flag of Berlin was chosen after summing up one of several competitions.  In 1990, the flag became a symbol of the capital of Germany - the state that arose as a result of the unification of Germany and the GDR after several decades of separation. </p>
