    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The tablet has a diagonal of 9.7 inches.  The aspect ratio is as comfortable as possible, so using this device will be quite convenient.  The screen received an IPS matrix, and the number of pixels per inch is 142 ppi.  According to consumers, such characteristics are enough to perform basic actions: watch movies, photos, work and so on.  However, it should be noted that pixels become visible on solid images. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tablet has pretty good performance.  It runs on two cores, and the processor frequency is 1.6 GHz.  RAM received a size of 1 GB.  Therefore, it will not work to perform serious tasks on the tablet, but watching movies, typing, or playing slightly capacious games will be quite convenient and comfortable.  Hanging can be noticed only if the tablet starts to overheat.  That is, you can‚Äôt, for example, simultaneously watch a movie and charge the device.  However, there is a special program for the Ritmix RMD 1055 tablet, which makes it possible to control the processor load. </p><p>  The 7800 mAh battery impresses many, so this nuance can be noted as a positive characteristic.  Built-in memory is 8 GB.  If this space is not enough, then the internal storage can be supplemented with a flash card.  The gadget works stably only with external drives up to 32 GB in size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet ritmix rmd 1055" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1652489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication and multimedia </h2><p>  The Ritmix RMD 1055 tablet is equipped with a Wi-Fi and 3G module.  The latter works quite well and stably, no failures are observed.  Some consumers say that Wi-Fi can sometimes stop functioning, and it‚Äôs better not to go far from the signal source. </p><p>  Unfortunately, many users complain about the sound quality through the built-in speaker.  However, if you do not take this nuance into account, then in general it can be said that it (even with the fact that it is the only one) is quite sonorous and clear.  However, in order to enjoy listening to music, it is better not to set it to maximum volume and not to listen to heavy rock compositions.  The sound in the headphones is good and there are no complaints about it.  The Ritmix RMD 1055 tablet received two cameras: the front and the main.  The first has a resolution of 3 megapixels, and the second - only 2 megapixels.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that this device allows you to take high-quality photos.  However, in case of emergency, the built-in matrix will always come to the rescue.  Moreover, the rear camera and front camera can be safely used for talking on Skype. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disassemble a tablet ritmix rmd 1055" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1652490.jpg" width="600"></div>
