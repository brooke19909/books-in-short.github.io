Preliminary preparation and useful information about the <span>federal highway</span> R-22 will help to make driving on the highway as safe, fast and comfortable as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1944717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1944717.jpg?1552206673"></div><h2>  Route </h2><p>  The peculiarity of the Caspian highway is that it crosses several areas, but at the same time lies along the entire distance from cities.  This is convenient for drivers, as large settlements hamper the movement, they increase the likelihood of an accident. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1944043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/1944043.jpg?1552206673"></div><p>  P-22 highway "Caspian" originates in the south of Moscow, at the intersection of Lipetsk street and Moscow Ring Road in the same place where the federal highway "Don" begins (aka M-4).  In the Kashira area, the R-22 highway branches off from the Don and rushes southeast to the Caspian Sea through the following regions and cities: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Moscow, with a small stop in the Tula region; </li><li>  Ryazan, through the city of Mikhailov, near the cities of Skopin and Ryazhsky; </li><li>  Tambov, near the cities of Michurinsky and Tambov; </li><li>  Voronezh, near the city of Borisoglebsk; </li><li>  Volgograd, through the cities of Novonikolaevsky, Novoanninsky, near the village of Mikhailovka, Ilovlei and arrival in Volgograd; </li><li>  Astrakhan, with the intersection of a small section of Kalmykia; </li><li>  The track ends in Astrakhan. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1944037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/1944037.jpg?1552206673"></div><h2>  Description of the R-22 highway: what quality? </h2><p>  The length of the Caspian highway is 1,383 kilometers.  In almost all sections of the road has two-lane traffic, the width of the road is 8 meters.  There are several sections with four lanes, but they are too short and do not particularly affect the overall impression of the road. </p><p>  Cement-concrete or asphalt-concrete coating.  For several years, the Caspian has been actively being repaired, so there are practically no areas left with frankly poor coverage.  The overall quality of the road can be assessed by a strong four.  And although the repair is wonderful, because thanks to it, the condition of the R-22 highway is constantly improving, but at the same time, repair work inevitably brings inconvenience to drivers. </p><p>  Traffic on the highway is intense, especially high traffic in the summer and early autumn, when trucks are driving the road, carrying agricultural products from the southern regions to central Russia and returning back.  Trucks seriously complicate the movement, long lines of cars line up behind them, impatient motorists go on dangerous overtaking, as a result, the number of accidents is growing.  Although in general, reviews describing the R-22 track are often positive.  Usually, drivers believe that the advantages of this road far outweigh its shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  This is the shortest way from the capital to Astrakhan and Volgograd.  Although some drivers prefer to get to the Caspian Sea along the wider and faster Don highway, making an impressive detour and sometimes making time at the expense of a higher average speed.  But this is a debatable issue and largely depends on the case. </p><p>  There are very few settlements on the Caspian highway with their mandatory speed limits, but there are enough cafes, hotels and gas stations along the road. </p><p>  P-22 highway "Caspian" is completely free, unlike the same M-4. </p><p>  Beautiful landscapes.  The route crosses Russia more than a thousand kilometers to the southeast, the climate zones and landscape are gradually changing outside the window.  Near Moscow, the road winds between wooded fields, they are replaced by light forests, then the Volga steppes begin, and the track ends in a semi-desert.  On the way, you can call in the beautiful Russian city of Tambov or the glorious Volgograd. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1944718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/1944718.jpg?1552206673"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><ul><li>  Repair in some areas. </li><li>  The track is narrow and has only two lanes. </li><li>  Tripod cameras are periodically installed on the roadsides, especially at repair sites where temporary signs are installed. </li><li>  A lot of trucks slowing down and making overtaking difficult. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1944044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51659/1944044.jpg?1552206673"></div><h2>  Roadside hotels </h2><p>  Even for an experienced driver it is problematic to drive the R-22 “Caspian” highway without stopping for the night, and for an inexperienced person who is not used to driving in the dark or long distances, this is completely impossible.  Therefore, along the entire road, roadside hotels can be found right on the highway or in the settlements near it. </p><ul><li>  210 kilometers.  Motel "Comfort".  Located directly on the highway: 700-2,000 rubles per person, four- and double rooms, cafe, parking. </li><li>  284 km.

For example, due to limited visibility at 1245, 1300 and 1379 kilometers, and due to steep ascents and descents - at 448 and 1378 kilometers. </p>
