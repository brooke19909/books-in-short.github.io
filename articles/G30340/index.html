    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Absolutely all reviews of tourists who visited the Baan Karonburi Resort (Phuket), noted its convenient location.  This hotel is located on the <span>Andaman Sea,</span> almost the Karon Beach, the most wonderful in Phuket.  It is only necessary to cross the road to step on clean white and yellow sand.  On the other hand, the hotel is very close to restaurants, cafes, bars, shops, shops, massage parlors and other objects of the Thai tourism industry.  Despite the fact that there is a lot of all of this, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is considered to be quiet and calm - its active life stops at around 10 o‚Äôclock.  But in Patong, located 8 km away, wild fun boils all night.  You can get there by taxi, tuk-tuk or a regular bus that stops near the hotel.  From Russia, all planes arrive at <span>Phuket Airport,</span> from which it is 48 km to the hotel or about 40 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Hotel Baan Karonburi Resort occupies a compact territory, on three sides sandwiched by other hotels of different stars.  On the fourth side there is a road along which a rivulet hurries to the sea.  This water artery among tourists causes mainly complaints, since it interferes with enjoying the sea during rains.  In a small area available to the hotel, the designers harmoniously arranged two four-story buildings, two swimming pools, a bar, a gazebo with massage couches, a parking lot.  All this was decorated with subtropical evergreen vegetation, flowers, laid neat paths.  The result was a very beautiful and functional area. </p><p>  In the main building of the hotel is the reception, which serves tourists around the clock.  The cozy lobby has tables, soft leather sofas and armchairs, a TV and Wi-Fi.  Also in the lobby there is a shop where popular Thai goods are offered.  At the reception you can hand over things to the left-luggage office, call a doctor, order a taxi, rent a vehicle, exchange currency, and buy excursions. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  It is advisable to plan a vacation in Phuket from November to the end of April, although sometimes in March it can be windy and rainy.  The air temperature during the day is always above +30 degrees Celsius, and the waters off the coast of the Andaman Sea are in the range +26 ... +28 <sup>o</sup> C. Baan Karonburi Resort is located, as noted above, near the best Karon beach in the city.  Here is a paradise for children, since the sand is clean, shallow entry into the water, but the depth begins close to the coast.  A feature of the beach is the lack of free sunbeds.  You can rest here only in the sand, laying a hotel <span>beach towel</span> and installing a hotel umbrella (available in each room).  Sun loungers are only paid (200 baht).  Entertainment here for every taste - water rides, bars, cafes, but also a secluded corner is not difficult to find, since the length of the sandy coastline is quite large. </p>
