The circles that appear on it and are alternating hollows and ridges are an example of mechanical waves.  What is their essence?  Mechanical waves are the process of propagation of vibrations in elastic media. </p><h2>  Waves on the surfaces of liquids </h2><p>  Such mechanical waves exist due to the effect of intermolecular interaction forces and gravity on fluid particles.  People have long been studying this phenomenon.  The most noteworthy are the ocean and sea waves.  As the wind speed increases, they change, and their height increases.  The shape of the waves themselves is also complicated.  In the ocean, they can reach terrifying proportions.  One of the most obvious examples of power is the tsunami, sweeping away everything in its path. </p><h2>  Energy of sea and ocean waves </h2>

They sometimes reach a height of several meters.

    <h2>  Elastic waves </h2><p>  In mechanics, not only vibrations on the surface of a liquid are studied, but also so-called elastic waves.  These are perturbations that propagate in different media under the action of elastic forces in them.  Such a perturbation is any deviation of particles of a given medium from the equilibrium position.  A good example of elastic waves is a long rope or rubber tube attached at one end to something.  If you pull it tight, and then create a disturbance at the second (loose) end of it with a lateral movement, you can see how it ‚Äúruns through‚Äù the entire length of the rope to the support and is reflected back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Source of mechanical waves </h2>

    <p>  The initial perturbation leads to the appearance of waves in the medium.  It is caused by the action of a foreign body, which in physics is called a wave source.  It may be the hand of a person who has rocked the rope, or a pebble thrown into the water.  In the case when the action of the source is short-term in nature, a single wave often appears in the medium.  When the ‚Äúdisturber‚Äù makes long <span>oscillatory movements,</span> waves begin to arise one after another. </p><h2>  Mechanical Wave Conditions </h2><p>  Such fluctuations are not always formed.  A necessary condition for their appearance is the occurrence at the moment of disturbance of the medium of forces that inhibit it, in particular, elasticity.  They tend to bring neighboring particles closer when they diverge, and push them apart from each other at the moment of approach.  The elastic forces acting on particles distant from the source of disturbance begin to bring them out of balance.  Over time, all particles of the medium are involved in one oscillatory motion.  The propagation of such oscillations is a wave. </p><h2>  Mechanical waves in an elastic medium </h2><p>  In an elastic wave, there are 2 types of motion simultaneously: particle vibrations and perturbation propagation.  A longitudinal wave is a mechanical wave whose particles oscillate along the direction of its propagation.  A transverse wave is a wave whose medium particles oscillate across its propagation direction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Properties of mechanical waves </h2>

Compression deformation is accompanied by the appearance of elastic forces.  In this case, <span>shear deformation is</span> associated with the appearance of elastic forces exclusively in solids.  In gaseous and liquid media, a shear of the layers of these media is not accompanied by the occurrence of the aforementioned force.  Due to its properties, longitudinal waves can propagate in any medium, and transverse waves exclusively in solid ones.

    <h2>  Features of waves on the surface of liquids </h2><p>  The waves on the surface of the liquid are not longitudinal or transverse.  They have a more complex, so-called longitudinal-transverse character.  In this case, the fluid particles move in a circle or in elongated ellipses.  <span>Circular movements of</span> particles on the surface of a liquid, and especially with large vibrations, are accompanied by their slow but continuous movement in the direction of wave propagation.  It is these properties of mechanical waves in water that cause the appearance of various seafood on the shore. </p><h2>  Mechanical wave frequency </h2>

So, if an oscillating body will be in a gaseous or liquid medium, then its movement will begin to be transmitted to all particles adjacent to it.  They will involve the following in the process and so on.  In this case, absolutely all points of the medium will begin to oscillate at the same frequency equal to the frequency of the oscillating body.  She is the frequency of the wave.  In other words, this value can be characterized as the <span>frequency of oscillation of</span> points in the medium where the wave propagates.

    <p>  It may not be immediately clear how this process occurs.  Mechanical waves are associated with the transfer of vibrational energy from its source to the periphery of the medium.  In the course of which there are so-called periodic deformations carried by the wave from one point to another.  In this case, the particles of the medium together with the wave do not move.  They oscillate next to their equilibrium position.  That is why the propagation of a mechanical wave is not accompanied by the transfer of matter from one place to another.  Mechanical waves have different frequencies.  Therefore, they were divided into ranges and created a special scale.  Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). </p><h2>  Basic formulas </h2>
