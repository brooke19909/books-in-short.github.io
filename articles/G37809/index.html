    <p>  Who and when first discovered the island, is exactly unknown.  However, since ancient times, the views of many conquerors were riveted to him.  In the capital of the island of Houmt Souk, there is a port, which is considered one of the largest in the whole Mediterranean, and it occupies the first place in the whole country for industrial fishing.  On the streets of the city there are many cafes and restaurants that offer visitors the most delicious and fresh seafood dishes. </p><p>  The island has many beautiful lagoons in which you can see flamingos living here in natural conditions. </p><p>  Hotel SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 * is located near the city of Meduna, which can also be visited.  Of course, there are no special attractions in it, but still it is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to the island: by ferry from the mainland and by plane to Djerba International Airport.  The most popular transport here is a taxi, which will take you to any local attractions.  As a rule, the trip costs 3-4 dollars.  By taxi, you can even arrange a sightseeing tour of the island, which costs about $ 30. </p>

    <p>  Each hotel has representatives of travel agencies offering standard trips.  If you want to calmly and thoroughly see all the interesting places, then it‚Äôs easier to do this by renting a car (rental offices are available in almost every hotel) or using taxi services.  For a detailed study of the sights, you will need two to three days. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing on the island, you should definitely alternate sea baths with sightseeing.  Local guides usually offer a standard set of trips: </p><ol><li>  Visit to a crocodile farm. </li><li>  A walk on a pirate ship. </li><li>  A trip to the Sahara (up to three days). </li><li>  Sightseeing tour of the island. </li></ol><p>  The same tours are offered by representatives of travel agencies at SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 *.  Reviews about them are quite different.  Children really like a <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyage</span> on a pirate ship to a desert island.  For active adults, a trip to the Sahara is interesting.  All excursions are good in their own way.  But those who are not afraid to travel themselves should go on their own to local attractions. </p>

    <p>  Tourists can be advised to visit the Bordj el Kebir fortress near the capital of Houmt Souk, the El Ghriba synagogue, the Djebra Heritage Museum and Entertainment Complex, Jewish settlements, the Guellala Ethnographic Museum, the village of Ajim, the Roman Museum of Local Lore. </p><h2>  SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to discuss the reviews of vacationers about it.  Is he really that good and is it worth recommending to tourists? </p><p>  The complex has a good location and is not too far from the international airport.  Transfer to the hotel taking into account visits to other hotels takes about half an hour.  The complex is located surrounded by a beautiful park on the coast, which is one of the advantages of SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 * (Djerba).  Reviews about the complex as a whole are very good.  The hotel rooms are quite spacious.  All of them are well equipped, but at the same time, guests believe that it is time to renovate them, however this does not affect the quality of rest. </p><p>  Maids clean the apartment daily, and do it in a quality manner (even without a tip).  In addition, towels are changed every day, laying them out in the form of swans and flowers.  Gels and shampoos replenish occasionally, but toilet paper - daily.  The furniture in the apartment is good and of high quality.  Very pleased with the good Wi-Fi signal in the rooms, which allows not only to work, but also to watch movies.  The bathroom has not only a shower cabin, but also a bathtub, which is extremely rare in hotels of this level. </p>

    <p>  The hotel staff practically does not speak Russian, except for the reception staff.  However, it cannot be said that the language barrier is strongly felt.  You can always explain in broken English or gestures to show what you need.  The maids are strikingly clever and instantly bring all that you ask.  At the reception, registration on arrival is very fast, within ten minutes you will receive a room key.  According to tourists, all the staff are very nice and attentive.  Locals are friendly to vacationers. </p><p>  The hotel has its own beautiful beach.  The wide sandy coast will delight even the most spoiled vacationers.  It has everything you need for relaxation, including umbrellas, sun loungers and a bar.  The coast has a gentle slope into the sea, which is very important for those people who come with small children.  The water is very clean and always warm, sometimes waves appear, after which algae can be seen on the coast.  The hotel staff tries to clean them in time.  The hotel's beach is one of its advantages. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to Tunisia, SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 *, the reviews of which are given in the article, can be a great option.  According to tourists, the complex is worthy of attention for many reasons, including well-organized food.  The popular All Inclusive system allows you to experience all the gastronomic delights of relaxation.  A local chef prepares deliciously delicious desserts that are worth a try even for people who don‚Äôt like sweets.  A large assortment of salads, snacks, meat dishes (chicken, beef, turkey), seafood, as well as many fruits are daily served on the buffet.  In addition, guests are given bottles of water for dinner and lunch, so there is no need to buy drinks outside the hotel.  Local alcohol is of acceptable quality.  It is offered free of charge for vacationers who choose All Inclusive. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has animators inviting guests to daytime sporting events and evening shows.  The guys try their best, and this is clear, but at the same time they are completely not intrusive.  Morning begins with exercise and water aerobics, due to which the mood immediately rises and a charge of energy for the whole day appears. </p><p>  Animators also pay attention to young guests, inviting them to participate in entertaining games and entertainment, and in the evenings a mini-disco awaits the kids, after which the children quickly put to sleep. </p><p>  A water park is being built on the territory of the hotel, so it is hoped that in the next season guests will enjoy new water activities.  Of particular note is the park complex.  It is large enough, but very well-groomed and beautiful, it is very pleasant to walk on it.  The warm humid climate of the island is a favorable habitat for insects.  Flies and mosquitoes become too annoying from time to time, so it is better to take appropriate means of dealing with them. </p>

    <p>  Djerba is a beautiful island with an amazing climate and beautiful nature.  Sea vacations certainly need to be alternated with sightseeing.  Experienced tourists are advised to use a taxi or rent a car.  It‚Äôs safe to move along the tracks, as there are currently many checkpoints with the military and police checking documents.  They are loyal to tourists.  Even at the hotel‚Äôs beach there is security at all times, and a patrol car arrives periodically, which gives the impression of a safe rest. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The SunConnect Djerba Aqua Resort 4 * hotel, the reviews of which are given by us in the article, is an excellent four-star complex on the sea coast.  Decent rooms, varied quality food, a beautiful clean beach and a warm sea - all this is the key to a good vacation.  The complex can be considered as an option for a budget holiday, since it fully corresponds to the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio and is considered to be one of the best hotels in Djerba. </p>
