To choose where to spend their holidays, many are reviewing a large number of sites and photos of Egyptian hotels in Hurghada.  We will make a short excursion around this city. </p><h2>  How to get to Hurghada </h2><p>  Direct flights to Hurghada International Airport can be arranged from most European countries.  The best way to get to the hotel from the airport is to take a taxi, preferably, before setting off, agree on a price. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="27.2578957" data-lng="33.81160669999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/9/3/1693.png"></div><p>  Taxis are not the only means of transport in Hurghada, there is a public one - these are minibuses that run throughout the city. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the city </h2><p>  The beautiful resort city of Hurghada is located on the Red Sea coast.  It fully justifies the choice of those who decided to spend their holidays in one of the hotels in Egypt.  In Hurghada, you will be amazed by the clear water of the sea, the golden sand along the coast, the beauty of coral reefs and coastal waters rich in fish.  All this attracts tourists from all over the globe.  Fans of windsurfing, kayaking and even riding a sea bike will enjoy their outdoor activities. </p><p>  <span>El Gouna</span> Beach is one of the best beaches in Egypt.
