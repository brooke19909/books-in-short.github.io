    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, the hotel, as mentioned above, our compatriots liked.  Moreover, it, unlike most others, has a rather large territory of its own and offers food on an all-inclusive basis.  Palm Bay Club Resort is not a new hotel.  But part of the buildings was renovated.  Many former guests are advised to settle in the Rio building if possible.  It has recently been renovated and installed new furniture and appliances.  Tourists also praise the central buildings.  As for the territory, there are a lot of trees, palm trees, several swimming pools, a sun terrace with sunbeds and umbrellas, a playground with tables and chairs where you can relax in the evening while sipping your favorite drink and listening to music.  The hotel also hosts children's and adult animations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma bay club resort 3 el arenal" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1269016.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, in general, according to travelers, all apartments are cozy, clean, with good quality furniture and appliances.  The rooms have everything you need.  All rooms have small balconies.  The only minus of the guests considered not very good soundproofing of the premises.  Therefore, if you are not lucky with your neighbors, you may have to ask the reception administrator to relocate you to other apartments.  Otherwise, there were no complaints from travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma bay club resort 3 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1269015.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service, staff </h2><p>  According to our compatriots staying at the Palm Bay Club Resort, the hotel staff did not disappoint them.  So, all the staff here are very nice, friendly, helpful.  Workers are always ready to help in solving any issue.  So, the reception administrators will always listen to your request and will do everything possible to ensure that it is satisfied.  The same applies to other hotel workers.  True, be prepared for the fact that no one speaks Russian here.  Therefore, you will have to explain in English.  If you have any difficulties in communication, then you can always turn to the Russian-speaking hotel guide.  Surely he will not refuse to help you. </p><p>  As for cleaning the rooms, there were no particular complaints from the guests.  So, vacationers note that the maids carried out dry and wet cleaning daily, threw away garbage, replenished supplies of personal hygiene products.  Towels and bed linen were changed several times a week.  Some tourists, however, complained that sometimes the cleaning was superficial.  However, this did not cause any problems. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots, by their admission, opted for the Palma Bay Club Resort 3 * (El Arenal), including because this hotel offers guests accommodation in the "ol inclusive" system.  This allows guests not to think about the need to look for a place in the city in order to eat during the day.  So, tourists at the hotel are offered three meals a day and snacks between main meals.  Meals are held at several restaurants.  They can be visited depending on the building in which you live.  In general, travelers were satisfied with the quality and variety of food.  So, according to them, for breakfast you can eat eggs cooked in different variations, bacon, sausage, sausages, potato casserole, vegetables and fruits, cheese, yogurt, pastries.  For lunch and dinner, you will be offered several types of meat and seafood, a variety of side dishes, as well as fruits, vegetables, pastries, desserts.  During the day, you can always have a junk food in the snack bar by the main pool.  There are also bars with a wide selection of drinks.  True, according to our compatriots, the lines for drinking are sometimes very long, and it takes a long time to wait. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palma bay club resort 3 spain majorca" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1269013.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As former guests of Palma Bay Club Resort 3 * (Mallorca) note in their comments, the nearest beach can be reached in 10 minutes with a measured step.  Please note that the hotel is located on a small hill.  Therefore, in the direction of the sea you will go downhill, and back the path will be somewhat harder.  Almost all tourists knew about this feature, so there were no difficulties in this regard.  The beaches in the vicinity of Palm Bay, according to our compatriots, are very good.  They are well equipped and constantly cleaned.  For the rental of sun loungers and umbrellas you will need to pay extra (about 15 euros per day).  However, many tourists bring mats and are located right on the sand. </p><h2>  When to go? </h2><p>  For many people planning their vacation, this issue is very relevant.  Judging by the comments of experienced travelers, the height of the holiday season in Mallorca falls on July and August.  These are the hottest months, respectively, and the water in the sea during this period warms up to maximum temperatures.  However, keep in mind that in July and August there will be a lot of tourists.  Many travelers are sure that it is better to visit a place like Mallorca in May-June.  During this period, the resort has warm, but not yet hot weather.  True, the water in the sea in May may be still cool for swimming.  Therefore, during this period it is not recommended to come on a beach holiday with children.  Mallorca in May is a great option for those who want to enjoy this resort without huge crowds of tourists and the sweltering summer heat. </p>
