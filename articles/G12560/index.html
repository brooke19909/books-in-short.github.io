    <h2>  Brief summary of on-lending </h2><p>  Re-lending is a new loan, providing an opportunity to repay an old loan.  In this case, the previous loan must be reissued for a large amount in another bank.  And although such programs are far from being available at all credit organizations, they are at Sberbank of Russia.  We will tell you more about how on-lending works at Sberbank. </p><h2>  Sberbank <span>loan refinancing</span> programs </h2><p>  Currently, the following <span>loan programs</span> are in effect at Sberbank: </p><ul><li>  for refinancing housing loans; </li><li>  consumer lending for refinancing. </li></ul>

So, what are the conditions for such a loan? </p><p>  Describing the conditions for granting a loan, we will be extremely brief.  First, a loan is issued in national currency and in the amount of at least 300,000 rubles.  In turn, the maximum that you can count on is for an amount not exceeding 80% of the total cost of secondary or primary housing - one, and no more than the balance of your debt on a previous loan - two.  By the way, when securing collateral with the property, the total loan amount will also not exceed 80% of the experts' assessment. </p><p>  Secondly, on-lending at Sberbank involves taking a loan without a traditional fee for issuing loans for up to 30 years. </p>

    <h2>  What are the interest rates on mortgage refinancing? </h2><p>  The size of the rate under the mortgage refinancing program at Sberbank directly depends on the estimated maximum term for the loan issued, as well as on whether you are a payroll client of this financial institution.  For example, for a period of up to 10 years, the loan rate for salary clients will be 13.75%, up to 20 years - 14%, and up to 30 - 14.25% per annum.  If you are not a client of Sberbank and get a loan here for the first time, feel free to add another 0.5% per annum to the above-mentioned base rate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What are the requirements for collateral? </h2><p>  If you want to receive a loan from Sberbank, be prepared to provide collateral.  As it is possible to provide ready-made or under construction housing, for which a mortgage loan had previously been issued.  Or you can pledge any other valuable property equivalent to the amount of the loan issued.  If you wish, instead of material security, you have the right to deposit a deposit of at least 3,000,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Insurance: is it necessary or not? </h2><p>  When drawing up a loan refinancing agreement with Sberbank, be prepared for compulsory insurance.  In particular, you have to insure your collateral against possible damage, loss or complete destruction as a result of a natural disaster.  The term of insurance directly depends on the duration of your loan agreement. </p><h2>  Is it possible to refinance at Sberbank and for whom? </h2><p>  Re-lending is possible for Russians, but on condition that they meet the established requirements of the bank.

You must also have six months of experience at your current place of work and total experience of the previous 5 years - from 1 year. </p><p>  In addition, mortgage lending involves the involvement of at least three co-borrowers.  These can be individuals, but with income corresponding to the maximum size of a bank loan.  One of the co-borrowers may be your legal spouse or spouse. </p><h2>  What documents are needed for registration? </h2><p>  Answering the main question ‚Äúis it possible to make on-lending at Sberbank‚Äù, we say: ‚ÄúYes.

However, it can vary and be supplemented by decision of the bank. </p><h2>  How to repay a <span>mortgage refinancing</span> loan <span>?</span> </h2><p>  A similar loan is repaid in monthly annuity (in other words, equal) amounts.

Here are just a refinancing of such loans is not provided.  However, Sberbank has another consumer loan program for these purposes with a view to further lending.  What are the features of this banking product? </p><p>  The main feature of this program is that it can be used to repay up to five current loans received from other lenders.  For example, it can be consumer loans, car loans, as well as current debts on a current overdraft or plastic card. </p><p>  In addition, when meeting the requirements of the bank, each borrower has the opportunity to receive the required amount without submitting a work book and income statement.  In addition, this program does not imply a fee for issuing a loan amount and does not require a collateral. </p><h2>  What are the loan conditions for the consumer program? </h2><p>  You can apply for this loan online or with a personal visit to one of the existing branches of the organization.

    <h2>  What are the loan requirements for refinancing? </h2><p>  This program is characterized by a selective attitude to loans subject to refinancing at Sberbank.  So, for example, the current loan term should not be less than six months, and at least three months before the end of its repayment.  In addition, your problem loan should not be past due.  At least six months, you must regularly repay it and avoid delays. </p><h2>  What are the requirements for borrowers? </h2><p>  Unlike the previous program, persons aged 21 to 65 can apply for this loan.  All other requirements, including general and current work experience, are identical.  That's how re-lending at Sberbank works.  Customer reviews will help you get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe programs. </p>

    <h2>  What do they say about Sberbank refinancing programs? </h2><p>  In order to understand how beneficial refinancing programs are at Sberbank, we turn to the reviews.
