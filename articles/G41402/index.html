The Pearl of the East is located in the very center of the intersection of trade routes in Asia, Africa and Europe.  A large metropolis with an unusual atmosphere has gathered the best achievements that colorful Egypt is proud of. </p><p>  <span>Cairo</span> is the capital of an ancient state and the main religious center of the Islamic world.  In the city of contrasts various cultures harmoniously combine, and in order to see the life of a mysterious country from the inside, you need to visit its heart, mesmerizing with special beauty. </p><h2>  A metropolis famous for its attractions </h2><p>  Located on both banks of the Nile, Cairo is famous for its archaeological, cultural monuments, and millions of tourists rush to touch the ancient history of one of the most developed civilizations in the world.  It is impossible to list all city attractions in the article.  Cairo arose from a small settlement defeated by the military leader Amr ibn al-Ass.  The name of the capital of the state comes from the Arabic al-Qahira, which translates as "victorious." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions cairo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1612512.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The extremely favorable position in the Nile Delta allowed the small town to gradually turn into one of the most influential and richest megalopolises on the planet.  The city, in which magnificent palaces and mosques appear, flourishes every year: the trade in spices and spices, products from precious metals brings good profit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "City of a thousand minarets" </h2><p>  Conditionally, the <span>capital of Egypt</span> can be divided into the Old City and its modern part, which is no different from most megacities.  Here are multi-storey shopping centers and the latest architectural buildings.  The historical part of the capital is located on the east bank of the Nile, and in the Old Town, where you are immersed in the atmosphere of the past, you can meet a variety of religious attractions. </p><p>  Cairo, whose life is greatly influenced by Islam, stuns foreign visitors with the number of mosques, and tourists simply cannot afford to visit them all.  Amazing masterpieces of architecture are striking at first sight.  The fact is that in mosques images of not only human faces, but of all living beings are forbidden, therefore, ancient architects expressed their emotions in an expressive Arabic ornament. </p><h2>  Mosque of Ibn Tulun </h2><p>  Ibn Tulun is the oldest prayer building erected in the 9th century.  For the first time in architecture, powerful arches were used instead of columns, which gave the structure lightness and elegance.  The appearance of the mosque is strict enough so that nothing distracts from prayer, and the ornament is devoid of pretentiousness and unnecessary decorations.  Unnamed architects have achieved a wonderful atmosphere of peace that reigns inside a famous landmark. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt cairo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1612510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An enormous amount of crystal chandeliers suspended from chains is giving admiration, giving the building a bright light.  And to the right of the colorful mosque is the tomb of Pasha Muhammad Ali.  One of the main decorations of the city every day receives guests who admire the sophistication of the interior decoration of spacious halls. </p><h2>  Tv tower </h2><p>  Cairo TV Tower is a symbol of the new Egypt.

With an 187-meter building, stylized as a lotus stem, the acquaintance of foreigners who arrived in the city begins.  This is a very popular place, especially at night.  At the very top there is an observation deck, from the height of which you can see the magnificent pyramids and admire the splendor of the Nile.  No wonder the ancient poets called the blessed Egypt a gift from the River of Life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cairo tv tower" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1612479.jpg" width="335"></div>
