Tourists from Russia to Athens need to change to either local planes or a ferry.  The flight time from Moscow to the Greek capital is 3.5 hours, and then to the island another 50 minutes.  The ferry trip will last about 14 hours.  From October to the end of April, international flights are canceled, they remain only from Athens, Rhodes and Crete.  Ferries run year-round.  To reach them to Kos is possible not only from Athens, but also from many other Greek islands. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Corali Hotel 4 * is a medium-sized hotel, representing one building and several pretty bungalows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corali Hotel 4 Greece" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473546.jpg" width="395"></div>  All buildings are located in an unusually beautiful landscaped area, where the paths in the emerald green grass are tiled, affectionately waving palm branches, and flowers are everywhere full of flowers.

    <p>  Most Greek hotels provide three types of food - breakfast only, half board, including breakfast and dinner, and All Inclusive.  This system feeds in the morning, afternoon and evening, in addition, snacks are provided throughout the day.  This type of food is most preferable if you stay at Corali Hotel 4 * (Kos).  Guest reviews indicate the inconvenience of half board due to the remoteness from the village, and even more so the city where you can eat.  But if you rent a car for the whole vacation time, then the distance will not be a problem.  Then, on the contrary, it is better to take a tour with breakfast only, so as not to be tied to the distribution of food at the hotel.  And there is where to eat on the Spit.  These are numerous multilevel restaurants and taverns in the center, and small, but family-friendly cozy restaurants somewhere in the mountains, from where magnificent views of the sea and the island open.  The hotel service is based on the buffet.  Breakfast here is continental, with not very varied dishes, but the products are all fresh and of high quality.  The menu includes cereals, sausages, eggs (scrambled eggs or boiled), milk, coffee, tea, juice, jam, pastries.  For lunch and dinner, they prepare national meat and fish dishes, vegetables, salads, serve fruit, ice cream.  From alcoholic drinks are offered beer, ouzo, crayfish, wine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corali Hotel 4 Kos reviews" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473547.jpg" width="423"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Many tourists just for a beach holiday come to the island of Kos.  Corali Hotel 4 * from the sea is located 400 meters, but there is no beach there.  To him from the hotel to go about a kilometer.  The beach in Tigaki is wonderful.  Its length is almost 10 km!  To some, he seems dirty, but that‚Äôs not at all.  Just the sand here is of volcanic origin, hence the dark color.  The sea along the coast is shallow and warm, and the water is clean, clear and fairly dense.  Out of habit, many have the impression that he is being pushed up.  But on such water it is delightful to lie, swinging on the waves, and look into the bottomless blue sky.  Shore on the beach is gentle, comfortable for kids.  The winds in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island are small, there are practically no storms or, as the Greeks say, ‚Äúfortunes‚Äù in the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Corali Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473542.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Corali Hotel 4 * does not arrange entertainment shows or any <span>kind of animation.</span>  So-called Greek evenings are held only twice a month.  Vacationers entertain themselves.  In the afternoon this, of course, is the beach, as well as relaxation by one of the pools.  Sports enthusiasts can play golf, billiards, tennis or volleyball.  You can also devote time to excursions.  Sin, having arrived in Kos, did not visit the temple of Asclepius, which healed so well that it became immortal.  In its heyday, the temple was three-level, with thermal baths, which had healing power.  Presentations are often held here, for example, oaths to the great Hippocrates, a native of these places.  There is a museum next to the temple, which has the most valuable archiexpoons and a medical center.  Of interest is a tour of the vineyards and winery with a visit to the tasting room.  Nature lovers can go to the nature reserve.  In the fall, flamingos live there.  Fans of sea cruises can take a tour on a yacht.  It is also interesting to simply ride around the island, admire its beauties.  And there are still thermal springs on the Spit.  They are located near the island capital.  Evenings can also be spent richly and interestingly.  All guests of the island are waiting for numerous restaurants, bars with live music and discos, which, as a rule, close only in the morning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kos Corali Hotel 4" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473543.jpg" width="376"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  From May to September, inclusive, Corali Hotel 4 * hospitably opens its doors.  Greece is a very beautiful country.  A distinctive feature of its inhabitants is friendliness and friendliness.  All this is present in the hotel, each employee of which tries to do everything so that the guests are satisfied.  However, some do not like the prevalence of tourists from Germany in this hotel.  This is not surprising, because many German companies conclude long-term contracts with Greek hotels, which stipulate special conditions for their customers.  If Russian tour operators work in the same direction, there will be more Russians at the hotel.  The hotel reception is open around the clock.  Nobody speaks Russian there, but everyone speaks English fluently, therefore, knowing at least the basics of this international language will be easy to explain. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of vacationers in Corali Hotel 4 * reviews about it leave very positive.  The main epithets characterizing this hotel are: ‚Äúvery good‚Äù, ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù, ‚Äúthe best‚Äù.  Especially a lot of kind words about the work of the staff, the quality of service, creating the atmosphere of the holiday.  The hotel rooms are spotlessly clean, quality cleaning, linen washed and ironed.  The selection of dishes and the presence of the German contingent of vacationers are rather poor in comparison with the Turkish ‚Äúfives‚Äù.  But you must admit, these are such trifles in comparison with the magnificent relaxation that Corali Hotel gives! </p>
