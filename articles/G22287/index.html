    <p>  Inconspicuous, this is how you can characterize the phone "Arc X5".  Like other models of the company, the device does not stand out against the general background.  The modern user is interested not only in the "filling" of the device, but also in its appearance.  Unfortunately, the "Arc X5" is not able to boast of a bright design. </p><p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs decision to make the device‚Äôs corners sharp is rather reckless.  The rectangular shape, together with the usual colors create a repulsive effect.  The buyer, even knowing the characteristics, will not pay attention to the phone "Arc X5".  The smartphone is made entirely of plastic, and the quality is poor.  Although the material seems lightweight, the device weighs as much as 165 grams.  The hand quickly gets tired of working with the device. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of all Arc devices is fragility.  Plastic is not of the best quality, it is definitely not intended for falls.  Minor scratches literally instantly appear on the phone.  Fingerprints will also become a problem.  The lack of <span>oleophobic coating</span> can be seen by the number of prints and dirt on the device.  Especially the back panel suffers from fingers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  External elements only worsened unpretentious appearance.  At the back of the device are placed: a flash, a main camera and a logo.  However, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot located in the center, but in the corner.  This solution does not add to the attractiveness of the model.  On the front part is also of little interest.  The display, controls, earpiece, front camera, sensors and display are located in front of the device.  It should be noted that there is no backlight on the touch buttons. </p><p>  The upper end was taken under the USB jack and headset jack.  At the bottom of the device are a speaker and a microphone.  The left side is empty, and on the right is the volume control along with the power button. </p><p>  X5 is produced exclusively in black and white.  Standard colors further highlight all the flaws of the case.  On the black version, fingerprints are especially noticeable, and the white one focuses on the corners of the device.  The only excuse for such a repulsive design is its low cost. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Got a phone "Arc X5" matrix of five megapixels.  The software <span>interpolation of the camera</span> slightly improves the quality up to 8 MP.  Of course, the images lack sharpness and detail.  The image is decent, as for 5 megapixels.  Expect more from a cheap device is not worth it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The HDR feature improves the situation, allowing you to get rid of a little blur.  There is also a macro mode in "Arc X5".  The smartphone is able to take good pictures of the text, but only in good light.  Actually, the whole work of the camera depends on the amount of light.  With perfect lighting, the image remotely resembles 8 MP.  Although in most cases, the photo corresponds to cheap devices. </p><p>  The device is capable of recording videos with Full HD-quality.  However, in reality, the video, like the photo, is blurry.  It is especially problematic to shoot objects in motion. </p><p>  Corresponds to the price and frontalka.  As the front camera, a 2 MP matrix was installed.  The front camera is suitable for video communication and in some cases for photos.  The user can make a self portrait only in good lighting. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Really surprise the phone "Arc X5" with its screen.  The manufacturer has equipped its offspring with a 5-inch display.  Of course, there is a similar diagonal in other state employees, but the resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels is very rare.  It is almost impossible to notice ‚Äúcubes‚Äù on the screen. </p><p>  Not without the usual IPS-matrix for modern devices.  The brightness and visibility of the Doogee X5 is significantly better than that of devices using TFT technology.  There is a slight distortion of the image when tilted, but the state employee can forgive this.  With brightness, too, problems should not arise.  Of course, on a sunny day, the regulator will have to be set to maximum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The display has one unpleasant feature.  The device‚Äôs sensor supports only two touches.  This should not affect work, although games can cause difficulties. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  The device is equipped with a 2400 maH battery.  Although the capacity declared by the manufacturer is still slightly different from the real one.  In fact, the phone‚Äôs battery is only 2200 maH.  But even such a difference did not affect the excellent autonomy.  The smartphone will "live" with minimal use for two whole days.  Calls, working with the Internet and small tasks will "put" the battery in a day.  Watching the video discharges the "Arc X5" much faster.  The smartphone will only work for 6 hours when playing clips. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The manufacturer installed a whole gigabyte of RAM in the "Arc X5".  Features fit not only for everyday tasks, but also for games.  Usually, 512 MB is found in low-cost devices, but apparently the savings on camera and design allowed the company to ‚Äúfork out‚Äù and increase productivity. </p><p>  Not bad things are with the native memory.  The phone received from the manufacturer as much as 8 GB.  Available for use a little less, only 5.5 GB, the rest of the memory is reserved for the system.  There is also a flash drive slot for expanding the volume.  Supports card slot up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The processor "Arc X5 Pro" is much more powerful than that of a colleague without a prefix, but there is something to surprise the ordinary model with.  The device works under the guidance of the MTK chip familiar to the Chinese.  The processor model 6580 is a slightly truncated version of 6582. The phone has four cores, each of them operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  The frankly weak Mali-400 MP is responsible for the graphics. </p><p>  Despite the stripped-down version of the chip and the weak video accelerator, the performance of the ‚ÄúArc X5‚Äù is decent.  The device will cope with most programs.  There will be no problems with games either.  The only thing the user has to do is set the graphics to minimal. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  About the low cost of the device says its set of delivery.  In the box, the buyer will find X5 itself, a network adapter, a USB cable.  This is all the equipment.  The cost of the device will have to include the necessary gadgets.  For example, the user will need a headset, a cover on the ‚ÄúX5 Arc‚Äù and, possibly, a flash drive.  The user can not do without additional protection of the device, because the quality of the material is low. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone is capable of working in 2G and 3G networks.  There is also a GPS module in the device.  The smartphone supports two SIM cards, but when you call one of them is turned off.  Not without the usual Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  In "Arc X5" installed OS "Android 5.1".  The system works stably and is well adapted for a smartphone.  On top of the OS, the manufacturer installed its own shell.  Fortunately, there were no "Chinese programs."  There is also little interesting, the usual system, without any chips and additions. </p><h2>  Cost </h2>

    <p>  Particularly attractive in the "Arc X5" price.  The cost of the device ranges from 4 to 4.5 thousand rubles.  For such a reasonable price, the buyer receives a powerful, albeit unattractive device.  The ability to install two SIM cards and a powerful ‚Äústuffing‚Äù hint that the phone is an excellent choice for work and calls. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage of the device is the presence of a large, bright display.  The screen attracted customers with a quality that is rarely found in low-cost devices.  Full HD resolution is enough for watching videos, games and working with the Internet. </p><p>  Of interest is the filling of "Arc X5".  Reviews noted that the smartphone is smart.  In games, the hardware also shows its best side.  For example, Asphalt 8 on X5 starts up and works without any problems.  Although the user needs to lower the settings to a minimum. </p><p>  The amount of memory is also unusual for an inexpensive phone.  The user gets a whole gigabyte of RAM.  Do not deprive the device and internal memory.  Affordable 5.5 GB expandable flash drive look good even on mid-range devices. </p><p>  <span>Overview Doogee X5 is</span> particularly pleased with the version of "Android".  The system has greatly expanded the choice of installed programs.  Users noted an unobtrusive shell, at least there are no Chinese applications. </p><p>  Most of the owners chose the "Arc X5" precisely because of its low cost.  The price is more than affordable, and almost any device can afford it.  The requested 4 thousand rubles for such a device look just ridiculous. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The main disadvantage of the device is its camera.  Although you should not expect good quality images from a budget employee.  The usual 5-megapixel matrix does not stand out from the rest of the devices.  The camera lacks sharpness, detail and brightness.  Only in good lighting can you get a good shot. </p><p>  The design of the "Arc X5" is also frankly bad.  The material is not of the best quality and the rectangular case resembles cheap models produced several years ago.  Despite the price, the manufacturer could make the X5 more interesting, or at least round the corners.  Afflict users and fingerprints on the device.  The phone case is a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù for dirt and fingerprints. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Although the Doogee X5 has many shortcomings and weaknesses, the device is definitely a success.  Against the background of minor problems, the pros look even brighter.  A modern system, a high-quality display, hardware - they smooth out all the shortcomings.  Once again, the company was able to surprise.  Creating a cheap and powerful device requires considerable skill. </p>
