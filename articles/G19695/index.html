    <p>  To begin with, we note that the task of any user is to choose the most affordable tablet with a good camera, low battery consumption and high performance.  It is logical that each of us, acquiring a mobile device of any type, is inclined to expect better indicators from it.  But this does not happen. </p><p>  Making a choice, we are forced to sacrifice something.  If we talk about the acquisition of high-performance devices from leading companies, then in this case we donate money.  If you look for a <span>budget tablet</span> with a good camera, its performance and build quality may ‚Äúsuffer‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, the task of each buyer is to find and find the very ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù.  Selecting it, he will receive a device suitable for any task.  In this article we will try to orient the reader just to search for such a model. </p><h2>  Tablet battery </h2><p>  Let's start with the battery, because it determines the duration of the device.  Many buyers, however, underestimate such a parameter as battery capacity, simply not giving it any importance.  And in vain. </p>

    <p>  Since the importance of a capacious battery for your mobile device, you will understand in the first days of working with it.  Perhaps the priority for you is to buy a tablet with a good camera;  but in the case of a small battery capacity, after a couple of hours of filming, the device will sit down and you will have no choice but to put it aside and wait until it becomes possible to connect to the network.  Believe me, this is very annoying. </p><p>  Therefore, you need to try to find a model that will have a more capacious battery that can hold a charge for longer.  However, it should be understood that the duration of the device depends on two criteria - charge and battery capacity.  If the latter has small dimensions (which is what manufacturers strive for, making the tablets minimal in thickness), respectively, it can not show a large capacity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, there must be a balance between how much space the battery takes and how long it can provide the gadget. </p><h2>  We select the battery for the screen </h2>

    <p>  The battery capacity that we already mentioned is measured in milliampere-hours.  In a letter, this value is indicated as "mAh".  You can see it in the technical specifications of any tablet or phone.  The higher the specified indicator, the longer the gadget can work without additional charge. </p><p>  However, there is another factor - the level of charge consumption.  It, in turn, depends on the capabilities of the device.  If, say, a simple keyboard phone has a battery of 700mAh for a week, then for a 7-inch tablet a battery of 3500 mAh is a day of work. </p><p>  There is such an installation: pick up the battery should be the size of the display.  Let's say for 7 inches 3500 mAh and more - this is normal;  for 8 - 4200 mAh, 9- and 10-inch tablets will work perfectly with 6 and 7 thousandth batteries.  Recall, this is about ensuring that your gadget is enough for at least a day of work. </p><p>  When choosing devices, do not forget that a tablet with a good camera and battery will cost a lot.  True, it will be much more comfortable to use it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Charge rate </h2>

    <p>  We remembered how to calculate the battery capacity depending on the diagonal of the screen for the reason that the screen "pulls" the bulk of the charge.  True, this is not a single form of battery consumption.  There are other factors, such as processor performance.  And in fact, the way the functionality of the latter is coordinated affects the duration of the device on a single charge. </p><p>  A sign that the processor in the tablet is not working efficiently is its excessive heating.  It comes, as a rule, in the case of working with "bulky" applications that take up a lot of resources. </p><p>  According to user reviews, you can observe such a problem on <span>budget-</span> class <span>devices</span> , for example, the cheapest Lenovo, some models of Asus, Samsung and other companies.  The trend is that if the gadget belongs to the low price segment, then the optimization of the charge consumption is lower, which means that the battery lasts for a much shorter period. </p><p>  On the other hand, it should be noted on a positive side that flagship models like Apple products, ‚Äútop-end‚Äù devices from Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and other companies are working.  There, in addition to capacious batteries, there is also an element of optimizing the operation of the device itself, which increases the capabilities of the tablet. </p><h2>  Cameras in tablets </h2><p>  Well, about the batteries, perhaps everything is clear: we look at the class of the device and the battery capacity indicator (measured in mAh).  But what about the other important component - the camera installed on the tablet? </p>

    <p>  In this regard, I would like to note that cameras are usually installed on tablet computers, as a rule, weak.  At best, these are analogues of those that are on smartphones.  In this regard, you should not expect high-quality images from most devices. </p><p>  Moreover, if we talk about the front camera, designed for "selfie", then its quality, as a rule, is quite consistent with the task: a picture taken at close range is obtained not bad.  As the reviews show, tablets with a good front camera are almost all ‚Äúflagships‚Äù, as well as some devices from the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù segment: Samsung, devices from Asus, LG. </p><p>  But the main camera, which can take pictures of landscapes, various poorly (or too brightly lit) objects, etc., does not always cope with the task.  Again, especially on inexpensive tablets. </p><h2>  What do megapixels mean? </h2><p>  Most often, the gadget is selected by the number of "megapixels".  This is a parameter characterizing the resolution of the device‚Äôs camera.  On most devices, it varies between 5, 8, or 12 units.  It is generally accepted that the greater this indicator, the more high-quality images the camera makes.  However, this is not always the case. </p>

    <p>  An important role, if you are looking for a tablet with a good camera, the matrix plays.  This is the main element of the entire device responsible for creating the picture.  The quality of her work determines how the pictures will be obtained.  If a tablet with all ‚Äú12 megapixels‚Äù specifications contains a cheap Chinese matrix, the quality of the pictures will be disgusting.  Therefore, you should focus on which tablet has a good camera, according to the manufacturer. </p><p>  For example, Sony has excellent cameras: the company is engaged in their production and even sells to Apple and several other manufacturers.  Again, the Apple iPad, Samsung Tab S8.4 and Galaxy Note, LG, Sony Xperia Z3, Meizu Mi Pad, Huawei MediaPad have good cameras (each model, taking into account its price, of course).  While most devices from Lenovo (A3000, for example), as well as many little-known Chinese companies make tablets, photos from which are not of the best quality.  At least user reviews indicate this. </p><h2>  Camera for video and flash </h2><p>  When looking for a device for photographing and shooting videos, do not forget about the flash.  As the reviews show, working with it on the tablet is much more convenient, and photos in low light turn out to be better.  The flash is not only on expensive and medium-priced gadgets (iPad, <span>Samsung Note, Samsung</span> Tab), but also on inexpensive tablets (Nomi, Assistant, Impression, Ainol, MYTAB and others).  So picking up a computer with lighting for pictures is not so difficult. </p>

    <p>  Another issue is cameras for video.  Here you need to look not at the number of megapixels, but at the video resolution.  A good indicator is the resolution of 720p, excellent - 1080p (HD - quality).  So, for example, removes Asus Eee Transformer or the same Apple iPad. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In fact, choosing a device that will satisfy you is not so difficult.  Or we determine the price and the manufacturer and take, for example, a Samsung tablet with a good camera - some kind of Galaxy Tab Pro, for example.  Another option is to look for technical parameters among the available devices and select something like Asus Nexus, Huawei or Meizu.  Among the little-known models, as well as among Chinese products, you can also find many decent devices. </p><h2>  Reviews will help you navigate </h2><p>  Also do not forget to read the reviews.  About each device today you can find a lot of recommendations from those who have already had the opportunity to work with it.  This helps to get some information about how the device behaves in practice, find a tablet with a good camera and flash and know what moments you should pay attention to, what kind of device has strengths or weaknesses. </p>
