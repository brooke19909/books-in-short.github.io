    <h2>  Network failure </h2><p>  If "iPhone 4" does not catch the network (like any other gadget), it is likely that the reason for this was a malfunction in the mobile operator.  That is, it is he who has a failure.  Accordingly, all subscribers will not be able to use the connection. </p><p>  Fortunately, this is a temporary phenomenon.  As soon as the operator corrects the problem, the connection is restored.  You can either wait a bit or use a SIM card of another company. </p><h2>  SIM card malfunction </h2><p>  Does your iPhone not catch the network?  There are a lot of options for the development of events.  The next point that should not be overlooked is the malfunction of the SIM card.  A similar problem rarely occurs, but it does have a place to be. </p><p>  Remove the SIM card from the device, then insert it into another gadget.  Is there no network anyway?  Then you just have to change the SIM card.  After all, it is she who is the main source of our today's problem.  Not a very serious phenomenon, only finding it can be problematic.  SIM cards rarely come into a dysfunctional state, and it‚Äôs hard to think that it was this trouble that happened to you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The possible scenarios do not end there.

    <h2>  date and time </h2><p>  For example, make sure the device has the correct date.  Don't forget about time either!  It is hard to imagine, but on modern gadgets communication problems can occur for incredible reasons. </p><p>  It turned out that the date is not true?  Then, independently, in the settings, change it to the one that takes place at the moment.  Of course, also set the clock to the required indicator.  Sometimes it‚Äôs better to do this with a Wi-Fi network and synchronization. </p><p>  As practice shows, most often this is what helps to solve the problem that the iPhone does not catch the network.  Therefore, before you sound the alarm, you must first eliminate this problem.  After all, otherwise you can never find out what the matter really is. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  "IPhone 4" does not catch the network?  This phenomenon is often observed not only among owners of this gadget.  People with regular smartphones sometimes also complain about the device constantly searching for a network.  What could be causing this? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone does not catch the network what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1355724.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, your location.  Remember, communication itself is not caught everywhere.  And so it can disappear.  When you are in the subway, elevator or underground parking, no matter how you try, you will not be able to call.  Only in rare cases.  Also, the device is not capable of catching a network in the forest and places remote from civilization. </p><p>  So, "iPhone" does not catch the network.  What to do in order to rectify the situation?  You can just change your location.  Move to where the net was usually well caught.  We'll have to wait a few minutes.  Look at the result - did it work out?  If not, you need to look for a reason elsewhere.  If so, then carefully monitor where you are.  Mobile communications are far from everywhere. </p><h2>  Card lock </h2><p>  "IPhone" - a device that requires compliance with special rules when using it.  Therefore, do not be surprised at some network failures.  It is likely that you still have the factory settings.  And the smartphone was initially blocked by one SIM card, and the mobile device will work only with the "SIM cards" of one particular operator. </p><p>  So, if you received a message from iPhone 5: "No network", it's time for you to change the factory settings.  It is advisable to use the appropriate service for this in service centers.  Otherwise, you can generally make an idle gadget out of the iPhone.  After collecting the factory settings, as a rule, the network appears.  And you can work with all mobile operators without problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone network search" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1355723.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Do you have a network search on your iPhone constantly?  Try to analyze your past actions.  If previously the connection worked fine, but then suddenly it suddenly began to fail, then something went wrong. </p><p>  For example, your device has been infected with viruses.  This is also a common case that users do not take into account so often.  Infection of any system disables the gadget.  And on the "iPhone" this can be expressed through the complete loss of the network or its constant failures. </p><p>  Of course, in order to correct the situation, it is necessary to treat the device.  This is done independently with the help of special antiviruses.  You can also go to service centers for help.  In any case, if you cure the gadget, it will begin to work in full force without interruption. </p><h2>  Gadget malfunction </h2>
