  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY brooch from old buttons</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A cute little thing made by yourself can be the perfect final touch to your look.  This is probably why handmade jewelry never goes out of style.  Such jewelry is not only an expression of our individuality and taste, but also part of the spiritual work that is commonly called creativity. </p><p>  Today we offer to make beautiful brooches with our own hands from improvised materials: pieces of fabric, old buttons, beads and beads.  Conduct an audit in your needlework box.  Perhaps there will be found many interesting and quite suitable for our noble purpose. </p><p>  The thrifty housewife always, before throwing away clothes, cuts off buttons from her and folds them for storage.  Today, these stocks come in handy for making cute flower-shaped brooches.  To work, you will need super-glue, five flat buttons of the same diameter and one larger size - to the center, a little thin foam rubber, a piece of beautiful fabric, a ready-made brooch clasp and a little felt. </p><p>  From a large button we have to build the core of the flower.  To do this, cut a circle of the same diameter from the foam rubber.  Glue it on the front surface of the button and wrap it with cloth.  We cut off the excess, so that there is a small margin for bending, and tighten the edges with a thread, with a <span>‚Äúforward needle‚Äù seam.</span>  Glue felt on the back to cover all unnecessary.  We lay out the buttons of a smaller diameter in a circle, like the petals of a flower, and carefully apply glue.  We fix the core and press lightly.  After the glue dries, we fix the fastener on the back of the jewelry and close the connection with a piece of felt. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even a small needlewoman will be able to make such a brooch with her own hands.  What is not a <span>summer vacation</span> activity <span>?</span>  By the way, this decoration is great not only for clothes, but also for a school backpack. </p><p>  If one very beautiful large button is lost in your casket, it can be completely put into action.  Let it become the center of a stylized floral arrangement. </p><p>  In addition, for making a brooch, you will need several smaller flat buttons, thin wire, Moment glue, and a fastener.  To hide the joints, use a piece of leather or felt. </p><p>  We pass the wire through the small buttons, draw it through the holes crosswise and twist the ends together.  We make several such parts with legs of different lengths.  Now we fix each of them from the wrong side of a large button, having a sector or a semicircle.  We close the junction and attach the fastener.  As you can see, making a brooch with your own hands is not at all difficult.  It will not take so much time, but in the end you will get a pretty and unique little thing. </p><p>  A beautiful, but no longer needed, button may well become a fixture for a chic satin and lace brooch.  True, everything else will have to be purchased at the store.  You will need a <span>satin ribbon in</span> two colors (each meter), 40 cm of organza-based lace border (7-8 cm wide), as well as silk sewing threads and a brooch blank (sold in needlework stores). </p><p>  We cut the tape of one color into eight parts.  We melt the edges so as not to crumble.  Fold in half and sew in pairs at an angle of about 30 degrees.  Divide another piece of tape into the same eight parts, but the segments will be a couple of centimeters shorter.  We repeat all the previous operations and collect the tape on the base, removing the protection from the adhesive surface.  The result should be a two-color outlet. </p><p>  We sew the lace along the free edge, collect it on a thread and tighten it.  We place the brooches in the center and fix with the help of a button.  You don‚Äôt have to admit that this brooch was made in your kitchen in your own kitchen.  Such an adornment is quite a designer's one. </p><p>  I must say that the process of creativity is a pleasure incomparable with anything.  When you make a bracelet, earrings, a ring or a brooch with your own hands, you wear this jewelry with special pride.  It is possible that over time, a hobby will develop into a more serious occupation and become a life's work. </p>
