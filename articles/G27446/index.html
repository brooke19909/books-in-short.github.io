  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The last battle of Napoleon: place of battle, date, historical facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few rulers today are worthy to occupy the minds of young people who are eager for knowledge.  If modern youths found themselves in France since the time of the great Napoleon Bonaparte, then many of them would immediately abandon their studies.  And after reaching eighteen, they would have gone into the army.  It was so popular then to serve for the benefit of one‚Äôs vast country, and so in those days young people were patriots.  In fashion salons they talked only about military operations. </p><p>  Each campaign of a strong leader brought a lot of money.  Industrialists received vast territories under their control, which immediately began to cultivate.  Merchants could expand the network of the trade department, capturing rare goods at a low price.  Everyone was happy, and after the army was armed with the latest technology, Napoleon decided to go to war on a powerful neighbor - the Russian Empire.  And what was the last battle for him?  In what battle did Napoleon die?  This is what we will try to find out. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  Many modern children really do not know in what battle Napoleon died.  "In the last" - so many say.  All of them make a gross mistake.  Although the head of France had every chance of dying on the battlefield, but for his deeds, after which the country did not have money for any serious reform, Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to exile on the island of St. Helena, where he died after a heartbreak.  But if Napoleon Bonaparte could have won in his last battle, now the world would probably have been completely different. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon's last battle of the year" class="if uuid-2543094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543094.jpg"></div><h2>  The actions of the Russian Empire </h2><p>  After France declared war, the troops immediately began a quick march.  The direct task was to cross the border with the Russian Empire in a couple of days and, choosing the two main roads (as they were called at that time - the merchant and the south), go straight to Moscow.  The stake was made on the fact that the Russian army is in very terrible condition.  The authorities did not have time to modernize the troops, and all the uniforms, including weapons, were simply old-fashioned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, nevertheless, the emperor decided to immediately repulse the French army.  The place of the last battle of Napoleon was decided to be held on the approaches to Voronezh, having gathered a significant contingent of troops around it.  They left immediately after the decision was made publicly available.  From the window everyone shouted joyfully and applauded to the brave soldiers who were going to die for their native country. </p><h2>  Some nuances </h2><p>  And everything would have happened already at this stage, if not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù.  Since the troops could not go together, it was decided to join forces near Voronezh.  And the commanders hit the road.  Only here the food supply was very different.  If one platoon calmly walked to the designated place, making rare rests, then other units first had to pick up food in the villages, and then move on, losing speed.  So by the time of the designated attack, only thirty percent of all sent forces were in place. </p><p>  The French easily crushed rare resistance.  Those troops that did not have time to reach the point will try to unite among themselves several times, only again nothing good will come of this venture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldatlas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the last battle of napoleon" class="if uuid-2543087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543087.jpg"></div><h2>  Battle of Borodino </h2><p>  The last battle of Napoleon in Russia occurred after a series of several important events.  In order not to give Moscow to the enemy, it was decided to burn it to the ground.  When the French entered a large city, wanting to take it by force, and after replenishing supplies of water and food, they saw only burnt ashes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At that very moment, many were shocked by the desire of the Russians to go to the end.  This is what surviving soldiers describe in their memoirs: ‚ÄúWe have never seen such a terrible sight.  The whole city was buried, forgotten in time, like ancient Babylon.  Moscow fell, and then we began to die. ‚Äù </p><p>  And really.  After no one began to sign a peace treaty in the capital, only one thing followed - the continuation of the war.  Only now there was no more food to fight, no gunpowder with buckshot.  Small convoys of Russian formations intercepted convoys with supplies and ammunition halfway, killing soldiers without much difficulty.  Napoleon‚Äôs army was deprived of the opportunity to conduct a major battle, forcing him to retreat. </p><p>  In the meantime, it was possible to assemble a single strike group, which should have completely put an end to this dubious military company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royal-irish.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The last battle of Napoleon in Russia" class="if uuid-2543097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543097.jpg"></div><h2>  Battle of Borodino.  Hostilities </h2><p>  What battle was Napoleon's last battle?  Maybe Borodino?  The attack began in the early morning.  The two infantry marched at each other, sometimes firing off over their heads.  Bullets were supposed to get into the second row, undermining the formation.  It didn‚Äôt work out very well, since very few people took a correction for the wind in those days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Enemy artillery began to work from the mountain.  The cannons fired explosive shells, trying to hit the very center of the Russian infantry.  Meanwhile, small groups of soldiers set off from the two flanks.  The task was to intercept the height, disarm artillery.  And deploying guns against their actual owners, hit what is urine. </p><p>  But several units were sent to defend the key link in the entire operation.  The Russians were crushed by numbers, since already at that moment successfully located defensive battles destroyed several important detachments. </p><p>  When there was virtually no hope, and in a couple of minutes the army would have fallen, the second phase began.  Bagration's cavalry jumped out of the woods in full steam, hidden there since last evening.  Seeing their own eyes, filled with bloody fury, the soldiers rushed with renewed vigor into the battle. </p><p>  The French soldiers were greatly frightened by this plot twist.  Many fled in panic from the battlefield, throwing their weapons to the ground.  After a couple of hours, the battle ended in victory for the Russian Empire.  The time has come to collect the bodies, to consider the dead.  And after burying them in damp land and celebrating that many remained alive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reference.com" data-author=": DEA / G. DAGLI ORTI, "><img itemprop="image" alt="in what battle did Napoleon lose in the last" class="if uuid-2543099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543099.jpg"></div><h2>  Sunset political career </h2><p>  So to the question in which last battle Napoleon lost, we can safely answer that in Borodino.  It was there that the ideal version of world domination first suffered a crushing collapse.  Upon returning to France, the ruler of fate was removed from his post and sent under arrest to Helena.  Changes have begun throughout the country.  The nobility began to regain power, using failure in the military field, as a key way to reduce the popularity of Napoleon. </p><p>  And yet, this was not the last battle of Napoleon.  The year 1812 turned out to be unlucky for Bonaparte, since the situation was like the actual sunset of his political career.  Supporters preferred to remain silent so as not to lose their key positions at the right time.  You could simply begin to serve the new masters and forget that you once once supported with all your heart a native of the people. </p><p>  High-profile court cases have begun.  They tried to eliminate all friends and close associates of the commander.  Several of them, sensing danger, fled the country.  Others were less fortunate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiatoday.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="place of the last battle of napoleon" class="if uuid-2543102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543102.jpg"></div><h2>  100 days of solitude </h2><p>  On the island of St. Helena, however, Napoleon was treated like a king.  He had the opportunity to correspond, which for those times was unacceptable luxury.  Only his trustees guarded him, who, all as one, were for him, and not against.  Even then, the idea came back and try again to stand at the head of the country. </p><p>  But in order to collect the old guard, it took time.  It was necessary to very delicately understand who would not mind again organizing a small military coup.  At the same time, one should not forget that, although Napoleon could have correspondence, all of it was read immediately after it fell into the hands of a special person.  It was necessary to select words so gracefully, so skillfully to hide the true meaning behind a mountain of other meanings, so that no one could recognize in this letter a clear call for urgent action. </p><p>  Napoleon believed that there was still a chance to change the balance of power in his favor.  The new government was extremely weak, and its entire policy was built on the destruction of the legacy of the past.  The French, on the other hand, needed nose blood that needed ideals to follow.  As soon as they were deprived of national pride, as soon as successful victories were taken away, a riot occurred in the hearts of many people. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the government began to surrender the lands conquered by Napoleon.  To get foreign loans, it was necessary to cajole states that already hated France.  Having recognized Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs war terror regime as illegal and contrary to the constitution, officials began negotiations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the last battle of napoleon at waterloo" class="if uuid-2543104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543104.jpg"></div><h2>  Escape from St. Helena </h2><p>  When the little resistance was ready, the final action began.  Everything was at stake and it was pointless to retreat.  A little more, and the proud France of Napoleon would forever lose its greatness.  The commander in chief could not allow such a cross-out of personal merits.  After the guard he needed was put up near Napoleon, immediate actions began.  The man was given weapons and money, and they were also explained how and where the posts would be placed.  Under cover of night, the captive left his island, to which he would definitely return.  But it will be later. </p><h2>  Army mobilization </h2><p>  As soon as the news of Napoleon's escape came to ordinary people, a mad excitement began.  Everyone was literally happy, predicting a new order and the return of old foundations.  People were very offended by the new government, not realizing that if the officials hadn‚Äôt found the money, then all of France would go around the world.  However, the French liked the sense of belonging to great victories much more than the economic stability of their country. </p><p>  Young youths, as before, began to join the ranks of the Napoleonic army.  Armament was provided by generals devoted to the leader to the very end.  Upon learning that the prisoner had left his cell, the government decided to act quickly.  Since many countries were directly interested in the fact that Napoleon did not again take the helm of France, it was decided to create a military coalition. </p><p>  By the time of the Battle of Waterloo, the situation was worse for Napoleon Bonaparte.  He managed to recruit only 200,000 soldiers, while the coalition had about 700,000. If desired, the Allies could use several more units, raising the total to 1,000,000 combat-ready units. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nam.ac.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what battle was the last battle of napoleon" class="if uuid-2543106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2543106.jpg"></div><h2>  The Battle of Waterloo </h2><p>  Napoleon had one strategy.  Since his forces were much smaller than the army of enemies, it was supposed to break them in pieces before they manage to unite.  And the plan would have been fulfilled if the generals, who had felt the defeat of the idol, had not begun to betray him en masse.  In which last battle did Napoleon die?  Morally, he died precisely at Waterloo.  Morally, but not physically. </p><p>  In a few hours, all the greatness of Napoleon was trampled.  The enemy cavalry repeated exactly the same trick that the Russian one at one time.  Only now the horses hit right away, and then retreated, giving way to the foot soldiers.  In two hours the battle came to an end.  Napoleon was captured, and again sent to prison.  All the generals who decided to support his rebellion were sent to court.  A new wave of purges began, but since the French saw the second defeat of their idol, their love for him cooled off at a fast speed.  The last battle of Napoleon at Waterloo ended his era. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Now Napoleon has remained on the island of St. Helena forever.  The old man, of course, was still trying to raise the military to a new rebellion, but no one wanted to die by the will of the captive.  Calls to raise weapons and go to the final battle less and less worried minds.  Even before his death, Napoleon curses those mediocrity that so cruelly treated his legacy.  The legend dies in splendid isolation.  Since even the guards do not have time to take up their legal post. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  So what was the last battle of Napoleon?  Due to betrayal by the personnel, the Battle of Waterloo was the last.  If you answer in what battle Napoleon died, then as the ruler of his country, as a great leader, he died during the battle of Borodino. </p>
