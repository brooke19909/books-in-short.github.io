The comments and jokes were in the style of Fedot the archer: "On the back, and then there are six of them." </p><p>  At the same time, the jokers were absolutely sure that Leonid Ilyich was the absolute world leader in the number of awards, but could not say how many awards Brezhnev had for sure.  They were also completely unaware of exactly when and in connection with which specific orders and medals were awarded.  Perhaps knowledge would somewhat diminish their fun.  Why was Leonid Brezhnev honored with so many honors?  The awards and titles of this significant personality in the history we will consider in the article. </p>

    <h2>  Task with the unknown </h2><p>  Not only the compilers of jokes, but also reputable experts do not dare to name the exact number of Brezhnev awards.  The problem is in foreign orders and medals, which the leaders of the countries of the Soviet bloc and other union states generously endowed with the <span>leader of the USSR.</span>  Their complete list has not been published anywhere, the available data have significant discrepancies.  Therefore, it is not worth disassembling them - you cannot rely on inaccurate information. </p><p>  With Soviet rewards easier.  Leonid Ilyich had 16 <span>orders (</span> one of them was awarded posthumously) and 22 medals.  By the way, a photo of Brezhnev with all the awards (or at least from the topic that fit on his jacket) is posted in the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In labor and in battle </h2><p>  But Soviet awards are far from everything that can be classified as military.  So, Brezhnev was a Hero of Socialist Labor - this, as they say, from another opera.  Leonid Ilyich also had several <span>anniversary medals,</span> including, for example, dedicated to the 1500th anniversary of Kiev.  But such at that time gave all the more or less significant people in the country, but it was impossible to circumvent the top leadership! </p><p>  At the same time, it is simply unreasonable to say that Brezhnev received his awards only because he had a weakness for them and, as the General Secretary, could afford to satisfy this weakness.  This is not true if only because a considerable part of orders and medals was received by him long before ascending to the highest post in the country, and Brezhnev's career began from the very bottom.  He really fought, and really worked a lot. </p>

    <h2>  Four star </h2><p>  Of the military awards of Leonid Ilyich, the 4 Stars of the Hero of the Soviet Union (and the Order of Lenin to them) primarily attract attention.  But here they can just be recognized as a manifestation of personal passion for "trinkets" and a subjugation of subordinates.  All Stars were received by Brezhnev in the very post-war period (respectively in 1966, 1976, 1978 and 1981) and already when he was Secretary General. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Yes, it happened that the awards found the heroes after a considerable period after the achievement of their feat, and in peacetime, you can also show heroism.  But Leonid Ilyich was not seen either in the cosmonaut squad or among the rescuers.  According to the charter of the award, there wasn‚Äôt much to give him a single copy of. </p><p>  In addition to Brezhnev, in the USSR there was another ‚Äúfour-star‚Äù Hero.  But it was the ‚ÄúMarshal of Victory‚Äù G.K. Zhukov, and no questions arise for his awards. </p>

    <h2>  For taking everything </h2><p>  The rewards of Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich for the capture of Warsaw and Vienna (to which he had nothing to do), as well as ‚ÄúFor the Defense of Odessa‚Äù (though he can be attracted here even through his work in the political department of the Southern Front) also attract attention.  But they cannot be explained in any way by the influence of the post of the Secretary General, since they were received before 1964, therefore, at the time when Brezhnev was a rather prominent party and economic worker, but not an omnipotent leader of a huge country. </p><p>  Probably the medals were received as almost memorable.  Such a practice existed in those years, and <span>military decorations</span> were given to honored <span>war</span> veterans (and Brezhnev was one!) In honor of anniversary dates or in connection with important events in the life of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Many anniversaries </h2><p>  This category falls medals dedicated to the anniversaries of Victory and the Armed Forces.  Leonid Ilyich had every right to them as a front-line soldier, major general, participant in the Victory Parade.  Too many participants in the war were noted in this way, and this is only fair. </p>

    <h2>  The Writing Paradox </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the military awards of Brezhnev that he received during the war years, it should be noted that he himself in some way contributed to the formation of a skeptical attitude towards them in society.  The reason is the literary work of the Secretary General. </p><p>  From the memoirs of Brezhnev's acquaintances who knew him in his youth, it is known that he tried to compose, but did not like to read, did not suffer from the beauty of the syllable, and even his grammar was noticeably lame.  Of course, being in ideological positions on the military and party lines, he could not help but learn a little coherent presentation of thoughts, but it is clear that literature was not an element of Leonid Ilyich. </p><p>  Nevertheless, several books were published under the name of Brezhnev.  Immediately rumors spread about who exactly and under what conditions worked for the Secretary-General as a "literary Negro," and the works were skeptical.  But among them was the ‚ÄúSmall Land‚Äù - a description of the heroic story of the unconquered bridgehead near Novorossiysk! </p><p>  After the start of perestroika, there was even talk that the hostilities near Novorossiysk were embellished to please Brezhnev, and Malaya Zemlya actually cost little.  So a little respect for the desire to denigrate the name of the one who can no longer give change led to an even worse result - a direct falsification of history. </p>

    <h2>  1941-1945 </h2><p>  Yes, Brezhnev did not go into dashing bayonet attacks, did not throw enemy pillboxes with grenades, and did not personally capture particularly valuable prisoners.  But he should not have done it!  In the war, he was a brigade commissar, then colonel and major general, served in the political department of the Black Sea Group (North Caucasian Front), and then - the political department of the Southern Front. </p><p>  Colonels and generals are not supposed to personally sit in trenches and rush at the enemy with shouts of "Hurray!"  Their task is to organize the matter so that the rank and file, who just have to go to the attack, do it effectively. </p><p>  In the war, Brezhnev was in the autumn of 1941, and performed his duties honestly.  This is another perestroika injustice - the assertion that political workers only spied on the soldiers, handed party cards and proclaimed inspired speeches away from the front line.  Their task was to constantly be among the fighters, explain to them within the framework of a possible military task, raise their spirits, motivate for excellent service.  And Brezhnev did it all, not swinging. </p>

    <h2>  Brezhnev's Awards: List (Short) </h2><p>  Rather, during the war, Brezhnev was even circumvented with awards.  At the Victory Parade, he was one of the least awarded generals.  He did not have high patrons in the army, and he himself did not show much careerism and did not climb into the foreground.  Therefore, all his awards during the war period are extremely respectful. </p><p>  Brezhnev had: </p><ul><li>  2 orders of the Red Banner; </li><li>  Red Star; </li><li>  medal "For Military Merit"; </li><li>  the order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky (it was customary to mark high-ranking officers with this award, and Major General is a suitable candidate for it). </li></ul><p>  The situation is more serious with the Caucasus and the Lesser Land.  Leonid Ilyich had a medal ‚ÄúFor the Defense of the Caucasus‚Äù, and who can say that she was not deserved by the deputy chief of the political unit of the Black Sea military group?  And for the liberation of Novorossiysk political officer Brezhnev was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War (1st degree).  And is there anything to object to if he was transported dozens of times under sea shelling to a bridgehead isolated from land to fulfill his duties as an ideological leader!  It is known that once his seiner even ran into a mine, and it cost the colonel-political officer of an unplanned bath.  But even after this incident, he continued to regularly visit the Small Earth. </p>

    <h2>  Defeated Germany </h2><p>  Leonid Ilyich received another military award after a considerable period of time after the end of the war.  This is the medal "For the victory over Germany."  But here it is difficult to see servitude or injustice.  By that time Brezhnev had not yet become Secretary General, and this medal was handed over to many front-line soldiers who went through the entire war some time after the Victory. </p><p>  Brezhnev did not go to the front in the very first days of the war just because, as the third secretary of the regional committee in Dnepropetrovsk, he was engaged in ensuring the mobilization and evacuation of strategic industries - a more than justifiable reason!  But already in the fall he was in the army, and until the end of the war did not leave the service.  The medal was rightfully due to him. </p><h2>  Selected Victory </h2><p>  But with one military order, embarrassment came out.  In 1978, Brezhnev was awarded the Order of Victory.  They were counted in units in the USSR, this award was relied to outstanding commanders for the successful organization of several operations on a scale no less than the front.  It is clear that there was no reason to hand it to Brezhnev - this was a case of service to the head of the country. </p><p>  In 1989, the Presidium of the Supreme Council canceled this award.  Everything would be true, if it were not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - it is very easy to take away the rewards of the dead ... By that time, Brezhnev had not been there for almost 7 years, and you could do anything with him. </p>

    <h2>  Red Army Brezhnev </h2><p>  You can award not only medals and orders.  Among other things, Brezhnev was the owner of a personalized weapon - a Mauser and checkers.  As for the second, questions may arise (handed in 1978).  Although why not - a military man.  Mauser was received in 1943 and undoubtedly deservedly. </p><h2>  Foreigners will figure it out </h2><p>  As for the foreign awards of Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich, among them were those with military status.  But these awards are on the conscience of the leaders of the respective states.  They know better who deserved their state orders and medals and how many times.  Claims for this can only be brought by their own peoples. </p><h2>  For eternal storage </h2><p>  No one was able to provide convincing evidence that 44 officers carried pillows with his awards during <span>Brezhnev‚Äôs funeral</span> - these are all newspaper gossip; televisions do not allow for accurate judging.  But it is reliable that the widow of the Secretary General handed over all his awards to the Order Chamber for storage - the family considered them the property of the state. </p><h2>  Top rank </h2><p>  And there are such awards of Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich, which neither the authorities, nor the ridicule of the ignorant, nor the time can take away. </p><p>  Marines Maria Aleksandrovna Galushkina, a volunteer sergeant, during the war performed the duties of not only a nurse, but also a liaison officer and even a sniper.  She is the owner of the Red Star and three medals "For Courage".  The word of such a person is expensive. </p><p>  So, in her memory was the ‚Äúgood, desperate man‚Äù Lenka Brezhnev.  Exactly.  And nothing else is needed. </p>
