There is an opinion that the reservoir formed over 10 thousand years ago.  Today, the lake is called a museum of nature, because relic vegetation that has grown in the ancient Ice Age has been preserved around.  By the way, the area near the lake is not assigned to the conservation area. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The pond is located in the pit between the mountains.  In the warm season, the water in it warms up to no more than 22 degrees.  In the deepest place, the distance to the bottom is 10 meters. </p><p>  According to various sources, the lake is located at an altitude of 2 to 2.4 thousand meters.  There are no fish in the waters.  We can say that life here is practically absent life.  Occasionally, leeches and swimming beetles can be seen; on the banks there are frogs hiding in sedge and cotton grass.  At the same time, the water is always crystal clear, transparent and cold, however, locals call it ‚Äúdead‚Äù. </p><p>  The water here is of low salinity, approximately 19.6 mg per 1 liter.  Visibility is small, not more than 3 meters. </p><p>  At the bottom of the reservoir there are thermal zones.  In winter, and this is about 7-8 months, the lake is covered with a layer of ice. </p>

    <h2>  Around the lake </h2><p>  The mountain lake is located on the northern slope of the Peredovy ridge, between two rivers - Khurzuk and Khudes.  Getting to the pond is quite problematic.  But the lake is surrounded by beautiful meadows, where you can stop and pitch a tent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Further beyond the reservoir there are mineral springs - Tokhtana and Tokhtana-Suu.  Around the mountain ranges, covered with glaciers and snow.  In the mountains there are multiple ravines with mountain rivers, trees grow in the lowlands, there are a lot of berries and mushrooms underfoot.  There are many pine trees in the forests, moss under the feet.  At the same time, due to the lack of protection from the state, there is a massive deforestation, so tourists on their way meet less and less pine groves. </p><h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  In the forests and thickets near Lake Hurla-Kel you can meet bears.  And between the rocks and in small swamps you will definitely see vipers.  Look at the cliffs and see how tours climb on them. </p>

    <h2>  The legend of the pond </h2><p>  Khurla-Kel Lake is shrouded in many mystical stories and legends.  One of them must be told by locals.  According to legend, a brave dzhigit Aimush lived in these places.  He had a huge flock of sheep, whom he loved very much, like them him.  The shepherd himself was attractive, had no problems with the opposite sex. </p><p>  One fine day, from the bowels of the waters of a <span>mountain lake</span> , the evil spirit of the Golden Ram appeared and sent a confusion of reason to Aimush.  And this was manifested in the fact that he fell in love with an ordinary girl, married her and completely forgot about his sheep. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Animals were waiting for their shepherd for a long time, and when he came, they did not recognize him.  He was angry and behaved aggressively.  The sheep, unable to withstand such changes, rushed into the lake, dousing the shepherd with icy waters.  And enlightenment came to the dzhigit. </p><p>  Aimush beat his wife, bowed his head in front of his parents, dressed in a cloak, girded, took with him a dagger of silver, which protects from evil spirits.  He came to the lake and drowned. </p><p>  Local residents claim that from time to time screams and voices are heard from the waters.  They claim that Aimush shouts, chasing after the evil spirit of the Golden Ram.  And sometimes white fluff from abandoned sheep is visible on the surface of the water. </p><p>  There is also a legend that sometimes brave horsemen bring their girls here, water opens in front of them and a drowned man with a silver dagger appears.  Aimush, who came out of the water, tells his sad story to those who came so that young people would know about true and true love. </p><p>  Locals believe that a person who catches one of the drowned sheep will be the happiest person on earth all his life. </p>

    <h2>  How to prepare for a trip by car? </h2><p>  The path to the Khurla-Kel lake is difficult and dangerous.  Better to get on an SUV, of course, with all-wheel drive, downshifts and differential locks.  Rubber should be mud, in extreme cases, medium mud.  It is recommended to take a guide, it is better to spend money on his services than wait a few days for help. </p><p>  You can go not only by car, but also on ATVs and enduro motorcycles.  Naturally, these vehicles must be able to drive well. </p>

    <h2>  Directions </h2><p>  There are two main routes to Lake Karachay-Cherkessia: </p><ul><li>  Via Biyshesyn; </li><li>  via Karachaevsk. </li></ul><p>  The first route is very beautiful.  However, there are many serpentines, ups and downs.  On the way you can admire the main Caucasian ridge, <span>the Bermamyt plateau</span> and the slope of Elbrus.  If you move through the Gumbash pass, the road will be easier, but there will no longer be such beauties around. </p><p>  Through Karachayevsk, the road to Lake Khurla-Kel is much easier, but you won‚Äôt get any special enthusiasm from the environment.  From the city 30 km, turn left (gorge of the Khudes River), then along the dirt road 18 km.  Leaning at the Royal Gate, you can already move on foot or by car, if possible.  After 2 km there will be a base "Hud√®s".  From here you can drive 6 km by car or take on the basis of horses.  The road from Khudes is quite difficult, continuous off-road, but you can see one of the oldest mountain lakes in the world. </p>
