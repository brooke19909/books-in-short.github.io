And sometimes even the most reliable equipment from leading manufacturers can fail at the most crucial moment.  And we have the honor to tell you about such an useful skill, how to disassemble the iPad yourself.  Of course, you will need certain tools, without which it will be difficult to know the inner world of the gadget.  Perhaps you can do it with an ordinary kitchen knife, but the case will be irreparably damaged, and it will be difficult to assemble the device back and get it in its original form.  Therefore, we advise you to concentrate, get together and take into account all our recommendations. </p><h2>  What will a Jedi need? </h2><p>  In an art like disassembling an iPad, security is paramount.  Therefore, obtain anti-slip paper to ensure adhesion of surfaces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alexnld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="necessary tools" class="if uuid-3193460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193460.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Special suction cup with ring grip.  This is one of the simplest but most important engineering subjects.  You can‚Äôt do without it when working with any tablets and smartphones. </li><li>  A plastic instrument for opening (it looks like a shovel, putty or guitar pick).  A serious attribute for this type of work, so as not to pry off the display or body parts with nails, fingers or foreign objects. </li><li>  Tweezers made of plastic.  It is important to use just such, and not metal, in order to avoid incidents presented by electric current. </li><li>  A set of special screwdrivers.  Do not be lazy and look at a special store with spare parts for mobile devices.  Tools of this kind are a serious arsenal for both a beginner and a practicing engineer. </li></ol><h2>  Getting to learn magic, or how to disassemble an iPad in 5 minutes? </h2><p>  First, turn off the tablet, wait 15-20 seconds.  Carefully lay on anti-slip paper or other fixing surface that minimizes slipping and prevents scratches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now use a suction cup.  Place it sequentially on each corner of the display and pull it out as gently as possible.  When a small gap is formed between the case and the screen, insert the plastic pick into this place and carefully pull along the perimeter of the case.  At the same time, use the suction cup to lift the next corner of the display.  Thus, you opened the device and almost got to its filling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="use a suction cup" class="if uuid-3193500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193500.jpg"></div><p>  Warning: do not tear off the screen sharply from the case, otherwise damage the internal metal screws that connect these two parts to each other.  This is a measure invented by developers to detect such unauthorized interference.  Therefore, the time has come for a screwdriver.  Hold the display near the case at an angle and loosen the bolts in sequence.  Then, using plastic tweezers or a special tool, disconnect the cable, which is the connecting link between the screen and the board. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itechip.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disconnected screen" class="if uuid-3193476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193476.jpg"></div><p>  Congratulations!  The first and most difficult step to solving the problem of how to disassemble the iPad at home has been completed.  Now you are ready to move on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  We know the inner world </h2><p>  No, not my second half, but the device just disassembled. </p><p>  Here, your attention is given to the logic board - the heart of the tablet, which is bolted to the case with several bolts.  If you want to remove it, then first disconnect all the cables that are attached to it from other parts - speakers, Wi-Fi-module, microphone, camera.  Only then boldly grasp the screwdriver and carefully remove the bolts. </p><p>  On the left of the device is Apple's proprietary 30-pin connector, next to which is the chip that provides the Wi-Fi tablet. </p><p>  All internal parts are also attached to the body with screws, so if necessary, remove any element carefully dismantle them. </p><p>  The entire back of the tablet is a massive battery pack, which is responsible for a large proportion of the weight of the gadget.  But be careful - for a better grip of the battery and the metal case, a sufficient amount of glue is poured here. </p><h2>  If I have Air 2, will there be any nuances? </h2><p>  Before that, we learned the standard procedure, which is suitable not only for working with Apple tablets, but also with other similar devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techrepublic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad 2 parsed" class="if uuid-3193470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193470.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to know how to disassemble the iPad-2, pay special attention to the Home button (or Home).  It is attached using a special fastener, which is located just above the button itself.  Use plastic tweezers with curved tips and disconnect the fastener.  But that is not all.  It's time to use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat up the button bracket and melt the glue.  The main thing is not to overheat.  Now you can dismantle. </p><h2>  Like mini, but no less complex </h2><p>  The iPad Mini is an advanced model of the product line, so it‚Äôs easy to guess that even opening it will now be more difficult. </p><p>  The device itself is more fragile than its predecessors, and now inside all the details are not only bolted, but also with a copious amount of glue.  Literally everything is flooded with it - the screen and the case, the battery, the board and even the headphone jack.  However, the LCD is not glued to the front glass, so at least replacing it will not cause serious problems. </p><p>  Before removing the screen, it is necessary to heat it with a hairdryer, but it is better to use a special heat gun to control the temperature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itechip.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heat the screen" class="if uuid-3193467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193467.jpg"></div><p>  So, according to the previous principle, we disconnected the glass and continue to hold it near the base at an angle.  Now be careful, the bolts are located everywhere: both around the perimeter of the case, and on the board.  Note that these cogs will be the smallest representatives of their kind and will try to disappear from sight.  So the task of how to disassemble the iPad Mini will require some skill and maximum concentration. </p><p>  Go to the screen itself.  It has two hidden and two open bolts.  Remove them, then similarly lift the display to the glass.  This way you get three separate parts that are still interconnected.  To eliminate the connections, disconnect the display cable with a plastic tool, then remove the additional fixing tape. </p><p>  Now your gaze opens in all its glory to a metal plate, which includes another 16 bolts and hides all internal parts from prying eyes.  Armed with a screwdriver, remove the screws and continue to study the contents.  You can disconnect the battery by first removing the cable and picking it up with a spatula.  But we recall a large amount of glue, which the manufacturer did not regret at all.  You can also disable the digitizer on which the Home button is located. </p><p>  To remove the logic board itself, you need to heat the back of the case from the outside, however, inaccurate intervention can lead to irreversible consequences and overheat the part. </p><h2>  Third generation </h2><p>  Everything here is the old fashioned way: we heat the screen, pull the suction cup, pry it off, disconnect it.  Be careful not to pull hard to avoid damage to the cables.  Next, disconnect the screen by removing all the bolts in the corners, and hold both parts.  Disconnect the loop, then the digitizer, which has two latches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPad 3 remove the display" class="if uuid-3193481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/127097/3193481.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, if you had experience working with mini like this, then the question of how to disassemble the iPad 3 will not arise, because the volume of difficulties decreases inversely with the size of the parts. </p><h2>  The fourth book, which became an unexpected addition to the trilogy </h2><p>  That is what could be called the release of "iPad-4." </p><p>  In terms of dismantling the device, nothing fundamentally changed here.  You can pay attention to another type of power connector - this is the main difference between two generations.  But it is noteworthy that the new connector does not save space inside the case. </p><p>  The posting procedure is no different from the one described previously.  Here, everything is also rigidly fixed to the glue, and especially the charge battery, although it refers to consumables and tends to wear out quickly.  The fact that it is not soldered to the board already facilitates the work.  On the logic board, you can also observe more advanced chips of the processor, memory and audio codec. </p><p>  Congratulations!  Now you can learn how to disassemble the iPad 4, as well as earlier models, although each of the representatives of the line has its own characteristics and nuances.  But, as popular wisdom says: "The eyes are afraid, the hands are doing." </p><h2>  What do we get at the output? </h2><p>  The art of engineering is a challenge for the brave and self-confident, since all work consists of many procedures that require skills and painstaking work.  Your companions are zeal, concentration and concentration.  Trembling hands and slightly crazy nerves are not working in your favor. </p><p>  And if you set yourself the task of how to disassemble the iPad, then the second problem arises - to assemble everything back and get the original device in the end.  But if you did everything correctly and accurately and did not lose a single bolt, then everything will work out. </p>
