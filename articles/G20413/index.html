Moreover, the speaker should be single-band.  This statement is fundamentally false.  There are a huge number of <span>speakers of</span> other designs that are able to provide very high-quality sound without any problems.  Shelf and floor speakers can do all this, especially if they are based on modern technologies and the latest technological progress. </p><p>  One of the latest innovations is the ceiling <span>speaker system.</span>  It is used in places where for some reason it is impossible to use standard floor speakers.  This solution saves valuable room volume, provides high-quality surround sound and gives the interior an aesthetic brilliance.  However, in order to choose good acoustics for the ceiling, you need to know something.  What exactly?  We will try to answer this question. </p>

    <h2>  What to look for when choosing? </h2><p>  Ceiling <span>speaker system</span> is a very complex device that requires an individual approach when choosing.  It all depends on the characteristics of your ceiling.  If it consists of GCR, then you need to purchase the appropriate speaker.  For a stretch ceiling or PVC panels, there are speakers.  They differ in fastenings and installation method.  To choose, you will have to determine the type of ceiling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now about the qualities of the speaker system itself.  Remember: the larger the diameter of the subwoofer, the better.  For an apartment, it is better to choose two and three-way speakers.  This will allow for better and surround sound.  Mounted <span>speakers</span> in the ceiling on the principle of spotlights.  So even those who have never done anything like this will have no problems installing. </p>

    <p>  What else do you need to know?  It should be noted that behind the mounted speaker there should be an empty space of a certain size (depends on the speaker system itself).  But it is best if this space itself is occupied by soundproofing material (mineral wool, cellulose).  This will provide high-quality sound and suppress vibration.  It is also necessary to choose acoustics, which has two front channels and one central.  This will achieve maximum realism when watching movies. </p><p>  But these are all general recommendations.  Now, it's time to consider speaker sets from reputable manufacturers.  It is worth noting that only those companies that have achieved certain success in this industry are engaged in the production of speakers of this plan.  Beginners do not risk undertaking such a difficult job.  So let's get started. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  BOSE Virtually Invisible 591 </h2><p>  <span>The</span> BOSE VI 591 ceiling <span>speaker system</span> is one of the best in its class.  The delivery set includes two speakers, protective grilles and a template.  The ‚Äúhead‚Äù consists of one low-frequency speaker with a diameter of 12.7 centimeters and two rotary low-frequency drivers.  This allows you to achieve surround sound.  The weight of the speakers is 1.40 kilograms.  The speaker uses proprietary technology Stereo Everywhere.  It provides full stereo sound no matter where the listener is currently located.  This makes speakers preferable for rooms in which there is nowhere to turn.  You can mount a pair of speakers anywhere.  There will still be full stereo. </p>

    <p>  The BOSE ceiling speaker system is of high quality.  This also applies to other products of the manufacturer.  Only high quality materials are used.  Every product is assembled by hand.  This makes the speakers premium and expensive.  But she is definitely worth the money.  In tandem with these speakers, it is better to use a high-quality receiver and a connection cable that contains precious metals.  Then you can achieve high-quality sound. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not also forget about the rules for installing ceiling speakers.  Only correct installation can unleash the full potential of BOSE speakers.  It is worth noting that the speakers of this company are very popular in Russia and the CIS countries.  This is due to the fact that in the domestic market there are very few high-quality acoustics at reasonable prices. </p><h2>  BOSE Reviews </h2><p>  Those who bought <span>this speaker</span> agree that this is the best ceiling <span>speaker system for the home.</span>  According to users, the speakers have a successful design, sufficient power and certain technologies that improve sound quality.  Also, many were pleased with the ease of installation of this acoustics.  Speaker grilles, which can be easily painted to match the color of the ceiling, deserve special praise.  This solution is unique.  Acoustics BOSE has every chance of winning in our short review.  And the comments of the owners confirm this. </p><h2>  Sanyo FSP-88 3D </h2><p>  This speaker is not intended for home, but for the car.  But nonetheless, it is ceiling mounted.  So, it also needs to be considered.  The ceiling speaker system Sanyo FSP-88 3D is a set of speakers for various purposes, enclosed in a plastic case.  The housing, in turn, has special mountings so that the speakers can be conveniently placed under the roof of the car.  The speakers look unusual, but due to the all-plastic case, achieving high-quality sound is not easy.  However, quality diffusers and the separation of the speakers into a tweeter, midrange and subwoofer save.  The latter, by the way, is located in the lower part of the case.  This is a passive speaker.  So, for its full use you will need an amplifier. </p>

    <p>  A feature of this speaker is that it cannot be found in free sale in the Russian Federation.  Only at foreign auctions or domestic flea markets.  The fact is that this model was produced exclusively for domestic use.  This speaker entered our latitudes only with imported cars.  In this acoustics, the 3D option is implemented, which allows you to get full surround sound in a closed and very small space.  However, you should not expect miracles from such speakers in terms of sound.  Affects the plastic case and the peculiar arrangement of the speakers.  The ceiling speaker system Sanyo FSP-88 3D is a very rare thing in our area.  Therefore, there are few reviews about it. </p><h2>  Yamaha NS-IC800 </h2><p>  Yamaha products are well known to lovers of good sound.  Her floor standing speakers are premium devices.  More recently, the manufacturer decided to experiment with the speakers.  So the NS-IC800 ceiling speaker system was born.  Photos of her convincingly show that this speaker will fit into any interior.  This was achieved due to the decorative lattices of the classical form, which can be painted in any color. </p><p>  The speaker system has two speakers.  Each of them has two diffusers.  One low-frequency with a diameter of 200 millimeters and one high-frequency with a diameter of 25 millimeters.  All this sounds very convincing.  It is also worth noting that this acoustics has an output power of 140 watts and a sensitivity of 90 dB.  For an ordinary room, this is more than enough. </p>

    <p>  The range of reproducible frequencies ranges from 50 hertz to 28,000 hertz.  This means that the status of this AS is somewhere at the average level.  That is, not yet premium, but not budgetary either.  The NS-IC800 ceiling speaker system is great for sounding rooms up to 130 square meters.  This is a very good result.  Let's not forget about Yamaha proprietary technologies that improve sound and overall acoustics.  Thanks to this, you can be anywhere in the room.  Anyway, the output will be full stereo.  Approximately the same technology is used in BOSE ceiling speakers.  In this they are similar.  Only products from Yamaha are noticeably more expensive.  What can you do - a brand. </p><h2>  Yamaha Reviews </h2><p>  A certain number of users have already purchased this speaker.  And not only purchased, but installed and tested.  So let‚Äôs listen to their comments about such a thing as the NS-IC800 ceiling speaker system.  Reviews about her are mostly positive.  All owners note the highest sound quality, excellent stereo and simply excellent appearance.  The latter helps acoustics fit into any interior.  And this is very important for those who use such speakers in the apartment.  Nevertheless, there are several reviews of a negative nature.  Some write that they expected more from Yamaha.  Say, the sound quality did not suit.  This situation is understandable, because this speaker belongs to the middle level and does not pretend to extra sound. </p><h2>  CVGaudio CRX6T </h2><p>  Another popular speaker that has won high user ratings.  It is not as expensive as the products from Yamaha and BOSE, but it has approximately the same technical characteristics.  So, the size of the low-frequency is 165 millimeters.  The high-frequency diffuser is represented by a 25 mm head.  Even this is enough to provide high-quality sound.  But only with a high-quality amplifier and adequate connecting wires.  Ceiling speaker system CVGaudio CR6T 100V 10W can not boast of special power (only 10 watts), but it provides full surround sound and the highest quality audio and video playback.  To use these components, a standard 100V amplifier is required.  With a resistance of 8 ohms, an increase in output power of up to 40 watts is possible. </p>

    <p>  The reproducible frequency ranges are from 80 hertz to 20,000 hertz.  This suggests that this speaker is intended mainly for office use.  However, it‚Äôs also comfortable to listen to music in MP3s.  Yes, and in FLAC, most tracks have a depth of 16 bits.  So problems should not arise.  The sensitivity of the speakers is 91 dB.  This is a decent result.  This acoustics can be considered budget.  Especially when you consider its technical characteristics and cost.  Therefore, the number of those who acquired these speakers is greater than those who could afford BOSE or Yamaha. </p><h2>  CRX6T Reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, speakers of this class are acquired by those who are not particularly picky.  They do not particularly look at sound quality.  Therefore, reviews about this speaker are restrained and positive.  The owners note a good sound for such a price, a successful design and universal mount.  Also, users talk about a very high-quality low-frequency speaker.  But the high-frequency "tweeter" was not praised.  Many say that the speakers are sorely lacking in high frequencies.  Well, it could very well be.  However, it is worth recalling that this ceiling speaker system is one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) in the domestic market.  So you don‚Äôt have to find fault with her so much. </p><h2>  Ecler IC8 </h2><p>  The Ecler IC8 ceiling speaker system is manufactured and marketed by AUVIX.  AC is an inexpensive and high-quality solution for home use.  The speakers are equipped with a universal mount, an 8-inch woofer and a Kevlar squeaker.  This unusual combination of components provides high quality sound.  Loudspeakers that can be painted in any color are included with the speaker.  Acoustics is designed to work with a 100V low impedance amplifier.  The output power is 20 watts.  To sound the room, this is enough.  By technical characteristics, these columns are very similar to the previous ones, but slightly better than them. </p>

    <p>  The frequency range starts at 50 hertz and ends at 28,000. This is a decent result.  The sensitivity of the speakers is 90 dB.  Also pretty good.  Acoustics does an excellent job of playing music from genres such as classical, soft rock, pop, rap and so on.  Fans of metal and modern hard rock, these speakers are definitely not suitable.  Oddly enough, this speaker is great for watching movies.  The sound is saturated and very correct.  Of course, subject to the use of a high-quality amplifier and good connecting wires. </p><h2>  Ecler Reviews </h2><p>  Those who have purchased this speaker can not get enough.  A very successful investment, it turns out, is the Ecler IC8 ceiling speaker system.  Reviews about her are full of laudatory odes.  And it‚Äôs not in vain.  At a frankly low cost, the speaker is able to provide sound quality "above average".  This is more than enough for the average user.  Audiophiles, of course, will be unhappy, but these speakers are not designed for their needs.  And for home use, this speaker fits almost perfectly. </p><h2>  Built-in speakers 5.1 </h2><p>  All the above models are stereo format.  But if the user is interested in a 5.1 ceiling speaker system?  One explanation is needed here.  Such speakers are very, very expensive.  Only masters of the genre are engaged in their release: Yamaha, B&amp;W, Sony, AKG and so on.  And the installation of such acoustics requires a room of a certain architecture.  It is very difficult to do this.  Therefore, it makes no sense to focus on this option.  It is enough to know that there are such speakers, they are very expensive and can not always come up to your apartment design. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the most popular models of ceiling speakers.  Now it's up to you.  For it is you who decides what to choose.  But it‚Äôs better not to save on such purchases. </p>
