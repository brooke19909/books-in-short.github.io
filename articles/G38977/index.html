    <p>  If you buy excursions on the street, then their price will be approximately two times lower. </p><p>  For an independent tour of the city, it is advisable to make a travel plan at home, in Dubai to get a map by metro and enjoy the surroundings without a time limit, but without a guide. </p><h2>  Dubai in February: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the vacationers, in February there are a lot of visiting guests in the emirate, but due to the fact that there are a large number of hotels, a free room can always be found.  Those who do not like to stand in lines may be uncomfortable, because sometimes it is not always possible to immediately make a purchase or find an empty seat in a restaurant.  For fans of long races or families with children, February is also not a suitable month to visit the UAE.  Water here warms up to a maximum of +22 degrees, you can swim, but not for long.  At first it seems very cold, but gradually you get used to it, especially if it turned out to be a hot day.  Although fans of water treatments can save the heated pools that are on the territory of almost every hotel. </p>
