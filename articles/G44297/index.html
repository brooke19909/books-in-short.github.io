Absolutely any part of the marvelous Crimean peninsula will give a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions.  The mysterious natural beauty and power of the water is conveyed by the waterfalls of Crimea, which will delight any tourist who has seen them. </p><p>  In the gorge Yaman-Dere, the river Uzen-Bash originates.  The gorge is located above Alushta, in the north-eastern foothills of Babugan-Yaila.  Waterfalls wake up and begin their vigorous activity, murmuring among steep gorges, with the onset of spring, when nature begins to come to life.  The most attractive is the Golovkinsky Falls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovkinsky waterfall in spring" class="if uuid-2718749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2718749.jpg"></div><p>  It is named after a hydrogeologist from Tavria, who was one of the first to pay attention to its uniqueness and natural beauty.  In Crimea, Golovkinsky's waterfall is popularly called the "two-horned".  This name is explained by its division into two streams in the dry period. </p><p>  Interestingly, water falls down eight rocky ledges from a twelve-meter height.  About 170 liters of water are passed in one second. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about Golovkinsky Falls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovkinsky waterfall photo" class="if uuid-2718746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2718746.jpg"></div><p>  Before you go on a hiking trail to this unique natural attraction of the peninsula, find out some interesting facts about it: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  The cascade system of this waterfall allows you to hide the bowels of a beech forest. </li><li>  Due to the fact that the waterfall is located on the inaccessible and protected territory of the Crimean reserve, most of the local residents and tourists are not aware of its beauty. </li><li>  The relict birch grove, which is located near the waterfall, is a legacy of the ice age.  In the harsh climate, extensive snow fields formed on the eggs.  As warming, the birch began to die out and has survived to the present day in the form of small groves in the most inaccessible and shaded places of the mountain range. </li></ul><h2>  Yaman-Dere Gorge </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovkinsky waterfall in autumn" class="if uuid-2718745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2718745.jpg"></div><p>  The gorge, where the waterfall is located, was called by the locals a "wicked place" to drive away dark forces and evil spirits.  In fact, Yaman-Dere is a natural cache of amazing beauty, along the bottom of which the Uzen-Bash River flows. </p><h2>  About the waterfall </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to find Golovkinsky‚Äôs waterfall on the map, but getting to it is not an easy task.  The waterfall is located in a mountainous area, so it can only be reached on foot.  On the way to this beautiful place you will find many obstacles in the form of rocky spurs and dense thickets. </p><p>  Such a trip will be interesting and entertaining for lovers of hiking and purposeful people.  The trail itself is very picturesque.  On the way to the Golovkinsky Falls there will be many ringing, clean streams, as well as ancient ruins.  The road is quite long and tiring, but the surrounding natural beauty and cheerful company help pass the time, making the trip more interesting and fun.  When the goal is reached, you will feel a surge of energy.  An incredibly beautiful view will open for you, which will serve as the main award. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Golovkinsky Falls is part of Uzen-Bash and consists of eight rapids.  It has a significant drop in water.  The waterfall is icy and crystal clear.  Around it is a beech forest, which is diluted with birches and slender yews.  There are also huge beautiful boulders and rocky ledges.  Being near the waterfall, you can not miss the emerald, shaggy moss, which is admired. </p><h2>  What time of year is suitable for visiting the waterfall? </h2><p>  Pay special attention to the time of the year when planning a trip around the Crimea, including the Golovkinsky Falls.  If you choose a warm season, for example, July or August, for this trip, you will be disappointed.  In the summer months, the waterfall almost completely dries up, leaving only a mountain stream. </p><p>  May is the best time to visit the waterfall.  It is the spring time that makes the waterfall incredibly full of water, captivating and captivating the hearts of all tourists.  He has an incredibly beautiful view in the morning, as the fog creeping out of the gorge covers the rapids with a thick veil.  The waterfall in the morning is very mysterious and bewitchingly beautiful.  As the sun rises, the fog dissipates, and the water begins to sparkle like jewels. </p><h2>  How to get to Golovkinsky Falls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Golovkinsky waterfall in the morning" class="if uuid-2718747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74177/2718747.jpg"></div><p>  The road to the waterfall will take from 3 to 4 hours, as this trip will have to overcome more than 5 kilometers.  The starting point of the route is the village of Vinogradnoye.  To get to this settlement, you should use a trolley bus.  Then from the stop you need to move along the path that leads to the mountains.  After the blocks are overcome, you will find yourself at the Ai-Yori spring (by the way, this source is healing).  Next, you need to follow the road that leads to the Crimean reserve.  After one kilometer from this road, you need to turn onto a path that goes along the Ulu-Uzen riverbed.  It is she who will lead you to the Golovkinsky waterfall. </p><p>  This waterfall with its surrounding beautiful nature resembles a real fairy tale.  But to get into it, you have to make a trip around the Crimea.  Golovkinsky said that the beauty of the Uzen-Bash valley is incomparable, and he was right.  If you find yourself on the Crimean peninsula, then be sure to visit this amazing place, it will not leave you indifferent. </p>
