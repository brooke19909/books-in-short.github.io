Its history began in 1350 - the moment it was founded by the Czech king and Roman emperor Charles IV.  According to legend, the first healing spring with "living water" was discovered by the king of Bohemia during the hunt.  He saw how the water from a small pit restored the strength of a wounded deer.  At this place ‚Äúit was ordered to lay the city‚Äù so that the courtiers could be treated here.  The name of the city was in honor of Emperor Karl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resort in Karlovy Vary czech republic prices" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1800457.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This cozy town is located in the West of the Czech Republic.  Sanatoriums, hotels, pensions are built on stepped terraces.  Thanks to this layout, the city is literally buried in alleys and parks, which are in Karlovy Vary 26. The Victorian spirit is preserved in the architectural ensembles of the city and romantic streets with an abundance of street cafes.  Here at one time, List, Beethoven and Mozart rested and were treated.  ‚ÄúTreatment on the waters‚Äù was carried out by Turgenev, Gogol and A. Tolstoy.  Many famous personalities strengthened their health.  All can not be listed for the seven centuries of the resort. </p><h2>  Thermal springs </h2><p>  Of the sixty sources discovered in Karlovy Vary, 13 are used for medicinal purposes. A feature of all sources is the same chemical composition.  The temperature in the sources and carbon dioxide saturation are different.  This is what plays a role in prescribing <span>water treatment for a</span> specific source for a specific disease. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tradition of preventive treatment that has developed over many centuries is based on the unique healing properties of thermal water in spas in the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary.  Prices for medical tours are different.  And tours are formed individually, based on the impact of balneological procedures on the body.  The water of their miraculous sources helps restore metabolic processes in the body, removes toxins, turns kidney stones into sand and removes it from the body.  The processes occur due to the intake of water from a thermal source of a certain temperature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech health resorts with treatment prices" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1800552.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Doctors' appointments </h2><p>  The most famous source under No. 1 is Virgilo, a real natural geyser that ejects 2,000 liters of hot (72 ¬∞ C) mineral water every minute from a depth of 2.5 km.  It is useful to be near the source and breathe air saturated with trace elements.  As in many Czech health resorts, people with diseases of the musculoskeletal system (source No. 2, 3, 5), gastrointestinal tract (source No. 6, 7, 8 10), diabetes mellitus and its complications (source No. 9, 10), with periodontal disease and caries (source No. 4).  If we talk about the reviews of people undergoing treatment and just having a rest in Karlovy Vary, these will be large volumes of books of gratitude and a thin notebook of reviews from those who are not satisfied with something.  And there are always such people.  Resort attendance speaks for itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Frantiskovy Lazne </h2><p>  The spa town of Frantiskovy Lazne as a balneological resort declared itself in 1827.

    <p>  Many vacationers like the rather comfortable sanatorium "Pavlik".  It combines a good level of amenities, excellent food and a strong medical base.  Arriving for the treatment of gynecological problems, all procedures are held in the treatment center Cisarske Lazne.  In the whole Czech Republic prices in sanatoriums are approximately the same.

In a relatively small area, natural healing springs were discovered.  Their number today is about 140. The monks from the Tepla Monastery tried the effects of healing waters in 1528 on themselves.  Many springs were surrounded by forests and swamps, so they were not accessible for a long time.  Of those that were available, local healers used water for medicinal purposes.  Only in 1818, Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ was declared a public resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resorts in czech republic marianske lazne prices" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1800483.jpg" width="600"></div>
