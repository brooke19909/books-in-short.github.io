Despite the fact that this service is no longer in great demand, it is still used by many consumers.  To understand the issue, you need to carefully study the purpose of this function and understand whether it is worth using it at all.  And only then proceed with the instructions, which will help to achieve a positive result.  But first, let's talk about the function of transferring photos. </p><h2>  Why do you need MMS? </h2><p>  Mobile communication is unique in itself and has many advantages.  One of those is the ability to transfer photos in the form of messages between subscribers.  Against the background of various communication programs, it is strange to be interested in how to set up MMS on Tele2.  But we will inform you, because knowledge is never superfluous, especially if it is associated with an everyday subject. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="MMS is a unique service" class="if uuid-3145755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145755.jpg"></div><p>  MMS is a universal mobile communication function that is paid.  It allows you to share photos with other subscribers, regardless of their location.  The main condition here is the presence of special settings that allow you to receive information and download it for viewing. </p><h2>  MMS Analogs </h2><p>  How to configure MMS on Tele2?  Before we analyze this issue, we need to understand whether it is advisable to use them.  It is not easy to answer this, because despite the presence of various analogues: VK, Odnoklassniki, WhatsApp, Instagram, subscribers continue to use photo transfer functions.  We highly recommend that you use similar options, as they are free and the easiest to use.  But if you want to use standard MMS, then move on to useful instructions.  They will help you understand all the actions and are guaranteed to provide a positive result. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="irrelevance of the MMS service" class="if uuid-3145756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145756.jpg"></div><h2>  Auto settings </h2><p>  Is it possible to configure MMS on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù?  In fact, the installation technology is created in such a way that it is the same for all phones, regardless of the model and version of the operating system.  Therefore, you can safely use the following instructions: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Dial on it number 679, press the call button. </li><li>  Listen to the answering machine. </li><li>  Expect an SMS with settings. </li><li>  Open it and go to the additional ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù with the symbol of three dots in the upper right. </li><li>  Select "Installation." </li><li>  Wait for them to install. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is the message received at 679" class="if uuid-3145760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145760.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated and unexpected.  But a situation may arise that after the call the message does not come.  In this case, you need to call the operator at 611 and explain the whole situation.  He will personally send you a message and you can use it.  But this is the simplest option, which, although effective, does not always help.  If this happened to you, then it is better to use a different method. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Manual settings </h2><p>  How to configure MMS on "Tele2" using another method?  To answer this question, just use our special instruction: </p><ol><li>  Pick up the phone. </li><li>  Go to the "Settings". </li><li>  Select "Connections." </li><li>  Go to Mobile Networks. </li><li>  Select Access Points. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù item in the upper right. </li></ol><p>  As soon as you do all this, a new window will open in front of you, where you need to enter data.  They look as follows: </p><ol><li>  Name: Tele2 MMS. </li><li>  Proxy server: enabled. </li><li>  Port: 8080 (if it doesn‚Äôt work, you can use 9201). </li><li>  APN access: mms.tele2.ru. </li><li>  MMS server: mmsc.tele2.ru. </li><li>  IP address: 193.12.40.65. </li><li>  Connection Type: GPRS. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how the window for manual settings looks like." class="if uuid-3145761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145761.jpg"></div><p>  After filling in, do not forget to save all changes.  Be sure to send a test MMS to another subscriber for the system to register you.  If all is well, you can safely continue to use.  If it doesn‚Äôt work out, contact support at 611. You will receive additional advice and recommendations.  Now you know how to configure MMS on Tele2, but that‚Äôs not all.  IPhone users may encounter some problems.  How to solve them, you will learn further. </p><h2>  Problems with iPhone models </h2><p>  If you decide to set up MMS on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù on an iPhone, then don‚Äôt be upset if you didn‚Äôt succeed.  The problem lies in the technical component of this model, which can only be solved by calling 611. You will be sent separate instructions to help resolve the issue.  But before that, be sure to use our recommendations, there is a high probability that they will help you.  Unfortunately, this problem is associated exclusively with the iPhone models and it is almost impossible to solve it at a technical level.  This is due to the use of various information protocols of the mobile operator and the manufacturer of the phones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone setting" class="if uuid-3145762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3145762.jpg"></div><p>  In conclusion, I would like to note that now it is impossible to send MMS from a computer to Tele2 using the official website.  This feature was disabled due to its irrelevance.  Previously, users could freely try to send photos via the Internet, but now this opportunity has been replaced by social networks and instant messengers.  For the rest, you can safely use all the available functions and just understand them well. </p>
