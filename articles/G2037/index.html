But it should be noted that the idea does not belong to this manufacturer, but to the South Korean Samsung.  It was his products that the basic design elements were spied on.  Many buyers in their comments note that the smartphone from afar is similar to the Galaxy S7 device.  But the overall impression of the device does not deteriorate.  In reviews of Xiaomi Mi Note 2 (64Gb Black), this fact is practically not mentioned. </p><p>  What else do customers talk about?  Most liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa curved screen.  He perfectly "got up" into the case, not sticking out and not going beyond the ends.  At the edges you can see a slight bend.  The owners note that the display technology is implemented more than well - erroneous clicks are excluded. </p><p>  Many buyers notice the quality of the materials used.  Glass and aluminum allow you to maintain a beautiful appearance even when dropped from a small height.  During tactile contacts, as the owners notice, a ceramic feeling is created. </p><p>  In general, everyone liked the design: it is beautiful, fresh and bright.  Use the device conveniently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi note 2 64gb black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010749.jpg"></div>

The developer also added highlight points.  The key on the left is responsible for returning back, and the one located on the right will open the latest applications.  All commentators notice one advantage - their purpose easily changes in the device settings. </p><p>  Together with good impressions, the owners describe a negative interaction experience.  Unlocking is inconvenient, especially at first, until a person gets used to it.  In order to do this, you first need to press the Home button and only then apply your finger to the sensor.  In all other moments, people do not find any flaws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi note 2 owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010750.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance Reviews </h2><p>  The phone runs on last year‚Äôs processor, so its performance is not at a high level.  Moreover, reviews of Xiaomi Mi Note 2 confirm this.  Buyers in the comments notice that the games and applications run perfectly, but the device heats up quite a lot.  Most owners do not like the latter factor, and they write that the temperature rises regardless of what the user is doing.  It is enough to just start viewing the feed on Twitter or flipping sites in the browser - the case will immediately heat up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi note 2 smartphone reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010751.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews about battery life </h2><p>  All buyers in <span>reviews of the Xiaomi</span> Mi Note 2 <span>smartphone</span> notice that charging is fast.  Just wait two hours.  Particularly curious owners conducted an experiment, as a result of which it became clear that in half an hour the device charges up to 40%, and in 60 minutes - by 75%, in 1.5 hours - 95%.  The capacity of the battery is popular with all customers, without exception. </p><p>  However, it‚Äôs worth mentioning right away that you do not need to count on 17 hours of continuous active work.  At maximum brightness, the device can withstand no more than 360 minutes - all users declare this.  Over the night in standby mode, the phone resets about 5%. </p><h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  The owners of the <span>Xiaomi Mi Note 2</span> (64Gb) phone in the reviews note that the photos during the daytime shooting are excellent.  Sharpness, white balance, focus - all these are the advantages of the phone.  Buyers also notice that in cloudy weather the quality suffers slightly.  But what do owners say about night shooting? </p><p>  Unfortunately, the task of taking photographs in the evening or even very late is rather difficult.  The frame may turn out to be too dark, surprising, but also too overexposed as well.  Least of all photos are successful.  Overall reviews about the Xiaomi Mi Note 2 camera are positive. </p><p>  Video is shot in 4K quality.  Users note the presence of stabilization and eightx zoom.  Shooting is too sensitive to light.  Brightness can jump very much, especially if the operator moves.  Exposure changes automatically. </p><p>  The front camera, judging by the reviews, will allow you to take good pictures in the daytime.  Blurring photos may sometimes occur, but this is rare. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the owners leave positive reviews about the cameras.  The only negative is shooting at night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi mi note 2 camera reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2010752.jpg"></div>
