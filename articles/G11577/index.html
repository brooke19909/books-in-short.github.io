  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to stitch a leather laptop case with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Making a stylish laptop case with your own hands is quite simple, if you approach the issue creatively.  Minimum sewing skills, suitable materials and a little patience will be required, since manual labor does not endure fuss.  The most expensive accessories are made by hand, even the smallest details are given maximum attention, and therefore such things are valued extremely highly.  Do it yourself with a leather laptop case; this thing will last for many years and will always look great. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  The most suitable material is dense skin, both natural and synthetic samples can be used.  Soft skin is not recommended, since the case in this case will jam and quickly lose its appearance.  Of course, you can make a dense lining glued with doubler, but such manipulations require serious sewing skills and the layman will not be able to.  One more successful material for a cover is a thick felt: it is soft, but keeps its shape perfectly, it is much easier to sew than dense skin, however, such a cover will serve much less.  If you have never before been engaged in the manufacture of accessories with your own hands, it is better to practice it on felt fabric. </p><p>  Before you make a laptop case with your own hands, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  a piece of leather or felt is three times longer than your laptop and 5-7 cm wider. </li><li>  strong thread in tone to the main material or a contrasting color; </li><li>  sewing needle; </li><li>  a ruler with a length of at least 50 cm; </li><li>  pen or thin marker; </li><li>  big good scissors; </li><li>  an awl or a special hole punch for the skin. </li></ul><h2>  Cut </h2><p>  Ruler measure the length and width of the laptop.  Draw a product pattern on a piece of leather: use a ruler and pen to draw a rectangle 5-7 cm wider than your gadget and 3 times longer.  Make sure that the corners are perfectly straight, otherwise the finished product will turn out to be uneven.  Attach the laptop to the pattern and make sure that the dimensions are set aside correctly.  Carefully cut the skin along the marked lines with scissors, make slow and wide movements, carefully watch that burrs do not form.  If this still happened, carefully cut off the uneven area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe edge.  Attach the resulting segment once more to the gadget and make sure that you are not mistaken and that the sizes match.  If you do not use leather, but felt, cutting must be done in a similar way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="eggandprince.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cutting a laptop case" class="if uuid-2292614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2292614.jpg"></div><p>  Useful <strong>advice.</strong>  With black material, difficulties can arise, since the markup will be poorly visible on it.  In this case, you can use a gel pen with shiny ink. </p><h2>  Sewing </h2><p>  Since it is not easy to sew a laptop case with your own hands, it is necessary to mark the seam lines in advance.  From the wrong side, along the sides of the cut-out section, measure and draw with a 7 mm handle.  Then, every 10 mm, mark the locations of future holes.  Using a special hole punch or an ordinary awl, make accurate punctures at the marked points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eggandprince.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to sew leather" class="if uuid-2292616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2292616.jpg"></div><p>  Put the laptop on the material and measure the height of the cover.  Then remove the gadget and sew the product on the sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eggandprince.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather laptop case" class="if uuid-2292615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2292615.jpg"></div><p>  Now it is necessary to process the valve.  If desired, it can be shortened by a few centimeters, made triangular or oval.  Using a ruler and pen, measure and mark the line at a distance of 7 mm from the edge.  Then, along the drawn line, make marks every 10 mm.  Lay a neat decorative seam along the marked points.  This step is optional, but a self-made laptop case in this case will look more stylish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="eggandprince.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Envelope for laptop or tablet" class="if uuid-2292613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2292613.jpg"></div><p>  If you use felt, there is no need to pierce holes in advance, but it is necessary to outline the line of the future seam.  In this case, drawing is required on the front side. </p><h2>  Clasp </h2><p>  From the main material, cut two ribbons 1 cm wide and 3 times longer than your laptop.  Mark the center point on the back of the case and sew the ribbons securely.  Wrap a cover around them and tie a bow on the front.  Self-made laptop case, ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="eggandprince.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a zipper" class="if uuid-2292618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2292618.jpg"></div><p>  Instead of leather for the fastener, you can use other materials: braided cords, various textile ribbons.  You can apply leather or suede in a different color. </p><p>  Now you are convinced that making a laptop case with your own hands is not as difficult as it seems at first glance.  If you still doubt your abilities, you can make a trial version from any unnecessary fabric, accurately determine the sizes, practice the art of sewing, and then create a magnificent and unique handmade accessory. </p>
