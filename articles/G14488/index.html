One of their favorite towns on the <span>Antalya coast</span> is Konakli.  Hedef Rose Garden hotel - the hotel, located only 2 km from it and 12 km from Alanya, attracts with its own beach, special privacy, Turkish hospitality and beautiful views from the balconies. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of Konakli </h2><p>  Where can you relax in silence, enjoying the sound of the surf and birdsong?  In Konakli.  Where are the great parties, discotheques until the morning and delicious drinks in the bars?  In Konakli.  As guests of the resort write in their reviews, here everyone finds the type of vacation they are looking for. </p><p>  Mediterranean small towns have a special appeal.  Perhaps these are narrow streets and low houses, on the first floors of which the doors of numerous shops and shops are hospitably open, or maybe an amazing combination of the smell of the sea, interwoven with the aromas of local cuisine escaping from restaurants.  Konakli with a population of just over 12,000 people is a typical Mediterranean town, full of life from the beginning to the end of the holiday season, and freezing in the long-awaited silence in the off-season. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Hedef Rose Garden is 2 km away from the town, which makes it a kind of “outside observer” for the noisy life on its streets in the midst of a tourist boom, but is close enough to participate in it, as its guests say about the location of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the Hedef Rose Garden hotel is 4 stars, you can have a good time here at very affordable prices. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  This hotel has its own beach, but you should be prepared for the fact that it is mostly pebble, although there is a sandy area.  Since the Hedef Rose Garden hotel 4 (Alanya) belongs to the family type of recreation, it should be borne in mind that the bottom of the sea is also pebbly mixed with rather large stones, so it is better to enter it in shoes.  This is for those who do not like to leave their sunbeds, which, by the way, are free on the beach, like umbrellas. </p><p>  It’s worth a few meters to go to the side, and there the bottom is sandy and completely safe, so for parents with small children it is better to immediately go there for a beach vacation. </p>

    <p>  To complain at the Hotel Hedef Rose Garden that it has an uncomfortable beach is the same as scolding nature for creating pebbles.  In Konakli, not all beaches are pebble, and in Alanya, on the contrary, they are sandy, so you can always find a place for sunbathing. </p><p>  Directly on the coast near the hotel, special bridges are made, leaving for the sea, so that vacationers can dive without fear of injuring or hurting their legs.  A thirsty bar saves them from thirst, offering everyone who wants it juice, coffee, mineral water and beer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Two five-story buildings, converging at an acute angle, as if embracing a large pool, around which loungers and umbrellas lined up waiting for guests.  A cozy lounge with soft armchairs in a light upholstery gives shelter to tired travelers who have just stepped off the plane. </p>

    <p>  The hospitable staff brings refreshments if customers have to wait a long time before checking into a room that starts at 14.00.  As a rule, if they come at night to the hotel Hedef Rose Garden, they will have a delicious soup to eat and have an already prepared room.  Those who are not lucky to arrive in the morning have to wait until their apartments are vacated and prepared.  To make time pass unnoticed, you can spend it in a bar in the hotel or near the pool, which many guests do and write about in their reviews. </p><p>  The territory in the Hedef Rose Garden hotel 4 with an area of ​​about 12,000 square meters contains several pools and a playground, and the hotel itself has 218 rooms of the "standard" category. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  As a rule, for four-star hotels, tourists have the same requirements for room service and their arrangement as for apartments with five, and Hedef Rose Garden is no exception.  As his guests describe in their reviews, he has the following advantages and disadvantages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you need: comfortable beds, armchairs and an ottoman, TV, bedside tables and a mini fridge. </li><li>  Balconies are suitable for drinking coffee in the morning, sitting at a table, and in the evening with a glass of wine watching the day fade away. </li><li>  The daily cleaning process refreshes the ceramic tiles on the floor and makes you want to return to your comfortable room after a day full of impressions. </li></ul>

    <p>  Of the negative, as vacationers mention, an irregular change of linen can be noted.  Otherwise, room service and arrangement correspond to the four stars assigned to the Hedef Rose Garden hotel.  Service is an integral part of a good holiday, and in Turkey they are well aware of this. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  Arrive at the resort and sit in the hotel can only either very lazy people, or have already seen everything.  Konakli, within walking distance of the Hedef Rose Garden hotel 4, is famous for its oriental bazaar, for which it is worth leaving the hotel on Wednesday. </p><p>  Once a week, the town becomes like a bright buzzing hive, where, it seems, everyone is talking at the same time.  But how else, because this is an oriental bazaar, which is simply a shame not to bargain.  Here, rows of handmade carpets are replaced by sellers of Turkish sweets, followed by souvenir shops and tables with exotic fruits. </p>

    <p>  As tourists note in their reviews, the only drawback of the bazaar is its crowdedness, but the advantages clearly outweigh their dissatisfaction: </p><ul><li>  The location of the Hedef Rose Garden hotel is just a 15-minute walk from the market. </li><li>  Turkish manufacturers bring famous leather jackets, sheepskin coats and shoes for sale at such affordable prices that it’s a sin to grumble. </li><li>  Here you can taste the most incredible fruits and buy fresh vegetables. </li></ul><p>  Delicious aromas of spices interspersed with the smell of genuine leather, tasting <span>Turkish tea</span> and watching the auction - for the sake of this, it is worth checking into the environment at the Hedef Rose Garden hotel.  Guest reviews strongly recommend this. </p><h2>  How are they fed in Turkey? </h2><p>  Who-who, and the Turks know how to cook.  This is mentioned by everyone who has ever visited this country.  The national cuisine offered by the restaurant at the Hedef Rose Garden hotel (all inclusive) is a buffet that is bursting with an abundance of dishes.  Here is food for every taste: </p><ul><li>  Several varieties of fish cooked in different ways. </li><li>  Meat with and without sauces. </li><li>  Fruits, ice cream and famous Turkish sweets. </li><li>  Dozens of salads that are decorated so that it is difficult to determine what they are made from. </li></ul><p>  For those thirsty, there are 4 bars on site.  And those who are looking for not only national cuisine, but also the atmosphere, will find numerous restaurants and cafes in the town.  Here they are met by live music, large portions of delicious food, local wine, beer and the smiles of the waiters. </p><h2>  What to do at your leisure? </h2><p>  Today it’s not enough for tourists to lie in a chaise lounge with a cocktail in their hand or dip their feet into the Mediterranean Sea, give them “bread and circuses” no worse than gladiatorial fights.  The pursuit of impressions has taken the tourism business from sightseeing to gambling and breathtaking rides. </p><p>  Hedef Rose Garden has no sharp turns, but everyone can dive into the pool from one of the two water slides, regardless of age.  When you get tired of lying in a chaise lounge near one of the pools and “chasing” waiters, you can take part in water aerobics, play billiards or tennis, bring victory to the beach volleyball team or enjoy the work of animators. </p>

    <p>  For children, the hotel has a playground with swings, a club is open, where in the evenings they dance to the sounds of disco, and a games room is open.  Various competitions, creative activities and children's animation will create a child’s own opinion about staying at the Hedef Rose Garden 4 hotel. </p><h2>  Healthy stay </h2><p>  Today, few people will be surprised by a hotel with SPA, because face and body care, even on vacation, has become the norm for modern travelers.  The Hedef Rose Garden Hotel is not far behind fashion trends.  At the disposal of guests: </p><ul><li>  sauna and steam room (it should be noted that they are paid); </li><li>  massage services; </li><li>  SPA center; </li><li>  barbershop; </li><li>  gym. </li></ul><p>  Currently, this looks like a standard set of face and body care services in all hotels, unless they are specialized SPA resorts. </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  A good Slavic "tradition" is to get maximum pleasure from the rest for the money invested in it.  The best that foreign resorts can give is free sightseeing. </p><p>  Near the Hedef Rose Garden 4 Hotel in Konakli are: </p><ul><li>  mosque and chapel; </li><li>  caravan - the barn; </li><li>  Children's Luna Park; </li><li>  dolphinarium. </li></ul><p>  The latter is a favorite place for children, because in it you can not only see a real shark and exotic fish, but also swim with dolphins. </p>

    <p>  In the neighboring town of Alanya, you should visit Cleopatra's beach with its white sand, an ancient fortress and port, the Red Tower and the <span>Damlatas cave</span> , ironing in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea <span>,</span> admire the surroundings from the walls of the Kale fortress and many others. </p><p>  Turkey has an ancient history, so there will be no problems with the search for attractions, because here, wherever you look, there is either a holy mountain or ancient ruins. </p><p>  No less fun can be obtained from shopping in local shops.  One gets the impression that the population has turned every free meter of land either into shops, or into restaurants, or into markets.  Prices in them sometimes pleasantly differ even from similar products in the famous eastern bazaar of Konakli. </p><h2>  Who is Hedef Rose Garden for? </h2><p>  In vain, this hotel is called mainly "family".  Yes, the location is far from noisy centers, evening programs and animations are more suitable for older couples and families with children, but there are also many young people here.  This is because they have everything they need at Hedef Rose Garden hotel 4: </p><ul><li>  beaches; </li><li>  night clubs and discos in the towns closest to the hotel; </li><li>  sports entertainment; </li><li>  show programs; </li><li>  disco bar; </li><li>  inexpensive shopping and more. </li></ul><p>  This is probably why at the height of the season youth companies prevail here, and the rest of the time the hotel is populated by elderly people and couples with children.  Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, excellent food, the cleanest Mediterranean Sea, convenient location, interesting animation and a large number of attractions are what guests of the Hedef Rose Garden Hotel praise in their reviews. </p>
