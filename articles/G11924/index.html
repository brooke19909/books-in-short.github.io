These two concepts are closely interconnected.  That is why hotel complexes are built in most cases in places that are distinguished by the massiveness of their visit.  This refers to a variety of resorts, cities most visited by tourists, attractions and cultural objects.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Odessa has a large number of hotels. </p><p>  Located in the south of the country, Odessa attracts thousands of tourists every year.  Odessa hotels are half full even in the offseason.  Numerous tours to Odessa of a lot of people contributed to raising the level of <span>hotel service.</span>  Like most resort cities, the city's budget is formed largely due to tourists.  Odessa hotels work closely with <span>local governments</span> and with this, a new service has appeared in the hotel industry of the city, allowing customers to book hotel rooms in advance completely free of charge.  To make such a reservation, just call the hotel or go to his website on the Internet.  Such a service undoubtedly makes a trip to Odessa much more attractive. </p><p>  As in many resort cities, hotel room prices are based on several parameters.  First of all, this, of course, is the "stardom" of the hotel.  The more stars she has, the more expensive she is.  It is worth noting that the "one-star" hotels in Odessa, as well as throughout the world, are becoming less and less.  Nevertheless, tourist hotels or hostels are also popular with tourists.  In such hotels there are practically no services, but the cost of housing in them is very low, which, of course, attracts the poor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, business-class hotels are developing rapidly in Odessa.  These hotels are designed for wealthy guests.  In most cases, these are business people who come to business negotiations or those who are used to relaxing in comfort.  Odessa hotels belonging to the business class have all the conditions for a comfortable stay for visitors.  The rooms have Internet access via wireless technology wi-fi, personal computers.  Also, Odessa hotels of this class provide safes where you can put all valuable things for storage: documents, money, jewelry.  On the territory of these hotels there are conference rooms and other large premises that are suitable for large business meetings, seminars or symposia.  Business class Odessa hotels are located in the central part of the city. </p><p>  The price of the hotel also depends on its location.  The closer to the sea, the higher the price of a hotel room.  However, hotels in Odessa offer quite reasonable prices for accommodation in them.  Service in hotels of almost European level, however, in Europe it is hardly possible to find a room at a cost comparable to the Odessa hotel.  It is not surprising at such prices that Odessa hotels can boast of good quality of services.  The rooms, albeit small, but very clean and well maintained for the most part. </p><p>  For tourists traveling to Odessa to sunbathe and swim in the sea, it would be better to turn their eyes to hotels on the coast.  A stunning view from the window to the sea, with its breeze, will cheer you up throughout your vacation.  Those who go to Odessa on business or prefer to explore cultural and historical values, with visits to excursions, are suitable hotels located in the central part of the city. </p><p>  The most popular and prestigious hotels in Odessa are: Zirka, London and Otrada.  In accordance with this order, their "star" status is growing.  So the first hotel belongs to the three-star type.  It is located in the city center and is famous for its high level of service.  Low prices are due to small but very comfortable rooms.  The London Hotel has four stars.  One of its facades overlooks the park area, which certainly makes it an attractive choice.  Being in the city center, you can forget about the hustle and bustle and admire nature.  The service provided by the hotel meets the European level.  And finally, the hotel with the most stars is called Joy.  This five-star hotel is located in a prestigious place of the city - on French Boulevard.  The hotel meets all international standards and captivates with its exquisite architecture of the surrounding buildings. </p><p>  Arriving in Odessa, it does not matter whether it is a tourist trip or a business trip, each person will leave in his memory a memory of the amazing nature of these places, the cleanest sea and magnificent architecture, both of historical sights and modern buildings. </p>
