Studying forums, reviews of professionals and consumers, the majority of drivers make a choice in favor of the Pioneer model, namely the DEH-80PRS. </p><p>  This radio tape recorder suits many in terms of the quality of its sound, design, and the presence of line outputs (there are only three of them).  This device is capable of working with a bluetooth connection, and it also reads WAW with ease.  In the article we will try to briefly, but as informatively as possible, consider this radio tape recorder and its competitor Alpine CDA-117RI. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deh 80prs" class="if" height="154" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639378.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer complements the model <span>Pioneer DEH-80PRS</span> (photo can be seen below) in a cardboard box, which in general is able to protect the device from unintentional deformation. </p><p>  And what awaits the buyer inside?  To begin with: the device itself, as well as the shaft for it.  The manufacturer additionally put a lot of different documentation, deliberately attaching to it a special disk that will help with the installation.  There is also a case for transferring the panel, a package for removing the device, a control panel, an extension cable and several microphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cda 117ri or pioneer deh 80prs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639379.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Radio inspection </h2><p>  In life, the DEH-80PRS cassette player looks much better than in photos on the Internet or on the box.  It is necessary to treat it as carefully as possible, since its body is glossy.  This suggests that with careless use, it will all be in small scratches.  The front part is as ergonomic as possible, although consumers note a slight inconvenience.  What are you talking about?  Next to the volume control in the closest proximity is a button that is responsible for selecting a playback source.  Because of this, any person with ease will accidentally increase or decrease the level of sound reproduction.  Of the positive aspects in the design, it can be noted that motorized panels are not used here.  Therefore, all parts are able to function for a long time without the slightest glitch. </p><p>  Under the front panel there is a drive that is responsible for processing discs.  You can immediately notice a special slot for a memory card, if necessary, it is allowed to use an adapter (in case the micro-size flash drive is used), as well as a drive release button.  On the back of the radio are special outputs: for antenna, microphone, RCA (needed for an amplifier), USB (2 pieces), AUX.  There is also a fuse. </p><p>  There is no cooler on the radiator.  This fact can be attributed to both pluses and minuses.  On the one hand, this completely eliminates the noise from its operation, on the other hand, the DEH-80PRS radio heats up quite a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 80prs specifications" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639380.jpg" width="600"></div>

In total, it has 4 functions.  Briefly consider them. </p><ul><li>  "Entertainment".  This category is one of the most non-functional.  Here are just a few settings.  The menu allows you to change the background for playing songs, as well as hide or show the clock. </li><li>  "Function".  Here the user can choose the sequence of inclusion of songs. </li><li>  "Audio".  The menu allows you to change everything regarding the sound reproduction of the Pioneer DEH-80PRS.  Subwoofer settings, equalizer, time pauses and so on - all this changes in this category. </li><li>  "Lighting".  Everything is intuitive here - setting up the display and its backlight. </li></ul><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  The ergonomics of the front of this unit are comfortable.  The encoder may remind some of the multicontroller.  But he differs from him in addition to everything else in that he has only two degrees of freedom.  Following the modern fashion, the manufacturer installed the buttons so that they do not protrude much from the general case.  It‚Äôs convenient to use them, there are no complaints.  The DEH-80PRS display has many backlight options.  Installing the device is a bit problematic, but it pays off by the fact that it is securely fixed.  The display is dim, but contrasting, so many drivers will like it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="genuine parts for radio pioneer deh 80prs" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639381.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  The general characteristics of the rear panel have already been described.  I would like to add that consumers note the excellent location of all the connectors and ports.  There are no problems connecting.  In addition, all connectors are reliable.  It's nice to work with them - the wires never go away.  Due to the fact that several ports have several pieces, you can always use the additional connector.  Breakdowns are very rare.  If there is a need for a performance check or repair, you can always contact the service center, where they will not be denied the appropriate service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 80prs photo" class="if" height="183" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  additional characteristics </h2><p>  Opening the menu of the model that the manufacturer offers, it can be noted that it is only four pages.  How to configure two or three connection levels, it is recommended to look in the instructions. </p><p>  The device interface is represented by a large number of languages, so you should not worry - there is Russian.  Sound can be corrected with a graphic equalizer.  There are also templates.  There are only five from the manufacturer; the consumer can create no more than two. </p><p>  Of the nice nuances, it is worth noting the presence of an automatic equalizer and independent sound synchronization.  They will allow to make reproduction better with the minimum expenditures of consumer efforts. </p><p>  Original parts for the Pioneer DEH-80PRS radio tape recorder, if necessary, are easy to buy at any service center.  They are publicly accessible and not expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which remote control is suitable for the pioneer deh 80prs" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The device has very few drawbacks, so let's start with them first.  Consumers, often, most of all complain about the inconvenient settings of the device, we are talking about some specific, but not all.  And also the bad viewing angles of the display are related to the minuses. </p><p>  Often consumers answer the urgent question: ‚ÄúWhich remote control will fit the Pioneer DEH-80PRS?‚Äù.  It is best to use the one that comes with the kit.  However, reviews often say that universal ones are suitable. </p><p>  The advantages are much greater, they completely cover the existing disadvantages.  These include: sufficient display sizes, protecting the front panel from dust and dirt, the presence of ports for working with Apple equipment, the ability to control all devices connected via USB directly to the radio, switching between playback modes, automatic sound synchronization systems and its settings, quality materials and assembly. </p><h2>  Alpine CDA-117RI or Pioneer DEH-80PRS </h2><p>  Consumers, most often, highlight the described model.  Why?  At least because it comes with a processor, which cannot be said about its opponent - Alpine CDA-117RI.  If you put this drawback to the background, then it can be noted that the latter option has a more natural and lively sound.  Many drivers recommend purchasing a radio in specialized stores with a direct assessment of playback.  Because you can‚Äôt advise such a technique - everyone has their own taste.  And I do not want to regret the unsuccessful expensive purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer deh 80prs subwoofer setup" class="if" height="189" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1639386.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  This model differs from the previous ones in that its sound is much improved.  The bass became more distinct and collected, the upper frequencies were noticeably improved.  If desired, you can look at the time delays.  If you tinker a bit with their settings, it is quite possible to get the most successful sound.  While listening to a song, it feels like a sound is being made outside the machine.  This can be called a successful effect. </p><p>  Concluding the review of the Pioneer DEH-80PRS model, the characteristics of which are liked by most consumers, it must be said that after operation it leaves quite positive emotions.  The bluetooth module works properly, without failures.  It connects to the music source wirelessly quickly, playback occurs without any interference.  If necessary, you can use the speakerphone.  The USB port is working fine.  It works with any kind of flash drives.  Recognizes music files in a few seconds (no more than five).  If the playback was interrupted for some reason, when you restart the radio, it will start from the same place. </p>
