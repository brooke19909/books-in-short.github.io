    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Believers believe that at the top of Narystau two sahabs (father and son) are buried - Zubair Ibn Zait and Abdurrahman Ibn Zubair, who are very revered.  Information is known that they arrived on the territory of modern Bashkiria as early as the 7th century and carried with them faith in Allah.  The followers of Islam call the Sahaba those who were an ally and associate of the Prophet Muhammad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to historians, the peak of Narystau, near which the holy spring is located, is the place of the grave where the hero of the epic tales, called Idukai, is buried.  This is the legendary hero who distinguished himself in the confrontation between the Bashkr and the Khan of the Golden Horde named Tokhtamysh.  The merciless army of the latter burned villages, destroyed the people in a bloody struggle and punitive campaigns. </p><p>  The historical events of this period are reflected in one of the Bashkir epics under the name "Idukai and Muradym", which today is recognized as a literary monument.  There the mountain (which the truth was then known as Narysta-tau) was mentioned many times.  Idukai is called the very Edigey who is considered a temnik in the Golden Horde.  This refers to the events of the late 14th - early 15th centuries.  He founded the dynasty, which became the head of the <span>Nogai Horde.</span>  The direct descendants of Idukai (meaning the male line) are the princely family of the Urusovs and the Yusupovs. </p><p>  Not far from it there is a neighboring mountain, which is considered the burial place of his son - Muradym.  Since the time when these heroes of Bashkiria rested on these peaks, they are revered and respected among the inhabitants of the region.  Izge Gali is a spring that can be called a symbol of the living connection between the bygone eras and the present day, which shows its value with the help of natural forces. </p>

    <h2>  Monument History </h2><p>  Mount Narystau, the holy spring (photo you can see below) and other attractions are also the location of a beautiful monument, on which are written the names of the holy Muslim associates.  Not so long ago, a white openwork yurt, which is made of metal structures, was installed next to it.  The style of construction is traditional Islamic.  It immediately performs two functions: protecting the monument and aerial architectural composition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This holy place attracts pilgrims from many regions and countries, including Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, all of Russia, as well as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and many others.  The history of this monument is old and surrounded by legends.  It is said that the inhabitants of Central Asia had to get here using camels as a transport.  Legends indicate that Mount Narystau is known even in the holy city of Mecca.  The writer Gazim Shafikov published an entertaining story about the peak, which is based on the memories of the villagers.  She says that a mullah from these parts made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where everyone was surprised why he went to such distant lands, if there are such famous sacred places next to him. </p>

    <p>  Regardless of whether all these stories are true or not, it is difficult to disagree with how beautiful Mount Narystau is.  The holy spring (reviews of which can be read below) also helps many people with its healing power.  Every year in these parts you can see a large number of pilgrims - both from Russia and other countries. </p><p>  There is a belief that you need to make three wishes and go around the burial 7 times, after which they will surely be fulfilled. </p><h2>  Nowadays </h2><p>  Five years ago, thanks to the Ural Charitable Foundation and the chairman of the foundation‚Äôs board, Murtaza Rakhimov, the same <span>memorial</span> was built on the mountain <span>.</span>  <span>The complex</span> looks like a yurt, which is decorated with three crescents.  The mosque was built four years ago by the mountain with the support of charitable organizations.  The white building has several columns and miniature minarets.  In 2014, the village celebrated the anniversary, which is located near the top.  The ancient community celebrated it together: apparently, the holy places influence people who live here together and joyfully. </p>

    <h2>  Source Izge Gali </h2><p>  The foot of the peak is famous for the holy spring, which is called Izge Gali.  The source does not freeze even in severe frosts.  The approaches to it are landscaped, there is also a swimming pool in which people dive in holy water.  Reviews from tourists who have been here indicate that this spring heals.  Water from it can be in the vessel and not spoil for a long time.  Maybe its properties are due to the fact that silver ions are present in it. </p>

    <h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  The holy spring beats in the middle of a plot of two hectares, which has a rectangular shape.  This place is planted with vegetation - trees and shrubs, among which there are pines, spruce, mountain ash, rosehip bushes and barberry.  The area where the source beats protects the canopy, which is built of red brick, as well as a wooden structure.  In addition, there is a decorative metal fence.  On the way to the spring, the locals put gazebos.  Landscaping of this site, they were also engaged.  It was the inhabitants of local villages who planted trees and ennobled the territory. </p><h2>  Bathhouse </h2><p>  The unusually cold spring water has not only healing properties: bathing in it is a pleasant ritual that adds strength and energy.  The procedure takes place in a small building, divided into female and male half.  If you suddenly forget your swimsuit, you can dive into the source without them. </p>
