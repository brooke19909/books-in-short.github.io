Resorts of the Black Sea coast of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When planning how to spend your next vacation, think about a vacation on the Black Sea coast of Russia.  For some reason, today it has become popular to travel exclusively to foreign resorts, not paying attention to what is very close by. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the Black Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470115.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Of course, it's worth seeing the world.  But only by learning to see the beauty of what surrounds us, one can fully appreciate the new experiences.  Almost the entire <span>Black Sea coast,</span> which is part of Russia, is suitable for a resort holiday.  Therefore, the choice of vacation location is quite wide.  Let's consider large cities for starters. </p><h2>  Major Cities of the Black Sea Coast of Russia: List </h2><p>  If you make this list, starting with large cities immediately after the Crimean peninsula and moving along the coast to the southwest, then it will look like this: </p><ul><li>  Anapa; </li><li>  Novorossiysk; </li><li>  Gelendzhik; </li><li>  Tuapse; </li><li>  Lazarevskoye; </li><li>  Sochi </li></ul><p>  What can these <span>resort towns of the</span> Black Sea coast of Russia offer for tourists?  Here you can not only have a good time on the beach, but also see many attractions, as well as visit the diverse events that are regularly held by the municipal authorities.  Now let's talk about the above resorts in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Anapa </h2><p>  This is one of the most comfortable cities.  A visitor may even get the impression that the best places on the Black Sea coast of Russia are concentrated in Anapa.  Judge for yourself - for the season this city receives more than 4 million 200 thousand people.  And they all leave the city with a slight sense of longing and a distinct desire to return. </p><p>  And this attitude is not accidental.  After all, not only nature worked on Anapa, but also the people themselves.  There are excellent conditions for tourists.  The city has beautiful parks.  The streets are clean and well maintained.  The beaches provide everything you need for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  Very beautifully decorated "Avenue of roses."  In the middle of it they put a fountain, made in the style of the temples of the ancient Aztecs.  The quiet murmur of water, the aroma of numerous types of roses blooming all along the alley and the light salty breeze flying from the sea fill a simple walk with unforgettable impressions. </p><p>  As for entertainment, it is very difficult in Anapa not to stumble upon something close to your heart.  All kinds of attractions, summer theaters, water parks and karaoke are scattered throughout the city. </p><p>  Those who prefer outdoor activities can go on a quad bike safari or visit a crocodile farm.  Fans of cycling, horse riding or kite surfing will also find interest clubs here.  And the huge number of excursions offered will satisfy the most demanding travelers. </p><h2>  Novorossiysk </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resorts of the Black Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470119.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Strictly speaking, this city is not considered a resort.  But a tourist map of the Black Sea coast of Russia would not be complete without this place.  And not least because the rest in this city has in its arsenal what is inaccessible to its noisy resort counterparts.  Namely - a certain share of peace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Within the boundaries of Novorossiysk is a multi-kilometer coastline.  But most of it is occupied by the port.  However, this does not mean that the city is completely devoid of beaches.  On the contrary, there are both bathing areas well-equipped with the city, where familiar sunbeds, sun loungers and other amenities of the seaside resort are available, as well as completely wild beaches, beckoning by their isolation from civilization and giving incomparable peace. </p><p>  In addition, vacation on the Black Sea coast of Russia may include the study of underwater depths.  And under the supervision of professional instructors, you can successfully do it in Novorossiysk. </p><h2>  Gelendzhik </h2><p>  The resorts of the Black Sea coast of Russia are designed not only to give a pleasant experience and provide an opportunity to relax after a long labor period, but also are aimed at improving the health of its guests.  Moreover, both general and narrowly targeted. </p><p>  And the city of Gelendzhik can safely fight for the palm in this regard.  Here, deep in the bowels of the earth, mineral waters form.  Numerous sanatoriums are located near these deposits, in which you can combine relaxation with a health course. </p><p>  Nature in the vicinity of Gelendzhik enchants with its beauty.  The nearby mountains contributed to this a lot, from which numerous rivers and rivulets tear down waterfalls, continuing their run into the hospitable embrace of sea waters. </p><p>  The length of the beaches in Gelendzhik exceeds 20 kilometers.  Along them are the best pensions of the Black Sea coast of Russia.  The eight-kilometer city embankment is one of the longest in the whole world.  You can walk around it for hours, examining sculptures, fountains and green spaces. </p><h2>  Tuapse </h2><p>  With regard to natural wealth and diversity, Tuapse will easily receive the highest award in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Most Beautiful Places of the Black Sea Coast of Russia‚Äù.  90% of all land in this area is covered by forests.  Wild animals live in picturesque mountain gorges and ravines.  The Caucasian cat, weasel and marten feel great here.  A meeting with a real bear in the forest will not see anyone. </p><p>  A great many birds take their trills from dawn to dusk.  For tourists who are not used to such performances, their songs serve as a good alarm clock.  But few complain about this. </p><p>  From Tuapse, you can book an excursion to the Lago-Naki plateau.  These places are in no way inferior in beauty to the famous alpine meadows in Switzerland.  Or head to thirty-three waterfalls located on the deep Dzhegosh stream. </p><p>  Well, of course, spend enough time swimming in the sea.  The climate here is favorable, the swimming season lasts from May to October.  Like all the beaches of the Black Sea coast of Russia, the territories reserved for swimming in Tuapse are equipped with everything necessary for relaxation. </p><h2>  Lazarevskoye </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="black sea beach" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470120.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Lazarevskoye is famous for its sparing climate.  Snow is a rare guest here.  The average temperature of the coldest month - February - froze at around 6 degrees Celsius.  And the summer is not warm thanks to the constantly refreshing breeze from the sea. </p><p>  Resorts of the Black Sea coast of Russia in this region can offer 200 sunny days per year for recreation.  And thousands of tourists who come to the southern cities with their families are ready to take advantage of this offer. </p><p>  Compared with the surrounding settlements, the prices for holidays in Lazarevsky are quite sparing, this does not affect the quantity or quality of the proposed entertainment at all.  There are many clubs, cafes and restaurants.  Entertainment centers will not let you miss either children or adults.  A visit to the penguinarium, dolphinarium and oceanarium will allow you to get acquainted with the marine inhabitants. </p><h2>  Sochi </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia Black Sea" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470123.jpg" width="448"></div></h2><p>  Sochi is the largest resort listed.  From ancient times, the elite of society came to rest in this area.  The best hotels of the Black Sea coast of Russia are located here. </p><p>  This city is saturated with entertainment, like a sponge dipped in water.  Cinemas, discos, clubs, bars and restaurants are here at every step.  Children will be delighted with the Riviera amusement park, and adults should visit the Planet Sochi center, where they are the service facilities. </p><p>  It is in this city that the popular KVN festival takes place.  In addition, at any time you can visit the art museum, circus or concert hall, depending on personal preferences. </p><p>  As for the beaches, there are a lot of them in Sochi.  There are pebble and sand, open and closed, equipped with the latest fashion and completely wild.  As they say - any whim for your money!  And they, I must admit, there will have to leave a lot.  But, in the end, the choice always remains with tourists.  After all, it is up to them to decide where to go and how much you can afford to spend on it. </p><p>  However, rest on the Black Sea coast of Russia is not concentrated only in several large geographical points.  Between the big cities there are smaller objects, a stay in which will bring travelers no less fun.  Therefore, we now consider what the villages of the Black Sea coast of Russia can offer tourists. </p><h2>  Kabardinka </h2><p>  Although the village of Kabardinka does not differ in impressive size, the tourist infrastructure here is developed so that it is just as easy to envy some large cities.  On the beaches you can rent a jet ski, a catamaran or a yacht, ride a ‚Äútablet‚Äù or a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù. </p><p>  Here in honor diving and windsurfing.  Horseback riding in the area is also available.  Various cafes and restaurants offer their services on the promenade.  In the evenings, guests are invited to discos and nightclubs. </p><p>  From Kabardinka you can go on an excursion to the safari park or visit the mud volcanoes.  Nearby are the famous Abrau-Durso wineries producing high-quality champagne.  Here, rest on the Black Sea coast of Russia can be spiced up with a tasting of excellent wines. </p><p>  The village has a resort complex, marked by five stars, and more than 130 different official opportunities to rent housing.  So it‚Äôs almost impossible to stay here without a roof over your head even in high season. </p><h2>  Dzhubga </h2><p>  Dzhubga - a place where the wind is spreading.  That is how the name of the village is translated.  He sheltered under the canopy of the mountain with a very nice name - Hedgehog.  The combination of the sea, the mountains protecting the village and the dense forest created a mild Mediterranean climate in this area, which has a very beneficial effect on health. </p><p>  In addition, there are large deposits of healing blue clay.  People noticed its health properties for a long time.  So do not miss the opportunity to further strengthen your health. </p><p>  Well, when the first euphoria from staying in the tender embrace of the salty sea begins to subside little by little and the soul craves adventures, you can go spearfishing, rock climbing or jumping.  Fortunately, there were plenty of those offering such entertainments. </p><p>  And if you come on vacation with children, then listen to a little advice.  There is a water park in Dzhubga.  Try not to show it to your offsprings at least the first few days in order to have time to enjoy a vacation on the beach.  Because as soon as your children visit it at least once, they will not give you rest. </p><p>  The fact is that the Dzhubga water park complex is the largest in the region.  There are more than 20 different attractions, and oh, how hard it is to break away from them! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places of the Black Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  Crimea has always been a special resort place on the coast, which Russia has now taken care of.  The Black Sea, washing the peninsula, has always attracted vacationers from all the republics of the USSR.  It is not for nothing that the Crimea was called the All-Union Health Resort. </p><p>  Contrary to popular belief, to see the Crimean peninsula in all its glory, you need to go here not in the midst of summer, or even in the velvet season, but in early spring or late autumn.  It is then that its amazing nature will open to you at its best. </p><p>  However, if you want to get a standard set of pleasures - the Black Sea, the beach and a beautiful tan - you still have to go here in the summer.  Therefore, we begin to consider places that are worth visiting. </p><h2>  Yalta </h2><p>  This is probably the most famous city of the Crimean peninsula.  Yalta is a favorite place of the intelligentsia.  Here and today it is customary to slowly walk along the promenade, as it has been happening for many decades in a row. </p><p>  Beautiful monuments, a rich history and a sense of familiarity with something ancient and great could not be replaced by loud discos or restaurants with exquisite dishes.  Here I want to relax not only with my body, but also with my soul. </p><p>  Resting in Yalta, take the time to visit the royal residence in Livadia.  This building rightfully competes with the Vorontsov Palace in Alupka.  Livadia residence is strikingly beautiful and elegant.  The motives of classicism, modernism and the Renaissance used in it are organically intertwined and complement each other.  Thin stucco molding, shady galleries, a bay window and towers create a striking architectural ensemble. </p><h2>  Cape Tarkhankut </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of the Black Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470128.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Well, those who want to take a break from civilization and just go to the Black Sea, Tarhankut beach will reliably hide from a noisy crowd.  The fact is that it is not very convenient to get here.  The best thing is to drive your car, but you will have to leave it on the road, because the descent to the beach is steep enough even for a walk. </p><p>  But transparent as a tear, water, the amazing shape of the coastal cliffs and a sense of true solitude will more than pay for any minor inconvenience. </p><p>  These places are especially appreciated by divers.  And not only because of clean water, but also because the entire underwater coastal zone of the cape is cut with picturesque grottoes, caves, small bays and intricate bays. </p><h2>  Royal beach </h2><p>  Another wild piece of the coast is located near Cape Kapchik, on the outskirts of the New World.  In fact, it is officially closed, since at the moment there is a threat of landslides there, and therefore the area is unsafe for tourism. </p><p>  But if possible, it is worth going there at least in order to admire the magnificent view of the unusually blue water in a magnificent setting of towering rocks. </p><h2>  Golden beach </h2><p>  If you come with children, then the Golden Beach in Feodosia will be an excellent choice.  It owes its name to yellow sand.  The descent into the water is gentle, so the kids can calmly splash around in the coastal waves.  And the possibilities of sand sculpting of various figures are completely endless. </p><h2>  Chufut-Kale </h2><p>  In addition to standard sets of beaches and water parks, the Crimean peninsula can please with interesting buildings that have been preserved since ancient times.  And a special place in this collection is, of course, cave cities, carved directly in the rocks. </p><p>  These fortifications built in sheer cliffs were indeed full-fledged functioning cities.  Heavy massive gates and deep ditches guarded the approaches to them.  In the cities there was a rather interesting system for collecting and storing rainwater and food supplies.  The complexes of residential buildings and farm buildings were competently designed to make the most of the available space. </p><p>  These ancient cities are perfectly preserved until our days.  An interesting story is connected with the study, for example, Chufut-Kale.  According to legend, the city was a secret source of water in case of siege.  Only a few initiates knew how to get to this source, who transmitted information directly to their successor. </p><p>  Of course, by the time the archaeologists began to work, none of these elected were left alive.  The city was studied, described and "commissioned" as a tourist attraction.  But ancient legends haunted one stubborn scientist.  Combining one known to him the data of geological explorations and assumptions, with snippets of information about the legendary source, he again set about searching. </p><p>  And his efforts were crowned with success.  Thanks to these investigations, not only a cleverly designed and well-camouflaged inner well, powered by underground sources, was found, but also a real treasure of ancient coins, which is of great value to archaeologists. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful places of the Black Sea coast of Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/470133.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  And although, having arrived today to rest on the Crimean peninsula, you are unlikely to be able to make a significant discovery for science, but for yourself you can very well become a daring and successful pioneer. </p>
