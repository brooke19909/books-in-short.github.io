    <h2>  Scientific works and books of Julia Kantor </h2><p>  Thanks to her work in the editorial department of the newspaper Nevskoye Vremya (also a correspondent for the Izvestia newspaper), Kantor Yulia had access to a large database of classified documents from the Second World War.  Curiosity and a craving for knowledge prompted Julia to seriously study the entire period of the war.  She described her studies in detail in her books.  For example, in 2008, Julia published one of her most powerful works - a book on Stalinist repressions.  ‚ÄúThe War and Peace of Tukhachevsky‚Äù is a book that describes detailed details about the ‚Äúmilitary case‚Äù, it is based on the life example of the Soviet military commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Yulia Zorakhovna is the author of a number of historical books, such as Sworn Friendship. Secret Relations of the USSR and Germany, Baltic States. War without Rules, Tukhachevsky.  All books are based on reliable sources, because when they were written, Julia used data from unique documents taken from the Central Archive of the FSB and foreign military archives.  In these books you can find answers to many questions regarding the political motives of certain events, for example, the repressions of 1937-1939. </p>

    <h2>  Social work </h2><p>  In addition to scientific activities, Cantor Julia is actively involved in public affairs.  She constantly speaks at various meetings with proposals to perpetuate the memory of victims of repression.  So, for example, in 2012, Julia was appointed a member of the expert group of the program to help the needy victims of <span>political repression.</span>  Of course, the state provides assistance (financial support ranging from 300 to 2,000 rubles), but Julia Zorakhovna believes that this is too little.  ‚ÄúWe need every Russian citizen to realize that the repression of the 20th century is a common national tragedy,‚Äù she says. </p><p>  To the question of how she manages to combine work at the university (we recall that she is a professor at the Herzen State Pedagogical University of History) with active social activities, Yulia Zorakhovna replies that competent time management helps her. </p>
