    <p>  The history of trade dates back more than one century, then fading (Middle Ages), then flourishing (Renaissance).  Even primitive people observed relationships in the course of which some objects or products were changed to others.  In Mesopotamia, Egypt, they began to take shape more clearly, units of calculation appeared, and a regular pattern began to emerge: goods - money - goods. </p><p>  The Babylonian cuneiform script talks about transactions for the purchase and sale of slaves, livestock, land.  At the same time, credit relations between people began to take shape, and the ways by which goods, slaves and cattle were delivered to Persia, Armenia, Media, Arabia and India were mastered.  In the same way, precious stones, spices and incense, fabrics and articles made of silver and gold were delivered.  The cities through which cargo was transported flourished. </p><p>  The history of trade in ancient Greece, and later in the Roman Empire, was reflected in myths and <span>works of art.</span>  <span>The Greek god</span> Hermes and the Roman Mercury helped people in a successful exchange of goods, and temples were erected in their honor, sacred gifts were brought to them.  And if the ancient Greeks not only imported, but also sold various goods, then the Romans, as a rule, only imported them.  <span>The Roman Empire</span> bought bread and lentils from Egypt, meat and dairy products from Gaul, fruits and olive oil were delivered from Africa, and silk from China.  Almost the whole world had relations with Rome. </p><p>  After the fall of this great empire, the history of trade turns in a different direction.  New European states are being formed, which for prosperity must be engaged in sales.  During the time of Emperor Justinian in the VI century A.D.  Byzantium enters the world stage and <span>establishes relations</span> between European countries and the East; sea and river routes of cargo delivery are laid.  Byzantium imports cotton and sugar from Syria, trades with India, China, and the Black Sea countries, until Italian merchants become their competitors, stealing the secret of silk production from the Chinese.  Since then, Europeans themselves began to produce these exquisite fabrics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Middle Ages were not favorable for the prosperity and development of sales, and only in the Renaissance did the history of trade gain a new direction.  People began to discover new, unexplored lands, navigation is booming, previously unknown ways to transport goods are being mastered.  At the same time, there are surpluses of goods that need to be sold.  This period is also characterized by the fact that the history of the development of trade begins to acquire a negative character.  The massive removal of slaves from Africa until the 19th century is a terrible shame on civilized Europe.  People were sold worse than cattle, and taken to the Old and New Worlds. </p><p>  Our ancestors began to engage in the sale of relatively recently.  The history of trade in Russia begins from the VIII-IX centuries, and Kiev was its center.  At that time, our ancestors supplied honey, furs, and agricultural products to the foreign market.  In the cities on the squares there were festivities, where they sold leather, furs, various utensils.  By the XII century, Novgorod became the main Russian shopping center, and in the XIV century - Moscow.  Our ancestors knew how to sell and knew a lot about it.  Various fairs and <span>courtyards</span> began to appear <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the era of Peter, the history of trade in Russia becomes European.  Merchants and industrialists successfully promote the country on the <span>world market.</span>  A more intensive procurement of goods from Europe and America begins.  By the middle of the 18th century, large companies were being formed, relations were being established with India and China, from where many goods were imported.  Towards the end of the 19th century, the history of the development of trade in Russia came to its peak.  The empire has become one of the leading powers exporting the lion's share of products to the world market. </p>
