    <p>  <span>The principle of operation of</span> a car generator is to convert <span>mechanical energy</span> into electrical <span>energy</span> .  This device also serves as a <span>battery charger</span> when the engine is running.  Another of his important tasks is to ensure the stable operation of all electrical systems, preventing battery discharge.  This usually occurs at low voltage.  Otherwise, the battery is recharged, which leads to its rapid failure.  To be more precise, the principle of operation of the generator is simple.  Using a <span>belt drive, the</span> motor rotates the rotor.  Further, the voltage is supplied to the field winding, which forms a <span>magnetic flux.</span>  The relay-regulator regulates the flow strength, which is provided by a decrease or increase in the voltage on the brushes.  At the output, the voltage fluctuates within the required limits, which is sufficient for the normal operation of the battery.  The principle of operation of the generator, it turns out, is not as complicated as it seemed the first time. </p>

    <p>  Generator device </p><p>  Each mechanic, in addition to the principle of operation of the generator, needs to know its device, which is a few separate units assembled in one housing.  The main elements are: housing, stator, rotor, relay-regulator and rectifier bridge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The generator housing is an alloy metal assembly that is the base for the stator winding.  "Windows" in the case are designed for better cooling.  In the front and rear parts are bearings with which the rotor is mounted.  The stator is a winding of copper wire laid in the grooves of the core.  Three stator windings are interconnected by a triangle, where a rectifier bridge is connected to them.  This is because a car generator is considered a three-phase energy producer.  Phase windings must be insulated.  Most often, special varnish is used.  The rotor has one winding, which is located on the shaft itself.  On the same shaft there are copper rings connected to the winding by graphite brushes, which supply voltage from the relay regulator. </p>

    <p>  Relay regulator regulates and controls the voltage at the output of the generator.  It can be installed both in the housing and separately.  In the first case, the regulator is with brushes in one housing, and in the second, the brushes are installed on the brush holder.  The rectifier bridge allows you to get a constant from a three-phase AC voltage.  The principle of operation of the generator will be more effective if, during its assembly, all the elements are folded correctly.  In the event of a skew, jamming may occur, which will lead to serious consequences. </p>

    <p>  By design, generators can be divided into two groups: traditional and compact design.  The first includes devices with one fan, which is located at the drive pulley, and the second - with two fans located in the internal cavity of the device.  From these differences, the principle of operation of the generator does not change.  Its installation is carried out on special brackets with bolts.  The tensioning eye and mounting legs of the generator are located on the covers. </p>

    <p>  During operation of the automobile generator, it is forbidden to perform several actions.  If the rectifier is faulty, do not leave it connected to the battery.  It is not recommended to check the operability of the device, closing it to ground, as well as disconnecting it from the battery during engine operation.  And it is undesirable to spill electrolyte, antifreeze and other liquids on the generator. </p>
