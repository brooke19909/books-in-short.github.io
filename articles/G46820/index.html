Located in the south of the globe, it is unique in that it occupies the territory of the entire vast continent and the nearby islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. </p><p>  It is necessary to distinguish between Australia - the continent and Australia - a state that takes fourth place in the ranking of the best countries in the world, which indicates a high standard of living of the population. </p><h2>  Terra Australis Incognita </h2><p>  In our article, we will talk about a state, also called the <span>Australian Union.</span>  In ancient times, people assumed that there were undiscovered corners in the Southern Hemisphere called Terra Australis Incognita, which means "unknown southern land."  Before the advent of Europeans, locals living in the tribes extracted food using stone tools. </p><p>  In 1770, an expedition led by <span>D. Cook, having</span> examined the coast of previously unknown lands, recognized them as possessions of Great Britain.  After 18 years, dangerous convicts began to be brought to the continent, which was in isolation, and this continued until 1840. </p><p>  However, free people also came to the new country for the best share, having founded various colonies on the mainland, which later merged into one, called the Australian Union in 1901. </p><h2>  Income to treasury from tourism </h2><p>  The amazing state of <span>Australia,</span> whose <span>sights are</span> known all over the world, takes care of the development of new tourist routes that bring the main income to the country's budget. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the variety of natural and man-made monuments to travelers who want to explore as many unusual places as possible, it is sometimes difficult to navigate the place. </p><h2>  Great Barrier Reef </h2><p>  For those who want to take a break from civilization, Fantastic Australia offers tourist routes that deserve attention for adults and children.  The state, the sights of which can be called real natural miracles, is making every effort to preserve an unusual colony of marine organisms located off the coast of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Australia Attractions Description" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1218131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A giant reef consisting of polyps is visible even from space.  Marine organisms throughout their lives form a unique capsule - coral.  Thus, a colony of polyps reaches an incredible size, most of which is under water.  This stunning sight is remembered by everyone on the coast - over 900 <span>coral islands</span> growing every day are visible above the smooth surface of the ocean <span>.</span> </p><p>  Those who are not limited in finances are offered a wonderful vacation in the hotels located on the islands of the state of Australia.  Attractions first discovered by the French traveler Bougainville are the largest and long-lived organisms in the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Researchers of the World Ocean have established that the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãpolyps is 3.5 million square kilometers, which is much larger than Great Britain, which considered the country its colony, and organisms appeared more than eight thousand years ago. </p><h2>  Australia (state): attractions.  Pink Lake Hillier </h2><p>  Another amazing place where tourists come from all over the globe, despite the unusual color, has a natural origin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Australia state attractions pink lake" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1218133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lake located on Middle Island since its discovery at the beginning of the XIX century, keeps the secret of the pink shade of its waters.  There are several versions that explain the strange color, but scientists of the world are inclined to one of them, suggesting that the amazing color of the lake is the result of various microbes.  And in the hot months, the color of the salt reservoir changes to bright coral. </p><p>  Local guides warn that the best time to visit an unusual reservoir is summer, which lasts in the country from December to February, because it is then that the color of the water becomes saturated and visible from afar.  Tourists are offered the opportunity to view the local attraction from the air in order to fully enjoy the beautiful sight. </p><h2>  Abandoned british ship </h2><p>  For many years now, an abandoned British ship, which was acquired by the government of the country, has been standing in Hombush Bay.  In the 70s, swimming equipment was decommissioned, and it remained forever at the mouth of the Parramatta River <span>(Sydney, Australia).</span>  The state, the sights (photo below) of which changed beyond recognition due to the influence of wildlife, did not care about the abandoned ship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Australia state attractions photo" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1218141.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now the ship is completely rusted, and its inspection from the inside is not performed.  However, from the coast, tourists enjoy the stunning view of the ship, completely twisted with mangroves, the swimming facility looks especially beautiful at sunset. </p><h2>  Devil's stones </h2><p>  In the valley in the south of the country more than a million years ago, under the influence of erosion processes, huge boulders formed, called devilish.  The state of Australia, whose attractions cause a sense of admiration, considers these stones a symbol of uninhabited corners. </p><p>  Water and wind rounded the granite blocks remaining after volcanic eruptions when hot lava seeped through cracks in the earth's crust. </p><p>  The temperature difference affects the boulders is not the best way, and some of them split in half. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Australia state attractions" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1218142.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ancient <span>aborigines of Australia</span> keep the legend that once the devil himself walked along this valley, scattering giant stones with a reddish tint.  Now this corner is of particular interest for curious tourists who come to admire the fantastic-looking area with massive boulders. </p><h2>  Ricketts Sanctuary </h2><p>  We can not tell you about the unusual open-air museum, located near Melbourne.  In a small park, viewers are presented 92 sculptures created by potter W. Ricketts from clay and wood.  The state of Australia, whose sights are very interesting, is proud of the museum called the sanctuary.  For 33 years he worked on the creation of his works by Ricketts, who had lived among the natives for a long time and was impressed by their special attitude to nature. </p><p>  The museum, created by the hands of one person, is considered one of the most mystical places in the country.  Strange sculptures seem to grow out of mossy boulders and peek out from the mighty tree trunks, and some statues spread their wings, as if protecting each other. </p><p>  Tourists walking here for hours notice a completely different atmosphere of unity with nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state australia attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1218160.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Amazing sights of Australia (we described the description of some of them in the article) will always attract tourists who want to enjoy the beauty of nature and monuments created by human hands.  Even experienced travelers will discover many new corners, the memory of which will remain for many years. </p>
