    <p>  Forex Club is a group of joint brokerage companies and educational institutions that provide effective access to their clients to online trading.  The number of customers reaches several hundred thousand in more than 120 countries. </p><p>  There is nothing superfluous on the club‚Äôs official website.  Everything is concise and clear.  Three sections are given.  If you are already an experienced and confident trader, then welcome to the last section - ‚ÄúStart Trading‚Äù. </p><p>  This is a very correct note warning that trading in the foreign exchange market is a risky activity that brings not only profit, but also losses.  The amount of possible losses is limited by the size of the deposit. </p><p>  In fact, in these two lines lies the main point of trading in the foreign exchange market.  Trading is a job that needs to be constantly improved.  And this requires training and experience.  Forex trading is a risk, but the risk is justified.  You can‚Äôt just give up on failure.  Today you leaked the entire deposit, and tomorrow you can triple your deposit.  This is also indicated by many reviews (including about the Forex Club) of traders, and if you are not ready to take risks, then the <span>foreign exchange market is</span> definitely not for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forex club reviews" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/73673.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are new to this business, we advise you to start from the second section - ‚ÄúOn-line seminar‚Äù.  Here you will learn how to learn online trading.  They will tell you about financial markets, how to trade in them and what principles are best followed for successful work.  You will learn where to start, which trading platform to choose and how to open a training demo account.  In addition, you have the opportunity to receive online advice from teachers and analysts of the Academy individually. </p><p>  And the first section remained - this is the opening of a demo account.  There you go through registration, download the trading terminal and start trading virtual money. </p><p>  Here I want to make a small digression.  Many experienced traders do not recommend starting their training with a demo account, since the trading conditions on the virtual and real accounts are still different.  Better if you study on a cent account, this is real trading.  Only they do not have the Forex Club, customer reviews on this occasion are regrettable.  Just then it will be much easier to work with the dollar counterpart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forex club reviews" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11061/73674.jpg" width="274"></div>

    <p>  Trading conditions provided by the Forex Club (customer reviews on this subject are positive): </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ trading platforms - StartFX2, MT4, Rumus; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ minimum deposit amount of 200 US dollars; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ leverage from 1: 1 to 1: 200; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ trading instruments - currency, stocks, gold, indices, oil, metals and so on; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ deposit opens in US dollars; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ methods of withdrawal / replenishment of accounts - this is a Webmoney system, plastic cards of international payment systems and a virtual VISA card. </p><p>  What can say reviews about the Forex Club?  First of all, I would like to note that reviews should be viewed only on reliable resources, for example, arbitration on WebMoney.  As for the Forex Club, the reviews left about it say that there is a normal, working process.  Someone is happy with everything, everyone is happy, but someone has complaints and questions.  Perhaps here you need to be able to read between the lines. </p><p>  If a person writes that he was deceived and robbed, then most likely this is a grief newcomer who did not really understand anything, decided that it was like a game of poker.  The result here is obvious - a drain of the deposit.  There are reviews with a purely subjective opinion.  For example, one is not comfortable with a floating spread, and the other is fixed.  One platform is suitable for someone, another is suitable for someone, and so it is possible to sort through ad infinitum. </p><p>  There is only one conclusion here - you need to try it yourself, otherwise you can‚Äôt figure it out. </p>
