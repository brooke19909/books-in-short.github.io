    <p>  One of the most profitable and popular today is the simplified taxation system for LLC (USN) - a set of measures that are chosen voluntarily and used at the same level with other peers.  Although this system implies a different procedure for calculating payments and maintaining reports, it has been chosen by many entrepreneurs, as it is beneficial when compared with the classical system, which provides for the general taxation of LLCs.  And if we are talking about a small company, then accounting is much easier.  This simplifies the task for every entrepreneur.  But, nevertheless, the LLC must take into account that it is impossible to refuse accounting, this is evidenced by a letter from the Minister of Finance.  In 2013, minor changes were made to the tax code, so the system has undergone modernization.  More on this later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mandatory conditions </h2><p>  <span>Simplified taxation system</span> for a company with an ogre </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/395035.jpg" title="tax system for llc" width="305"></div>  In 2014, it has several strict requirements that must be observed:

In order to make the transition to simplification, a notification must be submitted to the tax organization from 1.10 to 31.12.

    <h2>  Objects and tax rates </h2><p>  For a limited liability company, only two types of STS are provided.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Objects where income is taken into account (six percent rate) and income where net profit is taken into account. </li><li>  Taxable item.  In this case, a rate of 6% of the total profit is assigned. </li><li>  Taxable income.  Net profit is taken into account here.  A peculiar system of "income minus expenses". </li></ul><p>  The law on taxation provides that the organization has the right to change the object.  However, you must first inform the appropriate authority.  The organization can choose the scheme independently.  But this rule does not apply to companies that are not parties to joint ventures.  For such organizations, a tax system for LLCs is preferred where income excludes expenses.  In this case, the object is a purely profit. </p><p>  The legislation allows organizations to set tax rates, only their percentage should vary from five to fifteen.  This is an important fact.  But nevertheless, the minimum percentage is equal to one of all income, according to Art.  345. 15 of the Tax Code. </p><h2>  Opportunities provided by a simplified tax system for LLC </h2><p>  If the organization has <span>applied the simplified tax system,</span> then it may not pay the following types of taxes: </p><ul><li>  On the property. </li><li>  At a profit. </li><li>  <span>Value added.</span>  This rule does not provide for the tax that is paid when goods are imported into the customs territory of Russia. </li></ul><p>  The organization that uses the simplified tax system is a kind of agent, in other words, it carries out withholding, calculating and paying <span>taxes on personal income (PIT).</span>  For example, in relation to their hired workers. </p><p>  Before deciding what taxation to choose for an LLC, you need to identify the pros and cons of each system.  This is important. </p><p>  Also, organizations can pay other taxes, such as: excise taxes;  land;  water;  for transport, etc. </p><h2>  Insurance premiums </h2><p>  When registering an LLC, mandatory additional payments will be required.  These include premiums.  The most popular of these are the following payments: </p><ul><li>  To the pension fund of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Social insurance.  To receive benefits in case of disability or related to motherhood and childbirth. </li><li>  To the territorial fund of compulsory health insurance. </li></ul><h2>  Definition of expenses and income </h2><p>  The solution to this issue requires the right approach.  During the determination of the taxable object, the STS provides for the accounting of income from sales, as well as other profits.  Details about this are written in the <span>tax code of the Russian Federation (Articles</span> 249 and 250).  You should carefully read their contents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax law" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/395047.jpg?1399927737835" width="300"></div>  And article 251 of the same code describes income that is not subject to accounting, as well as those that are subject to income tax.  The costs are determined and taken into account in accordance with Art.  346.16 of the Tax Code.

    <p>  The date of receipt of income is when the money arrives at the bank account or at the cash desk of the organization.  Costs - these are the costs that were made only after payment upon delivery.  If, in this case, the ‚Äúobject - net profit‚Äù scheme is used, then the organization has the right to add all insurance premiums to expenses.  This is a prerequisite.  And with another version of the ‚Äúobject-income‚Äù scheme, an LLC can reduce the tax, given that insurance premiums will be paid on their own. </p><h2>  Changes made in 2014 </h2><p>  This item is also important to familiarize yourself with.  Different types of taxation for the LLC annually tolerate some kind of adjustments.  Here are a few items that were changed in 2014: </p><ul><li>  For companies that have re-registered, the deadline for filing an application is extended to thirty days from the moment when all information was included in the state register. </li><li>  The taxes of the simplified tax system for benefits paid by the company may be reduced.  But they will be able to reduce them only by 50%. </li><li>  All participants in the simplified tax system need to keep records. </li><li>  Possible indexation of annual income.  That is, any entity engaged in entrepreneurial activity will need to take into account the coefficient-deflator.  It is important.  As a result, the amount of income will be increased in proportion to this ratio. </li><li>  Now LLC does not need to consider the exchange rate difference.  Currency transactions will be fixed in rubles at the time of payment. </li><li>  Subjects who are participants in the simplified system had to submit a declaration before March 31.  And those who only go into this system in 2014 will pay the previous tax rates. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what taxation to choose for llc" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13849/395036.jpg?1399927881748" width="480"></div></h2><p>  Thus, from all this it follows that the simplified taxation system for the LLC has not undergone major changes.  The only thing that is considered an innovation is that each of the companies should keep accounting records or simply restore it for lost time. </p><h2>  Bidding </h2><p>  Those entrepreneurs who have chosen the "income - expense" scheme will pay a tax equal to fifteen percent.  And if another version of the system is determined for profit, then in this case there will be a rate equal to six percent. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  To all of the above, we can add the conclusion that a simplified taxation system for limited liability companies is the most profitable and acceptable option.  This is a completely confirmed fact.  Those who do not believe in this can study in detail other taxation systems and draw their own conclusions in favor of what they like. </p>
