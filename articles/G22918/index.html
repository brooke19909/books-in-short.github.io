  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet for overweight women: how to make openwork and jacquard pattern?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many women complain that they are too full.  This thought directly oppresses them!  It seems to them that they are becoming more disgusting with every extra kilogram, and they no longer attract the attention of men who would like to get to know them.  In fact, in fullness, there is no vice at all, and many men like just full women. </p><p>  Another question is that it is quite difficult to buy stylish and fashionable clothes of large size.  Today, beautiful clothes of large sizes, although they are made, are far from being in the quantity that would be enough for all ladies who have elegant forms. </p><p>  However, there are many ways to replenish your wardrobe with stylish, modern and comfortable clothes.  It is only necessary, as they say, to make pens, diligence and skill.  And also, of course, patience! </p><p>  For example, hand knitting for full women will help not only to diversify the style of the lady, but also amazingly emphasize her originality and charm.  In the last century, some fashion legislator suggested that overweight women should wear loose clothing that supposedly hides overweight.  And the tendency has gone - to make bag-like mantle for ‚Äúhiding the fullness"! </p><p>  And as for all voices they knitted for the full!  It was generally set a strict taboo.  Like, a magnificent woman in a knitted product is tasteless and ugly.  Today, most fashion designers are inclined to believe that the softness of knitwear, its light fit, looks extremely charming on any figure.  It is only important to choose the right model and carefully execute it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Particularly delightful is the charming lady with Rubenian shapes in products made by delicate, light lace.  Crocheting for overweight women will help a cute little girl to become the owner of a fashionable openwork cardigan or shawl, a poncho with tassels or the original half-finished model with cuffs.  Performing these robes is easy even for beginners. </p><p>  To perform fishnet gizmos, you first need to pick up a picture.  One of the simplest is triangles.  Knitting for full women with the use of this pattern does not visually increase its size, but rather, as if distracting the eye precisely to examine the pattern. </p><p>  It is carried out extremely simply: three double crochet columns or two double crochet columns are knitted from one column.  Then the next triangle is executed after two columns are untied in the previous row, and three columns are again knitted from the third. </p><p>  For more "advanced" needlewomen models are offered, consisting of their individual parts.  It can be a wide variety of flowers or marine-themed details: fish, <span>shells, starfish</span> or octopuses.  Then they are beautifully distributed on the pattern and crocheted with the help of air chains are combined into a single product. </p><p>  Knitting for obese women offers ladies chic shawls and ponchos made by the same method - assembling ready-made small parts.  Particularly presentable is a product made of large yellow flowers attached with air chains in a checkerboard pattern with black solid squares.  Brushes or small hanging pompons decorate the edge of the product. </p><p>  Cardigans and coats are a separate article.  Knitting for full women in these things involves tight knitting, usually a single crochet.  If there is a desire to decorate a product with a wide stripe with a color ornament, you can easily do it.  Choose the ornament that the future owner of the cardigan likes best. </p><p>  When crocheting a jacquard pattern, you can use as many colors as needed in this pattern.  When the diagram shows that this column needs to be knitted in a different color, another should be tied to the main thread.  Now the main thread is laid along the upper edge of the product, the column is crocheted in a different color, and the main thread, thus, is inside.  It turns out a two-sided ornament, which from the inside looks the same as from the front side. </p><p>  Later, using stripes with a knitted pattern, you can decorate any very simple outfit, making it a real weekend outfit. </p>
