    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Of course, in this four-star hotel, guests have the opportunity to use all kinds of amenities not only in the rooms, but also directly on the premises. </p><p>  The Armas Beach Hotel 4 * (Kemer, Turkey) features: </p><ul><li>  Exchange office. </li><li>  The shops. </li><li>  Fitness Centre. </li><li>  Volleyball Court. </li><li>  Billiard room. </li><li>  Night club. </li><li>  Playground for darts. </li><li>  Laundry. </li><li>  Equipment rental for water sports. </li><li>  Mini water park. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the territory of the Armas Beach Hotel 4 * (Kemer) has its own outdoor pool.  It is not necessary to keep luggage directly in the room at the guests of this hotel.  The hotel has a large luggage room.  Of course, this complex has its own hammam. </p><h2>  Armas Beach Hotel 4 *: infrastructure reviews </h2><p>  On the facilities on site, there are also mostly only positive reviews.  For example, a very good opinion among tourists was formed about the spa of the Armas Beach Hotel 4 *, as well as about its hammam and massage room.  The equipment in these rooms is modern.  The staff of the fitness center is qualified and helpful. </p><p>  The pool at this hotel, judging by the reviews, is clean and relatively comfortable for swimming.  However, employees still add a lot of bleach to it.  A characteristic odor even emanates from the water.  This is due to the fact that various types of infectious diseases are actively spreading in Turkey in hot weather.  According to the Coxsackie virus, for example, at least for 2017, this hotel is considered quite prosperous.  Mass epidemics were not observed here.  However, in 2017, judging by the information available on the Web, some children in this hotel were still infected during a period of a strong outbreak of the disease in Turkey.  Therefore, tourists living here should still be careful. </p><h2>  Vacationers Opinion About Hotel Beach </h2><p>  Good reviews are also available about the sea near this hotel.  The water here is clean, warm and clear.  The hotel beach itself is also not dirty.  There are no too large boulders here, and the entrance to the sea is quite convenient.  If desired, you can walk along the beach in ordinary slates or, if the sand is not too hot, even barefoot.  The same goes for entering the sea. </p><p>  There are a lot of sun beds on the beach.  Some tourists even note the fact that it is difficult to walk between them.  But in any case, all guests occupy the sun loungers since the evening.  Sometimes, however, a beach worker simply throws stones that are pressed "marking the place" towels.  And then the last blows away.  But this does not happen too often. </p>

    <p>  A feature of the Armas Beach Hotel 4 * (Kemer, Turkey) is that it is allowed on the beach here even at night.  In many other Kemer hotels, sea visits are only possible during the day.  Many tourists, of course, attribute this feature to the unconditional advantages of the hotel. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel: reviews </h2><p>  The dining room of the hotel Armas Beach Hotel 4 * most tourists are also very praised.  The food here is delicious, and the staff are attentive to the guests.  There is usually not too much meat food from beef or pork in the menu of the dining room of this hotel.  But at the same time, tourists every day have the opportunity to take dishes from chicken or turkey.  Also in the dining room are served all kinds of fresh and quite tasty salads, fruits, vegetables and, of course, all kinds of drinks. </p><p>  Actually, the restaurant itself, operating on the territory of the hotel, is not too large.  And in order to take places in a room equipped with air conditioning, tourists should come for breakfast or lunch early.  The only drawback of the hotel dining room is that it serves very few dishes suitable for feeding a child.  All the food in the restaurant of the complex is rather fatty and spicy. </p><p>  In addition to the dining room, this hotel, of course, has a small bar.  It is located in the courtyard next to the pool.  Here guests can order all kinds of drinks.  Also on the territory of the hotel often fry cakes and make ice cream. </p>
