    <h2>  Hotel owned beach </h2><p>  Royal Asarlik Beach Hotel 5 * has a lot of features, however, they are all characteristic of Bodrum.  The fact is that the entire coast is indented with small bays and bays.  Because of them, the view of the coast is lost, but it is this fact that contributes to the fact that the sea almost never storms and you can swim here even when the weather scares the winds. </p><p>  The hotel's beach is divided into two parts.  They are located at some distance from each other and differ in depth near the coast.  On one beach it is very convenient to relax with children, because the depth here is just above the knee.  But the second zone is chosen by those who are ready to make long swims along the mirror surface of the Aegean Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach consists of sand and small pebbles, and its length varies within one hundred and fifty meters.  Despite the fact that many reviews of Royal Asarlik Beach Hotel 5 * mention mud on the beach, it is considered one of the best in the vicinity.  The fact is that the guests themselves actively litter during the day, throwing candy wrappers and cigarette butts on the sand.  But from the very early morning, the hardworking hotel staff completely clean it. </p><p>  Sunbeds and umbrellas are installed throughout the beach, but they are very close to each other, which creates some inconvenience to vacationers.  It should be noted that almost all coastal areas of Bodrum are very narrow.  Therefore, sun loungers create some crowding.  However, hotel guests have the opportunity to relax in the recreation area, equipped on a special floor by the sea.  It is spacious enough and there are always enough free sunbeds.  All guests receive free beach towels with cards at the spa. </p><p>  If you are going on vacation in the fall, do not worry, the weather in Bodrum in September and October allows you to swim in the sea for days on end.  The water warms up to a comfortable twenty-five degrees, and the gentle sun will delight you with an even chocolate tan. </p><h2>  Pool Description </h2><p>  The hotel complex has three swimming pools.  One of them is indoor and begins to work in the offseason.  The rest are open to guests at any time of the day. </p><p>  The main pool is located opposite the main residential building.  It is always noisy and fun here, as from the very early morning the animators carry out exercises, aerobics and other recreational activities.  The second pool is located a little inland and is divided into two parts by a compartment with a jacuzzi.  Nearby is a water bowl for babies, where they can frolic under the supervision of parents. </p><p>  Keep in mind that there are no slides in the pools.  Therefore, this type of entertainment on vacation you will not find.  For some tourists this fact is a plus, but others will never choose a hotel that does not have slides. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about infrastructure </h2><p>  Each traveler rightly assumes that the five-star hotel has a lot of infrastructure facilities, so the rest will be varied, comfortable and interesting. </p><p>  The hotel complex has four restaurants and seven bars.  At almost any time of the day, guests can have a bite to eat and refresh themselves with a delicious drink. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel has three conference rooms.  They differ in capacity and equipment.  Each can hold business meetings, corporate events and family events.  If necessary, their preparation will be fully taken over by the hotel staff. </p><p>  The reception is open around the clock, but its employees are not familiar with the basics of the Russian language.  If you do not speak English too well, then when you check in, they will call for you a girl from Russia working in a tour desk.  She will give you a free familiarization tour of the hotel absolutely free of charge, tell you about all the rules of accommodation and in the future it will be through her that you will be able to solve all arising issues.  Often, our compatriots note in reviews that they do not like the room you change for free and without much persuasion, which can be considered a rarity for Turkish hotels. </p><p>  If desired, guests can rent a car for the entire duration of the vacation and leave it in a free parking lot near the hotel complex. </p><p>  In addition, the property has its own hairdresser, beauty salon and internet cafe.  There are always going to a lot of vacationers, however, as in any other place in the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Service Level Reviews </h2><p>  Service at Royal Asarlik Beach Hotel 5 * is often described in the comments left by Russian tourists.  In general, most of our compatriots consider it to correspond to the level of five stars.  Quick check in, lightning fast solution to any problems and service in the restaurant are highly appreciated. </p><p>  However, some guests believe that the lack of Russian-speaking staff does not allow the hotel to be called a five-star.  Therefore, they write that tourists can count on the service of a hotel complex, which has four stars. </p>
