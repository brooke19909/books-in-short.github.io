  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geneva hotels - for work and leisure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All over the world, this city is known as the most important diplomatic center, it hosts conferences and seminars at various levels, concludes contracts and makes business deals.  Geneva hotels are suitable for a wide variety of events, which are attended by representatives of all countries of the world, therefore it is not at all surprising that the entire tourist and hotel infrastructure is aimed specifically at such a level of customers. </p><p>  For those who decided not to save on quality holidays, five-star hotels in Geneva, such as the "Raffles Le Montreux Palace 5 *", are intended.  This complex was erected in 1906, and even now experts in architecture and the most ordinary tourists, who appreciate an attractive appearance and originality, call it a real gem, combining equally modern elegance and classic traditions, conveying to its guests an amazing atmosphere of beauty and appeasement. </p><p>  This hotel is located in one of the most picturesque places on the shores <span>of Lake Geneva,</span> which can be reached by train from Geneva International Airport in an hour or two minutes on foot if you depart from Montreux Train Station.  The Raffles Le Montreux Palace 5 * hotel offers guests to stay in one of 235 rooms, some of which are specially equipped for tourists with disabilities, and some are located on two non-smoking floors for the convenience of families with children.  All apartments are beautifully restored and stylishly decorated, equipped with all necessary amenities and appliances, including air conditioning, individual <span>satellite dishes,</span> television, telephone lines and modem sockets.  It is important to note that from the windows of all rooms there is a magnificent view of the surrounding landscapes - mountains and the lake.  All guests have the opportunity to spend time in the restaurants located on the hotel territory, in jazz clubs or a bar with live piano music, as well as actively relax in the local CopyCat night club. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Five-star hotels in Geneva open their doors to the wealthiest guests who value safety, tranquility, comfort of living and the ability to access all sorts of civilization achievements and amenities offered by the modern world.  Of course, the cost of living in such hotels is much higher than in complexes of a lower class, but sometimes the price determines the quality - lovers of luxury class are ready to pay any funds for it.  Reviews of Geneva hotels are diverse, and the difference of opinion is guaranteed just by the difference in prices for accommodation in a particular place.  If your budget does not allow you to count on the chic rooms of the elite 5-star hotel, you can go to inexpensive hotels, usually located far from the city center.  Their only advantage, in addition to the low price, is the proximity to <span>public transport,</span> and the disadvantage is the limited range of services. </p><p>  If upscale Geneva hotels seem too expensive for you (many tourists experience such feelings), then you can find a compromise - the four-star Tiffany Boutique Hotel, located in the city center, is equally close to the beautiful shores of the lake and the financial district.  Guests can choose one of 46 homely rooms with all amenities for their stay, visit shopping centers located near the complex and Rue du Rhone, the famous street with the maximum number of the most expensive and famous boutiques, numerous designer shops, ‚ÄúGrand Theater "and the concert hall" Victoria Hall ". </p><p>  Naturally, both work and leisure in Geneva should be provided with a high-quality level of service, for which tourists are accommodated in an atmosphere of tranquility and comfort in the best rooms.  In Geneva, everyone literally fights for each client, allowing him to feel the care of the staff, the desire of the hotel staff to provide affordable assistance in a variety of situations, as well as to ensure that the holidays are spent in the most stylish and comfortable rooms and apartments. </p>
