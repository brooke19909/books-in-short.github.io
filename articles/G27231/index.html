Designing and creating enclosures requires specific knowledge of the geometry of sound.  To help designers, they created special programs to calculate the optimal geometry and amount of sound-absorbing material. </p><h2>  Programs for calculating the geometry of sound </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bcae1.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online program" class="if uuid-2406263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406263.jpg"></div><p>  To create a great sound system, all factors must be considered.  This is due to the fact that designing a box for a subwoofer is both a science and an art.  To create the most effective speakers, there are several best programs that can guarantee maximum performance and unique design: </p><ol><li>  Woofer Box and Circuit Designer. </li><li>  Subwoofer Design Toolbox. </li><li>  AJHorn 6. </li><li>  Boxnotes. </li><li>  WinISD. </li></ol><h2>  Calculation parameters and units </h2><p>  Before calculating the box for the subwoofer, the user selects a program and system of units.  All programs released after 2017 support metric units.  They easily compare the parameters of various block designs visually on a single graph.  Frequency response printouts can be in color or with characters that improve readability with black and white printers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The tool for designing enclosures helps create rectangular and wedge-shaped boxes, calculate the volume of prefabricated boxes.  You can calculate the drawer volume from the size of the mounting windows, or any shape by entering the required enclosure volume. </p><h2>  Box making tool </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiofabrication.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subwoofer Box Dimensions" class="if uuid-2406257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406257.jpg"></div><p>  Woofer Box and Circuit Designer is an advanced tool for creating subwoofer enclosures using MS Excel.  The program has a complex mathematical model that can simulate the results of sealing, ventilation or passivity of the radiator.  It also has special filters that allow you to simulate a very wide range of shapes. </p><p>  The goal of this program is to provide the tools necessary for developing a subwoofer using a wide range of available plate amplifiers, crossovers, digital processors and equalizers.  Before calculating the box for the subwoofer, the sound response curve of the room is imported into the program, which is saved as a file from any other software and will take into account the imported data in the output results. </p><p>  Graphs are displayed showing the frequency response, phase, impedance, maximum output, sensitivity 2.83 V, filter transfer function, ventilation rate, group delay (filter, driver and system) and pulse response.  All calculations and graphs include effects from the selected filters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  AJHorn 6 Case Modeling </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Case design" class="if uuid-2406264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406264.jpg"></div><p>  Due to its modular design, AJHorn offers modeling of various types of subwoofer boxes with the same calculation algorithm.  This is interesting because the theory of speaker design is not limited to one type of enclosure.  An ideal solution to acoustic conditions where boundary cases are included - transmission line, bass reflex, bandwidth and enclosed enclosure types. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svntnine.appspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Subwoofer Box Drawing" class="if uuid-2409093" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2409093.jpg"></div><p>  Relevant AJHorn projects (hrn files) can be found in the AJHorn installation directory, they provide for the construction: </p><ol><li>  Frontal shout.  Frontloaded Horn is a situation in which the front of the driver creates acoustic power along with a speaker.  The back of the driver emits sound in an enclosed or ventilated chamber (RC) with a VRC volume.  The length of the closed rear camera with sufficient damping does not affect the simulation result. </li><li>  Rear speaker.  The difference between loading and the front speaker is the discarded rear camera.  The driver emits sound right above the cone.  Thanks to this modeling ability, old structures (classic rear horns) can be improved if there is still an unused area.  This feature allows you to simulate and optimize your device with AJHorn. </li></ol><h2>  Portnotes for port selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="techtalk.parts-express.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Horn amplifier" class="if uuid-2406268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406268.jpg"></div><p>  This free software helps you determine the actual size of the case.  Features of the current version V3.1: </p><ol><li>  It takes into account the additional volume consumed by ports, mounts and drivers. </li><li>  Checks the minimum dimensions required to accommodate the driver. </li><li>  The presence of the visual effect of changing port parameters. </li><li>  Stop resonance, size adjustment to minimize its effect. </li><li>  Additional permission to trim using a router. </li><li>  Saving work of project files in notebooks, including comments. </li><li>  Drawings of boxes for the subwoofer are made in an accessible dimension. </li><li>  Supports both inch and metric measurements. </li><li>  Creates a text report containing a selection of user information. </li></ol><h2>  BassBox Pro for speaker design </h2><div class="photo" data-original="techtalk.parts-express.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calculation Program" class="if uuid-2406273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406273.jpg"></div><p>  This is a modern utility for designing a subwoofer box, the best amplifier enclosure program.  It is used worldwide by professionals, amateurs, and speaker designers to create world-class enclosures.  The program is universal and is used to create speakers for a variety of purposes, including a home Hi-Fi cinema, a personal car or a van, professional sound amplification, recording studio equipment, stage monitors, etc. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ol><li>  Easy to learn and use. </li><li>  Many features that make it easy to learn and use. </li><li>  A step-by-step and beautiful 364-page print guide. </li><li>  Design Wizard to help new users quickly create a speaker. </li><li>  The creation process can begin either with the driver or with the box, and then it will go through BassBox Pro, as it requests information in an orderly progression. </li><li>  The main window, resizable, includes a summary of all open structures. </li><li>  You can open up to ten projects at a time. </li><li>  BassBox Pro has the world's largest driver database!  Users can add, edit, or remove drivers, and database searches can be unlimited. </li><li>  Two different box shapes are available. </li><li>  Acoustic properties take two different types of data.  They can be entered manually or imported from several popular measuring systems (B &amp; K, CLIO, IMP, LMS, JBL / SIA Smaart, MLSSA, Sample Champion and TEF-20). </li><li>  Acoustic data is added to the corresponding graphs to increase their accuracy in the manufacture of subwoofer boxes. </li><li>  Performance provides nine graphs to evaluate speaker design performance. </li></ol><h2>  Winisd sound design online </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forum.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular amplifier" class="if uuid-2409118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2409118.jpg"></div><p>  Great free speaker design software for the Windows platform.  It offers a wide range of functions, thanks to which it is easy and simple for users to create ventilated, strip, and closed enclosures that will produce high-quality sounds.  Drivers have different specifications that require changes in the design of the box or port. </p><p>  Using WinISD Pro is a relatively simple way to ensure optimal cabinet placement for the specific subwoofer you are using.  This program for calculating the subwoofer box will require a computer that can run WinISD.  It has a database of home theater systems according to TS specifications.  The simulated driver acts linearly with moderate to high SPL. </p><p>  An example of a drawing of a simple design amplifier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound amplifier drawing" class="if uuid-2409125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2409125.jpg"></div><h2>  Design Tool MFR Engineering </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mfr-eng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Utility for calculating the case" class="if uuid-2406300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406300.jpg"></div><p>  Subwoofer Design Toolbox is an easy-to-use yet powerful subwoofer design tool.  The user-friendly tab interface allows you to choose the design of the box, port, enclosure and subwoofer selection tools.  It works in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. The design tool allows you to create tight, ported and strip boxes.  It also includes ‚Äúfree on-air‚Äù modeling for car audio applications. </p><p>  It will be easy for the user to determine which box for the subwoofer is needed, you just need to enter the driver parameters, the type of enclosure and the volume of the unit.  For ported designs, the program will recommend a port frequency, or you can select your own port.  Bandwidth skipping is easier than ever before.  After selecting the volume - the port frequency is automatically optimized.  Design Toolbox subwoofer fully supports metric measurements. </p><p>  The answering machine function allows you to see the effect of the submaster in a wide range of sizes.  For home subwoofers or convertibles, you can select the 2D setting.  Otherwise, you can choose the setting that most accurately describes the car.  Using the Subwoofer Design Toolbox, it is easy to compare the frequency responses of various block designs on a single graph.  Using the cursor, you can precisely determine the frequency points and their sizes. </p><h2>  Subwoofer Installation Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudiofabrication.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box installation" class="if uuid-2406259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2406259.jpg"></div><p>  Before installing the speaker in the subwoofer box, it is important to know the impedance so that the speaker can connect to the amplifier correctly.  Most amplifiers have separate positive connections for each of the resistances, while a negative connection is common. </p><p>  Incorrect connection of the speaker to the amplifier, on the contrary, will reduce the volume of sound. </p><p>  With enclosed speakers, usually the dimensions of the subwoofer box allow insulation inside to absorb sound from the back of the speaker.  If the enclosure is not equipped with insulation, fiberglass insulation may be used. </p><p>  The speakers that are used with sealed enclosures must be sealed in the enclosure.  In no case should this be done with silicone or any other liquid, gel or glue.  A simple but very effective gasket can be made using foam material, for example, for doors and windows. </p><p>  Before making a box for the subwoofer, you need to strengthen the mount to the body and it is better to install T-shaped stands.  The subwoofer housing must be very securely attached to the car.  The subwoofer and chassis can weigh 20 kg or more.  In a collision at 60 km / h or during rapid braking at this speed, such a device can exert up to 500 kg of pressure.  This is enough to cause serious injuries to passengers. </p><p>  A good electrical connection is essential to maintaining a healthy system.  The best and most reliable way to connect wires is soldering. </p>
