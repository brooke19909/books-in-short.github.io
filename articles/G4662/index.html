Already in those days on the territory of the Crimean city settled Taurus settlements.  Then these places were taken by the Greeks, and after them the Genoese, Byzantines.  Later Turks.  In 1838, already being part of Russia, the settlement received the status of a city.  The history of Yalta as one of the best resorts begins in the second half of the 19th century, after the end of the Crimean War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crimeaguide.com" data-author=": "><img alt="south coast of crimea" class="if uuid-2452889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452889.jpg?1541771820"></div><h2>  Ancient times </h2><p>  According to ancient legend, the history of the creation of Yalta is associated with Greek sailors.  Travelers plowed the sea for a long time, and finally saw the land.  They went ashore and founded a settlement, which they called "Yialos".  Translated into Russian means "coast". </p><p>  The results of archaeological research indicate that the first inhabitants of this part of the Crimean peninsula were Taurus.  Funeral structures dating back to the 4th-5th centuries BC were discovered here.  Tavrov mentions Herodotus in his historical work, but speaks of them unflatteringly, calling them "cruel pirates."  Why they left these fertile lands is unknown.  Probably, they preferred wanderings, full of adventure, to boring agriculture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the VII century, Venetian merchants did not live here for long, and after them the Genoese, who founded trading ports and fortresses.  The ruins of one of the strongholds can be seen at the Wuchang-Su waterfall.  The remaining fortresses built by the Genoese did not survive. </p><p>  The history of Yalta includes the Byzantine period.  For some time, these lands belonged to the Eastern Roman Empire, which fell at the beginning of the 15th century.  Two decades later, Turks settled in the territory of modern Yalta.  Having burst into the city, they killed almost all the inhabitants and, according to medieval tradition, set off a grand fire.  And what remained after the Turkish robberies destroyed the earthquake that occurred in the second half of the 15th century.  Therefore, there are no ancient architectural monuments that can be visited in order to learn more about the ancient period in the history of Yalta, except for the ruins of the fortress. </p><p>  Since the Turks appeared on the territory of the modern Crimean city, Mohammedanism and the Tatar language began to spread.  But Christian traditions did not disappear without a trace.  A certain part of the population was made up of Greeks who lived in peace and harmony with the Tatars.  Nevertheless, in the second half of the 18th century, Christians were evicted to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  And a bit later, the mass immigration of the Crimean Tatars began. </p><p>  Today it is difficult to believe that in the history of Yalta - a city that is associated with entertainment and not cheap vacations - there was a period when this settlement was a poorly populated fishing village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krymtrek.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Crimea swallow's nest" class="if uuid-2452891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452891.jpg?1541771820"></div><h2>  First mansions, parks and vineyards </h2><p>  Everyone who has visited the legendary city of Crimea knows: Mikhail Vorontsov played a role in the history of Yalta.  Earl served as Governor-General of the Novorossiysk Territory.  He concluded a mutually beneficial agreement with the new inhabitants of Yalta: he gives them land for use, and they, in turn, plant vineyards on this land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the southern coast of Crimea appeared <span>palaces, mansions,</span> villas.  They built their serfs new owners of land.  Thus began the history of the buildings of Yalta - Crimean attractions, which are so indifferent to tourists.  In the XIX century, gardens, vineyards, and parks appeared here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deadokey.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Massandra Palace" class="if uuid-2452898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452898.jpg?1541771820"></div><p>  Yalta became the center of the district at the time when it was a tiny village.  The choice was not accidental.  There is a convenient bay and plenty of fresh water.  In 1838, the South Coast was separated into a separate county.  The center became, of course, Yalta.  The history of the resort begins later.  In the 30s of the XIX century, the city consisted of only one street, on which there were thirty courtyards.  A little over a hundred people lived here.  Artisans and craftsmen settled on the slopes of Polikurovsky hill. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  In 1837, Vorontsov ordered the construction of a road between Alushta and Simferopol.  There was no port here yet, and the pier built in the thirties destroyed the storm.  Already in the middle of the 19th century, maritime traffic was established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="old-photo.gallery" data-author=": "><img alt="road from Yalta to Alushta 19th century" class="if uuid-2452903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452903.jpg?1541771820"></div><h2>  Crimean War </h2><p>  It lasted only three years, but left a mark on the history of Yalta.  Briefly about the events of 1853-1856, we can say this: military operations between the coalition of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire and Russia.  The Yalta nobility raised about a thousand rubles in favor of the wounded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1856 there were only 36 houses suitable for living.  But the restoration of the city was rapid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="suntime.com.ua" data-author=": "><img alt="Livadia Palace" class="if uuid-2452897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452897.jpg?1541771820"></div><h2>  Resort town </h2><p>  After the end of the Crimean War, new houses appeared.  A new period has begun in the history of Yalta.  The city has transformed, transformed from a province into a resort center.  Mark Twain once visited here.  An American writer once devoted several lines to the city, calling it a picturesque place and emphasizing the beauty of the palaces that stand out against the background of dense greenery "like bright flowers." </p><p>  Not only sights, but also health resorts, Yalta is famous.  The history of the creation of hospitals dates back to the end of the XIX century, but the fact that this part of the peninsula has unique natural conditions, scientists said back in the XVIII century.  Botkin wrote in more detail about the healing properties of the Yalta climate.  Alexander III heeded the recommendations of doctors and ordered the construction of palaces.  First Massandra, then Livadia.  He was ill a lot and spent the last years in Crimea. </p><p>  The construction boom in Yalta began after the advent of the railway.  And when Livadia became the residence of the king, the resort city gained particular popularity among landowners and officials.  It was then, at the end of the 19th century, that the appearance of the Crimean city took shape, which lasted several decades. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, a huge number of dachas belonging to the Russian nobility appeared in Yalta.  In 1913, 30 thousand people lived here.  Crimea was loved not only by idle nobles, but also by people of a new format, namely merchants and manufacturers - sons and grandsons of former serfs.  These enterprising people started their activity here - in 1904 there were already four factories, in which about six hundred people worked in total. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img alt="Yalta 19th century" class="if uuid-2452902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452902.jpg?1541771820"></div><h2>  The Red Terror </h2><p>  The twenties of the last century - this is perhaps the darkest period in the history of Yalta.  In 1918, a new government was established in Crimea, after which life on the peninsula fell into decay.  In February, the Red Guards received the right to be shot without trial.  The victims were people accused of counter-revolutionary agitation and espionage. </p><p>  Yalta became the last Crimean city captured by the Red Army.  But the atrocities committed by the Red Guards, convinced that it was here that the main exploiters settled down, took on terrifying proportions.  In 1920, a new wave of terror began. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Until mid-1942, Yalta remained, in fact, the frontline zone.  The fighting took place in Sevastopol.  In Yalta, the Germans organized a Jewish ghetto, in which more than four thousand people were placed.  All of them were shot.  During the years of occupation, several <span>residents of Yalta</span> were killed <span>.</span>  The death of the ship "Armenia" has become one of the largest marine disasters in history.  Yalta was liberated on April 16, 1944. </p><h2>  After the collapse of the USSR </h2><p>  In Soviet times, like today, Yalta was a developed resort.  On the territory there are health resorts, sanatoriums.  She became one of the few cities of the former USSR that got out of ruin in the early 90s.  In 1992, the Massandra Palace was restored, then other attractions. </p><p>  Until March 18, 2014, Yalta was part of Ukraine.  After it was annexed to Russia.  It is worth talking about one of the most famous sights of Crimea - the noble estate, which housed the residence of Stalin during the Yalta Conference. </p><h2>  Yusupov Palace </h2><p>  Construction at the end of the 19th century was unfolding privately.  The palace of Prince Yusupov, one of the richest aristocrats in Russia, was erected in Korisey, designed by Nikolai Krasnov, the famous Yalta architect.  Previously, the site of the construction was the cottage of Anna Golitsyna.  Then the lands were owned by Morozov, the owner of a local winery.  In 1880, the estate was acquired by <span>Felix Yusupov,</span> who at that time held the position of Governor-General of Moscow.  According to the designs of Nikolai Krasnov, the Livadia Palace and the Dulber Palace were also built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img alt="Vorontsov Palace" class="if uuid-2452901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452901.jpg?1541771820"></div><p>  In 1920, the Yusupov estate, like other Yalta sights, was nationalized.  The palace was used as a holiday home for employees of the Cheka.  There was, of course, the namesake of the previous owner - the revolutionary Dzerzhinsky. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the Yusupov Palace was badly damaged.  But by 1945, the historic building was put in order. </p>
