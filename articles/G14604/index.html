Any master of a service center, if you ask him a question, how many such complaints comes to them, will be lost on the fifth dozen and wave his hand.

    <p>  Having survived the first shock, the owner immediately calls the master, trying to immediately find out why the refrigerator does not freeze and eliminate this disgrace.  He is in a hurry and - right, he makes people laugh!  If you are lucky, only the master has fun, inserting the plug that fell out of the socket into place, and the owner, burning with shame, pays his carelessness in the form of an emergency call for home repairs. <br><br>  As an option of the previous embarrassment, but more serious: the malfunction lies either in the plug or in the outlet itself.  If the owner knows how to handle these items, the problem will be fixed by him personally and pretty soon.  If not, it‚Äôs better not to risk it, and then the call of the master will be justified. <br><br>  Another ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù of carelessness is the loose-fitting refrigerator door.  Either the owner himself, without looking, pushed her, but did not check whether she had taken her place.  Or in the refrigerator compartment there is dishes that do not fit into its internal dimensions.  How such a ‚Äúmalfunction‚Äù is eliminated - this is for chickens to laugh! <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Why does not the refrigerator freeze?" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/197164.jpg" width="320"></div>  Another thing is if the refrigerator does not freeze due to the fact that the door does not fit snugly against the case, <span>rubber seals are</span> worn out <span>.</span>  Of course, they can be replaced on their own.  But if the kitchen has a new model of the refrigerator, the seals in it are molded in the grooves of the door and can only be replaced with it.  There is no way out but to call the master. <br><br>  Moreover, you should contact the appropriate service if the refrigerator does not freeze for reasons that cannot be eliminated at home.  These are most often the broken regulation of the temperature regulator or a junk compressor.  However, if there is a serviceable thermostat available, you can put it on, and give the unbalanced device for adjustment. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The top chamber of the refrigerator does not freeze" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/197163.jpg" width="225"></div>  One of the most unpleasant moments when the top chamber of the refrigerator and the rest of the household does not freeze is a refrigerant leak.  The system is depressurized if the condenser remains cold when the unit is running (otherwise it decently heats up).  Consider yourself lucky if the damage is localized in one place - it is relatively easy to repair and refill the refrigerator with freon.  If there is a series of microcracks - you have to change the whole system. <br><br>  There is such a curiosity when the fact that the refrigerator does not freeze properly is to blame ... the camera illumination lamp, which should turn off when the door is closed.  If, bending the seal at this moment, you will see the light inside, the contact breaker for the bulb power is worn out.  You can try to deal with this trouble yourself by gluing a leather square to the contact area. <br><br>  But if the home "Santa Claus" does not want to preserve food and drinks, and upon examination there was no reason that could be easily eliminated on their own, the best solution would still be to call the master.
