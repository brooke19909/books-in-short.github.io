After all, it‚Äôs quite difficult for many people to navigate in the dark, and artificial lighting is not always convenient, as it attracts outside attention, or scares away fish and game.  In the domestic market there are a lot of ready-made solutions both from the domestic manufacturer and under foreign brands, so there will not be a problem with choosing a worthy product. </p>

    <p>  The focus of this article is the PNV-57E device, which is presented on the market by the Russian military-industrial complex.  Description, specifications, owner reviews and expert recommendations will not leave a single reader indifferent to this wonderful device. </p><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  Naturally, users are interested in the principle of operation of this device.  After all, the device is made in the form of a helmet, which must be worn on the head.  It is immediately worth noting that the night vision device does not emit any radiation - everything is based on the physical laws of optics.  In fact, the device enhances the infrared and ultraviolet rays that are invisible to the human eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Electron-optical converters pick up weak light reflected from objects and transmit its photocathode, which has a light-sensitive matrix (as in SLR cameras).  The photocathode, in turn, transfers the image to a luminescent screen, which is able to increase the brightness of the image due to the constant movement of electrons from the cathode. </p><h2>  The convenience of this technology </h2><p>  The reader managed to notice that the market is dominated by solutions from foreign manufacturers, which are made in the form of a monocular.  They are more reminiscent of an <span>optical sight</span> and are designed for mounting on a rifle or are used as a <span>spyglass.</span>  And the PNV-57E device, whose price is an order of magnitude lower (10,000 rubles), is binocular, that is, it allows the user to see in the dark with two eyes in real time. </p><p>  As users note in their reviews, this solution is not only convenient, but also allows the owner, through some manipulations with the optical device, to change the tactical and technical characteristics of the device.  After all, this is military equipment that has been created for centuries.  No expansion cards and tricky devices - a common designer for a Russian person: metal structures, <span>optical instruments</span> and several wires. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Disadvantages of the PNV-57E device </h2><p>  Naturally, any product of the military industrial complex has a number of disadvantages, which many users pay attention to.  First of all, the disadvantage is the weight of the device.  Nevertheless, the metal construction of the PNV-57E device makes itself felt.  The reviews of the owners assure that to work with the device at night, you need to have not only steel nerves, but also muscles in the cervical spine. </p>

    <p>  Low resolution of the image, which affects the detail of the image at large distances (over 20 meters).  Among the negatives, many attributed the effect of a <span>fish eye,</span> which slightly deforms the visible image.  There are also problems with image sharpness when viewing objects at close range (up to 5 meters). </p><h2>  The performance characteristics </h2><p>  The PNV-57E device provides a field of view of at least 35 degrees - this is a serious advantage if compared with monocular systems.  The optics of the device has a slight increase, which does not go beyond 1-1.2 times.  Eyepieces have diopter settings that allow the user to adjust the sharpness of the picture in case of poor vision.  <span>The focal length of the</span> lenses is 37 mm, and they consist of nine lenses.  The optical axes of the PNV-57E device are equipped with a floating connection, as is realized with ordinary binoculars, so this device can be used by anyone, regardless of age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  As for the power supply system of solar cells and a luminescent screen, it is carried out at a voltage of 12-15 V or 24-30 V. Switching between power supplies is carried out automatically.  The power consumption of the device at maximum load does not exceed 6 watts. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Users who had to deal with military products of domestic production, it is known for certain that all devices are delivered to the market in protective metal boxes.  Apparently, this is a proprietary packaging from Russian industrialists.  Yes, and there will never be problems with transportation - the device is securely fixed inside the case, so that no bumps and drops from a height are dangerous for him. </p>

    <p>  The box contains: PNV-57E, safety and operating instructions, a summer helmet for a tankman, a set of glasses for blackout headlights, an adapter for connecting the device to the power supply of vehicles.  By the way, there are glasses for blackout, both for ordinary headlights and for halogen ones.  The future owner will also be pleased with the spare set of glasses that he will find in one of the offices of a capacious metal box. </p><h2>  Encyclopedia for the beginner </h2><p>  A very interesting and informative instruction for the PNV-57E device: the power of internal elements, the arrangement of optical devices and the principle of operation are described in the manual at the school level, that is, in an accessible language.  Better to start with maintenance - any owner can easily disassemble the device, clean its elements from dust, lubricate and put it together.  Perhaps this is due to the presence of a complete device diagram in the instructions and the presence of an assembly-disassembly algorithm. </p><p>  The manufacturer also suggested that not all PNV-57E users may like a tanker's helmet, so the night device is provided with a universal mount that can be adapted to a helmet or other helmet.  Naturally, the possibility of tilting up the optics is provided in all cases. </p><h2>  Power System Features </h2><p>  Caring primarily for the reliability of the mounts in the night vision device, the manufacturer forgot about the ease of use.  We are talking about high-voltage hard wires that connect the power supply and converters.  But the battery in stand-alone mode at the PNV-57E device is a ‚Äúcrown‚Äù.  A regular 12-volt DC battery.  Here, the owners will be helped by a description of the change in the food system, which is being promoted by enthusiasts in the media. </p>

    <p>  Rigid and heavy wiring simply changes to ordinary soft-braided copper wires.  The only recommendation that all owners of the device should listen to is to discard all attempts to manually interfere with the operation of the converter installed on the back of the device.  It emits a high-frequency sound (like a faulty capacitor) - this is normal, you just need to get used to it. </p><h2>  Oh, these Russians! </h2><p>  Probably only abroad it is customary to shout about dustproof devices operating in a humid environment and capable of experiencing shock loads.  All users are familiar with the IP87 markings and their analogues.  The PNV-57E device has several orders of magnitude higher performance. </p><ol><li>  <em>Dust protection.</em>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, who used the device for more than 100 hours within one year, when servicing the device, no dirt and dust were found in the optical elements and on the power boards.  Only in the lubrication areas of moving parts is dirt accumulated. </li><li>  <em>Moisture protection.</em>  Fog, rain, accidental fall in the snow?  No, this device does not pass water into the optical elements and does not cause a short circuit even when it is in salted water for 10 minutes. </li><li>  <em>Shock protection.</em>  It is clear that it is easy to move the device in a tank, but a fall from a nine-story building onto a damp surface of the earth did not cause any disturbances in the device (it is worth noting that during testing the eyepieces were closed with rubber caps). </li></ol><h2>  Recommendations for hunters </h2><p>  Like any optical binoculars, the device has problems with detailing objects at close range.  In fact, within 1-4 meters, image sharpness is low.  Some enthusiasts suggest reducing focus by moving the lenses on the eyepiece.  But then another problem will arise - the lack of detail over a long distance.  This is unacceptable, especially if the device PNV-57E is used for hunting.  There is a solution, it is interesting and was appreciated by many owners, judging by their reviews, positive. </p><p>  You can move the lenses on one eyepiece, adjusting the focus so that the sharpness is 2-4 meters.  And leave the second eyepiece unchanged.  Yes, you need to get used to these settings, but it's worth it.  With fast movement through the forest in pursuit of game, this solution allows you to better navigate the terrain and significantly saves the hunter‚Äôs time. </p><h2>  Collaboration with sights </h2><p>  A domestic-made night-vision device is clearly not intended for hunting with optics in the dark.  It is not that the user will be able to see the object at a great distance, but to look into the eyepiece.  Therefore, this venture is better to leave immediately.  But the owners of the collimator a bunch of two devices obviously will like.  If the optical device has autonomous power and backlight, then the user does not need to center the PNV-57E eyepiece with a collimator.  It is enough to be able to look into the device at a large angle and see <span>the aiming point.</span> </p>

    <p>  Laser Guidance is even easier.  Red target pointers are visible in the night vision device, like the Jedi swords.  Naturally, the guidance point is easily located on the object, and any hunter will be pleased to lead the target with it.  But the combined use of a laser and a collimator is better to immediately eliminate.  The fact is that through the optical device, the red dot of the target pointer acquires a huge halo, which interferes with aiming. </p><h2>  Nearest competitors </h2><p>  For buyers who have looked for a PNV-57E device for outdoor activities, the price (10 thousand rubles) played a major role in choosing a night vision device on the market.  Therefore, it is better to start the comparison with inexpensive devices (within 30,000 rubles).  The spyglass ZENIT NP-105, issued by the Krasnogorsk Instrument-Making Plant, immediately fell into focus.  In addition to night vision, she still knows how to bring objects closer (2.4x), and also has a small weight (1 kg versus 3.5 kg for the PNV-57E).  But with the convenience of the pipe, the problem is to run through the woods for game, holding a rifle in one hand, and it is problematic in the other. </p><p>  Belarusians presented an interesting Pulsar Edge GS 2.7 √ó 50 binoculars on the market.  It allows you to see perfectly in the dark and has a slight increase.  But then again, it is intended only for observation.  Ukrainian baby "Promin PN-3" has long been discontinued, but is popular among hunters and fishermen due to its price (only 2000 rubles).  It looks more like a portable movie camera, but looks, as always, are deceiving.  In terms of functionality, it is not inferior to the PNV-57E device. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As practice shows, to purchase a night vision device for personal use is not a problem for many users.  Even the representative of the military departments - the PNV-57E binocular device - is available in retail and does not require permits.  Yes, there are minor flaws, and the device itself is inconvenient in operation, but it was not intended at all to chase game with a rifle at night - it was primarily designed for tank drivers, armored personnel carriers and hovercraft.  And if the buyer believes that this night vision device is not suitable for him in quality and convenience, a solution to the problems can be found in the price category from 100 000 rubles and above. </p>
