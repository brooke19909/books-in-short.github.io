  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Croatia Travel Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The state of Croatia is located on the Balkan Peninsula and nearby islands, of which there are more than a thousand.  Thus, the state is divided into two parts: island and continental.  The coast of Croatia is washed by the Adriatic Sea, which attracts many tourists from all over the world to this amazing country.  It is on the coast that the country's most popular resorts are located. </p><p>  Today, Croatia whose hotels meet all modern requirements, attracts not only wealthy citizens on vacation.  Recently, due to the availability of leisure in the country, the flow of tourists has increased markedly.  In order for all vacationers to have enough space, new modern hotels and hotel complexes are being built on the coast. </p><p>  The unique natural conditions are perfectly combined here with numerous historical monuments, so vacationers can not only swim in the sea and sunbathe on the beach, but also make numerous excursions and walks to unique historical places, as well as visit ancient medieval castles, ancient fortresses, cathedrals and monasteries.  After a day trip, you can visit Venice - the pearl of the Mediterranean Sea.  Agree that not all European countries can boast of such a successful combination. </p><p>  Croatia, whose hotels are served at a very high level, has a well-developed infrastructure.  Although we must not forget that some of the hotels in this country are not modern hotel complexes demonstrating the last word in technology, but outdated guest houses.  Therefore, if you want to have air conditioning in your room, you need to worry in advance, or at least ask when the last reconstruction took place in this hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now many hotels are closing for reconstruction.  For example, the Hotel Aurora Croatia rightfully considers it to be its pride, was successfully reconstructed and modernized in 2002, and now it is one of the best hotels.  In 2003, the Aurora hotel received four-star status and entered the Spanish hotel chain Sol Melia, one of the largest hotel operators, opening its hotels in Croatia with a high level of comfort. </p><p>  Croatia hotels which are better to book in advance is a suitable place for families with children.  However, it should be borne in mind that many hotels in the country work only with organized groups, not accepting individual tourists. </p><p>  Croatia The best <span>hotels for children</span> located on the islands and along the entire coast, is an ideal country where you can go on vacation even with kids.  When Russians travel to this country, tourists do not experience dramatic climate changes, so children quickly adapt to new conditions.  It is best to live close to the sandy beaches, so that kids can enjoy running on the sand and sculpt turrets from it.  But if you buy rubber slippers, you can have a good rest on small pebble beaches, where the water is more transparent.  It is also better to enter the water in slippers so as not to step on the sea urchin.  It should be noted that Croatia is a world leader in the number of beaches with crystal clear water. </p><p>  Holidays in this country, compared to other European countries, are considered more relaxed, therefore it will be good not only for kids, but also for adults who want to take a break from the bustle of the city.  The air here is filled with volcanoes of laurel and pine, so holidays in Croatia will be especially useful for those people who have lung problems. </p><p>  This country is unusually beautiful and has a long tradition of health tourism.  On its territory are located the popular thermal and <span>balneological resorts.</span>  Croatia, whose hotels demonstrate European quality, is the best place for holding various festivals and large-scale parties. </p>
