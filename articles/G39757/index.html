A huge number of architectural monuments have been preserved in the heart of the metropolis, so the <span>hotels in St. Petersburg in the center</span> are in greatest demand. </p><p>  However, luxury rooms can not afford many tourists.  Mini-hotels located in cozy St. Petersburg courtyards come to the rescue.  A separate room or bed in a common room - it all depends on your wallet. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúPros‚Äù of small hotels </h2><p>  More recently, a great alternative to network ‚Äúgiants‚Äù has appeared - keep this in mind if you are going to <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Mini-hotels</span> in the city center have a number of indisputable advantages: </p><ol><li>  Lower cost by reducing staff costs and maintaining infrastructure. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg hotels in the city center" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/977340.jpg" width="350"></div></li><li>  Due to the small number of guests, the administrator and maids can provide an individual approach.  For the same reason, the level of security is increased - statistics show that unpleasant situations occur in mini-hotels much less often. </li><li>  ‚ÄúAt home‚Äù - there is not a large crowd of people and fuss, in the lobby there is no smell of food from a restaurant, and at night no one sings in karaoke.  Life in large <span>chain hotels</span> does not stop for a minute, and it is almost impossible to relax in such conditions. </li></ol><h2>  "Prestige" </h2><p>  The most important advantage of the Prestige Hotel is the center.  St. Petersburg is often called the cultural capital of Russia, and the main attractions are concentrated in the city center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

However, without exception, all guests can look into the restaurant ‚ÄúRussian Fun‚Äù and try traditional Russian dishes.  When booking, you can include a wonderful breakfast in the price: two types of cereal, granola, egg dishes, pancakes, juices, tea and coffee. </p><p>  If desired, guests can also have lunch and dinner at the restaurant.  According to reviews, the food in the "Russian Fun" is tasty and satisfying, but does not differ in special variety.  Unfortunately, there is no good grocery store nearby, and for guests of the Prestige Hotel in the cafe there is a constant 10% discount. </p><h2>  Skyhotel </h2><p>  Looking for hotels in St. Petersburg in the center?  Inexpensive housing is offered within a three-minute walk from Nevsky Prospekt.  It recently opened Skyhotel. </p><p>  The number of rooms is small, consists of three categories of rooms: </p><p>  - Superior double room with skylights.  Guests can choose one or two beds.  Price - from 3000 rubles. </p><p>  - Classic double room with one bed.  Bathroom and toilet are on the floor.  Price - from 2500 rubles. </p><p>  - Classic double room with two beds.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Exemplar </h2><p>  Today, Skyhotel's reputation can be envied by some of St. Petersburg's central hotels.  It's all about the guests who are trying to surround with attention and care.  Cozy bathrobes and slippers, bath accessories, excellent cleaning and delicious breakfasts - it is almost impossible to find a negative review. </p><p>  Recently, the mini-hotel has been hosting SkyDay.  Relaxed atmosphere, pleasant music, wine, fruits and sweet treats - at this ‚Äúhome‚Äù party you can meet other guests, share your impressions about the trip and just have a great time. </p><h2>  Hotel "Aurora Central" </h2><p>  Dreaming of a trip to St. Petersburg?  Hotels in the city center will save time, because within walking distance are the main attractions of the Northern capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg mini hotels in the center" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/977341.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  ‚ÄúAurora Central‚Äù is located on Ligovsky Prospekt - near <span>Vosstaniya Square,</span> Nevsky Prospekt and <span>Moskovsky Station.</span>  Guests can choose from 12 rooms of the following categories: </p><p>  - Standard (single).  The price is from 2100 rubles. </p><p>  - Comfort.  The price is from 2450 rubles. </p><p>  - Business.  The price is from 2800 rubles. </p><p>  All rooms have a private bathroom, fridge, cable TV, hairdryer and telephone.  Guests have access to a shared kitchen. </p><h2>  Traveler ratings </h2><p>  It is interesting that almost all the hotels in St. Petersburg in the center are located in residential buildings, and the entrance is the first thing that guests see.  When checking into the Aurora Central mini-hotel, the dirty and dark front door, which has long been in need of cosmetic repairs, makes an unpleasant impression. </p><p>  Wi-Fi receives ‚ÄúDeuce‚Äù from guests - its signal quality does not even allow checking email.  Most travelers do not recommend staying at this hotel for more than two days. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúStation K43‚Äù </h2><p>  Every month, new hotels open in St. Petersburg.  In the center you can cheaply rent a room in a hotel with the unusual name ‚ÄúK43 Station‚Äù, the stylish interior of which will appeal to young travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel St Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/977339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Guests can book one of the fifteen rooms in the following categories: </p><p>  - Standard single (from 2000 rubles). </p><p>  - Standard double (from 2300 rubles). </p><p>  - Triple ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù (from 2500 rubles). </p><p>  - ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù four-seater (from 2700 rubles). </p><p>  The rooms have a private bathroom, toiletries and a flat-screen TV. </p><p>  Reviews of some guests make us doubt the authenticity of high ratings on tourist portals.  ‚ÄúStation K43‚Äù is characterized more as an improved hostel than a full-fledged hotel.  Key notes: small rooms, weak Wi-Fi signal, inattention of the administrator and minor problems with the settlement of certain groups of tourists, as well as the lack of an elevator. </p><h2>  "St. Petersburg" </h2><p>  One of the advantages of large hotels is the view from the window.  Choosing between value and beautiful cityscape, we often stop at the first one, and a dull Petersburg yard appears before our eyes every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap hotels in St. Petersburg in the center" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/977345.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another thing is the hotel ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg‚Äù.  A magnificent twelve-story building was built on Pirogovskaya Embankment in the late 60s.  Here, for the first time, a continental breakfast and a buffet were served.  ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg‚Äù received many famous guests and repeatedly became the venue for all kinds of events. </p><p>  Much has changed since then, but the hotel management is trying to ‚Äúkeep the mark‚Äù.  Travelers are fascinated by the view of the Neva, picturesque bridges, domes of St. Isaac's Cathedral and the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, which opens from the windows of the room.  Wi-Fi ‚Äúcatches‚Äù throughout. </p><p>  The front desk and lobby bar are open 24 hours a day.  On each floor there are coolers with drinking water.  At the request of the guest, the administrator can organize an individual tour or a trip to the theater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg hotels in the center" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/977343.jpg" width="368"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Hotel St. Petersburg has a large number of rooms.  Only 655 options for every taste and budget: </p><p>  - Standard - 2940 rubles. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù with a view of the Neva - 3290 rubles. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù two-room with a view of the Neva - 3290 rubles. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù with a view of the city / Petrograd side - 2940 rubles. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù with a view of the Neva - 4900 rubles. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúExecutive‚Äù two-room suite - 5200 rubles. </p><p>  All rooms have a set of toiletries, a TV and a telephone.  A hairdryer is available upon request. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Despite its rich history and excellent location, St. Petersburg does not live up to expectations.  Claims by guests come down to outdated furniture and an inattentive attitude by all staff. </p><p>  The quality of dishes in the restaurant, the lack of an ATM of one of the largest credit organizations and unnecessary souvenir stalls also add negativity to the ‚Äúpiggy bank‚Äù.  The most harmless remark concerns city noise, which is quite natural for the center of a metropolis. </p><p>  Repair and competent staff management will help to fix all the flaws, but they do not plan to close the hotel in the near future. </p>
