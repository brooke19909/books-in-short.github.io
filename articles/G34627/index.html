    <h2>  History </h2><p>  There are two main points of view regarding the foundation of this city.  Russian scientists say that Harbin was founded as a settlement for the builders of the Sino-East Railway.  In this regard, the date of the appearance of the city is considered to be May 25, 1898.  Chinese experts, however, insist that until that time there were villages on the site of Harbin, so that only the beginning of the "Russian" period can be associated with this date.  Both sides have many arguments, disputes do not stop, but to deny the fact that for more than half a century the history of the city has been closely connected with Russia is simply strange. </p><p>  So, the construction of the CER firmly connected the northeast of China with a neighboring country, weakening the influence of Europe and Japan here.  Therefore, the emergence of the railway has become a matter not so much of infrastructure as of politics.  Of course, it connected Siberia with the Far East and became an important transport artery, but strengthening ties with China is not a secondary goal either. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, peoples who spoke different languages ‚Äã‚Äãsettled separately in Harbin.  In the Russian part, their schools were opened, all the inscriptions were on the "great and mighty", even the architecture was very different from the second district.  This trend continued after the October Revolution, which made the city a center of emigration in Asia.  By the way, at some point he almost became Soviet - the uprising that began, inspired by the Bolshevik-minded inhabitants, was quickly crushed. </p><p>  From the middle of the 20th century, emigrants began to leave Harbin, leaving back to Russia or other countries.  A significant role in this was probably played by the increased hostility of the Chinese towards foreigners - the Russians did not always behave correctly with the owners.  But the main reason was the sale to Japan of the Soviet part of the property in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Now the city has become completely different.  Nothing betrays the fact that the history of Harbin was closely connected with the "elder brother," as the Chinese used to call the USSR.  Is that the number of foreigners, among whom the Russian-speaking prevail. </p><p>  Modern Harbin is the capital of Heilongjiang Province, located in northeast China.  Its population is about 10 million people, despite the <span>sharply continental climate</span> with severe winters.  It is an important economic and industrial center of the PRC.  And he is the most popular city among Russian tourists.  So what does Harbin offer travelers? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the ‚ÄúRussian <span>period‚Äù of history</span> has long ended, something native is still visible in the guise of the city.  Much has been destroyed, but some buildings have remained untouched: </p><ul><li>  Central Street (Zhongen Dojo).  The 1.4-kilometer pedestrian area is a true open-air museum of architecture.  It is very crowded, because even the locals really like to walk. </li><li>  Church of St. Sophia.  This is one of the few remaining Orthodox buildings in Harbin.  Inside, however, nothing resembles an ordinary church - photographs are exhibited illustrating the "Russian" period in the history of the city. </li><li>  The new synagogue.  White <span>emigration from Russia, of</span> course, included Jews.  And in this building there are exhibits telling about their life in Harbin.  An old synagogue and a Jewish school are also nearby. </li><li>  TV tower.  "Dragon" is the name of this building.  It is the tallest steel tower in Northeast Asia.  At the very top is a revolving restaurant, and those who do not have enough to admire the beautiful view from the window can go to the roof. </li><li>  Sunny island.  Here is a park where locals really like to be, newlyweds take pictures.  There are also cages with squirrels, deer and a pond with turtles. </li><li>  <span>Amur tiger</span> park <span>.</span>  There are not so many of these beautiful animals in the world, and all the more valuable is the opportunity to see them in their natural habitat by driving in a completely closed bus around the reserve.  You can even feed the animals, so visiting this place is definitely worth it. </li></ul><p>  Thousands of tourists annually come to Harbin.  The sights they visit are restored on time, so many come back here again.  Not the last role in this is played by annual festivals. </p>

    <h2>  Events </h2><p>  One of the most interesting events for tourists, not only in Harbin, but throughout China, is the famous festival of snow and ice, which takes place here every year.  The history of this holiday has been going on for 3 decades, but only recently it has acquired its current scale. </p><p>  15 thousand sculptors from different countries each year in early December arrive in Harbin to show their skills, building, for example, a four-meter sculpture or a castle the height of a five-story building.  The official opening of the festival is held on January 5.  Until about mid-February, the entire Sunny Island turns into a real winter tale.  It is not surprising that winter tours in Harbin are so popular, and travelers are ready to endure frost and long flights to get here. </p><p>  However, this is not the only event that attracts residents from various countries here.  August International Beer Festival, July Music Competition, Lantern Festival, and <span>Chinese New Year</span> are all worth visiting Harbin.  Sights, of course, are also interesting, but colorful annual events will give an unforgettable experience. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For many residents of the European part of the continent, almost all of Asia is the Far East.  Cities are nearby, so you might think that you can get from Beijing to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky by bus.  Of course, this is not so.  And the largest Russian city closest to Harbin, Vladivostok, is approximately 500 kilometers away. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is not difficult to get here, because the city is a major transport hub.  Harbin (Taiping Airport) receives aircraft from international companies such as Aeroflot, Air France, KLM, Air China and many others.  This is one of the largest air harbors in the north-east of the country. </p><p>  There is also a large station through which trains pass to many Chinese cities.  Soon it is planned to organize a high-speed route to Kazakhstan.  Thus, the development of transport infrastructure in Harbin is in full swing. </p>
