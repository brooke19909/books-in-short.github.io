Someone plans to spend time actively having fun, while others want the vacation to be calm and relaxing.  Those who prefer the second option will certainly enjoy a holiday in Krinitsa. </p><h2>  Description and location </h2><p>  Krinitsa is a small village with a little over 150 inhabitants.  It is comfortably located on a mountain hill in the valley of the Pshada River.  It is 40 km from Gelendzhik.  And the closest settlement from Krinitsa is Betta, which is only 10 km away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in krynitsa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1287304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since the village stands on a high bank, you will have to go down the stairs to get to the Black Sea beach.  But if you regard this walk as a health benefit, then it will not seem intimidating. </p><p>  Since the village is located by the sea, it has resort infrastructure, although it is not the same as in large cities.  Holidays in Krinitsa can become varied, because there are cafes, bars and a disco.  In the village you can buy the necessary things, because there are several shops.  Also in this area there are children's camps and camp sites.  But it is important to note that mainly tourists come here to enjoy the true mountain and sea nature and plunge into silence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Village nature and weather features </h2><p>  Holidays in Krinitsa combines the opportunity to see three amazing worlds at once - picturesque mountains, a bewitching forest and the azure endless sea.  As already mentioned, the village is located on a high bank, so the descent to the sea is a hundred-meter iron staircase.  But the general relief that surrounds the village is smooth and picturesque.  Diverse and numerous vegetation gives it a special charm.  Although there are no palm trees or cypress trees, there are approximately 1,200 different species of trees, shrubs, and grasses in the area. </p>

    <p>  Since the mouth of Pshada is located here, off the coast of Krinitsa the sea is cooler than in Gelendzhik.  But, as compensation, the village is closed from the cold northeast winds by Mount Shahan.  In this area, the climate of the Mediterranean type is dry subtropical. </p><p>  This means that summers are long and hot, and rainfall is rare.  In Krinitsa, there are about 250 sunny days.  Water in July usually warms up to +24 ¬∞ C.  All these conditions create a good resort atmosphere.  Holidays in Krinitsa can begin in mid-May, when the water warms up enough.  The swimming season ends in mid-October.  We can say that the winters are mild and in February the temperature fluctuates around +4 ¬∞ C. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Village Beach </h2><p>  As soon as you step on the old iron staircase leading to the beach, you will breathe in the aroma of the sea and feel yourself in a full-fledged resort.  Numerous reviews about holidays in Krinitsa indicate that there is a clean pebble beach, but the bottom has a strong slope, so that already five meters from the coastline, the depth will be two meters. </p><p>  On the beach itself, you can rent a deck chair and an umbrella.  There are also water activities such as catamarans, scooters and boats. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment in the village </h2><p>  Coming here on vacation, you need to understand that this is a quiet and peaceful place, where there are no club parties and noisy water parks, which, according to reviews of guests who appreciate peace and quiet, is a big plus.  And as an entertainment, you can try riding a horse - for this there is an <span>equestrian arena</span> on the Pshada Ranch.  There is paintball. </p><p>  Tours are also offered in the vicinity of Krinitsa.  Here you can visit various waterfalls, a winery, the Ostrich Farm ranch, a fishing farm or go for fun in Gelendzhik. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of vacationers, before the guests who arrived in the village, there are a lot of options where to stay.  It can be a private sector, a sanatorium, a guest house, a hotel or a recreation center. </p><p>  In Krinitsa there are children's camps where you can arrange your own child, and yourself at this time to relax in the village.  But still you need to remember that in the midst of the season it is better to reserve places in hotels or recreation centers in advance. </p><p>  It is important to note that campers or those who prefer camping are also staying here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center in krinitsa" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1287301.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Food in the village </h2><p>  Numerous reviews say that several dining rooms and cafes help to solve the food problem in Krinitsa.  In addition, you can eat in the camps "Krinitsa", "Kuban" or in the dining room of the camp "Kommunarskaya".  But the bulk of vacationers, by the way, prefers to purchase products from the local population and cook their own meals. </p><h2>  Rest in Krinitsa: reviews </h2><p>  Every year there are thousands of people who want to be in nature, away from the city and its bustle.  And many have been coming to the coast for more than a year to spend a quiet holiday in Krinitsa.  The reviews of such people show that the terrain of the village is truly mesmerizing and conducive to a good rest. </p><p>  Many parents believe that Krinitsa is very suitable for children‚Äôs leisure, as there is enough entertainment on the beach, and nature helps to improve your health.  But, unfortunately, for some the problem (although, as they say, the only one) was the daily hundred-meter descent and climb the stairs.  True, and this is being solved, since there is the possibility of avoiding difficulties, if you rent housing in the river valley, on the right side, then the road to the sea will be gentle. </p>
