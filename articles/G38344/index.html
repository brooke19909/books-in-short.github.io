And do not forget about customer reviews. </p><h2>  General information about banks </h2><p>  A bank is an organization that specializes in financial and credit operations and provides its services to the government, legal entities and individuals. </p><p>  Today banks in Ulan-Ude are developing rapidly and provide their customers with new products.

Let's look into this issue.  The case of defrauded depositors of this bank in Ulan-Ude got to litigation.  The depositor of the bank, an elderly woman who had been saving money for 10 years, was deceived.  According to her, she bought a bill in the amount of 289 thousand rubles from this bank, and eventually deprived herself of all her savings. </p><p>  And on September 14, 2018, protesters gathered in the city center near the building of the Asian-Pacific Bank in Ulan-Ude - 10 defrauded depositors with placards called on the bank's administration to return their funds. </p><p>  ATB involved in its financial ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù a very large number of residents of Siberia and the Far East.  Across Buryatia, 60 people suffered for a total of 90 million rubles, and in Russia by 4.3 billion rubles.  This was told by Sergei Bashkov, one of the protesters.  According to him, ATB deceived people for several years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arigus.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photos of protesters" class="if uuid-3016117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109172/3016117.jpg"></div><p>  The Asia-Pacific Bank in Ulan-Ude has not shown its best side.  Says Sergey Bashkov, one of the owners of bills: </p><blockquote><p>  "ATB Bank, together with an affiliate company owned by the same founders as the bank sold bills. Vdovin himself was the owner of the bank and he was the founder of FTK. At one time, an unsecured loan was issued by the bank by order of the former the owner, and in return they offered the population FTK bills, which turned out to be unsecured and, moreover, signs of a financial pyramid were discovered by the Central Bank. " </p></blockquote><p>  But, according to some journalists, they were provided with information that the company that issued the bills to the bank takes responsibility for the return of all funds.  So far, this process will begin with payments to those whose payment deadlines and amounts do not exceed 500 thousand rubles. </p><p>  According to the Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia Vasily Pozdyshev, nothing changes for ATB's customers in their relations with the bank.  The bank branch still holds 250 jobs, which it hopes to maintain in the future. </p><p>  Since May 2018, not only in Ulan-Ude, but throughout the country, bank employees began to deny people interest on purchased bills, referring to FTK LLC. </p><p>  In Khabarovsk alone and in the regions belonging to this region, more than 3,000 bills were sold.  The main buyers were people of retirement age. </p><p>  Recent court decisions oblige the bank to return the amount spent on bills to depositors.  It is also necessary to pay penalties in favor of depositors.  That's just the accumulated funds they refuse to return. </p><p>  The head of the public organization Denis Lokantsev commented on this situation as follows: </p><blockquote><p>  We also filed with the courts of Khabarovsk and the Khabarovsk region about 10 statements in defense of ATB depositors.  They dragged it on a bit, as they were waiting for answers to inquiries to the Central Bank about the results of the internal audit, which was held at the bank after the start of the rehabilitation process and the introduction of the interim administration.  In response, however, they received only unsubscribes.  However, now that there are positive court decisions in favor of depositors, there is hope that we will be able to achieve payments.  Although, it is possible that ATB will try to appeal the decision.  After all, we are talking about multi-million payments. </p></blockquote><p>  It remains only to wait and hope that the depositors will be returned their money in full. </p>
