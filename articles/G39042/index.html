To master the technique of folding various figures from paper sheets is not as difficult as it seems at first glance.  Gradually, you can move from simple works to voluminous figures that will look extremely original. </p><p>  The article will discuss how to make an origami cat. </p><h2>  The easiest classic option </h2><p>  Here you need two sheets of paper in the shape of the same squares.  The work is performed in the following sequence. </p><p>  One leaf is folded diagonally, then the corner on the left is slightly bent to the right side, so that it resembles a tail.  This is what the body of an origami cat looks like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami cat" class="if uuid-2355322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2355322.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a head </h2><p>  But to make a head, you have to work a little more.  The paper should be positioned so that one of the corners looks up, then you need to bend down through the middle so that you get triangles. </p><p>  Then you need to add both vertices of the resulting shapes so that they are aligned with the vertex below.  After forcing the bends, all the same corners need to be bent up, but not completely, to get a pair of triangles in front with another corner, which is located in the middle.  Gently pulling the corners in different directions, we straighten the bends that turned out earlier. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The result is a triangle with a vertex at the bottom and 4 fold lines.  Then you need to separate the paper layers, and press the paper inside where there were already folds from past folds.  The final figure should be a rhombus that has ears. </p><p>  The upper part bends backward, the resulting bend must be ironed properly and loaded into the paper so that there are no protrusions on the back side. </p><p>  At the very last stage, you need to connect the torso with the head and spread the legs on the sides of the craft. </p><h2>  Another version of the craft </h2><p>  Here, for work, you need two sheets of paper as well as in the manufacture of the first version of the cat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="origami.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="origami cat" class="if uuid-2355363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2355363.jpg"></div><p>  The first leaf is folded in half diagonally to form a triangle.  The upper part of the resulting figure must be bent to the center by 2/3.  The corners remaining from below are bent up.  Then you need to turn the workpiece over. </p><p>  For the body, the paper also needs to be folded in half, then unfold and cut a triangle along the arc, starting from the lower left corner of the paper, so that the cut goes to the upper right corner. </p><p>  At the next stage, stepping back a few centimeters from the fold line, you need to cut a small triangle.  The resulting long piece bends and becomes a tail. </p><p>  It remains to glue the head with the body and draw the cat's face.  Paper origami cat is ready. </p>
