  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We create with pleasure - openwork patterns with knitting needles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A conceived and do-it-yourself thing will surely become a favorite, it will delight you and surprise friends.  All things made by oneself are unique, because a piece of the author‚Äôs soul is enclosed in them. </p><p>  Each craftswoman involved in knitting, always drew attention to the airiness and weightlessness of clothing associated with openwork patterns.  Using this technique, you can knit a beautiful cardigan or wrap, a fantastic shawl or stole.  And you can choose a lace for a light summer dress or a thin top.  In this article we will try to understand the secrets of the technique of openwork knitting and make the complex more understandable. </p><h2>  The principles of openwork knitting </h2><p>  Despite the apparent confusion of the patterns of openwork patterns with knitting needles, the knitting technique is not at all complicated.  Of course, before starting work, you will need to understand the scheme, understand what the symbols mean, and try to make a control sample of the pattern you like.  A control sample of the pattern is needed to correctly calculate the number of loops for the details of the product, because the density of knitting is different for each master. </p><p>  In the technique of <span>knitting openwork</span> patterns with knitting needles, a pattern is created in the front rows of the canvas, the loops of the wrong rows are knitted by default in the pattern.  The airy mesh structure of openwork patterns is manifested through the use of yarn.  They increase the number of loops of the canvas, so their number is regulated by knitting two front loops together.  Depending on the pattern, the faces are knitted together with a slope to the left or right (this will be indicated in the description of the pattern). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The simpler, the better. </h2><p>  For starters, you can try to master knitting simple lace patterns with knitting needles. </p><p>  The setochka lace is considered to be the most uncomplicated one: its rapport is calculated only on two loops and is 4 rows in height. </p><p>  The pattern is obtained through the alternation of two facial loops, knitted together and yarn.  This combination of loops is repeated until the end of the first row.  In the next front row, the order of the loops changes: the yarn is knitted over the front and vice versa.  In the wrong rows, knit all the loops on the wrong side.  Such a simple pattern looks good when knitting a long stole or shawl, you can use it for a light blouse. </p><p>  Here is an example of another simple knitting pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fragment of the pattern and flowchart" class="if uuid-2470022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2470022.jpg"></div><p>  The rapport of this pattern consists of 7 loops and is 8 rows high.  In the front rows, the loops are knitted according to the scheme, in the wrong ones according to the figure.  When knitting this pattern, you need to pay attention: the number of loops involved in broaches varies from larger to smaller (from a triple broach in the second row, then a double broach to the usual in the last).  When forming the bends of the picture, this nuance will be of great importance.  If everything is connected correctly, very beautiful weave of lace will turn out. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When calculating the number of loops for the part of the product, it will be necessary to add 3 more loops (one closing circuit and 2 edge ones) to their number.  This pattern is well suited for both pleasant summer models and a lightweight mohair pullover. </p><h2>  Patterns of openwork patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="theknittingneedleandthedamagedone.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted mohair air pullover" class="if uuid-2470313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2470313.jpg"></div><p>  Along with fairly simple, there are many complex lace patterns, the description of which would take several pages.  Therefore, such patterns are deciphered in the form of knitting patterns.  Each outline icon indicates a specific loop or loop action.  These icons are universal, having learned to understand their meaning, it will be possible to decipher the scheme, the description of which is given in an unfamiliar language. </p><p>  Knitting openwork patterns with knitting needles with a description given in the form of a pattern will require extreme attention and constant control of the number of loops.  It may seem a little complicated for a beginner, but the result is worth it.  Having mastered the technique of knitting <span>openwork with knitting needles,</span> you can create completely unique things! </p><h2>  The nuances of knitting openwork </h2><p>  When working with openwork patterns, it is better to use thin threads with a smooth texture.  If you plan a warm, gentle thing, it is better to choose a thin mohair with a content of natural fibers of at least 80%.  For thin summer models, you can use cotton or linen threads.  It is better not to use all natural yarn for knitting things with an openwork pattern.  She has the feature of being slightly stretched, and this can deform the finished product. </p><p>  Please note that knitting openwork patterns is better to combine with small-diameter knitting needles, while the loops are more even and neat. </p><h2>  Openwork summer top </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.garnstudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer oversize pullover with lace inserts" class="if uuid-2471010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2471010.jpg"></div><p>  By learning to understand the patterns of openwork patterns with knitting needles, you can try to connect a simple, but very relevant summer pullover in the oversize style.  Such a free model, made of light yarn, is suitable for a walk on a summer evening. </p><p>  Cotton or linen yarn is well suited for this model.  The back and the main part of the front of the pullover are knitted with front stitch, and the center of the product and the edges of the sleeves are decorated with a delicate openwork pattern. </p><p>  The diagram shows only the front rows, in the wrong rows the loops are knitted according to the figure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.garnstudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern of openwork inserts" class="if uuid-2471029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2471029.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting, like any other work, is a magical process.  From a thread wound into a ball, a new thing appears, created by you.  And the ability to knit openwork patterns will further expand the possibilities and add charm and personality to your products. </p>
