    <p>  It is generally accepted that personal income tax in Russia is 13%.  These funds will be withheld from the bulk of the taxpayers of the Russian Federation.  But there are exceptions. </p><p>  For example, income tax may be withheld: </p><ul><li>  30% - for foreigners; </li><li>  35% - winnings and prizes, bank deposits, insurance; </li><li>  9% - income from dividends; </li><li>  15% - with the simplified tax system "income-expenses"; </li><li>  6% - with the simplified tax system "income". </li></ul><p>  But most of the profits are taxed at 13%.  Salaries, property income, inheritance, gifts - all this provides for a 13% <span>tax rate.</span>  And nothing more. </p><h2>  Deductions </h2><p>  Another interesting nuance is that citizens who transfer personal income tax in the amount of 13% can apply for a so-called tax deduction.  This is the procedure for the return of expenses incurred for certain operations against taxes paid. </p><p>  Deductions are due: </p><ul><li>  on children (standard); </li><li>  for studying; </li><li>  for treatment; </li><li>  for the purchase of property; </li><li>  when applying for a mortgage. </li></ul><p>  There is also a professional tax deduction among entrepreneurs.  But in Russia it is issued extremely rarely. </p><h2>  Deduction amount </h2><p>  Need to return income tax on children or for the purchase of an apartment?  Each taxpayer will have to clarify some restrictions on this.  The thing is that personal income tax is returned at a rate of 13% of the expenses incurred, but with certain limits.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  390,000 rubles - a mortgage; </li><li>  260 thousand rubles - when buying an apartment / property; </li><li>  120 000 rubles - <span>social deductions</span> (for training, treatment); </li><li>  50 000 rubles - for the study of each of the children, brothers or sisters. </li></ul><p>  You can apply for deductions until these limits are exhausted.  After that, it makes no sense to apply for a return. </p>

    <p>  Special attention is required to the income tax return on children.  It is drawn up by the employer and provides for a reduction in the tax base when calculating personal income tax.  The amount of deduction depends on the number of children. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ul><li>  1,400 rubles - for 1-2 minors; </li><li>  3,000 - for 3 or more; </li><li>  12,000 rubles - for a disabled child (up to 18 years old and up to 24 years old, if he is studying at a university / graduate school / residency); </li><li>  6,000 - for children with disabilities to guardians. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing difficult to understand in this.  And how to make a deduction in a particular case? </p><h2>  Personal income tax return </h2><p>  Need to return income tax on your apartment or tuition?  Then you will have to follow some instructions.  But first, let's figure out how to get a deduction for children. </p><p>  To reduce the tax base when calculating personal income tax, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Contact your employer for a deduction. </li><li>  Attach to the request documents: passport, TIN, birth certificates of children, certificates of disability and education (if any). </li></ul><p>  Nothing more is needed.  Other tax deductions, as a rule, are made through the Federal Tax Service at the applicant‚Äôs registration. </p><p>  In order to receive income tax for training / sale of property / treatment, you will have to follow the instructions: </p><ul><li>  Collect a specific list of papers.  Their list will vary depending on the situation. </li><li>  Write a deduction application.  It must indicate the details of the beneficiary's account. </li><li>  Submit a written request to the Federal Tax Service at the applicant's registration.  Attach prepared papers to it. </li><li>  Wait for a response from the tax (from 1 to 3 months of waiting) and transfer of funds for the specified details. </li></ul>

Now it‚Äôs clear what income tax is.  How to return it?  This is also no longer a secret.  This information will help bring the idea to life. </p>
