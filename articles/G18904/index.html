On average, in the CIS countries men die in the region of 60 years, and women - 65. In Western Europe, this indicator is slightly higher.

    <p>  In general, ‚Äúcentenarians‚Äù are people who have crossed the threshold of 90 years.  According to statistics, women stay in this world longer than men, which is why they own most of the records for life expectancy. </p><p>  <strong>Oldest person on earth</strong> </p><p>  This title belongs to the heroine Jeanne Louise Kalman.  In the entire history of man and to the present day, no such person has lived who lived longer than her.  She was born in France on February 21 in the distant 1875, and she died at 122 in 1997 on August 4.  Kalman lived longer than her children and grandchildren.  In scientific papers, information about her life is carefully documented. </p><p>  <strong>Second place.</strong>  <strong>Oldest person on earth</strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The Guinness Book of Records says that the oldest man is Shigechio Izumi from Japan.  It is said that he was born in June 1865 in 1865, and died on February 21 in 1986.  If the date of birth is correct, then he spent 120 years in this world, and this means that he takes second place in the list of centenarians after Joan of Louise Kalman.  However, according to other sources, he passed away at the age of 105 years.  What information is correct, we most likely will not be able to find out.  But, despite this, Shigechio Izumi nevertheless set a record, however, in terms of length of work.  He worked 98 years.  Another interesting fact is that after 70 years of his life he began to smoke. </p><p>  <strong>The second applicant for the title "The oldest man on Earth among men"</strong> </p><p>  If we take into account that the date of birth of the Japanese Izumi is incorrect, then Thomas Peter Torvald Christian Ferdinand Mortenses, who lived 115 years, can rightly be considered the oldest man.  He was born in Denmark in 1882 on August 16, and died in 1998 on April 15.  In the church there were records of his baptism, which did not call into question the true age of Christian. </p>

    <p>  <strong>How old is the oldest person living today?</strong> </p><p>  The first place by right in this list is occupied by Frenchwoman Anna Eugenie Blachard.  Her age has already exceeded the mark of 117 years.  She was born on February 16, 1896.  The oldest man on Earth today among men today is the American Walter Breuning.  He was born in the same year as Blashar, only on September 21. </p><p>  Probably everyone wants to live a long life, filled with happy moments, but, on the other hand, this has its drawbacks.  Think for yourself, friends, parents, children, and sometimes even the grandchildren of long-livers, die before them, so a person who has suffered so many losses can be considered happy with a stretch.  So do not think about the years, appreciate every minute, every day and every chance and try to live your life as brightly as possible. </p>
