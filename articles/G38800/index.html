What determines the cost of badges from the times of the USSR?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Collecting badges</span> and awards - faleristics is a fascinating activity, which has many fans in different parts of the world.  In recent years, many rarity collectors have sought to get the rare and expensive badge of the USSR - a country that is no longer on the world map.  The decoration of the collection may be a sign issued in the first decades of Soviet power in a limited edition, a set dedicated to people of rare professions, important events in the life of the Country of Soviets.  Let's try to understand some of the issues that concern beginners and experienced collectors, for example, how is the price of different types of badges of the USSR. </p><h2>  Popular themes of Soviet badges </h2><p>  During the years of Soviet power, badges were issued, marking belonging to the arms of the armed forces and to the state security committee.  For more than 20 years, no one has been wearing such emblems, but you can see photos of the USSR badges related to these popular series on sites and forums of falerist, numismatists, and collectors of Soviet rarities.  For almost eight decades, badges were massively produced in the Soviet Union in honor of the anniversaries of prominent figures, military, revolutionary, and sporting events.  There were series devoted to military subjects, which are very popular among modern collectors.  The awards marked outstanding services to the homeland.  Now you can study the history of the USSR from these miniature monuments of the Soviet era. </p>

    <p>  According to the faleristes, the spread of collectibles during the years of the <span>Soviet Union</span> was driven by successes in space exploration and the political ‚Äúthaw‚Äù, when the ‚ÄúIron Curtain‚Äù rose slightly, separating the country from the capitalist world.  In 1957, the 6th International Festival of Youth and Students took place in Moscow, the participants of which exchanged badges.  Separately, it is possible to single out directions devoted to cities, sports societies, universities, objects of cultural heritage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  USSR political badge </h2><p>  Almost all Soviet people were in organizations and societies.  First graders were admitted in October, and the first 3-4 years of schooling were decorated with a five-pointed star with a portrait of little Volodya Ulyanov (Lenin).  At the age of ten, almost all the guys joined the pioneers and changed the badge.  The first breast emblems belonging to the Komsomol with the inscription "KIM" (Communist Youth International) appeared in 1922.  After changing the name of the organization, an image of Lenin and the inscription of the Komsomol appeared on the flag-shaped icon. </p><p>  In the <span>Soviet Union,</span> lapel badges of October, Pioneer and Komsomol signs were not of interest to collectors, because almost all schoolchildren and youth up to 30 years old had to wear them.  After the collapse of the country, a separate direction of faleristics was gradually formed - the ‚ÄúPolitical Badge of the USSR‚Äù, which includes badges marking affiliation with organizations, participation in party congresses, social competitions, and national squads. </p>

    <h2>  What are the badges of the USSR </h2><p>  Many distinctive badges were issued in the <span>Soviet Union in</span> large quantities, others came out in small batches.  Almost all teenagers who have reached the age of 14 became Komsomol members, and only the most respected and honored people are deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.  Breast deputy emblems were issued in limited editions, which means that the price of the USSR badges belonging to members of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Russian Federation or another union republic is higher than the Komsomol badges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Materials for the manufacture of most emblems, insignia, badges of the USSR were: </p><ul><li>  alloys and metals (bronze, brass, stainless steel, duralumin, aluminum); </li><li>  wood; </li><li>  glass; </li><li>  different types of plastics; </li><li>  semiprecious stones; </li><li>  Enamels, varnishes. </li></ul>

    <p>  Stamped badges the size of a small button, issued <span>emblems the size of</span> a fist.  Very often, Soviet fashionistas and fashionistas they replaced jewelry.  Badges with cartoon characters were especially popular as decorations for children, and for women miniatures with elements of Palekh painting, in the form of flowers, animal figures. </p><h2>  Badges of the USSR: value, preservation, value for collectors </h2><p>  At auctions and special markets, the price of badges is determined depending on their rarity, safety and other distinctive qualities.  An important indicator for collectors is the stories associated with the circulation, with people who wore the logo.  A significant role is played by the value of the materials from which the rarity is made.  The USSR badge with Ural gems is valued more. </p><p>  Increases the cost of the absence of a price on the back, which happens in the case of premium, memorable corporate badges.  The release date also matters: the earlier the circulation was, the more expensive it is.  Some insignia are equipped with numbers on the back, which means they are registered, the price is the highest.  Beautiful and original badges were rare in Soviet times, mainly consumer goods were produced.  Now a kind of ‚Äúhunt‚Äù has begun for such rarities, collectors are eager to get them and do not spare money for the purchase. </p>

    <p>  <span>Breastplates,</span> issued in the USSR before the Great Patriotic War, became rarities.  For example, the metal emblem of the Friends of Radio Society is auctioned for $ 10,000.  The Dobrolet badge costs 450 thousand rubles, or even more. </p><p>  When the development of aviation began in the USSR, small series were created designed to popularize the Society for the Assistance to Defense, Aviation and Chemical Production (Osoaviahim).  In 1926, a sign was issued in honor of the international flight from Paris to Angora, which became a real rarity.  Badges in the 1930s were produced in limited editions, on equipment preserved from imperial times.  They have a lot of manual labor, and therefore such products are expensive. </p>
