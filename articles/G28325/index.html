    <h2>  The first inhabitants of the island </h2><p>  We suggest that you first get acquainted with the history of such an interesting country as the Republic of Madagascar.  Interesting facts about this <span>island nation are</span> numerous.  We will focus only on the most important events from the history of its settlement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to myths, immigrants from Africa were the first inhabitants of Madagascar.  They are known as mikea, or wazimba pygmies.  According to scientific studies, the first inhabitants appeared here in the 2nd-5th centuries.  We are talking about representatives of the Austronesian peoples who sailed by canoe to this island.  Later, Bantu tribes arrived here who preferred territories located near the water.  Austronesian descendants who settled earlier occupied the middle of the island.  Around the 10th century, as a result of mixing with the Austronesian African population, a distinctive people arose who called themselves Malagasy. </p><h2>  Arabs and Marco Polo </h2><p>  Arabs arrived in Madagascar in the 7th century, and from that time written evidence began to appear on the island.  It is believed that Marco Polo gave the name to Madagascar.  In his notes, this traveler mentioned the countless treasures that Madeigaskar possesses.  However, it is possible that it was about the port of Magadishu, the <span>capital of Somalia,</span> and not about the island.  Nevertheless, the name has become fixed and has survived to this day. </p><h2>  Arrival of Europeans </h2><p>  At the turn of the 15-16 centuries.  Europeans arrived on the island.  This happened for the first time when the ship Diogo Diasha, a traveler from Italy, lost its course, heading to India.  The European ship first docked on the shores of Madagascar.  Since the island had an important position for spice traders who traveled all over Africa, France and Britain tried to establish their outposts here.  However, hostile locals and the inhospitable climate that caused the disease made this task practically impossible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Pirates on the island </h2><p>  Since the 17th century, Madagascar has been known as a <span>paradise island</span> for pirates and slave traders.  This was due to its convenient location, as well as the fact that there were almost no colonial authorities.  Famous pirates such as William Kidd, Robert Drury, John Bowen and others called this island their second homeland. The photo above shows the pirate cemetery (Santa Maria). </p><h2>  The activities of Maurice Benevsky </h2><p>  In 1772, Moritz Benevsky, a Slovak adventurer, came up with a plan for the development of Madagascar.  Louis XV supported him in this.  In February 1774, Moritz arrived here accompanied by 237 sailors and 21 officers.  The natives did not show active resistance, and almost immediately began the construction of a city called Luibur, which became the capital of the island.  Local leaders in 1776 elected Benevsky king.  However, the French were alarmed by the influence of the Slovak, who had already managed to create an independent militia from local residents.  The government ceased to assist him.  As a result, Benevsky was forced to abandon his plan and return to Paris. </p><h2>  Power on the island in the 19th century </h2><p>  In the 19th century, Merina, a state that existed in the mountains and in cultural isolation from Madagascar, announced its influence on the entire island.  Radam I in 1818 was declared king.  Until 1896, his dynasty ruled the island.  Her last monarch was overthrown by the French, who had already landed here in 1883. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The French protectorate in 1890 secured the support of England.  However, France for this undertook to recognize the power of England in Zanzibar and Tanganyika.  The indigenous monarchy in 1897 finally lost its power. </p><h2>  20th century in the history of the country </h2><p>  After Germany invaded France in 1940, British troops occupied the island.  It was they who protected the island of interest to us from Japanese attacks.  Germany tried to implement its Madagascar plan, according to which 4 million European Jews should have been relocated here. </p><p>  After the Gaullist part of France seized power in 1943, revolutionary unrest began in Madagascar.  In 1947, they spilled over into an armed struggle for independence.  In 1958, France granted independence to its colony, despite the fact that the uprising was crushed.  On October 14, 1958, the Autonomous Malagasy Republic was proclaimed, which was under the protectorate of France.  After another 2 years, this republic declared its independence.  Power was in the hands of the Social Democratic Party, which was led by Philibert Tsiranana. </p><p>  In 1972, a political crisis occurred on the island, as a result of which the military, led by General Ramanantsua, gained power.  However, on December 31, 1974, the general was removed from his post by his closest supporters.  Power was in the hands of a military directory. </p><h2>  Education of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar </h2><p>  In 1975, the state of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar appeared.  The construction of socialism began on the island.  Madagascar undertook to strengthen ties with the Soviet Union.  Perestroika in the USSR led to similar processes on an island called Madagascar.  The republic restored its multi-party system only in 1990.  A demonstration against the government was shot in 1991. Democratization and market reforms began since the presidency of Albert Zafi, who came to power in 1992. </p><p>  In Madagascar, a rally against the government took place on January 31, 2009.  As a result, Andrew Rajoelina, the mayor of the capital, declared himself president.  This coup was condemned by many countries. </p><p>  These are the main milestones of history that the Republic of Madagascar has experienced.  Its sights are numerous, in this article we will tell only about some of them. </p>

    <p>  The thermal resort of Antsirabe is a great place to relax.  This city is the coldest in the country (average annual temperature - 17 ¬∞ C).  He is also famous for the art of embroiderers.

    <h2>  Dyke Complexes </h2><p>  The dam complexes located on the High Plateau are also very interesting.  A dense network of channels permeates the surface of these pools.  Here you will find numerous dams, gateways and small bridges.  The rivers in Madagascar are very deep.  They lay silt in their channel, eroding rocks.  As a result of this, the valleys rise slightly above the level of the surrounding area.  In order to restrain the rivers, protective dams were built, which in their engineering solutions and size are not inferior to the famous Dutch dams.  From the side, they are very similar to the terraced rice fields found in Southeast Asia. </p><h2>  East Madagascar </h2><p>  The east of Madagascar is washed by the Indian Ocean.  This part of the island is overgrown with the remnants of the forest that previously covered its entire territory.  Numerous rivers cross the mountains.  The coastal lowland is a narrow strip of a plain about 55 km wide, which is bordered on one side by forests, and on the other by the sea.  The area has a very humid climate; it rains almost continuously.  Therefore, in the eastern part of the island, unique tropical rainforests formed.  Madagascar is a republic whose animals and plants cause real delight in children and their parents.  Those who want to fully enjoy the richness of local nature will find the eastern parts of the country suitable for relaxation.  Here, for 700 km, from Manakara to Tuamasina, the Pangalan canal stretches, where many fish and birds live.  Dozens of species of interesting relict animals inhabit the surrounding forests. </p><h2>  Tuamasina </h2><p>  The second largest city on the island, as well as its largest port, is Tuamasina (Republic of Madagascar).  Tours here are also very popular.  In the vicinity of the city you will find many excellent recreational areas, such as the Mahambu and Manda Beach seaside resorts, the Mahaweluna balneological resort (Fulpuent).  And not far from the coast, in the ocean, lie the islands of Nosy-Burakh, Ily-o-Pryun, Nosy-Ileinetsambu, Ily-o-Natt, Madame and others.  These are beautiful beach resorts in a country like Madagascar. </p>
