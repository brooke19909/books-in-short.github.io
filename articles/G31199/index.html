Nevertheless, her image as a separate integral being was present in almost all cultures and religions.  It was believed that joking with her, just mention it is impossible.  It is unlikely that anyone would dare to put on a Death suit a couple of centuries ago.  However, times and customs are changing, and today this image is incredibly popular for masquerades and theme parties on Halloween. </p><h2>  The modern face of Death </h2><p>  Today, most often, Death is depicted as a skeleton in a black cloak-mantle with a scythe behind his shoulder.  The main attribute of clothing is often very long and has a deep hood.  According to some legends, Death sometimes at the most unexpected moment dropped her hood, showing a naked skull with empty eye sockets.  Curiously, this mythological character does not have a specific gender.  Accordingly, a Halloween Death suit is suitable for both sexes.  It is not necessary to make him too sinister, this character is sometimes portrayed in a well-caricature style. </p>

    <h2>  Classic Death Costume </h2><p>  If you chose this image for Halloween, you can purchase all the necessary clothes and accessories or make them yourself.  A self-made costume will cost much cheaper than the purchased analogue and will be the one and only of its kind.  So what does Death look like?  The most important accessories are a <span>black cloak</span> with a deep hood and a scythe.  Death is most often depicted as a decrepit old woman or a revived skeleton.  Accordingly, you can make a suitable make-up or choose a mask.  Best of all, the Death suit looks in the classic black color for him.  But if there are difficulties with the selection and creation of clothes, you can choose dark gray or <span>dark blue shades.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  We sew a cloak of Death: pattern and tips </h2><p>  The most important element of the costume is a long <span>mantle with a hood.</span>  It is desirable that the cloak was really ‚Äúon the floor‚Äù, but whether or not to make sleeves depends on your personal wishes and sewing skills.  Can I sew a Halloween Death costume with my own hands?  In fact, this is not at all difficult.  The simplest mantle pattern is a rectangle or square.  All sides are processed, and one of them is assembled using braid, a hood is sewn here, it is also formed using braid and assemblies from a rectangle or square.  If there is enough time, you can make a Death suit with your own hands with a more complex cloak.  In this case, the wrap should be modeled with sleeves.  Pattern details: front (2 pieces), back (2 pieces), sleeves (2 pieces) and a hood.  To make the cloak more luxuriant and free, you can add side wedges.  Such a mantle may have a fastener in front or be tied to a belt arbitrarily (in this case, for convenience, belt loops should be sewn for it). </p>

    <h2>  Where to get the braid? </h2><p>  A Death Costume cannot consist only of a mantle and ordinary clothing.  An important attribute of this outfit is a braid.  The easiest way is to make it out of durable cardboard and paint it with suitable paints - a black or brown handle and silver - a blade.  The cutting element can also be glued with foil.  A Death Suit with a scythe will look even more spectacular if you manage to get a real agricultural tool somewhere.  This is an option for men who decide to reincarnate on the eve of the feast of All Saints.  Remember that a real braid weighs a lot, and it will not be easy for a girl in a Death suit to wear it all evening.  An important condition is that the tool must not be sharpened, otherwise you risk injuring yourself or injuring others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Add-ons &amp; Accessories </h2><p>  What to wear under the mantle?  A good option is simple black clothes, such as a turtleneck and trousers.  It is desirable that things be monophonic and have no bright decor.  An interesting option is to complement the Death suit with a purchased skeleton jumpsuit.  However, you can also do it yourself by drawing bone on white clothing with black paint.  It is better to comb your hair smoothly, although many girls who choose such a suit prefer to do hairstyles based on loose strands.  Perfectly complement the image of the corresponding makeup.  The face can be specially aged or painted under the skull of a skeleton.  The Halloween Death Costume can also be complemented with ready-made <span>carnival masks,</span> such as the one of the main villain in the movie "Scream", or something similar to it. </p><h2>  Is it possible to dress up as Death?  Opinions and reviews of lovers of gloomy parties </h2><p>  Halloween is not like many of our compatriots.  Almost every year, representatives of the older generation and Orthodox activists appeal to the public to refuse to participate in the celebration, and also demand that the authorities ban the holding of thematic events.  However, despite such actions, people in clubs at parties on the eve of All Saints Day do not become smaller.  Moreover, many of our compatriots celebrate this holiday at home with friends, preparing traditional snacks and decorating their apartments.  Opponents of Halloween claim that the holiday is too sinister, and its surroundings are inappropriate.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, dress up in evil spirits and once again disturb the forces of evil with a mention. </p>

    <p>  The most indignant among many is the <span>costumes of the devil,</span> Death, vampires and other messengers of hell.  However, those who celebrate this holiday usually do not pay attention to such prejudices.  Many Halloween fans at least once made a Halloween Death Costume with their own hands and happily attended parties and participated in photo shoots.  They claim that all this is just a masquerade holiday, which has a somewhat gloomy aesthetics.  In night clubs in honor of the celebration of the eve <span>of All Saints Day,</span> no rites and black masses are held.  On the contrary, people come to have fun and chat, show their costume and look at how others dressed.  Both opinions have a right to be, if you do not like Halloween - just do not celebrate it.  And those who are going to go to a festive party should carefully consider the choice of costume.  Find the image and character that you find most interesting and close. </p>
