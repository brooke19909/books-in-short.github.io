Manufacturers seemed to have entered into a race with each other and are trying to invent the thinnest, largest or ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù phone in the world.  But some of them took a different path and decided to create their smallest phone in the world.  What happened as a result - we learn from this article. </p><h2>  Why do we need tiny phones? </h2><p>  When you see a miniature phone, the question immediately arises - why is it even needed?  Why do companies release such models?  Not everyone likes the ever-increasing phones.  By their dimensions, they have already approached tablets, and some of them, for example, HTC One, the Samsung Galaxy Note line and Sony Xperia Z1 can be called tablet phones.  Many owners of such devices do not use a tenth of their capabilities.  A small phone, without having excess and unnecessary functionality, can perfectly fulfill its main purpose - to be a convenient means of communication. </p><h2>  Baby from japan </h2><p>  In 2013, the miniature phone, called Willcom Phone Strap 2, was introduced by the Japanese operator Willcom.  It weighs only 32 grams, has a screen diagonal of 1 inch. </p>

    <p>  The Japanese manufacturer is proud to announce that their tiny phone can send e-mails.  In terms of functionality, this smallest cell phone can not boast anything special, except for the infrared port.  And in the mode of operation without recharging, it can be used modest for two hours.  The Japanese themselves admit that it is rather a compact addition to a tablet or a full-sized smartphone.  In terms of ease of use, the phone also raised questions - how to use the tiny buttons to type text, for example, SMS?  It was planned to market no more than 12 thousand Willcom Phone Strap 2, and this device was available for purchase only in Japan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modu Phone - the smallest phone of 2009 </h2><p>  This miniature phone has been released for a long time, but at that time it was surprising both for its modest size and functionality.  Weight - 40 grams, a diagonal of 1.3 inches and a color display with an MP3 player and Bluetooth made this phone the best among other compact communication devices.  But here the work time is again only two hours, so you won‚Äôt talk much with such a phone far from the outlet.  And another fact that could cause difficulty when working with this miniature device is the lack of buttons.  The phone had navigation keys through which you could dial a number or write a message.  In general, the device made a very good impression, although outwardly it looked more like an MP3 player, and it looked a little like a phone. </p>

    <h2>  Keychain phone - maybe this </h2><p>  In 2010, another smallest phone was released - sWap Nova.  It is not only miniature, but also unusual.  Its dimensions are so small that this phone can be worn either as a key ring or as a pendant.  Weighing 43 grams, it is the smallest phone of the sensory devices, and this fact was officially registered in the Guinness Book of Records in 2012. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Although the device has a pendant size, it is a full-fledged phone with a good set of features.  A 1.76-inch touch screen, built-in speakers and a microphone, microSD slot, FM radio - all, like large phones.  An interesting detail - thanks to a retractable USB adapter, sWap Nova can be connected to a computer as a USB flash drive.  It is almost impossible to work with a touch screen with its tiny size, so a stylus came with the phone. </p><p>  Now you can find it only through the Internet, on sites selling mobile devices.  And still there are those who wish to purchase sWap Nova, but rather as an exclusive accessory. </p><h2>  Nokia - experience creating a mini-phone </h2><p>  Do not stand aside from the temptation to create your smallest phone in the world and the famous brand companies.  The Finns have proposed two options for small-sized phones targeted at different user groups.  One of them is the budget Nokia 100. The weight of the device is really small - 71 grams.  But it is equipped with a bright color display and has a good set of applications. </p><p>  The second smallest Nokia phone is the <span>Nokia 700</span> smartphone <span>.</span> Of course, this device looks large compared to the Willcom device, but if you take smartphones from other manufacturers as an example, the Nokia 700 seems to be a tiny bit against their background. </p>

    <h2>  Phone - QUMO Cardphone </h2><p>  But the QUMO Cardphone can rightfully be considered the smallest phone in the world.  The size of a business card or credit card, it can easily fit in a purse or <span>women's wallet.</span>  The new product from QUMO is aimed at an audience of customers who purchase a phone only as a means of communication and do not want to overpay for functions that they do not need. </p><p>  The phone is made of ordinary plastic, but looks very attractive.  In addition, it comes in several vibrant colors.  The modest size, however, allows it to have an impressive array of features.  This is a calculator, alarm clock, phone book.  Weight 38 grams and a thickness of 7 millimeters make the device the smallest communication device to date.  A photo of the smallest QUMO Cardphone is shown below.  By the way, it can also be charged from a computer or laptop, which is very convenient. </p>

    <p>  It is suitable as the first <span>phone for a child,</span> you can take it with you on vacation and not worry that he might get lost or fall into the water.  The cost of less than 2 thousand rubles allows you not to worry about its loss. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Does it make sense for manufacturers to produce small phone models?  An example of a QUMO Cardphone, which recently appeared on the market, shows that such products will find their buyer who is interested not in the huge screens of the phone, but in its function to be a simple and inexpensive means of communication without unnecessary frills. </p>
