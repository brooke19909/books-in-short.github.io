  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Medieval culture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the Middle Ages, a special influence of the Christian church on the formation of the mentality and worldview of Europeans was observed.  Instead of a meager and difficult life, religion offered people a system of knowledge about the world and the laws that operate in it.  That is why medieval culture is completely and completely imbued with Christian ideas and ideals, which considered the earthly life of man as a preparatory stage for the impending immortality, but in a different dimension.  People identified the world with a kind of arena in which the heavenly forces and the infernal, good and evil, were at war. </p><p>  Medieval culture reflects the history of the struggle of the state and the church, their interaction and the realization of divine goals. </p><p>  <strong>Architecture</strong> </p><p>  In the 10-12 centuries in the Western European countries the <span>Romanesque style</span> dominated <span>,</span> which is rightfully considered the first canon of medieval architecture. </p><p>  Secular buildings are massive, they are characterized by narrow window openings and high towers.  Typical features of Romanesque-style architectural structures are dome structures and semicircular arches.  The bulky buildings symbolized the power of the Christian god. </p><p>  Particular attention during this period was given to the monastery buildings, as they combined the monks' dwelling, chapel, prayer room, workshops and library.  The main element of the composition is a high tower.  Massive reliefs adorning the facade walls and portals were the main element of the temple decor. </p><p><strong> </strong>  Medieval culture is characterized by the emergence of yet another style in architecture.  It is called Gothic.  This style shifts the cultural center from secluded monasteries to crowded city blocks.  At the same time, the cathedral is considered the main spiritual building.  The first <span>Gothic-style</span> temple buildings are distinguished by slender columns, carried upwards, elongated windows, painted stained-glass windows and "roses" above the entrance.  Inside and out, they were decorated with reliefs, statues, paintings, emphasizing the main feature of the style - upward striving. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Sculpture</strong> </p><p>  The medieval culture of <span>Western Europe is</span> characterized by the integration of sculptures into the general church architecture.  They served exclusively aesthetic and constructive purposes.  Small sculptures were created mainly from bronze, gold and bone, following the model of Byzantine models.  Large-scale sculptures made of stone appeared in Europe only in the 12th century. </p><p>  In many churches, stone figures were placed on the facades, and statues on columns.  A distinctive feature of the sculpture in the Romanesque style is that it does not depict natural phenomena and the human body. </p><p>  <strong>Literature</strong> </p><p>  Church writings telling about the life of saints - this is what distinguishes the culture of <span>medieval Europe.</span>  By the beginning of the 10th century, a canon of this genre had formed in this area: the indestructible spirit of the protagonist and a set of his virtues.  The ‚ÄúGolden Legend‚Äù by Y. Voraginsky, a collection of descriptions of the life of Catholic saints, gained great fame. </p><p>  <strong>Musical medieval culture</strong> </p><p>  It is based on the liturgical singing of God.  Initially, this trend was used in tunes, and then in hymns, where the poetic text is combined with a song melody. </p><p>  Gregorian choral is an example of canonized music.  It includes chants used for services marked on the church calendar. </p><p>  <strong>Painting and DPI</strong> </p><p>  Book miniature, bone carving, casting, art weaving, chasing are actively developing.  In all types of art an important role is played by an ornament composed of motifs of flora and fauna, or a <span>geometric pattern.</span> </p><p>  Metal processing is mainly used for the production of <span>church utensils.</span> </p>
