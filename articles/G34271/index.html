    <p>  Great impressions begin with the very settlement, which occurs immediately, without delay.  Rooms at Dar Khayam are clean, linen and towels are changed daily, guests share.  The area is very well maintained.  The sea, according to reviews, is just crystal clear, and the sand is tender and soft, like silk.  The beach, as tourists say, is a 3-minute walk from the hotel.  Descent into the sea is smooth, for children it is very convenient.  To the present depth, you need to go 50 meters from the shore. Sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach and by the pools, as the authors of the reviews indicate, can be used for free, but the use of mattresses requires a small fee. </p><p>  The hotel does not allow water to be collected in its own bottles.  Guests must use water spills where hotel staff pours water into disposable glasses for free and in unlimited quantities.  This precaution is dictated by hygiene and sanitary considerations. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews describe the food in the hotel as ‚Äúsuper-diverse‚Äù and worthy of the rating ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  There is always a fish on the menu.  Meat dishes for lunch and dinner are represented by 4-5 items, in addition, meat and vegetable casseroles are offered.  In assortment - a wide variety of vegetables and desserts.  Three varieties of ice cream are served during lunch and dinner.  A children's menu is provided. </p><p>  At the reception, tourists are served by Russian-speaking staff.  There is a very good children's and adult animation.  There is a currency exchange office and spa on site.  At the entrance, guests are greeted by the magnificent hotel lobby, where Wi-Fi is free. </p><p>  TV in the rooms shows several Russian channels.  The authors of the reviews recommend that future hotel guests bring along a fumigator to combat mosquitoes.  This is especially true for those tourists who plan to stay in a bungalow. </p>
