    <h2>  Maryina grove: history of the area </h2><p>  The origins of the area called Maryina Grove go back to the distant XVIII century, when this place was not yet an independent unit, but was part of the estates of the village of Ostankino and was named so because it was not far from the village of Maryino.  According to the first version, the settlement got its name back in the 15th century in honor of the boyar Marya.  She was a rare beauty and was the wife of the boyar son Fedor Goltay, the owner of this territory in those days.  Other information indicates that Marya was called the fearless ataman, the leader of the robber gang.  This assumption is due to the fact that until the XVIII century.  the territory of the modern Maryina Grove was part of a huge forest - a favorite refuge for bandits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Be that as it may, historical documents tell us that the "village of Maryina Sloboda" was growing rapidly;  by 1646, there were already 80 yards and about 200 people here.  Boyarin I.V. Cherkassky, and later the successors of his family and, in particular, the nephew Y. K. Cherkassky, became patrons for all kinds of artisans, who served as a pillar of the stable improvement of the territory. </p>

    <p>  The times of Peter's reforms were the force that temporarily slowed the rate of development of Maryino, since most healthy and strong men in the prime of life were recruited as recruits.  Statistics from 1709 indicate that only about 50 male souls remained in the village.  In addition, 6 yards were empty, and 2 more were extremely poor.  Subsequently, the clan of the princes of Cherkassky on the male line was interrupted;  the daughter of the last male representative, Alexei Mikhailovich, by the name of Varvara, became the wife of Count P. B. Sheremetyev, and therefore, from the XVIII century, Maryino came under the patronage of this family name. </p><p>  The beginning of the XIX century is marked by the fact that Maryino, or as it was called already from the XVIII century.  Marina Grove is becoming a place popular with Muscovites who do not have the opportunity to travel far from the city to their own country estates and estates.  The walks in the Maryina Grove regularly take on the widest scope, in connection with which the then-beginning poet V.A. Zhukovsky wrote his sentimental romantic novel Maryina Grove (1809), which caused the tears of many young girls.  The performance ‚ÄúSemik, or Walking in the Maryina Grove‚Äù, the essay by M. N. Zagoskin ‚ÄúMaryina Grove‚Äù, the mention of M. Yu. Lermontov and others were also dedicated to this place.  Gradually, however, the spreading shady trees of the grove were cut down, and plots of land began to be rented out.  Interest in Maryina Grove subsided ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, not all.  In the unstable periods preceding the formation of the Soviet Union, the region again, as if ringing its own history, turned into a place of accumulation of unreliable elements: thieves, robbers, criminals, resellers of stolen, fugitive prisoners.  For a long time, the Maryina Roshcha district (Moscow) was associated with a lack of amenities and unreliability: there was no sewage system, and a simple working class lived in flimsy wooden shacks.  The impetus for the serious development of this area was industrialization, in particular, the construction and opening of the large enterprise "Caliber" - the plant, which was the only one in the entire USSR to produce precision measuring instruments. </p>

    <h2>  Features and architecture of the subway </h2><p>  The <span>Maryina Roshcha</span> district <span>(Moscow)</span> is famous not only for its rich history, but also for its beautiful metro station.  It opened relatively recently, only in 2010, after a 2-year construction.  The station is the last built under the former mayor of Moscow, Yu. Luzhkov and the head of the metro, Gaev.  The architectural features of the station include lining its walls with light marble, as well as a panel installed at the exit, which depicts the princes Sheremetyevs - the historical owners of these places.  It is curious that in 2016 the Lublin-Dmitrov metro line was extended.  Today <span>,</span> a large number of Zelenograd residents passing through the Maryina Roshcha station, which is located in the <span>NEAD (Moscow),</span> arrive daily at the capital to get to the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya station and drive further to the city center. </p>

    <h2>  Market </h2><p>  What else is Maryina Grove <span>(Moscow)</span> famous for <span>?</span>  <span>The</span> wholesale cosmetics <span>market</span> is the place that attracts women from all over the area.  Decorative products, hygiene products for personal care, face and body skin, household appliances, masks, creams, scrubs, an assortment for children are all made in Japan and South Korea, which means that the leadership guarantees the quality of the presented brands.  Here you can find both offers of small, just beginning their journey trading companies, as well as large international companies that have already established themselves. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  So, if what constitutes the Maryina Roscha district, where this territorial unit is located in Moscow, where its history begins from, has already been clarified, the question remains as to why it is worthwhile to come here at least once in life to at least any Muscovite.  Attractions in the area include: </p><ul><li>  Theater "Satyricon"; </li><li>  Center "KVN Planet"; </li><li>  Street of the Soviet Army; </li><li>  Central <span>Museum of the Armed Forces</span> ; </li><li>  Palace of Culture of Moscow State University of Railway Engineering; </li><li>  Wooden residential building (a unique example of a wooden residential building of the XX century); </li><li>  The <span>Armenian Cathedral</span> under construction, etc. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are many places with a distinctly preserved imprint of history and, conversely, those that were created recently or continue to be built literally now.  This means that both an admirer of antiquity and a lover of modernity will be able to find something for themselves in this area. </p><h2>  Then and now </h2><p>  Maryina Grove is a truly distinctive area.  Previously, he had a notorious reputation for being ‚Äúbad,‚Äù although it was truly a legendary place;  At present, there are a large number of shops, cafes and restaurants, cinemas, and the proximity to the city center provides the district with a constant influx of residents from other territories.  Today Maryina Grove is a territorial unit with modern infrastructure.  There are 20 factories and 21 educational institutions, 4 of which are: </p><ul><li>  Gymnasium. </li><li>  Boarding school. </li><li>  School with in-depth study of languages. </li><li>  Comprehensive school. </li></ul>
