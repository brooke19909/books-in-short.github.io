A similar problem has many causes.  And so you have to pay attention to a lot of things that affect the Internet.  Consider the most common causes of network problems and how to resolve them.  Often, no special skills and knowledge are required from the user.  A person will be able to establish a connection without difficulty.  And only in exceptional situations will you have to try hard to regain access to the World Wide Web. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsclick.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No Internet - what to do" class="if uuid-2448424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448424.jpg"></div><h2>  Accident on the line </h2><p>  Why does the internet not work?  One of the most common causes is a transmission accident.  A regular user will not be able to correct the situation. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is able to exclude such a situation from the list of reasons why the Network does not work.  It is enough to call the provider and check if there are any accidents or breakdowns on the line.  The Internet will begin to function normally immediately after troubleshooting. </p><h2>  Engineering works </h2><p>  The next scenario is the technical work of the provider.  At such times, the network is unstable.  And, as a rule, companies do not warn about technical work and system upgrades in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The problem by user forces cannot be resolved.  But the user has the right to call the company offering Internet access.  The provider will definitely inform about the ongoing preventive maintenance and will orient in time regarding when the Network will work in normal mode. </p><h2>  Weather and Connection </h2><p>  Internet does not work?  It's time to look out the window!  What for? </p><p>  The thing is that bad weather affects the Internet connection.  Heat, severe frost, hurricane - all this slows down the Network or even stops its work.  In addition, accidents can occur on the transmission lines due to weather conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.talklocal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Network connection" class="if uuid-2448426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448426.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth waiting for normal weather.  There is no way to fix the situation anymore. </p><h2>  LAN connection and cable malfunction </h2><p>  Internet does not work?  If we are talking about computers, you will have to pay attention to many different scenarios. </p><p>  For example, today the bulk of users connect to the network via LAN.  The cable from the router can simply burn out or break.  Or to be initially faulty.  The only right solution in this case is to replace the cable for connecting to the network. </p><p>  Important: if on another computer connected to the Internet via LAN, the network is working properly, then the problem is somewhere else. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  No connection to the router </h2><p>  Internet still not working?  It is possible that there is no connection to the router.  For example, due to its malfunction.  This is a fairly common occurrence, especially if a person has long acquired a modem. </p><p>  The user needs to do this: </p><ol><li>  Click RMB on "My Computer". </li><li>  Select "Properties" - "Device Manager". </li><li>  Go to the "Network Adapters" tab. </li></ol><p>  If there is an exclamation mark next to the name of the connected modem, then the device does not work correctly.  The absence of any signs indicating a connected router symbolizes a malfunction of the device for accessing the Internet. </p><p>  What to do?  It is recommended that the user simply replace the modem.  It is advisable before this to exclude all the previously listed reasons for disconnecting from the Network. </p><h2>  Drivers and their obsolescence </h2><p>  <span>Doesn't Beeline</span> or Rostelecom <span>Work</span> ?  It does not matter which provider the user contacted.  The main thing to remember is that connection problems are possible with all service companies.  But often they are quite easy to fix. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeuseof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Network problems" class="if uuid-2448423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448423.jpg"></div><p>  The following scenarios are obsolescence or failure of network card drivers.  To solve the problem, you will have to find a computer with Internet access. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then you have to do this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the website of the network card manufacturer. </li><li>  Select the model of the corresponding device. </li><li>  Specify the operating system the user is working with. </li><li>  Download the installation file of fresh drivers. </li></ol><p>  It is not difficult to guess that the user needs to transfer the installer to the computer with network connection problems and update the drivers.  After this, it is advisable to restart the PC.  If the problem was this, things will work out. </p><p>  Important: this option is often found when working with USB modems. </p><h2>  Broken Network Settings </h2><p>  What to do if the Internet does not work?  Further actions depend on the cause of the problem.  Sometimes the reason for the lack of the Internet are the lost network settings. </p><p>  In this case, you will need to perform the following steps: </p><ol><li>  <span>Open "Control Panel"</span> - "Network" - "Network Connections". </li><li>  Select the desired connection and click on it with RMB. </li><li>  Click on "Properties". </li><li>  Double-click on the line "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4)." </li><li>  In the "General" section, check the box next to "Automatic." </li><li>  Save changes. </li></ol><p>  If after 4 steps it turns out that the user was initially set to automatically receive settings, you need to put a checkmark next to "Use the following ...".  Then you have to specify the network settings.  It is better to check with your Internet service provider.  Information is easily reported by phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="windowstune.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Device Manager&quot;" class="if uuid-2448425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448425.jpg"></div><h2>  System crash </h2><p>  Mobile Internet does not work via USB modem or regular network?  Maybe the reason lies in a system failure.  Most often, it is indicated by a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in the Windows tray.  It will be drawn near the web icon. </p><p>  What to do?  Can: </p><ul><li>  reboot the modem and wait; </li><li>  remove the USB modem and reinsert it into the slot; </li><li>  to restart a computer; </li><li>  disconnect the connection and reconnect it (most often, reception is used when connecting via Wi-Fi). </li></ul><p>  The actions taken will help to fix a system failure.  This will lead to the normalization of the Network. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Why is the MTS, Beeline or Rostelecom Internet still not working?  If all the tips listed above did not help, you can check your computer or phone / tablet for viruses.  Sometimes computer infection blocks access to the network. </p><p>  Any antivirus program is suitable for implementing ideas.  The user needs to run a deep scan of the system, then treat all potentially dangerous objects.  Most likely, something cannot be cured.  Such files will have to be placed in Quarantine, and then deleted. </p><p>  It is advisable to use utilities to search for computer spies.  Software called SpyHunter 4 is ideal. You will have to work with it just like with antiviruses. </p><p>  Important: after cleaning the computer, you must restart the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="f1comp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet setting" class="if uuid-2448421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448421.jpg"></div><h2>  System files </h2><p>  Consider a tip suitable only for PC users.  The thing is that sometimes viruses and spies block access to individual sites or to the Web as a whole by embedding it in system files.  After removing the computer infection, the problem with the Internet does not disappear. </p><p>  It is recommended to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to My Computer. </li><li>  Follow the path C / Windows / System32 / drivers / etc. </li><li>  Open the hosts file with notepad. </li><li>  Erase everything that is written in it. </li></ol><p>  Now you need to restart your computer and try connecting again.  Most likely, there will be no more problems. </p><h2>  Forgot to connect </h2><p>  Now computers allow you to configure automatic Internet connection immediately after loading the operating system.  Some users have not activated this feature.  And someone even uses the home Internet via a USB modem. </p><p>  In these cases, the user may simply forget about connecting to the network.  Of course, an error will pop up when accessing the Internet.  To remedy the situation, just connect.  For example, through a specialized application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="comservice-chelny.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to set up the Internet" class="if uuid-2448427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448427.jpg"></div><p>  Important: a similar problem does not occur on mobile devices. </p><h2>  No money in the account </h2><p>  Internet doesn‚Äôt work on my phone or computer?  Maybe the situation arose due to the negative balance in the account.  In time, unpaid provider services block access to the World Wide Web. </p><p>  What to do?  The user needs to replenish the SIM-card account or pay for the services of an Internet provider.  Once the money goes to the service company, the Network will start functioning normally. </p><h2>  Load </h2><p>  Mobile Internet not working?  Isn't everything good with a computer network too? </p><p>  It is recommended to pay attention to the time and place of connection.  It is possible that the transmission lines are overloaded.  This happens in prime time (in the evenings) and in crowded places. </p><p>  How to fix the situation?  You can try to move to a less crowded place or wait for the Network to unload.  Only after that a person will be able to work normally on the Internet. </p><p>  Important: with a high load on the transmission lines, the Network sometimes works, but very slowly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="informaticaperanziani.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet does not work" class="if uuid-2448428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2448428.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We found out what to do if the Internet does not work.  In fact, there is no single answer to this question.  And each user must think how to act. </p><p>  If all of the recommendations listed above did not help, it is best to seek the help of a specialist.  The wizard will certainly help to fix the situation. </p>
