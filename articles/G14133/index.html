    <h2>  How to get to the territory of the capital's fortress </h2><p>  If you get on the subway, it is most convenient to go to the station “Library named after  Lenin. "  Next, head to the street sign Manezhnaya.  Having come to the surface, you will find yourself in the Alexander Garden - it is located near the western wall of the palace.  Any scheme of the Kremlin shows the tourist that the entrance to it is through the <span>Kutafya tower.</span>  At the right hand there will be ticket offices, there you get tickets for visiting. </p><p>  After passing a little, you will see that the Trinity Tower adjoins the fortress wall, which is connected to the previous <span>tower by the Trinity</span> Bridge.  Once upon a time, <span>the Neglinnaya River</span> flowed under it <span>.</span>  Several centuries ago, she was enclosed in an underground collector to equip the Alexander Park. </p><p>  Passing through the guard of honor at the Trinity Tower, you will find yourself on the square of the same name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kremlin: a scheme for a walk.  Start </h2><p>  Around Troitskaya Square there are many tasks.  To her left is the Arsenal building, or Zeichhaus (in German, the “weapon house”).  The Armory House is considered a relatively young building, since it began to be built at the beginning of the 18th century.  Near the Zeichhaus, according to the idea of ​​Peter the Great, various military weapons, including French cannons, were exhibited. </p><p>  To the right of the square, the State Kremlin Palace was erected, where various pop concerts are held, as well as the main Christmas tree of the country. </p><p>  The territory of the children is divided into squares and streets.  The Kremlin is beautiful.  Its outline is clear and simple.  Passing all along the same Trinity Square directly, to the left of it you can see the Senate Square.  Behind this square in the square is the Senate itself.  All sorts of passages to it are closed, since this building is the working residence of the head of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Behind the <span>Senate Palace</span> in the Soviet years, the building of the Kremlin administration was built.  It was built on the site of the demolished Chudov and Voskresensky monasteries. </p>

    <h2>  Continuation of the walk </h2><p>  We smoothly move to Ivanovskaya Square, from it you can see the cathedrals of the ancient children.  Before reaching the old churches, all tourists stop at the Tsar Cannon.  This tool of foundry craftsmen is striking at first sight; Andrei Chokhov cast it in 1586.  Previously, the cannon "guarded" the southern side of the royal palace.  She was later moved inside. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Directly on the course, a narrow "multi-story" temple - Ivan the Great Bell Tower, built in 1329.  Nearby is the Tsar Cannon. </p><p>  The Church of the 12 Apostles, erected in 1656, is located next to the bell tower. </p><p>  This is followed by Cathedral Square, it was named because it is surrounded by cathedrals and churches: the Bell Tower of Ivan the Great, Arkhangelsk, Annunciation and Assumption Cathedrals, churches of the Terem Palace and the Deposition.  A little further, the Cathedral of the Annunciation was built.  Between this and Arkhangelsk churches there is an exit to Borovitskaya street.  This is a kind of observation deck (the southern side of the Kremlin), with a view of the Moscow River. </p><p>  On the right is the Grand Kremlin Palace.  In it, the president receives guests, rewards the heroes of the Fatherland.  Behind the palace is the Armory of the times of Ivan Kalita.  It is displayed for viewing not only weapons, but also dishes, utensils, stones, as well as a collection <span>of the</span> country's <span>Diamond Fund</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Exit from the palace </h2><p>  The Moscow Kremlin is huge.  Its outline looks like an irregular quadrangle.  Behind the Armory in the corner of the fortress rises the <span>Borovitskaya Tower,</span> named after the hill on which it stands.  Through this building, the exit from the Kremlin is carried out. </p><p>  You can end this excursion, since then there is the opportunity to walk only along the various towers on the walls of the fortress (Blagoveshchenskaya, Tainitskaya, 1st and 2nd Unnamed, Petrovskaya, etc.). </p><p>  Grandiose Moscow Kremlin.  The scheme, unfortunately, cannot convey these majestic expanses and the scale of temples, palaces and chambers, but it will help the traveler to plan a route for visiting interesting historical sites. </p>
