  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Want to know how much it costs 100 rubles 1993?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1993, they issued coins and paper notes in denominations of 100 rubles.  The abolition of <span>banknotes of the USSR</span> issue of 1991 and 1992.  Banknotes depicting Lenin were withdrawn from circulation.  The first paper money with Russian symbols of the 1992 issue with a face value of 5,000 and 10,000 rubles was canceled.  Instead, they issued banknotes of 100 and 200 rubles.  Five hundred and one <span>thousandth banknotes appeared.</span>  The largest denomination: five, ten and fifty thousand rubles. </p><h2>  One hundred rubles with one coin </h2><p>  Such money was minted in Moscow and Leningrad.  But the place of issue does not affect the cost of 100 rubles.  The most expensive are coins that have not been circulated.  Their <span>excellent condition</span> is called UNC.  The bulk of the coins that were used, but not badly scratched and not overwritten, are bought at the lowest price.  How much is 100 rubles in 1993?  The price is determined by the state of the coin.  She "bargains" for sixty-three hundred rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newauction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1993 coin" class="if uuid-2255540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2255540.jpg"></div><p>  The light coin is minted from silver cupronickel.  This magnet is not affected by nickel and copper.  It weighs 7.3 grams.  The diameter of the coin reaches twenty-seven millimeters.  The inscription in the middle of the reverse of the coin is "100 rubles."  On the left side is a wheat spike; on the right is an oak branch.  At the top of the inscription is the familiar five-pointed star.  Below you can see the stigma of the mint.  The year of manufacture is designated - 1993th.  Type of brand - MMD or LMD.  It all depends on where they minted - the Moscow Mint or in Leningrad.  In the center of the obverse is a double-headed eagle.  Above is the inscription around the edge - "One hundred rubles."  Above is the Bank of Russia.  A pattern of rhombuses on the sides frames the composition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Defective coins </h2><p>  It turns out how much it costs 100 rubles in 1993, determines the marriage on a coin!  Defective money is well valued.  The brighter or more unusual the marriage, the more expensive the <span>score.</span>  <span>Coins</span> at issue are carefully selected manually.  They are viewed in bright light and discarded by marriage.  Therefore, such coins are very rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gold coin" class="if uuid-2257992" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2257992.jpg"></div><p>  But occasionally I came across a displacement of the image from a second hit, a bad coinage of obverse or reverse.  Therefore, if you find a clumsy awkward coin, bring it to collectors.  They can estimate it at two to three thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Gold coins </h2><p>  How much is 100 rubles in 1993, if they are made of gold?  Yes, several of these coins were minted in a limited edition.  Not much was released - in series of 1,400-5,700 pieces.  Each series of coins has its own name and a specific image.  For example, the emblem is a brown bear, an image of a ballerina, a portrait of Tchaikovsky.  One such coin is now estimated from 50,000 to 75,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Paper money </h2><p>  An estimate of <span>banknotes of 100 rubles in</span> 1993 can be viewed from the Zagorsky catalog (designation No. 320) or Krause (designation No. 254).  The size of the hundred-ruble note is 130 √ó 57 mm.  On the front side is an image of the Senate Tower.  The flip side is with a panorama of the Moscow Kremlin.  Watermarks of authenticity of the bill are made in the form of waves and stars. </p><p>  Banknotes with small denominations were printed and issued in early 1993.  They were used for two years in circulation.  In 1995, monetary reform was announced.  Replacing money for new bills took place at Sberbank branches.  Exchange terms limited amounts.  Based on a person - no more than one hundred thousand rubles.  For control, this fact was noted in the passport.  In those years, money was mainly in the hands of the population.  Lined up endless queues for exchange.  Many people could not replace the bills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newauction.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old bill" class="if uuid-2257997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2257997.jpg"></div><p>  To understand how much it costs 100 rubles in 1993, look at the safety of money.  Paper notes suffered more wear and tear than coins.  Good or excellent condition for them is a rarity.  The years of storage also affect.  If the bill was not used, now it is "bargaining" for two hundred and fifty rubles.  For banknotes in excellent condition will give one hundred rubles.  A banknote in good condition costs ten rubles.  For example, a banknote in the photo above is sold for five rubles. </p>
