Mittens with an original pattern "Owl" - one of the fashionable areas of our time.  Wonderful gauntlets will decorate your hands in winter. </p><p>  It may seem to someone that knitting a product is a very difficult and painstaking task, but there is nothing complicated. </p><p>  Even a beginner knitter can create them quickly enough.  Tie the Owl mittens with knitting needles according to the pattern and decorate them with beads or sequins - and your winter look will become even more interesting.  Next, talk about how to do this. </p><h2>  We knit mittens with knitting needles with a pattern "Owl" </h2><p>  Wardrobe items with patterns in the form of birds and animals are very fashionable, and the owl is especially popular.  Do-it-yourself things are also trending.  Let's create for ourselves or daughters such beautiful mittens.  How to knit Mittens "Owl" with knitting needles, you will learn from the article.  The knitting process is quite simple, so everyone can handle it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.army-market.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens owl complete with hat" class="if uuid-2655397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2655397.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you will need to prepare the following tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  set for circular knitting of five knitting needles or knitting needles on a fishing line; </li><li>  yarn containing wool (can be with the addition of acrylic) - about 200 grams. </li></ul><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  To correctly determine the size of future mittens, it is necessary to correctly take measurements with a centimeter tape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Firstly, the widest place in the ossicle area with tape tension is measured. </li><li>  Next, measure the length of the brush - "wrist to the end of the middle finger." </li><li>  Measurements "wrist to the end of the little finger" and "wrist - thumb." </li><li>  The length of a single finger. </li></ol><p>  For greater clarity, circle the outline of the hand on paper and draw a drawing on it, according to which you can then navigate. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Mittens - this is such a thing that we often wear in winter, so when buying yarn for knitting, pay attention to the percentage composition: most should be wool.  Also figure out how such yarn will behave in the finished product - whether it will prick, stretch or form spools.  In these cases, mittens will very quickly become ugly and untidy.  Another prerequisite is the comfort and softness of this accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knitka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mittens fitting" class="if uuid-2655410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2655410.jpg"></div><p>  To connect Owl mittens with knitting needles according to the scheme with the description, you need to purchase 200-250 grams of thread.  For example, 100% alpaca or half with acrylic, a set of knitting needles No. 3 and 4, beads or small beads of black color, 2 sequins of yellow or golden color and a needle with a thread. </p><h2>  The process of making the left mittens </h2><p>  Let's start knitting.  Since the mittens are knitted round, when closing the loops of the dialed first row into the ring, it is necessary to mark this place with a pin or colored thread.  Knit the part of the mittens adjacent to the wrist with an elastic band 2 x 2, 2 x 3 with the help of knitting needles No. 3 (this is necessary to obtain a denser fabric, which subsequently will not stretch much and lose shape).  With this pattern we knit 26-30 rows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The width of the cuff depends on your desire - in children's gloves it is better to make it much wider so that the space between the sleeves of the jacket and the wrist is warm when walking. </p><p>  Change the knitting needles, taking number 4, and continue * 6 stitches of the front, 2 together one, knitting the front * - continue 4 rows from * to *.  We knit the front rows before the start of a single finger.  We try on the cuff and calculate the loops to create a separate finger.  Record your measurements and decreases - to tie the right mitt, these records will be useful to you. </p><p>  Then we knit mittens "Owl" with knitting needles according to the scheme below.  Remove the finger loops on a pin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dekormyhome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="owl knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2646070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2646070.jpg"></div><p>  We knit sixteen faces, remove the next ten with a pin, four wrong, eight facial and again four wrong.  The next row: another 16 facial and 4 wrong, 8 facial, 4 wrong.  Continue knitting another seven rows.  We knit 16 front, 4 wrong and 2 loops, remove the pin at work, 2 front and remove from the pin, knit front.  Next, 2 loops on a pin at the beginning of work, 2 facial, 2 facial with a pin and 4 wrong.  Again 16 facial, 4 wrong, 8 facial and 4 wrong.  We knit 3 rows. </p><p>  In the 28th row - 16 front, 4 wrong and remove 2 on the pin at work, 2 front and loop from the pin - wrong.  Again 2 in front of work, 2 wrong side with pins, 4 wrong side.  Another 16 facial, 4 wrong, 2 facial, 4 wrong, 2 facial, 4 wrong. </p><p>  In the thirtieth row, we knit 16 front, 4 purl, 2 together, add the wrong one, knit 2 purl, 1 remove, front and stretch the removed, 4 purl. </p><p>  We knit 16 front and 16 wrong.  32nd row - we will knit 17 front and 14 wrong, 1 front.  Next 18 facial, 12 wrong side and 2 facial.  In the last row - 19 facial, 10 wrong and 1 facial. </p><p>  Here you need to stop and try on a mitten on your hand - if you get to the little finger, then you can start making reductions.  First we knit 2 loops together with knitting needles No. 1 and 3, and 2 together together at the end of No. 2 and 4. Finally, we stretch the thread through the 2 loops remaining on the knitting needles and fix it on the wrong side. </p><p>  To knit the thumb, remove the loops previously removed from the pin, and we will pick up another 5 loops.  Reducing the loops, we get 12 - 14 and distribute them over four knitting needles.  We knit in a circle in front rows, sometimes trying on a mitt.  At the end, gradually decrease by knitting 2 loops together.  Tear off the thread and fix it inside the mittens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medadvicees.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loop loosening and thumb knitting" class="if uuid-2655402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2655402.jpg"></div><p>  Now tie the right Owl mitt with knitting needles in a pattern similar to the left. </p><p>  It remains only to decorate them with beads and sequins, carefully sewn in a suitable place. </p><p>  Making Owl mittens with knitting needles according to the pattern is a very interesting process, which will result in a wonderful winter accessory.  With this gift you can please your loved ones. </p>
