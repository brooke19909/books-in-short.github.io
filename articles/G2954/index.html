Rather, the device itself is not Chinese, but Finnish.  Nevertheless, if we take into account the fact that the Celestial Empire currently has a decent package of documents that allow them to produce certain phones on its territory, then everything will immediately fall into place. </p><p>  The <span>Nokia X6</span> 8GB case is a separate topic, and a special paragraph will be devoted to it in the article.  There are some nuances associated with this part of the device.  Meanwhile, we note that the device was available for purchase in mobile phone stores in three variations.  The first is just the same model with 8 GB of internal long-term memory.  The second variation is a model with 16 GB.  It would be logical to assume that the next model will be the device, "on board" which is 32 gigabytes of long-term file storage.  The rule of powers of two does not sleep, and this is indeed so. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Opening the box in which this smartphone is sold, we can find in it the device itself, an autonomous power source for it (battery), a charger and a USB cable.  Also included are wired headphones, an instruction manual and a voucher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The main material for the manufacture of the phone is nothing more than plastic.  Perhaps it is simply impossible to unequivocally answer the question of what is this - a disadvantage or an advantage.  Let us dwell on the neutral version and move on to further consideration.  Even at the development stage of the device, the manufacturer said that metal elements would also be present.  And, as we see, no one deceived us.  The metal elements in the case are represented by strips passing along the sides of the phone. </p><p>  Note that more than once crash tests were carried out, which revealed that the frames on the sides of the device are indeed made of appropriate materials.  The screen covers a special glass.  Similar materials were used for coating in devices such as the iPhone and iPod.  Again, if we return to the crash tests, we can notice: after the impact, the base seems to fall into separate parts.  It is in connection with this that there is a feeling that the screen is covered with the most ordinary toughened glass. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, the Nokia X6 sensor, reviews of which allow us to make a positive assessment of the phone, is supplemented with a special ‚Äúflooring‚Äù that can be physically impacted from above.  Scratching it is easy enough.  But ordinary glass will be difficult to damage.  However, iPhone users are well aware of this.  Cracks and scratches on the screens appear very, very slowly.  However, it is impossible to handle the device in such a way that during its continuous operation the display does not show even the smallest damage.  Is that wrapping the device itself with foam, for example. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a gap above the screen.  It is she who serves as a source of problems for many neat people.  The fact is that because of this gap under the screen, dust is constantly clogged.  If you do not clean the device for at least two weeks, then you can see its impressive layer.  However, it is also not possible to completely clear everything from there.  At least at home.  Only ‚Äúservice center specialists‚Äù can completely ‚Äúknock out‚Äù dust from under the screen of this device. </p><h2>  Front side </h2><p>  On the front panel of the device, directly above its screen, is the lens of an additional (as it is called, frontal) camera.  Touch buttons we will not see, because they are mechanical.  In general, such a decision is always difficult to call negative.  Mechanical buttons may be less familiar already for younger generations, but they are much more durable than touch controls.  And in this case, they are much more suitable for the phone, while with others certain troubles would have arisen. </p>

    <p>  The model is similar to the ‚ÄúNokia 5800‚Äù, since there is a shortcut key for the menu.  It is located above the screen and has a touch base.  Nevertheless, speaking about buttons, we will not forget that these are just trifles, the smallest elements. </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  The <span>Nokia X6</span> 8GB case, as mentioned earlier, is made primarily of plastic materials.  Thus, the use of plugs takes on some special meaning.  We see it on the left side of the device.  The first thought that creeps into my head is probably about a memory card.  However, there it was.  In fact, unfortunately, it should be noted that there are no memory cards in this model at all. </p><p>  Thus, there are only two logical explanations for the presence of a stub on the left side: it covers either a charging port or a SIM card slot.  In our case, the second option is the right one.  So, to replace the SIM card, you do not have to turn off the device.  But with bare hands, the user is unlikely to be able to do anything.  We need a tool, even an improvised one, with which you can pick up an old card.  Tweezers are great for these purposes. </p>

    <p>  On the same side, we can notice the dynamics in the amount of two pieces.  The company's designers protected them with a metal mesh.  Just note that the speakers on the phone are quite loud.  If we compare the models X6 and N97, then the first one by this parameter clearly exceeds the competitor. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  On the right side of the device is a button that allows you to adjust the volume of the device itself, as well as the music or video being played.  There is also a slider to help lock the phone.  There are a huge number of device models on the market that have such a control dangling.  However, not in the case of our device.  Here it is deepened inside the case, which can be called a positive point.  But, as the law of conservation of energy says, if there is any advantage, look for a disadvantage.  In our case, this is the usability of the slider. </p>

    <h2>  Top face </h2><p>  The top end contains a connector designed to charge the phone‚Äôs battery.  This is a 2 millimeter standard port.  Not far from it is hidden and the microUSB format connector.  By the way, this port, unlike the charger, is also hidden by a stub.  But fans of MicroUSB charging will have to be upset.  In the classroom, such a device is generally absent.  The logical conclusion to the picture was the 3.5 mm standard connector.  It is designed to connect a wired stereo headset to the phone. </p>

    <h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  On the back is the main camera lens.  The bezel protrudes noticeably forward.  Erasing it will be quite simple.  This will happen within a few weeks of operation.  But for a similar design of the device, this is not something new.  This is a kind of flaw.  Meanwhile, most experts are inclined to believe that such a shortcoming is expected, and therefore it would be better to write it into the category of expected losses. </p><h2>  Build problems </h2><p>  According to the polls, much more users of this phone are annoyed by the poor assembly of the device: there are backlashes, the back cover is prone to creak from time to time.  Whether this is due to its small thickness is unknown.  Also, the lid may become loose over time if it is often removed and put back.  Without tension, snap it in all the grooves instantly will not work.  Each corner must be squeezed separately.  A much more successful option would be with a metal plate. </p><p>  Perhaps, these support points can be distinguished in a superficial review of this phone model. </p><p>  The price of Nokia X6 (depending on configuration) is from 4700 to 5400 rubles. </p>
