  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paint on fabric: types and features of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At all times, clothing was an indicator of status, income level, way of expression and demonstration of taste.  And her color was an important characteristic.  Many centuries ago, people learned how to get paints from plants.  Today, the number of artificial dyes is thousands of times greater than the number of natural dyes.  And about how to get paint for the fabric and where, the average consumer does not even think about it.  They just buy it. </p><h2>  Types of paints </h2><p>  When choosing raw materials for dyeing, first of all, you need to take into account the composition and type of fabric, which must be given a different color scheme, as well as the purpose of using dye. </p><p>  Based on the composition, paints are classified as: </p><ul><li>  acrylic - made of acrylic polymer emulsion, which is a binder; </li><li>  aniline - consist of organic compounds that are formed during the oxidation of analin and its salts; </li><li>  plastisol - consist of polyvinyl chloride, which does not contain solvent; </li><li>  natural - are made from products of plant origin; </li><li>  stamping - is made on the basis of alcohol, oil and water-glycerin. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sgartclass.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric dyes" class="if uuid-2834788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2834788.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the application of paint for fabric </h2><p>  Dyeing is best suited to natural fiber fabrics.  It can be wool, silk, linen or cotton.  Able to change color and materials created from blended yarns.  But the polyester paint almost does not work.  In the best case, the color will be pale and will disappear after washing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If there is a uniform dyeing, then it is better to opt for aniline or natural dyes, and acrylic or luminous ones will perfectly cope with the transfer of the pattern to the fabric. </p><h2>  Natural paints </h2><p>  They are absolutely environmentally friendly and hypoallergenic, because they are created as a result of boiling products of plant origin.  Their list is very extensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Natural paints" class="if uuid-2834790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2834790.jpg"></div><p>  Before using natural dye for fabric at home, you need to adhere to several rules: </p><ol><li>  The material to be painted must be washed well. </li><li>  Before the procedure, the fabric must be rinsed in clean water with an addition in the form of soda ash.  If the product is made of silk fabric, then it is replaced by ammonia. </li><li>  Refractory dishes made of glass or enamel without chips can act as a container for staining.  To stir things during the process of changing their color, you can use a wooden or made of durable plastic stick. </li><li>  Before the procedure itself, some types of fabric require preliminary rinsing in solutions that contribute to the fixation of the paint.  It can be from zinc, alum, sauerkraut, vinegar and others.  Required proportion: 3 l of liquid per 100 g of tissue.  The boiling time is 5-30 minutes.  After which the fabric is not subjected to extraction, is placed in the dye.  Rinse can be done after the main procedure for changing color. </li><li>  The duration of staining determines the temperature of the water, the composition of the fabric and the presence of additional additives in the solution. </li><li>  The ratio of the coloring fluid to the weight of the fabric is 20: 1. </li><li>  To consolidate the result, you must use vinegar or salt.  And during the last rinse, adding a small amount of vinegar to the water is mandatory. </li><li>  The painted product is immediately suspended or laid out to avoid stains and smudges. </li><li>  If a plant that is used as a raw material to produce color is poisonous in nature, gloves should be used. </li></ol><h2>  Aniline paint </h2><p>  This is an inexpensive artificial dye that is completely safe for humans.  It spreads well on the fabric, creating an abstraction and beautiful color transitions, giving the material a catchy bright shade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, it quickly fades in the sun, and images created with aniline paint can be destroyed as a result of interaction with water.  Although manufacturers have now minimized these drawbacks of the dye, its sensitivity to these natural phenomena is still preserved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="centerforbookarts.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aniline dye" class="if uuid-2834792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2834792.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, aniline is an excellent paint on the fabric, as it dries for a long time and allows you to adjust the pattern, if necessary.  This is convenient when working with images. </p><p>  Although the paint is harmless to health, you need to follow some safety measures when working with aniline dye.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Avoid contact with skin using rubber gloves. </li><li>  Keep paint in a closed can. </li><li>  Do not use the container in which things were painted.  Most correct - get rid of it. </li><li>  Using aniline paint on the fabric, you can achieve a nodular effect on the material, make a gradient or get interesting “stains”. </li></ul><h2>  Plastisol paints </h2><p>  This is a thermoplastic fabric paint.  To achieve its full solidification is possible only at temperatures from 140 ° C.  A popular area of ​​application is silk screen printing. </p><p>  Plastisol paint perfectly stains all types of fabric, it is used for applying images to it.  It has bright and saturated colors, allowing you to make animated images on the surface.  It does not lose its original color when applied to dark or light fabrics.  The dye has almost no smell.  It is also suitable for textile printing.  Plastisol is part of the fluorescent dyes on the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastisol paint" class="if uuid-2835597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2835597.jpg"></div><p>  Any additives that allow you to save the basic properties of the material to be painted can be introduced into it.  It does not dry at room temperature, which contributes to its long-term storage. </p><p>  However, there are several disadvantages when using similar paint on the fabric, among which the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the thing cannot be subjected to heat treatment immediately after the staining procedure; </li><li>  it is sensitive to dust or dirt, which may affect its quality; </li><li>  after fixing, a certain ink film is felt, which can cause discomfort. </li></ul><h2>  Ink paint </h2><p>  Its scope is wide enough.  It is used in office work to refuel seals and stamps.  For marking linen and towels in the hotel industry is simply indispensable. </p><p>  Stamp ink benefits: </p><ul><li>  dries instantly; </li><li>  it is possible to remove only if the surface on which it was applied is destroyed; </li><li>  It is made in accordance with GOST and international standards; </li><li>  images made with ink stamps do not lose their sharpness, are not smeared or fade. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="thepolkadotcloset.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stamp ink on a napkin" class="if uuid-2835574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2835574.jpg"></div><p>  To dye natural fabrics, an alcohol-based dye is used.  It is used when you need to put a stamp, for example, on bedding.  It is usually available in a fairly uniform color palette: the most popular are red and black dyes for fabrics, as well as green, blue, purple. </p><h2>  Acrylic paints </h2><p>  They are popular for dyeing silk, wool and cotton. </p><p>  Acrylic fabric paint is very convenient for applying both dot images and creating a complete picture on clothes.  She painted bags, t-shirts, jeans and other things.  After fixing and drying completely, the acrylic fabric paint is indelible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brit.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acrylic painting" class="if uuid-2835529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104363/2835529.jpg"></div><p>  Ideal for natural fabrics due to the fact that it is deeply absorbed into the fibers and firmly bonded to them.  Synthetics, in essence, are more susceptible to washing, and acrylic paint on it holds much worse. </p><p>  Natural fabrics dyed with it can be washed in an automatic machine under delicate conditions.  Synthetic products are best hand-washed. </p><p>  Among its advantages can be identified: </p><ul><li>  bright color palette, the ability to obtain other shades as a result of mixing several tones; </li><li>  dries quickly; </li><li>  perfectly stains; </li><li>  well soluble in water; </li><li>  does not fade in the sun; </li><li>  items painted with acrylic can be washed. </li></ul>
