  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to care for bamboo to get a spectacular plant</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, in our homes and in household plots there are more and more exotic plants that were previously found only in parks and botanical gardens.  One of these species, the interest in which is growing every year, is bamboo.  It is used to create growing walls, as well as a background for <span>landscape compositions,</span> grown in open ground, in greenhouses and even at home. </p><p>  Before purchasing this <span>unusual plant,</span> it is advisable to clarify how to care for bamboo in order to avoid possible disappointments.  In open ground conditions, it is advisable for him to choose a place protected from cold winds and the scorching sun with well-drained <span>fertile soils.</span>  At the same time, abundant watering is a vital condition, without which bamboo will lose its decorative effect and wither.  In the year of planting, the soil around the plant must be mulched to preserve moisture, but over time the need for this procedure will disappear, as the bamboo grows and forms dense shady thickets. </p><p>  Knowing how to care for bamboo, you can beautifully arrange the entrance to the house, as well as create a picturesque grove that will decorate any garden or patio.  But it should be remembered that this is a rather aggressive plant, prone to expansion.  Therefore, it is recommended to limit the space around the soil using plastic plates or other durable materials dug into the ground. </p><p>  Speaking about how to care for bamboo, it is also necessary to mention the container culture.  There is a specificity here.  Firstly, in winter, the <span>root system of</span> such plants needs protection against freezing.  There are many materials that can be used to warm the pot: polyethylene foam, straw, spanbond and others.  They can be combined in different ways in order to provide thermal insulation of the root system and prevent moisture from entering the soil during the frosty period.  Secondly, flowerpots must be stable so that they are not turned over by a strong wind.  And thirdly, in containers, the soil dries much faster, so you need to carefully adjust the watering to avoid the destructive drying of an earthen coma.  The result depends on how to care for the bamboo.  If you follow all the rules of agricultural technology, you can quickly get luxurious specimens that will please lush greenery at any time of the year. </p><p>  Indoor cultivation also has its own characteristics.  If possible, it is advisable to keep the plant in a cool room with good ventilation and adequate lighting.  It is better to use a spacious and wide pot, taking into account the characteristics of the bamboo root system.  Necessary conditions are protection from direct sun, plentiful watering and regular feeding.  With excessively dry air, it is advisable to spray the crown of the plant.  Before transplanting bamboo, you should choose a larger pot, organize drainage and prepare a loose fertile soil mixture with good aeration.  If the bush has grown greatly, it can be divided and planted in separate containers.  Subject to regular hydration, the plant survives safely. </p><p>  In addition to the question of how to care for home bamboo, one can mention the pro-cattle runner-house, which is popularly called ‚Äúroom bamboo‚Äù.  These plants have an external resemblance and approximately the same care requirements.  Pogonaterum also grows rapidly, does not tolerate drying out of the soil coma and burns in direct sunlight.  But if he is provided with comfortable conditions, the plant quickly develops and forms lush thickets resembling a miniature <span>bamboo grove.</span> </p>
