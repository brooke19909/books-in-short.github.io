One of the main obstacles to using headphones is traditionally considered external noise, but there are more severe operating conditions.  For example, not all music lovers are ready to refuse to listen to their favorite songs, plunging into the pool.  For such cases, manufacturers produce <span>waterproof</span> swimming <span>headphones</span> , fully suitable for use under water.  They also have different sound characteristics, ergonomic features and, of course, have an unusual design. </p>

    <h2>  Headphones and players for the pool </h2><p>  The main feature of such models is the principle of operation.  However, it cannot be called absolutely anything revolutionary.  In essence, water enthusiasts are offered an audio swimming player, which also includes headphones.  As a rule, such devices work wirelessly, realizing communication via the Bluetooth module.  In other words, this is a variation of a wireless stereo headset, only sharpened on the possibility of operation in specific conditions for electronics. </p><p>  And yet there are different versions of the device, some of which provide for the separation of functions.  So, headphones for <span>swimming in the pool</span> from the Japanese company Sony distribute tasks between different components of the system.  The user receives directly the headphones, as well as the control panel and player, instead of which you can use a smartphone.  In general, a rather functional layout is obtained. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What to consider when choosing waterproof headphones? </h2><p>  In terms of sound, the parameters are fully consistent with ordinary headphones, so in this part it is worth relying on the usual selection criteria.  This applies to both the <span>frequency range</span> and impedance.  The water resistance properties deserve special attention.  Here it is necessary to take into account two important parameters: the permissible immersion depth and the operating time of the device under the same conditions.  On average, headphones for swimming in the pool are designed for immersion up to 1.5-2 m. Actually, this is the best option for swimmers and ordinary fans to splash in the water.  But for divers, such a device is not suitable.  As for the operating time, it fits into the standard duration of water procedures - about 30-40 minutes.  And now it‚Äôs worth considering reviews of specific offers in this segment. </p><h2>  Sony Walkman reviews </h2><p>  One of the most technologically advanced and functional developments of this brand is the model NWZ-W273.  What is very important, users note a deep and clear sound.  And this despite the fact that most devices of this type work with interference.  A common occurrence when an audio signal is diluted with all kinds of third-party effects underwater.  Many owners emphasize the dignity of the Japanese model - it boasts high-quality sound insulation, thanks to which the ear perceives only the signal from the headphones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Reliable fixation is also emphasized.  Even with active <span>swimming, the underwater</span> player in this modification does not slip from the head and does not require constant correction.  By the way, runners also point to this quality.  But there are also negative reviews about this development.  They criticize the device for inconvenient management with limited capabilities.  This nuance is due to the very modest size of the gadget. </p><h2>  Reviews on OverBoard Wired Model </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about a modification of OB1038, which represents a traditional approach to the manufacture of headphones, but with the expectation of operation underwater.  Oddly enough, and the budget model OverBoard causes a lot of favorable feedback regarding sound quality.  But this time, not only isolation is important, but also the technical basis with a decent frequency range. </p>

    <p>  If we return to the issues of insulation and tightness, then in these qualities the headphones for swimming in the pool from OverBoard reveal themselves very well.  However, all the advantages are covered by one big drawback.  Almost all users of this model speak negatively about ergonomics.  The presence of wires does not allow you to fully engage in swimming. </p><h2>  Speedo Aquabeat Model Reviews </h2><p>  The headphones of the Aquabeat series from the famous sports brand Speedo can be considered the opposite of the previous development.  This is a player that is a small-sized hybrid design.  That is, the gadget includes both controls and headphones directly.  According to the owners, this swimming player has a high degree of protection against water, a long battery life and a stylish design. </p>

    <p>  The pluses include earplugs made in the original form.  They provide both a comfortable fit and effective sound insulation.  If we talk about the shortcomings, that is, claims to the massive design of the device, because of which its weight is felt on the head.  However, you can get used to this feature. </p><h2>  How much are the headphones for the pool? </h2><p>  The inclusion of additional features traditionally increases the cost of gadgets, and such an unusual protective quality, such as water resistance, in particular.  One way or another, there are budget options in this class, which include the OverBoard device.  Despite the decent playback quality, this model is still not suitable for reliable operation in an aqueous environment.  True, taking into account the price tag of 2.5 thousand rubles.  you can come to terms with the shortcomings of this development.  The Sony Walkman's NWZ-W273 will cost the most.  <span>A wireless headset</span> for underwater use from Japanese designers costs about 4.5-5 thousand rubles.  The average level is the model Aquabeat from Speedo, which can be purchased for 3 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Segments that discover new practical properties of popular devices are populated by manufacturers pretty quickly.  But with waterproof headphones this did not happen.  In fact, 3-4 companies form a new niche, therefore there is nothing to choose from.  So, if you need high-quality, reliable and stylish headphones for swimming in the pool, then you should focus on Sony products.  For fans of active sports, who put practicality and undemanding content in the corner, it makes sense to turn to Speedo offers.  As for the headphones from OverBoard, then this option with all the shortcomings may be useful.  Despite the wired device, this gadget provides good sound and qualitatively performs protective functions.  Wires, of course, will interfere with active activities underwater and on its surface, but for leisurely procedures this option is quite suitable. </p>
