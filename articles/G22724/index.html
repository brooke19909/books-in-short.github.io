  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bull bubble and its application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What are the first leather balls made of?  The history of the first ancient window.  Toys and rattles.  It's hard to believe, but all these things were once made from a bull bubble.  It was used in military affairs, in medical practice and in the manufacture of children's toys.  But they did not dare to use it in cooking. </p><h2>  What did glass windows two hundred years ago? </h2><p>  Many years ago, bull bubbles were used instead of window glass.  They were pulled onto the frame after preliminary processing.  At the same time in the daytime the room was very dim light.  Stretched, it is transparent, a little yellowish.  Strong enough, reminding modern polyethylene. </p><p>  Bubbles are used in the manufacture of children's toys.  They were inflated and used to play balls with children.  Peas were poured into the dried, inflated bubbles and there were ringing rattles. </p><h2>  Special use cases for the bladder </h2><p>  An inflated bull bubble was used in those cases when it was necessary: </p><ul><li>  Cross the pond.  Bubbles tied in several pieces, tied them around his body and crossed. </li><li>  Measure the depth of the pond.  Researchers of past centuries threw them into the water and waited for them to surface. </li></ul><p>  A curious story happened with the invention of the ball.  It was first invented by a Roman gymnastics teacher named Atzius.  When he once saw a bull bubble on sale, he came up with a brilliant idea how to use it.  I bought a bubble and processed it in the proper way.  After it was inflated and lined with leather.  It turned out a good rubber ball.  In use, the ball turned out to be light and bouncing.  Thus, the bull bubble ball, invented by the gym teacher, became the grandfather of all balls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vintage ball" class="if uuid-2483585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84829/2483585.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, they also used such balls.  The process of converting a bubble into a soccer ball is not very complicated, but requires a lot of diligence. </p><p>  Long before now, small bubble bags were very popular.  And now at the exhibition of Yakut masters such handbags were presented as souvenir products. </p><h2>  Making musical instruments using old technology </h2><p>  Many peoples used the bull bubble in the manufacture of musical instruments.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Shuvyr is the oldest Mari musical instrument. </li><li>  Bagpipe - Byz (Byzgeton).  Udmurt national instrument. </li><li>  A gander or, in other words, a gander is a type of drum, a percussion musical instrument.  It is found in all nations of the world. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bagpipesociety.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bagpipe tool" class="if uuid-2483648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84829/2483648.jpg"></div><p>  Make-up artists of the last century widely used a wet bull bubble in the manufacture of a wig.  Since it is smooth, it was used when it was necessary to play a person with no hair on his head in a theatrical production.  A bubble was pulled over his head and created the appearance of a bald head. </p>
