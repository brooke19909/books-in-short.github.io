They determine this with numerous showers, cloudiness, small storms and other bad weather in the region.  But in fact, a resort like Pattaya lives in August as active as in any other month of the year.  Here you can sunbathe on the beach during the day (short showers), and at night visit bars, discos, street carnivals and beach parties.  Let us consider in more detail what the main <span>resort of Thailand</span> at this time is famous for. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The summer in Thailand is a particularly hot and humid season.  During the day, the air temperature warms up to 32 degrees (sometimes more), and at night the air cools down to only +28.  The humidity is about 85%.  Keep in mind, the most popular local resort, Pattaya, literally immersed in showers in August.  They are here short-term, but very strong (sometimes umbrellas even break from them).  But literally an hour after such an invasion, everything dries up, the hot sun rises, and you can safely go to the beach, sunbathe and swim in the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya in August" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/642581.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The state of water in late summer </h2><p>  The city of Pattaya bathes in the waters of the <span>Gulf of Thailand,</span> which by its nature is quiet and calm.  Storms occur here only if a strong wind flies into the region.  It happens that the water level in the sea rises very high, and coastal areas are flooded (but this phenomenon is extremely rare).  Given the fact that Pattaya warms up to its maximum in August (compared to any other month), the water here is like <span>fresh milk.</span>  Its temperature is approximately +30 degrees, and in some areas where the shallows stretch very far, it is even hotter.  It is worth noting that the beaches that are within the city are not entirely clean.  Here, both the sand and the water itself are dirty.  Therefore, if you want to fully relax and sunbathe, go out of town, where there are picturesque bays and bays, in which there is a minimum of wind and a maximum of hot sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Pattaya in August" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/642580.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  If you dream of a budget vacation at the end of summer, then one of the best solutions will be a trip to the Thai city of Pattaya.  In August, prices for tours here are the lowest due to rains, due to the very high air temperature and humidity.  At the same time, we note that the prices for airline tickets are reduced, since few people fly in this direction during this period.  Local hotels lower their rates for accommodation to a minimum, since they are completely empty.  Local merchants give their goods almost for nothing, so as not to remain in the red.  Therefore, having gone to Thailand in the summer, you get an excellent opportunity not only to relax cheaply, but also to buy very valuable goods that would be fabulously expensive in winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattaya august reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/643057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of <span>summer tourism</span> in Thailand </h2><p>  As mentioned above, at the end of summer, winds rise here, which provoke waves in the waters of the bay.  That is why windsurfing enthusiasts and those who would like to learn this sport for a long time are chosen for holidays in Pattaya in August.  Both on city beaches and on country recreation areas there are centers where you can rent all the necessary equipment for surfing, as well as bring an experienced instructor with you, who will tell you how to conquer the waves correctly. </p><h2>  Pattaya in August: reviews </h2><p>  Through the eyes of tourists, the opportunity to visit Thailand at the end of summer is an excellent budget option for a vacation.  Low prices for absolutely everything give you the opportunity to relax here very cheaply and at the same time get a lot of new experiences.  On especially cloudy days, you can go on excursions to ancient temples and museums.  When the sun rises, you can go to one of the suburban beaches to sunbathe.  Many also claim that in August it is best to try local delicacies.  Again - low prices for gourmet dishes make it possible to enjoy something new and exotic. </p>
