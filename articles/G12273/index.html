    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gift Ideas </h2><p>  Since ancient times, Abkhazia has been famous for its handicrafts made of twigs and boxwood, as well as many souvenirs made of shells, sea pebbles and bamboo. </p><p>  One of the popular answers to the question of what to bring from Abkhazia as a gift will be wicker furniture and jewelry. </p><p>  There are a lot of wicker furniture, which will become relevant not only in the house, but also in the garden for a successful summer vacation.  In addition, the fair sex in Abkhazia is very fond of making ceramic dishes, and it is worth noting that they have significantly succeeded in this matter.  Guests are invited to take with them a variety of ceramic items, embroidered handbags and a variety of hand-made jewelry.  Such souvenir products can be offered at every local market and on the way to the beach, and their cost is quite affordable and acceptable for the average consumer, and of course you should not forget that bargaining is always appropriate.  Locals are always happy to make concessions and discounts. </p><h2>  Wine </h2><p>  September, sun, beach ... What can be brought from <span>Abkhazia in September ?!</span>  Of course, wine. </p><p>  To date, there are not many real wines that have been famous for entire generations.  In almost all stores where ‚Äúhomemade wine‚Äù will be offered, there will be powder products.  It has nothing to do with the wine that the verses were written about. </p><p>  But there is still a local population that still offers its guests home-made products to the guests of Abkhazia.  However, you should be careful, it is better to listen to the reviews and recommendations of experienced tourists.  Good wine is famous for Sukhumi winery, which offers products at affordable prices.  In addition, quality products can be purchased in private distilleries, the whereabouts of which can be obtained from the local population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what souvenirs can be brought from Abkhazia" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34659/984406.jpg" width="600"></div>

Nevertheless, it is recommended to purchase alcoholic beverages either in specialized stores from the manufacturer (not to be confused with coastal stalls), or from the local population (but only from a trusted one).  Otherwise, "self-fired" chacha can easily be poisoned.  Gourmets are advised to use chacha separately from all alcoholic drinks, otherwise you can get poisoning or severe intoxication. </p><p>  But real delicious cognacs and wines specially for tourists can be bottled in beautiful souvenir bottles made of clay or glass. </p><h2>  Fruit </h2><p>  What to bring as a gift from Abkhazia?  And you don‚Äôt have to think about it - you can just walk along the streets and choose, since all kinds of souvenir products are sold almost everywhere.  Abkhazia is famous for its juicy variety of fruits, for example, in almost every market you can buy tangerines or figs at an affordable price.  It is worth noting that <span>dried figs are</span> characterized by unique healing properties. </p><p>  In addition, from Abkhazia you can bring along a bag of <span>dried persimmons,</span> which has an original taste and look. </p><p>  Quite often you can meet sellers of churchkhella, which is an original sweetness of dried fruits and various nuts planted on a string, which are covered with thick grape juice on top.  Due to the fact that churchkhela can be stored for a long time, it is a very original present from sunny Abkhazia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For those who like to treat themselves to a cup of coffee in the morning, various hand-made Turks are offered.  It is in such Turks that freshly brewed coffee acquires an original taste and an unforgettable aroma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to bring from Abkhazia in September" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34659/981820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Spice </h2><p>  Spices that can be brought from Abkhazia are a separate issue, since there are a lot of them, and each species has a special, original taste.  Surely there will not be a single tourist who has visited Abkhazia who would not have brought spices.  Almost all sets are characterized by affordable, optimal price, there are beautiful gift wrapping for sets with originally filled with grinding.  It is thanks to the spices that Abkhazian cuisine occupies a separate place in cooking and is famous for the unforgettable taste and aroma of dishes. </p><p>  Here there are a huge number of laurel bushes, of which you just can‚Äôt help but make a winner‚Äôs wreath or bring such a unique and original gift to relatives and colleagues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be brought from Abkhazia as a gift" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34659/981823.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Tea </h2><p>  Recently, it has become very relevant - as a gift from Abkhazia - large-leaf tea, which will warm you with long winter evenings and remind you of a wonderful vacation, the scorching sun and beaches. </p><h2>  Medicinal herbs and fees </h2><p>  Due to certain climatic conditions, Abkhazia offers tourists all kinds of homeopathic remedies unique in nature and medicinal decoctions, collections, ointments based on natural components.  This is due to the fact that in each region of the country all medicinal herbs that can only be found in the medical literature germinate.  But you should be very careful: before you buy something, you must at least consult or find out exactly what they are trying to sell, otherwise you can buy a very expensive herbarium, which is completely useless for medicinal purposes.  That is why the question of what to bring from Abkhazia is quite complicated, since the offered assortment is so large that I want to take almost everything with me as memories and souvenirs. </p><p>  For example, in Abkhazia, in almost every market or in a store, you can buy a fruit so rare in our Adam latitudes, which is ideal as a medicine for sprains, bruises or joint problems. </p><p>  In addition, you can bring <span>mountain honey</span> as a souvenir <span>,</span> which has unique healing properties and a very original taste that you can‚Äôt confuse with anything.  All sorts of nuts will also be an excellent gift or souvenir: walnuts, cedar, almonds, cashews and many others, which are very much on open sale at an affordable cost. </p><p>  Of course, adjika is the pride of the eastern peoples, which will be not only a great addition to meat dishes at home, but also a wonderful gift for guests on holidays or for colleagues at work.  After all, as you know, nowhere and no one, no matter how hard they try, get such a <span>home adjika</span> like the local <span>population of Abkhazia.</span>  Perhaps the ingredients are not the same, but perhaps there is a lack of Abkhazian color and a wide soul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be brought from Abkhazia in September" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34659/981821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For guests and tourists, Abkhazia offers various <span>suluguni cheeses,</span> sauces for meat and fish dishes, as well as sweet jams. </p><p>  Many tourists bring from here smoked quails, which are considered the most common bird in almost all regions, natural tangerine juice, as well as fresh and dried fruits and delicious pastries. </p><h2>  What to bring from Abkhazia in September? </h2><p>  In September, the velvet season begins, during which those who could not get out on vacation in the summer come to warm countries to soak up the sun.  And Abkhazia is no exception. </p><p>  Many are interested in the question of whether they can be brought to Abkhazia in September, because I want to please relatives, work colleagues with something warm, tasty and enjoyable.  So, it is best to choose wine, honey, sweets or souvenirs, because it is problematic to bring fruit, especially if you travel by train for more than a day to your home. </p><p>  Before choosing what to bring from Abkhazia as souvenirs and gifts, you need to know that, for example, homemade cheese and mountain honey can be bought and eaten right there, but since 2010 there is a law banning the export of these goods abroad.  Unfortunately, now you can only tell your friends and relatives about honey and cheese, conveying feelings and memories. </p><p>  Before you go on vacation, ask your loved ones what souvenirs to bring from Abkhazia as a keepsake. </p>
