    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of our compatriots, they had no complaints about the hotel on this item.  So, according to them, the sea from AMC Royal Hotel 5 * (Hurghada) can be reached in just a couple of minutes in measured steps.  The hotel has its own fairly large well-equipped beach.  So, at the guests' service there is a sufficient number of comfortable sun loungers and parasols, a bar and a restaurant.  By the way, some tourists did not leave the beach even during lunch.  After all, here you can eat at a local restaurant. </p><p>  You can enter the sea in two ways - directly from the shore or from the pier.  In the first case, it is recommended to use special shoes.  You will have to go a couple of hundred meters to the depths, and at the bottom, in addition to sand, there are also sharp corals.  Parents with small children bathe mostly on the shore.  If you swim confidently, you can go down to the water from the pier.  Here you will immediately go to the depths.  After swimming a few meters, you can watch the life of the inhabitants of the coral reef.  Therefore, do not forget to arm yourself with a mask for snorkeling and, if desired, flippers. </p>
