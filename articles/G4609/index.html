This magnificent palace was built in 1624 for Louis XIII as a hunting house.  Later it expanded, becoming the residence of the entire royal family.  Unique features of the palace include a corridor with 17 mirror arches, the Hall of Mirrors and a huge number of other equally interesting details.  Visitors in the Queen‚Äôs bedroom can see a hidden door - Marie Antoinette made her escape through it.  Versailles with its stunning rooms is a must-see.  We must not forget about the 250-acre gardens of the palace, demonstrating the geometric idyll of trails, flowers and trees. </p>
