Among the main attractions of this city, it is worth noting amazing waterfalls that are born from tiny mountain streams in the depths of the island during the rainy seasons, and approaching the coast, these quiet kids increase and gain strength, gradually turning into beautiful stormy streams.  Also, going down from the hotel to Patong beach, you should not ignore the unique structure in the old part of Kathu - the Chinese temple.

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  On the territory of the Leelawadee Boutique Hotel (Phuket) 3 * there is everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The hotel's main restaurant serves Thai and European dishes, and there is also a cafe-bar where guests can get a large selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and light snacks for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The Leelawadee Boutique Hotel Phuket offers 37 beautifully spacious rooms.  The hotel consists of one four-story building.  The building is built on a hill, and, according to tourists, this causes some inconvenience, since the building is located near the cliff, which means a certain lack of light in the rooms. </p>

All are decorated in national Thai style and equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  All rooms have balconies with a modern set of furniture.

    <p>  It is worth noting one important point in this hotel: there are no smoking rooms! </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There is no entertainment at the Leelawadee Boutique Hotel itself.  Yes, it is located not on the coast itself and without direct minute access to the resort‚Äôs main infrastructure.  But not always remoteness from the main arteries of tourist life is a minus. </p><p>  In the case of the Leelawadee Boutique Hotel, remoteness from the beach is one of its advantages.  Tourists resting in this oasis of tranquility and solitude can freely enjoy the beauties of nature surrounding them, without worrying that their peace will be disturbed. </p><h2>  Sea beach </h2><p>  The Leelawadee Boutique Hotel 3 * (Phuket) does not have its own beach, but the relative proximity to the beaches of Karon Beach and Patong Beach make it attractive for most tourists choosing this region. </p>

Just a few years ago, it really was one of the best and most chic beaches on the whole island of Phuket.  But, taking several thousand vacationers a day in the tourist season, Patong is losing ground every year.

    <p>  Tourists vacationing here do not think about cleanliness and about whether after their vacation the uniqueness of one of the most famous beaches of this region will be preserved.  This place is becoming more and more polluted every year, which does not add to its exoticism and popularity.  Every year more and more articles appear on the Internet with a call to avoid visiting this beach.  Now, every tourist who goes on vacation to the island of Thailand, in no self-respecting travel agency, will be advised to relax and sunbathe on Patong Beach. </p><p>  All our compatriots are recommended to visit the beaches closest to Patong, as there are both amazingly clean sand and a much cleaner sea.  And perhaps such recommendations will serve as a salutary action for the disappearing uniqueness of the four-kilometer magnificence of the island of Phuket. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many visitors to this hotel complex respond positively to the quality of the services provided, the sociability of the staff and, of course, deliciously prepared dishes.  Some argue that cleaning is carried out irregularly, sometimes staff can wake guests. </p><p>  Basically, they solve all problems quickly enough.  The administration is always ready to help its guests! </p><h2>  A small summary </h2><p>  Tourists planning a vacation on the island of Phuket, and in particular at the Leelawadee Boutique Hotel, reviews are examined especially carefully.  Why?  Because the hotel is in relative proximity to Patong Beach, which is losing its reputation. </p>
