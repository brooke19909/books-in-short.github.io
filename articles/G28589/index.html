One of the best is Forte dei Marmi.  Italy has long been chosen by the Russian elite.  But it is in this resort that she owns more than 30% of mansions and villas.  This resort is in every way for those who like to relax royally.  Let's take a short walk along its streets, the coast, take a look at some hotels and shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forte dei Marmi" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473104.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the city </h2><p>  Forte dei Marmi is located on the <span>Tyrrhenian Sea</span> in the Versilia region of Lucca.  It is very beautiful, drowning in evergreen vegetation, fragrant with flowers and the sea, ringing with wonderful fountains.  But the town is so small that many call it a village.  In the center is a pretty square, from which, like the rays of the sun in a children's drawing, clean and in every way pleasant streets diverge.  One of them is called Roma Imperiale.  It is here that you can see the mansions of many Russian nouveau riche.  On the perimeter of the square are concentrated prestigious expensive boutiques and restaurants, and the further from it, the cheaper and simpler.  On the outskirts of the city there is a good and quite affordable supermarket.  There is also a train station in Forte dei Marmi, which is only 3.5 km from the center.  You can get there on foot (about 40 minutes), by taxi and by bus (every hour).  From the station, trains leave for many Italian cities - Milan, Pisa, Genoa and others.  But most vacationers ride cars and bicycles.  They are offered for rent in offices located directly on the streets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forte dei Marmi Italy" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473110.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  An important question for those who have chosen Forte dei Marmi as their vacation spot: "How to get there?"  There are several options - by plane, by train, by road and by boat.  The nearest major international airport, which bears the name of Galileo Galilei, is located in Pisa.  From it to the resort 20 km (counting from the city borders).  At 5 km there is another small airport with grassy runways.  The planes there are only sightseeing.  By car, Forte dei Marmi can be reached from anywhere in Europe.  In this way, many from Russia come.  Drive along the A12 towards Versilia signpost, then turn right.  Having followed the third traffic light, turn again, but to the left, and move already to the city itself.  Indicative figures: from Lucca to the resort 30 km, from Milan 250, from Florence 80, from Rome 300. There is a separate route from each city.  From Milan, this is A1, which is followed to Fidenza, then go to A15 to La Spezia and then to A12.  From Florence, take the A11 to Lucca, then turn onto Viareggio.  From Rome follow the A1 to the city of Florence, and then follow the above pattern.  The port is located in Viareggio, in the same place as the railway station.  By sea, the resort can be reached from major Italian cities.  Information should be clarified by the numbers: 0584 444440584, 0584 89826, 0584 320330584 32033. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Forte dei Marmi" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473107.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  A wonderful summer vacation gives its guests Forte dei Marmi.  Italy, especially its south, is famous for its generous sun.  But at this prestigious resort in the off-season and in winter rains are not uncommon.  But from the second half of May to the end of September, most days are sunny and warm.  There is no heat, the air temperature almost never rises above +28.  But if there is rain in the sky and clouds, the mercury column drops to + 20 + 23.  Winter in these places often ‚Äúspoils‚Äù rainy days, so there are few tourists. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beaches of Forte dei Marmi are all perfectly equipped.  The resort has a sandy shore, and the sand is sifted every morning by workers, so there are no usual ‚Äúgobies‚Äù and beer caps for other beaches.  Entry into the water almost throughout the gentle, very convenient for the kids.  But the water is unclear (due to local plankton).  In windy weather, <span>seaweeds</span> can be seen off the coast <span>,</span> and quite biting jellyfish appear from the second half of July. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Forte dei marmi reviews" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473109.jpg" width="401"></div>  But the most interesting attraction of these beaches is the price.  Free can be found only at a distance of 2-5 km from the city.  Their advantage is almost the same sand and water as on all the others.  The disadvantage is a huge influx of people.  There are so many sunbathers that sometimes there is nowhere to not only lie down, even sit down.  In addition to municipal, beaches of coastal hotels may seem free, of course, for their guests.  Why appear?  Because rest on them is included in the room rate.  Those who are not lucky to check into a hotel on the 1st line are waiting for the elite paid beaches of the resort.  A place in the form of a sunbed and umbrella under the gentle Italian sun costs up to 100 euros per day.  A canopy with the same sunbeds plus a table and a changing cabinet costs from 300 euros per day.  A feature of all paid and free beaches is Negroes who constantly impose their goods.  Only on a <span>nudist beach,</span> which has the beautiful name of Santa Maria, with this better.  This beach, even in Forte dei Marmi, is considered too elite.  He regularly receives the Blue Flag for cleanliness, is well equipped, but not everyone is allowed there, that is, there is a scrupulous face pass there.

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Many parts of Italy boast interesting historical values.  Tourists are always attracted by Rome, Milan, Pisa, Florence.  Forte dei Marmi also has something to show.  It dates back to 1516, when a pier was built to send the marble mined in the area.  Frequent raids by pirates complicated the conduct of ‚Äúmarble business‚Äù, until in 1788, Prince Leopold built a defensive fortress called Forte dei Marmi, which means ‚Äúmarble‚Äù.  This material was extremely in demand, so the matter developed, and a town gradually grew around the fort.  These places, impressive in their extraordinary beauty, have been looked after by the Italian nobility.  Here they began to build chic villas for a rural holiday.  This continued until the Soviet perestroika, after which there were very wealthy Russians who began to develop this resort and actively buy real estate here.  Gradually, this place became elite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The beaches of Forte dei Marmi" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/473105.jpg" width="374"></div>
