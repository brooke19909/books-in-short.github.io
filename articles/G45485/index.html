Republic of Sakha (Yakutia): cities and areas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of <span>Sakha (Yakutia)</span> is a <span>constituent entity of the Russian Federation</span> leading in terms of the area occupied.  Moreover, many Russians about this region and the people living there have only a vague idea, which has developed on the basis of long-outdated data.  Therefore, it makes sense to learn a little more about what the capital of Yakutia - Yakutsk represents, what is the history of this city and what other large settlements are on the territory of this republic. </p><h2>  Basic information </h2><p>  The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), or, as it was called then, the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, was formed in the first years after the establishment of Soviet power in the region.  It is the largest administrative-territorial unit, but in terms of population density it occupies one of the last places in the Russian Federation.  Moreover, its land is incredibly rich in natural resources, which, if used correctly, can become a source of a real breakthrough in the economy of the republic. </p>
