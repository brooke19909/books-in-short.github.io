  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Vladimir: photo with description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Vladimir is one of the points of the Golden Ring of Russia, a green and bright settlement.  Located on the banks of the river Klyazma, in a place where beautiful forests interspersed with lowlands with swamps and treeless hills.  Such a landscape forms a unique climate in the city.  Most of the year there are clouds in the sky, and clear days last no more than a third of the year.  The temperature drop over the year is impressive: ‚Äì40 ... + 40 ¬∞ . </p><p>  Vladimir is the oldest city in Russia, he appeared even before Moscow.  According to one version, it was founded by Vladimir Svyatoslavovich - the baptist of Russia - in 990.  According to another, Vladimir Monomakh was the founder, and he laid the city in 1108. </p><p>  Today, the city is a Mecca for history buffs and connoisseurs of ancient architecture.  After all, Vladimir is famous for its sights, and not only within our homeland. </p><h2>  Golden Gate </h2><p>  This is the pearl of not only the Golden Ring, but of the whole of Russia.  As early as the XII century, it was the main entrance to the central part of the settlement, through which the prince entered with his retinue.  Once the gates were oak with gilded plates. </p><p>  Locals and guides tell one legend.  Under the rule of Andrei Bogolyubov, the gates fell and crushed several people.  With prayers, the prince ordered them to be lifted.  As a result, the Almighty heard the prayers of Andrew, and all the victims stood up, completely unhurt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="book33.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Golden Gate" class="if uuid-2348189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348189.jpg"></div><p>  Over the centuries of existence, the arch and the gates themselves were destroyed, burned down, and each time they were restored.  In the XVIII century, for the convenience of the entry of the crew of Catherine II, a more convenient passage was made and a church was erected above the gate.  Now it has a Museum of weapons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Golden Gate is located at 1a Bolshaya Moskovskaya Street. </p><h2>  Water tower </h2><p>  <span>This attraction</span> of Vladimir is not so ancient, it was built only in 1912.  By 1950, the tower ceased to fulfill its functions.  In 1975, a museum was opened in it dedicated to the history of the old city. </p><p>  A red brick building was erected according to the project of Zharov S. in a pseudo-Gothic style.  Upstairs there is an observation deck with a beautiful view of the city and the sights of Vladimir.  The photos taken from the top of the tower are magnificent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turizm.sputnik.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water tower" class="if uuid-2348475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348475.jpg"></div><p>  The tower is located at: Kozlov stub, 14. </p><h2>  Dmitrievsky Cathedral </h2><p>  This small cross-domed shrine was erected in the XII century by Prince Vsevolod.  Outwardly, it is very similar to the <span>Church of the Intercession on the Nerl.</span>  To this day, pilgrims come here.  This is not to say that the temple has an impressive interior, but there are several unique frescoes and bas-reliefs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitrievsky Cathedral" class="if uuid-2348204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348204.jpg"></div><p>  The cathedral often suffered from fires and enemy attacks, but it was constantly restored.  Inside there is a temple, there is an exposition. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The temple is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya, 60. </p><h2>  Vladimir-Suzdal Museum-Reserve </h2><p>  This attraction of Vladimir is a whole complex of architectural and artistic values.  The most valuable exhibits include the numismatic collection and the most valuable works of painting and ancient Russian art. </p><p>  The museum was founded in 1854 on the initiative of the historian Tikhonravov K. N. Initially, the collection was formed by the efforts of enthusiasts and was located in the provincial gymnasium.  Today it is already 56 architectural monuments of the XII-XVIII centuries and 35 expositions located in 3 cities of the region. </p><p>  You can get acquainted with a number of museum exhibits at 58 Bolshaya Moskovskaya. </p><h2>  Bolshaya Moskovskaya street </h2><p>  Are you here passing through and do not know what to see in one day?  There are so many sights of Vladimir that it is just right to get confused.  However, there is no need to panic.  Go to Bolshaya Moskovskaya - this is the oldest street of the city, a description of which is found in the annals of the XVII century.  It has always housed the most important institutions for the city: the government, Gostiny Dvor, churches and, of course, the Golden Gate. </p><p>  Today, the street is represented mainly by stone buildings of the XVIII-XIX centuries.  And once there were even wooden houses here, but when the first development plan appeared, in 1781, everyone who could not build a stone house sold the land to wealthier citizens.  The walls of many houses "remember" the great Russian classics: Pushkin A. S., Herzen A. I., Chernyshevsky N. G. </p><h2>  Theotokos Nativity Monastery </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest attractions in Vladimir.  Description and photos of the monastery are found in many advertising booklets on tours to this city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kul-victoria.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Theotokos Nativity Monastery" class="if uuid-2348523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348523.jpg"></div><p>  The temple was founded in the period from 1191 to 1192.  It is from here that the Lavrentievsky Chronicle hails. </p><p>  The Mother of God-Nativity Monastery is a whole complex where you can see the <span>cathedral, churches, a</span> bell tower, monastery buildings and official cells, that is, you can walk here all day.  The monastery is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya street, 68. You can climb up here from the station square if you move towards the historical part of the city.  The buildings of the monastery are visible very well, so it is impossible to get lost. </p><h2>  Patriarchal Garden </h2><p>  This attraction of Vladimir is located on the southern slope, almost in the center of the ancient part of the village.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden is 4 hectares, there are huge differences in height, up to 33 meters.  The unique microclimate and landscape made it possible to grow a huge collection of vegetation here. </p><p>  It is believed that the garden was laid by Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky in the XII century.  The main pride is cherry groves.  There is an opinion that the prince brought cherries from Kiev, hence the tradition appeared to grow these trees in Vladimir.  In the old letters of travelers it is mentioned that in the Patriarchal Garden there was a peculiar protection of the fruits of cherry trees from birds.  There were several towers between which ropes were stretched with rags and objects that rattled.  If there was no wind, the watchman manually pulled the ropes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vladimirgid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Patriarchal Garden" class="if uuid-2348193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348193.jpg"></div><p>  In the garden, exotic species of plants have never been grown and never grow, only those that grow well in central Russia.  Now in the park you can see century-old linden trees whose trunks exceed 1 meter in diameter. </p><p>  In 2014, a monument to <span>Vladimir Cherry was</span> erected at the main entrance <span>.</span>  And in 2016 the reconstruction was completed, the paths were updated, a cascade fountain was installed.  The park is located at: Kozlov Val, 5. </p><h2>  Chambers of Public Places </h2><p>  Not far from the Lipki park, another ancient landmark of Vladimir has been preserved - the building of the <span>Public Places.</span>  This is the first construction of the city in the style of classicism, the construction of the building ended in 1790.  Until 1993, government bodies and offices of various companies were located here.  Now it is the Vladimir Chambers Museum Reserve.  Here you can visit the art gallery and the exhibition of children's creativity, arts and crafts.  The complex is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya, 58. </p><h2>  "Vladimir Central" </h2><p>  A photo of this landmark of Vladimir often appears on the covers of musical albums of singers performing songs in the style of chanson, because this is a cult place.  This is one of the most famous and oldest prisons in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vladimir Central" class="if uuid-2348194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348194.jpg"></div><p>  Now you can get here on a tour.  This is a unique opportunity to plunge into the atmosphere of a sensitive facility, to see the graves and the place of execution.  On the territory of the prison there is a monument to the famous prisoner - Frunze M. </p><p>  A sensitive facility was built back in the 18th century, but the prison got its name at the beginning of the last century.  In those days, they contained especially dangerous criminals and terrorists.  And during the period of Stalinist repressions, it was precisely in these walls that a lot of "elements" disagreeable to the government appeared. </p><p>  The central is located on Bolshaya Nizhegorodskaya street, 67. </p><p>  With a great desire to explore all these sights of Vladimir in one day, it is quite possible. </p><h2>  Monuments of the city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Prince Vladimir and St. Fyodor" class="if uuid-2348183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348183.jpg"></div><p>  As in most cities of the world, monuments to those people who were directly related to the development of the settlement were erected in Vladimir.  For ease of perception, we place the material in a table. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Monuments of Vladimir </caption><tbody><tr><td><p>  name of the property </p></td><td><p>  Address </p></td><td><p>  Description and History </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Monument to Prince Vladimir and St. Fyodor </p></td><td><p>  St.  Bolshaya Moskovskaya, 43 </p></td><td><p>  Mounted at a height of 50 meters, the monument proudly rises above the Klyazma River.  This is a bronze monument.  Composition: a statue of a prince on a horse with a banner in his hand, and the figure of a bishop is set nearby.  The silhouettes of the monument are clearly visible from the bridge over the river.  They opened it in 2007 as an argument in favor of the version that the city was founded in 990.  A park area, in particular an observation deck, was landscaped in the district, and now it is a favorite resting place for citizens and visitors </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Monument to Andrei Rublev </p></td><td><p>  Pushkin Park </p></td><td><p>  In contrast to the controversial issue of the date of the founding of the city and its founder, it is precisely established that Rublev painted frescoes in the Assumption Cathedral.  The monument was established in 1995, it is made of bronze.  However, there is still a lot of debate about where the monument looks and what Rublev draws if he faces the Lenin monument and is far enough from the Assumption Cathedral.  There are several plans for the transfer of the monument, but so far they are all on paper. </p><p>  Near the statue of Rublev, rallies and various actions are often held. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Monument to Alexander Nevsky </p></td><td><p>  St.  Bolshaya Moskovskaya St., 64 </p></td><td><p>  Another attraction of Vladimir, located near the Mother of God-Nativity Monastery and near the St. Nicholas Kremlin Church (now the planetarium building).  Earlier, in Soviet times, instead of a huge bronze statue of the prince, a small bust of Nevsky flaunted to his full height.  In 2003, he was transferred to the building of the Law Institute, and a new monument was erected in its place.  Now the site in front of it can be called patriotic, from where search squads are sent and other events are held </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Monument to announcer Yuri Levitan </p></td><td><p>  St.  Announcer Levitan </p></td><td><p>  In 2015, on Radio Day, a monument to Levitan Yuri was inaugurated, because the city of Vladimir is its homeland.  This is the greatest announcer of the Soviet Union, he told the whole country that Gagarin flew into space, and he announced the Victory.  The monument is not simple, but interactive: on the built-in player 10 speaker entries are recorded </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Winter is not the best period for sightseeing in Vladimir, however, there are many museums in the city, so people who visited the village in the cold season do not need to be upset.  Most cultural institutions are managed by the Vladimir-Suzdal Museum-Reserve. </p><h2>  Historical Museum </h2><p>  It is here that you can find out the history of the city from the primeval site ‚ÄúSungir‚Äù.  The museum is located in a red brick building, erected in 1900.  The expositions will tell about the historical milestones of the development of the city, about how he survived the Time of Troubles and the Tatar-Mongol yoke. </p><p>  The museum is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya street, 64, not far from the Mother of God Monastery of the Nativity. </p><h2>  Museum of the Spoon </h2><p>  This is a private museum located on 4 Oktyabrskaya Street, not far from the Northern Trade Rows.

Once the Old Believers prayed here, now the Museum of Crystal and other folk applied art is located in the building.  It was discovered in the 1970s of the last century.  Here you can see crafts made of glass and crystal, engravings, cast figures and lacquer miniatures.  The museum is located on Dvoryanskaya street, 2. </p><h2>  House Museum Stoletov </h2><p>  Describing the sights of Vladimir, you can not ignore this museum.  The exposition is located in the annex to the house-estate of the family of the merchant Stoletov.  Here, the atmosphere of the 19th century is completely restored.  Information is also provided about famous residents of the city who have made an invaluable contribution to the development of Vladimir. </p><p>  The museum is located on Stoletovyh Street, 3, on the opposite side of the Theotokos Nativity Monastery. </p><h2>  Gingerbread Museum </h2><p>  This is a private exhibition dedicated to the history of gingerbread.  In the walls of the museum you can taste the gingerbread cookies made according to ancient recipes, and even paint them yourself.  Master classes and tea parties are held on a regular basis. </p><p>  The museum is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya, 40. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House Museum Stoletov" class="if uuid-2348198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348198.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum-fairy tale "Babusya-Yagusya" </h2><p>  This is an interactive exhibition aimed primarily at children.  There are more than 70 sculptures and dolls in the form of the most popular character in Russian fairy tales - Baba Yaga.  And not simple guides will represent the exhibits, but Koschey the Immortal and Kikimora. </p><p>  The center is located on Bolshaya Moskovskaya 26. </p><h2>  Suzdal </h2><p>  You can come to this city near Vladimir at any time of the year; a trip to it is often included in excursion programs.  It was here that the New Year‚Äôs film "Wizards" was shot.  If you come to the New Year or Christmas holidays, you should definitely look at the central square - there is a fair where you can buy souvenirs that are typical only for this region of Russia.  The most important is mead with different additives, juniper and mint, honey. </p><p>  Tourists have a unique opportunity to ride a horse-drawn sleigh.  And in the district there are buildings of ancient churches and structures.  And all this against the backdrop of picturesque Suzdal hills and a channel of winding, ice-covered Kamenka river. </p><div class="photo" data-original="--." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Suzdal" class="if uuid-2348207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2348207.jpg"></div><h2>  Day trips to the suburbs </h2><p>  From Vladimir you can get to the small suburban settlement of Bogolyubovo.  Buses regularly go from Vladimir to the city in about 20 minutes. </p><p>  What is interesting here?  In the town, on the very bank of the Nerl River, there are stone princely chambers, erected in 1158.  The Holy Bogolyubsky Nunnery, erected in 1174 on the territory of the Bogolyubov Chambers, is very remarkable and interesting.  And of course, the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl, built in 1165 and located among flood meadows, on a hill that was poured by hand, should definitely be included in the list of ‚Äúmast si‚Äù. </p><h2>  What to see in winter </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, it is better to start sightseeing in Vladimir from the Golden Gate.  In the arch, be sure to make a wish and go to the museum above it.  It is small, but tourists say it is very atmospheric.  Then you should walk along Bolshaya Moskovskaya Street in the direction of Frunze Street, where there are many classical buildings erected in the XIX-XX centuries.  Museums and monuments are also concentrated there.  Having left on the Cathedral Square, you can admire the cathedrals erected in the XII century - Dmitrievsky and Uspensky, between which the building of public places is located.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter that it is cold here in winter - this adds a certain charm to the walk.  Well, if you wanted to warm yourself - look at the local cafes or the museums mentioned above. </p><p>  Almost all of Vladimir‚Äôs attractions are located compactly in the historical part of the city, so it‚Äôs convenient to inspect them without wasting time traveling by public or private transport. </p>
