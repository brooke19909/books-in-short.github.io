  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Female anatomy - what are its features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Anatomical <span>differences between a woman and a man</span> appear immediately after birth.  These are external signs by which the sex of the child is determined.  Although the body structure of both sexes has much in common, they differ in their functional capabilities.  <span>The female body</span> is not only physiological in nature, but also has psychological characteristics.  But in this article we will talk about what constitutes the anatomy of the female body. </p><p>  The main and most important function of the female body is the ability to conceive, bear and give birth to children.  This is the main difference between women.  This ability is indicated by a number of anatomical features. </p><p>  In order to successfully fulfill the function of childbearing, a woman must have healthy genitals.  This is the primary anatomical feature.  The development of the female body goes through several stages.  It depends on the proper development and functioning of the genitals and reproductive system.  The first period is 10-12 years from birth.  The body is developing and with it the work of all organs is being established.  The ovaries are not active at this moment. </p><p>  At the end of the first period, the stage of puberty begins, which lasts up to about 20 years.  This is the process of turning a girl into a full-fledged woman.  During this period, the skeleton, body shape changes significantly and some anatomical signs appear.  The formation of mammary glands occurs, the menstrual cycle is being established.  The ovaries begin to fulfill their physiological functions.  The body tunes in and prepares for conception and bearing a child.  Final <span>puberty</span> occurs by 18-20 years.  It was at this time that the woman’s body was fully prepared for the function of procreation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There comes a period of puberty, which lasts an average of 15 to 49 years.  This period is the most favorable for the successful conception, gestation and birth of a healthy child.  Right now, a woman’s ability to reproduce is being determined.  Therefore, to this period of life and development, a woman should approach completely healthy. </p><p>  Then comes the period of sexual wilt, when the function of the ovaries decreases and completely stops.  It lasts about 2-3 years. </p><p>  These are the stages of development of the female body.  But now let's talk about the features that the female body has.  Anatomy suggests a few more signs that are characteristic of a woman. </p><p>  In addition to healthy genitals, well-developed mammary glands are also an anatomical sign.  They form <span>during puberty.</span>  The pelvic bones in a woman are generally wider than in men.  Almost all signs are associated with childbearing function.  The structure of the bones of the pelvis is due to the ability of a woman to have a baby. </p><p>  Another external feature of the female body is rounded hips and a soft stomach.  Such signs are due to the fact that female anatomy suggests the presence of more adipose tissue.  In men, on the contrary, muscle tissue makes up the majority. </p><p>  Female anatomy and all its signs are manifested with the proper production of female sex hormones by the body.  It is this fact that affects the proper development and formation of the woman’s body. </p><p>  The most important difference between the body of a woman and a man is the structure of the reproductive organs.  These are sexual characteristics that are called primary. </p><p>  The uterus is a muscle that is necessary for the development of the fetus.  It increases as the baby grows in the womb.  After birth, the uterus returns to normal. </p><p>  The ovaries produce and promote egg maturation. </p><p>  Also, female anatomy includes the following <span>primary sexual characteristics:</span> vagina, fallopian tubes, vulva and clitoris.  The entire <span>reproductive system of a</span> woman’s body is a single whole and its main task is to continue the human race.  Female anatomy and its features are associated mainly with this function. </p>
