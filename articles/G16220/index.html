  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Funchal (Madeira, Portugal): photos, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Madeira Island is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in Europe, where thousands of travelers come from year to year.  It offers not only a year-round summer climate and beautiful fauna and flora, but is also one of the safest holiday destinations in the world.  The main city of Madeira Island, Funchal, located in its southern part, offers many interesting places to visit and attractions. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="32.6669328" data-lng="-16.924055400000043" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/9/5/5/17955.png"></div><h2>  Capital of Madeira </h2><p>  Funchal is located on the south coast of the main island, adorning the slopes of the Central Massif, which descend to the ocean.  Here you can see the abundant plant life supported by volcanic soil and the eternal spring climate, as well as three lush colored gardens where you can relax and enjoy nature. </p><p>  Two of them can be reached by cable car, which takes tourists to the Monte area.  And to go down the slope, you can choose a faster option, driving through the streets on wicker sleighs.  The city is replete with whitewashed colonial architecture. </p><p>  When Portuguese sailors set foot on Madeira Island in 1419, they were convinced that they had arrived in the Garden of Eden.  Madeira's constantly warm weather and lush volcanic mountains with tropical flowers and gardens attracted European settlers, whose influence spawned much of what the island is now known for: Madeira wine, poncha (a traditional drink made from distilled sugarcane, honey and lemon) and handmade products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funchal city" class="if uuid-3238593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3238593.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the streets of the cosmopolitan city of Portugal (Funchal in Madeira), paved with black and white mosaics, delight tourists with a large promenade and old-fashioned shops, restaurants and cafes located in buildings with terracotta roofs. </p><p>  Although most of the attractions are located off the shingle coast of the Atlantic Ocean, some of the city‚Äôs most significant places are located high above sea level.  You can climb the cable car to the peaks that rise above the harbor to see a bird's eye view of the island, the same paradise above, as below. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  In addition to stunning views, famous cuisine, and relaxing walks, there are an infinite number of activities to choose from for more energetic tourists in Funchal.  This is a walk in Levada and mountain hiking, sailing and watching dolphins and whales, scuba diving and great game fishing, canyoning, surfing and paragliding. </p><h2>  Events &amp; Activities </h2><p>  Funchal hosts many interesting events and activities.  These are fascinating carnivals, a beautiful flower festival, and amazing bright light shows of the Atlantic Festival.  Christmas and New Year holidays, as well as many other parades, cultural and sports events - something always happens here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Attractions Funchal, Madeira </h2><p>  Funchal is the most picturesque and clean capital of Europe.  Today's city is very different from the times of growing dill and pirate days here.  Tourists can leave the winter landscapes of their native country and enjoy a fabulous vacation in a stunning year-round summer resort. </p><p>  Sights of Funchal (Madeira, Portugal) will help to make a choice in favor of relaxation in this part of Europe: </p><ul><li>  Rua Santa Maria.  This attractive cobbled street runs along the corridor of houses with painted doors.  It was one of the first in Funchal and dates back to the 15th century, and is now a destination for shopping and restaurants.  In 2010, the street was hit by floods, and as part of the reconstruction, the city launched the Open Door Art project.  Thus, now elaborate and bright doors, painted with real craftsmanship, enliven the route. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.shorefox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The cathedral. Funchal" class="if uuid-3238596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3238596.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Funchal Cathedral in Madeira.  In the city's cathedral, you can return to the Portuguese age of discovery.  This building was built at the dawn of the 16th century using multi-ton pyroclastic stone quarried in the rocks of Cape Girao in the south-west of the island.  If you look at the roof of the bell tower, you can see that it is covered with classic glazed tiles. </li><li>  Cableway Monte.  One of those inevitable attractions in Funchal in Madeira is the cable car, which takes tourists to the peak of Monte, located at an altitude of 600 meters above sea level.  This gondola lift began operating in 2000 and replaced a non-existent railway that stretched 4 km uphill and was closed in 1943. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.azamaraclubcruises.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funchal Cable Car" class="if uuid-3238599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3238599.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Monastery of Santa Clara.  Another rare look at Madeira XV century.  This monastery was founded by Juan Gon√ßalves da Camara, who was the second major captain of Funchal.  During his reign, the Madeira archipelago experienced economic and social development through the sugar trade.  The monastery testifies to these changes, and its history dates back to 1492, when it was a place for daughters of the local nobility.  Santa Clara functioned until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1834. </li><li>  Jesuit College.  Municipal Square (Pra√ßa do Munic√≠pio) with a volcanic fountain is one of the most impressive city scenes in Funchal.  It is surrounded by a city chamber and a striking Jesuit college.  This is a stunning 16th century building with Renaissance and Baroque architecture.  The Jesuits were suppressed in the Portuguese Empire in 1759, so since then the college has performed several different functions: the headquarters of the invading British army, the Portuguese military base, and now the main building of the University of Madeira. </li></ul><h2>  Gardens of Funchal </h2><p>  Regardless of the taste and preferences of tourists, in Funchal in Madeira (you can see the photo of the city in the article), everyone will find something that interests him.  From beautiful parks and gardens with exotic flowers, sea landscapes with a blue ocean and high cliffs to villages in quiet valleys and beautiful mountains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funchal Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-3238595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3238595.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Gardens of Paleira Ferreira.  One of the many benefits of the constant spring weather in Madeira is that such gardens can bloom year-round.  The outstanding Gardens of Paleuro are located on a colonial-style estate.  Broken around a private house, and they planted about 3,000 species of plants from all over the world.  Among the many flower beds and sculptured hedges are the rose garden, the sunken garden, Camellia Avenue, the French Garden, the Women's Garden, and the tea room.  At the end of winter, tourists can enjoy a preliminary overview of the European summer with wisteria, as well as with exotic plants, such as protea, already blooming. </li><li>  Tropical garden Monte Palace.  Another botanical garden passes through 7 hectares of terraces, where exotic plants alternate with waterfalls, and architectural blossoms resemble a Japanese pagoda.  The path through the gardens is adorned with stunning amazing Portuguese azulejo tiles from the 15th and 16th centuries.  And in the Japanese garden there are tiled panels telling about the history of trade between Portugal and Japan.  At the Monte Palace Museum you can see an exhibition of African art on the upper floors, while below is a collection of minerals with 700 pieces collected from the mainland of Portugal, South and North America and Africa. </li><li>  The Botanical Garden of Madeira.  In Monte, you can take the second cable car to the Botanical Garden.  This terminal is a short walk from the top station in Monte.  The second cable car also allows you to take a very scenic trip along the Juan Gomez river valley.  Like most of Funchal, the garden is on a hillside.  Unfortunately, forest fires destroyed orchids in 2016.  But there is something else to discover: picturesque views of tropical and subtropical fruit plantations such as papaya, avocado, coffee and sugarcane, creative topiary and a wide range of succulent plants. </li></ol><h2>  Day trips </h2><p>  In Funchal in Madeira, you can make day trips in search of adventure.  There are companies offering 4x4 car trips and paragliding.  Or you can drive along the scenic road to Curral das Freiras, a village located on the walls of the canyon, or try to walk along the windy cape in San Lorenza at the extreme eastern point of Madeira. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.silversea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funchal city" class="if uuid-3238598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115573/3238598.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, the interior of the island is woven with water channels known as levada, through which water flows from areas with high rainfall to arid agricultural land. </p><p>  Pico do Arieiro, the third highest peak of Madeira, is another easy one-day excursion from Funchal.  Tourists without cars can choose from dozens of companies offering bus or car rides to the top.  In the clear visible all the way to the island of Porto Santo, 50 km to the north. </p>
