    <h2>  City of federal significance </h2><p>  Sevastopol is a white-stone handsome!  Hero City of Russian Glory!  Entire legends are made up of him.  Tens of thousands of people dream of visiting here at least once.  I must say that Sevastopol is really considered a city that is worthy of attention.  It is known for its military history, numerous historical monuments, the sea, the navy, beautiful and picturesque places, cleanliness and spaciousness.  Perhaps this city should be visited, intending to come to the Crimea in September.  Reviews of tourists prove this.  Many argue that Sevastopol in the fall is very special.  The air is just as warm as in summer, only the heat is already falling, and there is no need to hide during the rush hour at home or in a hotel from the sun.  The water temperature also holds - below 20-22 degrees, it does not fall until mid-October.  The city is located in a very favorable climate zone - it is almost always warm here, so tourists come to these places both in summer and in winter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Romance of autumn Sevastopol </h2><p>  Many people buy tours to Crimea in September to this hero city.  And rightly so.  It is so nice to walk along the promenade along the promenade, admiring the passing boats and light waves setting behind the famous Monument to the sunken ships and the low-flying gulls.  Then go up a little higher, to the Bridge of Lovers, where you can see a picturesque view of the embankment and the North side of the city, which can be reached by regular next scheduled boat.  And then go to the wooden pier of the famous Count's Quay, located very close to the embankment - next to Nakhimov Square.  Then take a walk along the squares strewn with golden leaves.  And this is only the center of the city!  You can also visit the ancient Chersonesos - a small piece of Greece in a picturesque hero city.  Or go to Sevastopol Marseille - to Balaclava, an area saturated with the spirit of sailors and the smell of fresh fish, and stopping at some theme restaurant, admiring the yachts swaying on the waves and a picturesque bay.  In general, it is worth going to Sevastopol if you want to visit the Crimea in September.  The reviews of numerous tourists only confirm this advice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Trip to Yalta </h2><p>  This small sunny city on the southern coast of the peninsula is rightly considered its pearl.  Many people come here, wanting to see the Crimea in September.  Reviews show that Yalta is an expensive city, but picturesque.  Exotic palm trees, many cafes, hotels and restaurants, quiet parks, various excursions, amazing flora and fauna - thanks to all this, spending time here in the fall is not only interesting, but also much more comfortable and pleasant than in the hot summer.  Arriving in Big Yalta, you should definitely visit the Swallow's Nest, Vorontsov and Livadia palaces, climb Mount Ai-Petri to enjoy unbelievably beautiful views and go to the Massandra Crimean wine factory, which is one of the largest, oldest and most famous in the world the world!  Moreover, if we talk about such a moment as the temperature of the water in the Crimea in September, then Yalta wins - here it remains warm for a very long time, until the end of October. </p>

    <h2>  Simeiz </h2><p>  This is a small urban-type settlement in the Big Yalta region.  Arriving here once, I want to visit this place again.  In autumn, there is magnificent fresh air, giving off spices of conifers, and excellent water temperature.  In Crimea in September you can relax here fully.  In addition, this place has low prices!  Some of the most enjoyable on the entire peninsula.  You can stay in a comfortable house with all amenities (such as a kitchen, bathroom, private courtyard, etc.) within 10 minutes walk from the sea for only 800-1000 rubles per day.  And this is for two!  And the products here are not very expensive.  Plus everything is within walking distance.  Simeiz is a small, secluded, quiet town, so it is ideal for people who are tired of the hustle and bustle and want to retire somewhere in a picturesque place near the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Kerch </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest cities on the peninsula.  It was founded back in 530 BC.  So it’s immediately clear - the place is ideal for lovers of historical attractions.  And there are really a lot of them.  So people who want a cultural enlightenment do not think long about where <span>to rest in Crimea in September.</span>  In addition, any visitor who decides to go on a trip by bus or car gets to Kerch (after all, the peninsula can be reached this way only through the Kerch ferry).  And what is the sea in this place?  In Crimea, in September, to complete (or open) the swimming season, you can stop either on the South Bank (Sevastopol, Simeiz, Yalta, Koreiz, Alushta, Alupka), or in Kerch.  The climate here is temperate continental, a bit close to subtropical, so winters are mild, and all other seasons are warm, summers are even sultry.  So, deciding to go to Kerch, you should not stock up on warm things - except perhaps a lightweight sweatshirt for the evening. </p><h2>  Violet tape </h2><p>  This is also one of those places that Crimea is famous for.  The private sector (September is no exception) is cheaper than in the summer.  As a matter of fact, there are no apartment buildings on Fiolent.  Only private.  This is a place where you can admire the untouched nature, long hills, the open sea with incredibly clear water.  Located Fiolent in the <span>area of ​​Sevastopol.</span>  This is a small wild piece of paradise in a modern city.  It is worth coming here in the fall, at least for the sake of picturesque panoramic views, which are no worse than in the famous and popular European resorts. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go is not worth it </h2><p>  Crimea, of course, is a wonderful place, but there are places on the peninsula where you should not go.  For example, Simferopol.  It may be the capital of the region, but this city is not intended for a pleasant pastime.  As a matter of fact, for the sake of tourism, no one goes here.  This, so to speak, is a transit point - its people drive by cars, buses or land at the airport, after which they leave for their vacation spot.  No wonder Simferopol is called one of <span>the dirtiest cities in Russia.</span>  And besides, in this place there is simply nothing to watch.  The cities that are worth going round by going to the Crimea also include Dzhankoy, <span>Stary Krym,</span> Belogorsk, etc.  In general, it is preferable to go either to Kerch or to the <span>South Coast of Crimea</span> (South Coast).  There, it will definitely turn out to rest for the glory and leave with a pleasant experience. </p>
