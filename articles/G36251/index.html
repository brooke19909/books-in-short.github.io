Thirteen years later, plots of land were bought from Lake Kaban, which were intended to create a botanical garden.  It was planned that its area will be 6.7 hectares.  Five years later, a greenhouse was built, and the new botanical garden was open to visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan zoological garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430632.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In early November 1925, a very small zoo opened in the garden, which is located in the courtyard of the Central Museum.  To combine it with the Botanical Garden at the Museum of Tatarstan was decided in 1931.  The new institution was called a zoobotanical garden. </p><h2>  Kazan Zoobotanical Garden (Russia): description </h2><p>  Today, the unique garden has a huge collection, which has about one hundred and fifty species of animals (more than 1200 copies).  Of these, twenty-seven are listed in the Red Book.  Kazan zoobotanical garden was created to preserve the gene pool of fauna and flora, the species diversity of this territory.  This is a nursery where rare species of plants and animals multiply. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The collection of the botanical department of the park has five hundred species and cultivars of closed, as well as two hundred and three open ground.  The Kazan Zoological Botanical Garden, reviews of which are submitted by visitors from different regions of our country, works closely with fifty zoos and corresponds with thirty botanical gardens of the Far and Near Abroad, is a part of the Association of Botanical Gardens of the Volga and Urals of the Russian Academy of Sciences, collaborates with BGCI - International Organization of Botanical Gardens . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kazan zoological garden reviews" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  The staff of the zoo-botanical garden are highly professional specialists who conduct scientific research, participate in seminars and conferences, publish articles in various international directories.  They develop and implement the latest reproductive technologies aimed at the conservation of protected animal species. </p><p>  Zoobotanical garden successfully propagates rare species of plants and animals.  Together with the <span>Central Forest Reserve</span> in the garden, scientific work is being carried out to return brown cubs that were born in captivity to natural conditions.  This work in the world has no analogues.  From 1979 to 1996, fifteen white cubs were born in the zobotanical garden.  Twelve of them are grown - this is a very high rate for young animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews of the Kazan zoological garden" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430630.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The events held as part of international environmental events are very popular: competitions of crafts, drawings, brain ring for high school students, etc. </p><h2>  Breeding birds </h2><p>  Kazan zoobotanical garden takes an active part in international programs aimed at the conservation of four species of rare birds: </p><ul><li>  burial eagle; </li><li>  white-tailed eagle; </li><li>  black vulture; </li><li>  Steller's sea eagle. </li></ul><p>  Serious work is underway to conserve and raise birds of prey, along with the Volzhsko-Kamsky nature reserve, the latest techniques for the conservation of rare and sometimes endangered species are being developed.  We study the breeding of birds of prey in captivity.  In 1991, the first offspring of burial eagles was obtained.  This event was the second event in the world after a zoo in the Polish city of Poznan.  In collaboration with the landscaping department of the Kazan administration, birds settle on lakes in the suburbs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan zoological garden work schedule" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1433388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lukomorye </h2><p>  In the summer, a contact zoo for the youngest visitors begins to work in the garden, which is stylized as a village courtyard.  Here you can not only look at animals from afar, but also get to know them more closely: in this park you are allowed to feed, pet, play with animals. </p><h2>  Rehabilitation center </h2><p>  One of the oldest in Europe is the Kazan Zoobotanical Garden (Russia).  Kazan, or rather, its residents are proud of this institution, and the city administration assists in its further development.  Currently, work is underway to resume the very important activities of the MutopONIManiya center.  An indoor playpen has already been purchased, where hippotherapy classes will be held with children with disabilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan zoological garden prices" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430637.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Awards </h2><p>  For carrying out one of the environmental protection measures that were announced by EAZA, the Kazan zoobotanical garden was awarded the highest award in Belgium (Antwerp): a gold diploma for creating an original innovative educational program. </p><h2>  Zoo services </h2><p>  Kazan Zoo Botanical Garden offers visitors and residents of the city a variety of services.  Among them: </p><ol><li>  A visiting group of animals, which includes Angora and <span>lop-eared rabbits, a</span> fox and a raccoon, a peacock and a ferret, a pheasant and a guinea fowl, an iguana and a peacock dove, a tiger python and a Eublefar, a toad aha and a <span>corn snake,</span> various turtles. </li><li>  Show animals and a story about them for preschoolers and primary school students "Animals - the heroes of fairy tales." </li><li>  Conducts regular excursions Kazan Zoological Botanical Garden.  The prices are quite affordable: for a group of children from fifteen people a ticket costs 50 rubles for each child, two adult accompanying people attend the garden for free. </li><li>  In the park you can ride a pony or horse. </li><li>  Children's parties and entertainment programs are organized and held. </li><li>  The Kazan Zoo Botanical Garden holds the game "Intelligence at the Zoo" for schoolchildren.  The group of guys is divided into two teams.  Each of them receives maps of the zoo and certain tasks: find the animal according to the description and answer the question about it.  The team, which turned out to be stronger than the opponent, is awarded prizes and diplomas. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan zoological garden Russia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1430635.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Visiting Rules </h2><p>  As in any institution, in the Kazan zoological garden there are rules for visiting.  They are few, and they are quite simple.  In the park it is forbidden: </p><ul><li>  feed animals; </li><li>  throw foreign objects into the cells; </li><li>  climb over fences and barriers; </li><li>  hunting and photo hunting. </li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the zoological garden from <span>Kazan</span> Railway <span>Station</span> by buses No. 5, 68. They will take you to the stop called ‚ÄúHadi-Taktash Street‚Äù.  From the river port and bus station, you can use bus number 27, which will take you to the same stop or bus number 85 to the stop "Pavlyukhina Street".  You will spend no more than twenty minutes on the road. </p><p>  But the fastest way is to get into the garden using the subway.  You need to get off at the ‚ÄúSukonnaya Sloboda‚Äù station (the nearest to the Pavlyukhina Street stop). </p><h2>  Kazan Zoo Botanical Garden: opening hours and ticket prices </h2><p>  From April 1 to April 30, the garden awaits guests daily from 8:30 to 18:00.  Ticket offices close one hour before closing.  From September 1 to September 15, the garden begins its work at 8:30 and ends at 19.00.  From October 1, the park is open daily from 8:30 to 17:00. </p><p>  For adult visitors (from 14 years old) an entrance ticket costs two hundred rubles, for pensioners - sixty rubles, for children over two years old - one hundred rubles. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  Most often, visitors leave positive reviews about the Kazan Zoological Botanical Garden.  Guests enjoy the large and clean park area, which has seating areas and cozy cafes.  There are many rare plants and animals in the reserve that look well-fed and contented in their rather spacious enclosures.  Children are delighted after visiting the contact zoo, where aviaries do not interfere with their communication with animals. </p><p>  However, there are comments addressed to the garden administration.  Most visitors believe that it needs major repairs.  In addition, many consider the lack of sports and viewing platforms and the ability to rent sports equipment a drawback of this park.  In fairness, I would like to emphasize that this is not a park of culture and rest, therefore, initially no sports facilities were planned in it. </p>
