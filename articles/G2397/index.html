And this popularity is easily explained.  First of all, ICQ gives its owner a great opportunity to use the Internet messenger without a computer or laptop.  Let's find out how to install ICQ on a Chinese phone or any other, to chat with friends, acquaintances and colleagues online. </p><p>  Below is a detailed and very convenient step-by-step instruction. </p><p>  Step 1. How to install ICQ on your phone: configure the Internet </p><p>  In order to get mobile Internet settings on your phone, call your mobile operator or find out on its official website.  As a rule, the operator will immediately send you Wap-Internet, MMS, GPRS-Internet settings in the message.  Choose the latter and configure your mobile device for this particular work profile. </p><p>  Step 2. How to install ICQ on the phone: get UIN'om </p><p>  By the way, you still need a PC with an Internet connection in order to get a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù number (UIN).  If you don‚Äôt have a computer, ask one of your friends to register you.  This is done either on icq.com, or directly through an icic client (if the user already has his ICQ on the computer).  Do not forget to come up with a nickname and fill in the fields with additional information. </p><p>  Step 3. How to install ICQ on the phone: download ICQ </p><p>  To do this, select one of the most versatile clients - jimm or ICQ mip.  By the way, the latter is suitable even for the most non-standard phones.  Downloading can be done directly from the corresponding site to a mobile phone, or through a laptop or computer.  In the first case, you go to the website of the developer of this application through a mobile web browser, find the "Download" link and click on it.  If necessary, indicate the model of your mobile phone and other parameters.  Usually you are prompted to download jad and jar files.  If your mobile device is a new model, then you only need the jar file. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the second case, you need to connect the mobile phone to the computer using a usb cord (as a rule, it is supplied when you buy a phone).  Wait until the system completely detects the new device (this will be indicated by a short characteristic sound).  If necessary, then automatically install all the drivers that are responsible for the mobile (in this case, as a removable device).  Using Explorer, open the phone folder.  In another window, open the folder in which you saved the files of the application for the phone.  Having selected them and having clicked the right mouse button, select "Copy".  After that, open the folder of the mobile device intended for applications, right-click again and select ‚ÄúPaste‚Äù.  Wait until the copying process is complete. </p><p>  After you managed to install ICQ on your phone, open the file you just downloaded.  The application will either open immediately or the installation process will begin - it depends on what model of phone you have. </p><p>  However, you should be aware that not all mobile phones support this method of installing various kinds of applications.  In this case, in order to install ICQ, you will first need to run a special program that is designed to synchronize the phone and PC.  As a rule, it is located on the CD-ROM that came with the mobile phone.  If you lost a disk or purchased a used phone, the application can be downloaded from the official network resource of the manufacturer of your phone. </p><p>  Now you know how to install ICQ on your phone, and you can always stay in touch with your friends. </p>
