    <p>  Surely Charlene Wittstock, like all girls, dreamed of a prince on a white horse in childhood.  And then her dream came true.  Today she is the Princess of Monaco.  Charlene did not have the honor of being born into a high-born family, but fate decreed that she became the princess of one of the richest states in the world. </p><p>  <strong>Biography</strong> </p><p>  Charlene, Princess of Monaco, was born on the African continent in Zimbabwe in 1978.  Her parents came from Europe and professed the Catholic religion.  Father Michael C. Wittstock was a manager at a computer company, and his mother Lynette Wittstock was a swimming instructor.  As soon as her daughter began to walk, her mother taught her to swim and studied with her for a long time.  By the age of 18, the girl already had many sports awards.  By this time, their family moved to live in South Africa, and Charlene won the title of champion of the country in swimming.  Four years later, she participated in the national team of her country at the Olympics in Sydney, but without any special results (5th place).  In 2000, during the competition in Monaco, she met the heir to the throne, Prince Albert, and in 2002, Charlene became the world champion in swimming.  The second meeting with Albert, who by that time had already become Prince of Monaco, took place in 2006, at the opening of the Olympic Games in Italy.  Four years later, they officially announced their engagement.  The following year, Charlene lived in Monaco.  She took up the study of the French language and even the Monaco dialect.  The best etiquette instructors honed the manners of the future princess.  After all, she was to become the first person in the principality, receive royal persons from all over the world in her palace, appear at many social events, etc.  A year after the engagement, the future Princess of Monaco Charlene, along with Prince Albert of the Grimaldi clan, appeared at the wedding ceremony of the British Crown Prince William and Kate Middleton.  Two months passed, and again the wedding.  This time the whole aristocratic world gathered at a wedding in Monaco. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Matrimony</strong> </p><p>  On the day of the wedding, the future eleventh Princess of Monaco Charlene at 33 years old looked like a real princess: elegant, seasoned and charming.  Many compared her to Grace Kelly, her late mother-in-law, Albert's mother.  Nevertheless, the most observant audience could notice that the beautiful princess of Monaco Charlene (photos are presented in the article) was somewhat depressed and did not look happy at all.  The fact is that her newly-made husband, who is also 20 years older than her, is very loving in nature. </p>

    <p>  Over the years of his bachelor life, he managed to courting such secular lionesses as Brooks Shield, <span>Claudia Slate</span> and others. In addition, he is the father of two illegitimate children, who were subsequently adopted by him.  But that's nothing: right before the wedding, he had a third child, whose mother demanded that the prince be tested for DNA.  Having learned about this detail from the life of the groom, the future Princess of Monaco Charlene tried to escape from under the crown.  However, for the sake of decency and in order not to discredit the name of the Grimaldi clan before the whole world, she returned and with a heavy heart went down the aisle. </p>

Nevertheless, the prince and princess constantly publicly declare their love to each other, and Charlene tells the press about his dream - to give birth to the prince heir.  However, for two and a half years she has not been able to become pregnant, and this may cause a breakdown in their relationship.
