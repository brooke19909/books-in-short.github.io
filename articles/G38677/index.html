    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the device </h2><p>  So, we examined the main features of the ASUS ZenFone Max device.  What can be highlighted the most strengths and weaknesses of the device, if based on reviews about it? </p><p>  The indisputable advantages of the phone include, first of all: </p><p>  - a powerful battery; </p><p>  - high-performance processor and graphics module; </p><p>  - high-quality design and excellent assembly; </p><p>  - ease of management; </p><p>  - the presence of a proprietary software shell; </p><p>  - support of the main required communication standards; </p><p>  - support for additional memory cards of 64 GB; </p><p>  - the presence of technological cameras. </p><p>  If we consider the disadvantages of the device, then these can be attributed, for example: </p><p>  - not the latest version of the operating system - the phone is controlled by Android OS in version 5.0, while, for example, in ZenFone 3 Max there is Android 6.0; </p><p>  - Not the most outstanding amount of built-in flash memory - an additional card, most likely, will have to be purchased. </p><p>  Nevertheless, even under Android 5.0, the device in question looks like a fairly powerful multimedia tool, and 16 GB of RAM is an indicator that generally corresponds to what characterizes competing models in the price segment to which the phone belongs. </p><h2>  Device cost </h2><p>  Actually, how much does the ZenFone Max cost?  The price of the device in the catalogs of modern Russian retailers is about 14 thousand rubles.  Thus, the device can be attributed to the budget, but this segment borders on middle-class devices.  Given the competitive advantages that ZenFone Max has, the price of the device is quite adequate. </p><p>  At the disposal of the user is a high-performance and technological device that allows you to solve a wide range of tasks, launch games, create multimedia content, and also exchange data using various communication tools.  You will also probably have to spend money on a good case for ASUS ZenFone Max, but using such devices is stylish, and this is no less significant aspect than the application of the technological advantages of the device. </p>
