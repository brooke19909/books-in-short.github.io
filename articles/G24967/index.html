    <p>  Sberbank cards are very popular among the population.  This is due primarily to a large number of branches and the largest ATM network in Russia.  Thanks to this, it is very easy to draw up a Mastercard or Visa card.  Sberbank can be found in almost any locality. </p><p>  Sberbank produces plastic cards of various payment systems.  But <span>Visa and MasterCard</span> are traditionally the most popular in Russia <span>.</span>  With cards of other systems is somewhat more complicated.  Not all outlets will be able to accept payment on them.  But even among the two main systems, users often prefer Visa cards. </p><h2>  Types of Visa Cards </h2><p>  Sberbank issues cards of the Visa payment system in a variety of formats, from the simplest issued immediately at the time of contact to premium.  Each of them has an affordable set of services and privileges, as well as the cost of maintenance.  For example <span>, Sberbank</span> will take 750 rubles in the first year and 450 in the rest for the service <span>"Visa Classic"</span> , and service of a card from the Gold series will cost 3000 already. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  All cards, with the exception of the simplest ones, make it possible to use discounts from payment systems.  Additionally, Sberbank offers holders of personalized cards, such as Visa Gold, the option of withdrawing money on standard terms at its subsidiary banks located in Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey and other countries. </p><p>  There is also the opportunity to issue cards with bonuses.  The holder of such a Visa card, Sberbank will additionally accrue special points that can be spent with partners, for example, when paying for air tickets or spent on charity, depending on the chosen program. </p><h2>  Credit and Debit Cards </h2><p>  Sberbank divides all Visa cards into two categories: debit and credit.  The former allows you to conveniently use your own money to pay for goods, while the latter enables the client to use the bank‚Äôs money on credit. </p>

    <p>  A nice feature of Sberbank's Visa credit cards is the availability of a grace period.  Within it, you can use the money of the bank and not even pay interest on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes stocks are held at a credit institution, within the framework of which some cards, for example, Visa Gold, are issued by Sberbank without a commission for annual servicing. </p><h2>  Instant cards </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to cards issued immediately upon a client‚Äôs request, one of them is a <span>Visa Electron</span> Momentum card.  Sberbank does not charge a fee for servicing and issuing a plastic card.  But it opens up not only the opportunity to use money with great convenience, but also access to Sberbank Online, which allows you to comfortably pay for necessary services such as utility bills, the Internet, and so on. </p><h2>  Card design </h2><p>  Sberbank offers to receive a debit card "Visa" from the age of 18, and only a passport is required to apply for it.  With credit cards, it‚Äôs a little more complicated, they are issued only from the age of 21, and a salary certificate for the last 6 months will be a requirement. </p><p>  You can apply for a card in any department.  To do this, you need to contact any specialist, draw up the necessary statement and sign the paper.  After that, if a bank has ordered a credit card or simply a registered card, it will consider the application and inform about its decision.  However, this usually does not take more than 2 days. </p><p>  It is worth noting that only the cards of the "Momentum" series will be issued immediately, all the rest will have to wait a few days until they are made and delivered to the desired branch. </p>

    <p>  Salary clients often receive <span>special offers</span> from Sberbank and they do not have to pay for the annual servicing of their cards.  Also, they may not provide a certificate of employment.  All the necessary information for registration is already in Sberbank. </p><h2>  Card replenishment </h2><p>  Sberbank always offers convenient ways to deposit funds to the card.  To do this, use one of the following methods: </p><ul><li>  In the department.  You can replenish the card in any office, which is easy to find throughout Russia.  For the operation, it is enough to know the card number and have a passport with you. </li><li>  At the ATM.  If you have a card, you can replenish it very simply in any Sberbank self-service device with the function of receiving cash. </li><li>  By cashless payment.  It is easiest to transfer money from another credit institution to the card in this way.  Details can be found in "Sberbank Online" and check with bank operators. </li><li>  By translation.  Another of the most useful ‚Äúchips‚Äù of Sberbank cards is the ability to quickly transfer money to them from another card.  To do this, the sender needs to know only the card number, and in some cases you can do just the phone number of the recipient. </li></ul><p>  Card products are becoming increasingly popular among the population.  Due to the fact that Sberbank offers many convenient ways to replenish and additional services, as well as high stability, its choice by many customers is justified. </p>
