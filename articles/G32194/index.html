    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Royal Park 4 * is in a very good location.  Firstly, it is quiet and calm, and the beach is literally a minute's walk from the hotel.

And its main ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù is the huge sandy beach, which extends over 10 kilometers. </p><p>  The airport is 50 km from the resort.  Burgas, by the way, is the fourth largest city in the country. </p><p>  Particularly pleased is the well-groomed area near the hotel.  And well-developed infrastructure.  There is everything that a tourist needs - small shops with bathing accessories, sports equipment, juices, drinks, food, products and much more.  There are also wine markets, souvenir stalls and a tour desk.  And all within walking distance. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  Royal <span>Park 4 *</span> is an all-inclusive hotel.  That is, a person who decides to move into this complex automatically gets the opportunity to come for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the main restaurant of the hotel.  He can also eat unlimited hot and cold snacks, fruits, cookies, ice cream and much more.  Naturally, coffee, tea, soft drinks and strong drinks are also offered here.  True, there is one caveat.  If a person wants a foreign drink, you will have to pay for it.  Local alcohol is free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Royal Park 4 * main restaurant is designed for 480 visitors.  But, in addition to this institution, the hotel also has an Irish pub, as well as a lobby bar.  Mezzanine serves light snacks and drinks.

    <h2>  Junior Suite </h2><p>  This is the next category of apartments that Royal Park 4 * hotel can offer.  Their area is much larger than the previously mentioned rooms - 42 square meters.  There are two large single beds inside, and there is also a spacious furnished balcony with garden views.  Under the terms, everything is the same.  Only a TV with satellite channels.  The price of such apartments will be approximately 45,000 rubles for three people per week. </p><p>  By the way, a room with a sea view will cost about 5000 rubles more.  And if the landscape opening from the windows really matters, you should immediately indicate this in your reservation.  Since such numbers occupy the fastest. </p><h2>  Family apartments </h2><p>  Many come here in large companies.  Or with children.  Therefore, the Royal Park Hotel 4 * <span>(Bulgaria, Elenite) also</span> offers spacious rooms that can accommodate from four to six guests. </p><p>  These apartments boast an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters.  These rooms have a private entrance, a spacious furnished balcony and satellite TV.  70-80 thousand rubles will cost living.  This is provided if four adults and two children come.  By the way, in this case, only those who are under the age of 12 are eligible for the definition of ‚Äúchildren‚Äù. </p><p>  If you need a sea view, you will have to pay 5-7 thousand rubles more.  By the way, the same apartments will cost the same amount of money, even if four adults are planning to stay in the room, without children. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that it is better to carefully plan your trip and reserve a room in Royal Park 4 * (Bulgaria, Elenite) without the cancellation service included in the price.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Royal Park Elenite 4 * is more suitable for families with children.  So says the vast majority of those people who stayed at this hotel.  Quietly, calmly, all modern entertainments - in the complex.  90% of visitors staying at the hotel constantly relax at sea.  And by the way, those who have something to compare with, argue - in the Elenite is much better than in the nearby Sunny Beach.  It is very crowded and noisy.  And in the midst of the season, the sea becomes dirty, like the beaches. </p><p>  Guests of Royal Park 4 * ("Elenite") separately celebrate evening show performances.  Incendiary parties are held at the beach bar several times a week.  And in the afternoon these are performances related to gymnastics, aerobics, olympiads and sports competitions.  By the way, good playgrounds are especially pleasing.  And entering the sea is comfortable, smooth. </p><p>  The water park is also good, though sometimes it is too windy there.  And it is better to go there in the morning, if you want to enjoy the slides, since closer to noon there are too many people.  By the way, do not spare the time to go to the SPA.  These procedures are quite relaxing and give great pleasure for body and soul. </p><h2>  About service and accommodation </h2><p>  Royal Park 4 * reviews receive mostly positive.  Guests are satisfied with the provided rooms - everything is as shown in the photographs, no unexpected "surprises".  Everything is convenient, cozy, comfortable.  The beds are moderately soft, the furniture is modern. </p><p>  The staff is especially happy.  All are smiling, welcoming, welcoming.  Only two languages ‚Äã‚Äãare known - English and Bulgarian.  But, as the reviews left about Royal Park Elenite 4 * show, many here speak Russian, although this is not stated in most descriptions.  Mostly people from Russia just come here.  Especially now, during the crisis.  The rooms are budget, the sea is - everything you need for a summer vacation. </p><p>  By the way, the cleaning quality is also noted with special attention.  It is done daily, and not bad.  The room is thoroughly vacuumed, dust is wiped everywhere, in the bathroom and indoors they do wet cleaning.  And towels are changed daily.  Bed sheets are covered in two to three days. </p><p>  And the food.  Very tasty and varied.  Especially pleasing is the national Bulgarian cuisine - a lot of fresh, stewed, baked vegetables.  And in a variety of ways - in sour cream, tomato, yogurt, cream.  However, the restaurant has a lot of dishes - everyone will find something to their liking. </p>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Mostly positive leave reviews about Royal Park Elenite 4 *.  But, as elsewhere, you can‚Äôt do without minuses here.  It happens, for example, that on the beach there are not enough sunbeds for all vacationers.  Of course, this is not a minus for everyone - you can spread a towel and lie in the sand.  But for some this nuance is important. </p><p>  Even in the midst of the season, guests can be divided into two groups for lunch - from 12:30 to 13:30, and then from 13:30 to 14:30.  This is because the hotel is budget and, accordingly, in demand.  Sometimes a hotel is crowded, so that no one jostles in a restaurant, people are divided into such groups.  So that no one gets confused, guests are given cards with time.  Some do not like it.  But others are happy - but there are no queues for food. </p><p>  There are still complaints about Wi-Fi.  It is far from high speed.  Nice catch in the lobby bar.  So people whose work is connected with the Internet sphere, which obliges them to be always in touch, should either find another place of rest or take a modem with them. </p><p>  And yet, people who came to the resort with babies are advised to book apartments on 1-2 floors.  Since the elevator wait a long time.  And with a stroller, you can only get to the room on the 2nd floor without problems. </p><h2>  Interesting features </h2><p>  It is worth noting that a train travels around the hotel.  You can sit on it and get to the last hotel - there is a mini-club.  The water park is open from 9:00 to 18:00, but children's carousels are free from six to ten in the evening.  You can ride there as much as you want, not necessarily once.  They are located next to the water park.  By the way, some do not know, but in the morning the water in the pools is cleaner and cooler, like in the sea.  Therefore, lovers of refreshing water treatments should take this into account. </p><p>  Interestingly, guests staying at Royal Park can enjoy free drinks at the bars of any other hotels of this chain.  These are Andalusia, Royal Bay and even local villas.  But restaurants cannot be used.  Only bars. </p><p>  And the guests assure that the bartenders can make absolutely any cocktail - the main thing is to ask them about it. </p><p>  In the center of the hall you can see a beautiful twisted staircase, if you climb it, you can go to the terrace.  There are always few people there, and at 16:00 various sweets are brought there, which many do not realize.  By the way, there is an excellent patisserie on the way to the Royal Bay Hotel.  She works from 10:00 to 22:00. </p>

    <h2>  About booking and check-in </h2><p>  Well, finally, a few words about this topic.  So, check-in at this hotel is from 14:00 until midnight.  Departure is before noon.  But since the reception is open 24/7, guests can be settled earlier.  And evict later.  Only this must be agreed in advance.  So that the staff has time to prepare the room. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that extra beds and cots are not available in the apartment.  But here you can pay with a "Visa" or "Master Card" card. </p><p>  By the way, the issue of booking apartments is better to deal with a few months before arrival.  In season, hotels are often crowded, so you may not have time to reserve a room for yourself. </p>
