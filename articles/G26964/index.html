    <h2>  Origami Art </h2><p>  "The Art of the Whole Leaf" is what origami is called in Japan.  This is the main law of the masters, which they have been following for several centuries.  As you might guess, the art of origami arose when paper appeared.  You understand how it was expensive at that time, that's why paper products in the form of jewelry were used only for religious ceremonies or wedding ceremonies. </p><h2>  Divine origami </h2><p>  And all because the words ‚Äúgod‚Äù and ‚Äúpaper‚Äù in Japanese sound the same.  So people gave such products a religious meaning.  For the first time, paper figures began to be stacked in monasteries - they decorated walls.  They could depict gods, animals, or even seasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nowadays, if we make a fire in nature by using paper, then we are simply trying to achieve a large amount of fire, since the named material burns quickly.  But in ancient Japan, only sacrificial bonfires were lit with paper. </p><h2>  Origami as a way to convey a message </h2><p>  Origami also served as a means of conveying the message.  A skilled craftsman wrote cherished words on a piece of paper and folded a figure, for example, a crane, and only the same skilled craftsman could read them, since an uninitiated person could only break the message. </p><p>  It was not for nothing that we mentioned the crane.  This figure was most often used by masters, because in Japan it was considered a symbol of longevity and happiness, it was called "tsuru".  And so far, for origami masters this is the brightest, most important sign. </p><h2>  Origami's best students are kids </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but the best students of origami art are undoubtedly children.  For them, it is not only interesting, but also useful, because we all know how important it is to develop the fine motor skills of babies.  In addition, origami perfectly develops spatial as well as logical thinking and stimulates the creative activity of the child.  Therefore, very often you can meet such lessons at school and even in kindergarten. </p><p>  Indeed, in the process of folding, the child works with his hands under the control of consciousness.  The development of the eye is due to precise hand movements.  The memory also trains well, as the sequence of work needs to be memorized.  Origami classes perfectly help children get acquainted with the basic <span>geometric shapes.</span>  The aesthetic taste of the child develops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, teachers choose not difficult options, so that children do not get bored.  So our today's lesson will be simple, interesting and moderately <span>difficult.</span>  <span>Origami</span> from paper "book" will be a wonderful souvenir.  Moreover, you can create a mini-library from small books. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an origami book" class="if" height="455" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1176941.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Material preparation </h2><p>  And now about <span>how to make an</span> origami <span>book</span> .  First, we need, of course, paper. </p><ul><li>  Take 2-3 leaflets, depending on how many pages will be in your craft.  For an origami ‚Äúbook‚Äù product, we need A4 white <span>paper</span> . </li><li>  Another A4 sheet is needed for the book cover.  It can be taken in bright colors or, as an option, painted in patterns yourself. </li><li>  In addition, we need scissors to complete just one cut. </li><li>  Good mood and some free time. </li></ul><p>  Let's get started! </p><h2>  Progress: leaflets for a book </h2><p>  How to make an origami book?  We take a sheet of A4 paper and begin to fold it. </p><ol><li>  Make the first fold along the sheet, then turn it around and make four more folds across. </li><li>  Now return the sheet to the position of the first fold, cut with a pair of scissors the resulting line about the size of one square.  Take care not to cut off the excess. </li><li>  Next, you need to put the leaf so that the incision that you made is on top. </li><li>  Then gently fold the sheet so that you get the leaves of the book. </li></ol><p>  You should get the origami blank book.  The diagram below will help you figure it out.  A gray color in it painted over a piece of our future product. </p>
