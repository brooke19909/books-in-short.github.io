But no new product has attracted such attention as a smart watch.  The developers were able to create noise around the gadget, which still has not lost its relevance.  Why do they so attract the average user?  I remember once a wireless headset reached such a level of excitement.  By the way, this feature is also in smart watches.  Let's try to consider one non-brand instance, which is called SmartWatch DZ09.  Reviews about this watch are mostly positive.  But are they so good?  We will check this.  First, a little history. </p><h2>  Smartwatch History </h2><p>  This device was once patented by Apple.  Its engineers struggled for a long time to create a gadget that could pair with a smartphone and display information about a call, a song being played, or something else.  There were the boldest ideas.  They even planned to design such a device in the form of a ring.  But stopped at the clock.  And did not fail.  The first iWatch combined the functions of a fitness tracker, an additional screen for a smartphone and a watch.  The gadget was equipped with a touch screen, GPS-sensor, Bluetooth-adapter and waterproof housing.  But this device had one fat minus (common to all devices from Apple) - an unbelievably high price. </p>

    <p>  Samsung soon pulled herself up.  The Korean giant released something similar to the brainchild of the Yabloko, but with its own signature flavor and at a more adequate price.  Since then, a lot of time has passed.  <span>Smart watches are</span> overgrown with new features and become a universal gadget.  Now the appointment of smart watches is very universal.  They can do a lot and pair well not only with a smartphone.  However, let us consider in more detail a cheap sample from the Middle Kingdom - a smartwatch SmartWatch DZ09.  An overview of this device is better to start with its price.  The cost of watches on AliExpress (for example) does not exceed twenty dollars.  Already not bad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  So, let's start the <span>review of smart watches Smart</span> Watch DZ09.  The first thing you should pay attention to is packaging.  The watch comes to the consumer in a box of quality recycled cardboard.  The packaging lid schematically shows what is inside (the watch).  Having removed the cover, you can see the acquisition itself, which is recessed into a gasket of dense foam.  However, this is not all.  Under the watch and a layer of foam there are several more elements: a user manual (naturally, in Chinese), an adapter for a European plug and a USB cable for connecting to a computer.  A very good delivery kit for the Chinese copy. </p>

    <p>  Some suppliers (this also depends on them) add a protective film to the watch to the screen.  This is quite reasonable when you consider that the gadget is very cheap, and there can be no question of any protective glass such as Gorilla or Asahi Glass.  So the watch will live much longer.  It is also very good from the standpoint that in our Palestinians it is not possible to find a protective film on such a device.  If you haven‚Äôt put a film in the kit, there‚Äôs only one way out: buy a full-size one and cut it yourself.  We do not have special accessories for SmartWatch DZ09.  Owner reviews, however, show that most suppliers are not trying to save on film.  So there is still no time to despair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance and materials </h2><p>  Since this product comes from the Middle Kingdom, it makes no sense to be surprised that the watch painfully resembles the same gadget from Samsung.  Only the Korean giant has better performance and better materials.  But this craft cannot be called frank consumer goods.  The body of the gadget is made of textured metal.  But only its upper part.  Further, everything is made of plastic.  It is practical, but it looks unaesthetic.  But for the rubber strap - special thanks.  It is perfect for any hand.  You can, of course, replace it with any metal, but the view will not be the same. </p><p>  On the front side of the gadget is a screen that takes up almost all the free space.  There is a camera above the screen.  That's just a little sense from her.  And below the screen is the Home button.  Nothing more interesting in the look of SmartWatch DZ09.  The review can be continued.  It's time to go to the technical characteristics of the product.  This question takes many.  What can you get for this price? </p><h2>  Colors </h2><p>  There is not much variety.  Only three colors: black, white and bronze.  But this is a lot, if you recall where the device comes from.  What color to choose?  If you are guided by considerations of practicality, it is better to choose black: it will get less dirty, and scratches are less noticeable.  But the white gadget looks the coolest.  Immediately there are associations with "apple" devices.  This somewhat raises the status of the owner in the eyes of the public.  True, not for long.  Until the first call. </p>

    <p>  The model in <span>bronze</span> looks somehow not very good.  Probably the reason for this is a somewhat clumsy execution of the case.  Therefore, it is not recommended to order a watch in bronze color.  Black and white look much better.  And the visual side also sometimes matters.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how many functions and how powerful.  People primarily value the look.  Especially such a fashion gadget as a watch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU, RAM and memory </h2><p>  What about a smartwatch ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù?  The answer to this question cannot surprise anyone.  What we pay is what we get.  Nevertheless, the SmartWatch DZ09 smart watch, the reviews of which we will analyze a little lower, have on board an MTK processor with a clock frequency of 533 MHz.  For basic tasks this is enough.  However, some brakes and jams may be noticeable.  But this is already the features of the firmware and RAM. </p><p>  By the way, about the RAM.  The device has 128 megabytes of RAM.  For a smartphone, this would not be enough.  But for watches - even a lot.  This amount of RAM helps the gadget work relatively well.  The only bad thing is that memory is not particularly energy efficient.  It greatly affects the battery of the device.  Therefore, at least somehow to extend the battery life will not work.  Alas. </p><p>  The memory available to the user in the device is as much as 64 megabytes.  Just an attraction of unprecedented generosity!  But do not rush to call curses on the head of the manufacturer.  One has only to open the back cover of the gadget and remove the battery, as you can see the slot for a microSD memory card.  The device supports cards up to 32 gigabytes inclusive.  This is already serious. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  SmartWatch DZ09, the review of which we continue, is equipped with a high-quality IPS-screen.  Its diagonal is 1.56 inches.  But the density is very low, so the pixels are perfectly visible without a magnifying glass.  Screen resolution is 240 by 240 pixels.  Not much, of course.  What did you want for that kind of money?  Nevertheless, on this display it is quite possible to comfortably view all the notifications that are sent by the phone.  There is even an on-screen keyboard option in the firmware.  True, it is not clear to whom it will be convenient to poke a finger into microscopic keys.  And on a smartphone, you don‚Äôt always get where you need to.  Nevertheless, such an option is available. </p>

    <p>  In general, the screen is not the strongest characteristic of the <span>Smart Watch</span> DZ09.  The photo is proof of that.  Nevertheless, it is he who is the main component of a smart watch.  Without him, everything would have been much worse.  Complaining that the display is not very high quality is also not worth it.  Say thank you for IPS, not TFT.  For such and such money.  And in general, look for flaws in such a cheap, but fashionable gadget wildly. </p><h2>  Other "stuffing" </h2><p>  Now it's time to move on to the rest of the hardware features that SmartWatch DZ09 is equipped with.  The review is ongoing.  Inside the watch there is also Bluetooth version 3.0, a slot for a SIM card in micro format, a 0.3 megapixel camera, a microphone and a speaker.  Thus, smart watches can be used as a complete means of communication.  Without pairing with a smartphone.  But in this case, the functions of the smart watch will be greatly limited.  It‚Äôs better to use them in tandem with the phone.  There will be much more opportunities. </p><p>  Relatively recently, an updated version of the SmartWatch DZ09 smartwatch has been released.  She received the identifier U8.  In this version of the gadget there are such chips as GPS and a full-fledged heartbeat sensor.  In addition, the new product has an updated processor from Qualcomm and a waterproof housing.  Needless to say, this version of the device is much more expensive than a standard watch. </p><h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  But this is a very interesting topic.  Especially in the case of SmartWatch DZ09.  Overview, the characteristics of iron - this, of course, is good, but in this case, the operating system is important.  If anyone was hoping for something ‚Äúandroid-like‚Äù, then it's better to immediately throw these stupid fantasies out of your head.  The gadget is equipped with some kind of self-made firmware from the manufacturer.  "Android" here does not smell.  But the shell performs its functions.  Receiving and transmitting messages, answering calls, controlling the camera of the smartphone and player, monitoring the state of the heart rate (with the corresponding application on the smartphone) and tracking the location.  All this shell performs.  But the translation is lame.  No, the Russian language itself is quite adequate, but the fonts are very crooked.  However, for such a price you can bear it. </p>

    <p>  By the way, craftsmen have already managed to modify the firmware for this watch, stuff it with all kinds of "goodies" and add alternative dials.  Very good.  But there is one problem: gadgets based on MTK are sewn very tight.  And IMEI often flies after a flashing.  It‚Äôs good that this business is fixable.  However, in the case of this product, there are no problems with the flashing process.  Here they are - smartwatch SmartWatch DZ09.  The new version of U8 is generally sewn without problems.  So in terms of modification, this is a very good gadget. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The gadget has a small lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 380 mAh.  According to the manufacturer, it is able to provide continuous operation of the device for 180 hours in standby mode.  In talk mode, of course, he will not live so much.  The declared time is 3 hours.  Standby time with Bluetooth on - 150 hours.  True, it is not clear how the calculations were made. </p><p>  How do these numbers differ from the real ones?  It was very difficult to measure.  But in the average load mode, that is, normal everyday use, the smart watch lasted two days.  A very good result for a gadget with such a small battery.  It was also taken into account that the device was constantly connected to the smartphone using Bluetooth. </p><h2>  Watch functions </h2><p>  They are very extensive.  But only if a connection is established with the smartphone.  If there is no connection, their functions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  receiving and sending SMS messages; </li><li>  Answers to calls </li><li>  listening to music, viewing photos; </li><li>  informing about time. </li></ul><p>  But it‚Äôs worth connecting a smartphone to them using Bluetooth, as the functionality of the clock increases dramatically.  This is understandable.  The fact is that additional smartwatch applications are installed on the smartphone.  They allow you to work with the gadget using a Bluetooth connection.  I would only like the battery of the device to be somewhat more powerful.  For the modern "Bluetooth" consumes a lot of energy.  So what features will appear on the gadget after connecting to a smartphone?  In addition to those already listed, there are still such possibilities: </p><ul><li>  smartphone player control; </li><li>  display on the screen hours of incoming notifications and calls; </li><li>  location display; </li><li>  heart rate monitoring (using the gadget in the fitness tracker mode); </li><li>  Mobile Search function - search for a smartphone if you forget where you left it; </li><li>  pedometer; </li><li>  Dictaphone; </li><li>  sleep monitor; </li><li>  smartphone camera control; </li><li>  ‚ÄúAnti-lost‚Äù function - sound signals if you are moving away from the device. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the watch‚Äôs functionality expands significantly when interacting with a smartphone.  It is also worth mentioning the watch DZ09 SmartWatch function (reviews of which are slightly lower), with which you can use this option not only to display time.  But it‚Äôs better to understand this yourself.  In general, the watch can be almost fully used without a phone.  But paired with him is still better. </p><h2>  Product Reviews </h2><p>  So we got to the most interesting information about SmartWatch DZ09.  Testimonials are very important because they help to get complete information about the device you plan to buy.  Unfortunately, there are paid reviews that can lead a person into confusion.  But there are very few of them, and they can be easily calculated.  However, in our case, all the reviews are true.  The manufacturer does not make sense to spend money on custom comments.  They should at least beat the money for production. </p>

    <p>  So, many newly made owners of this smart watch signal that the shell interface is incomprehensible.  Comrade owners, explain how you can get lost in three Russified pine trees?  Everything is very clear there.  Some complain about the clumsy execution of the case: they say, gaps, backlashes, the creak of a single button.  But there are few of them.  And here comes the conclusion: they just came across an unsuccessful instance.  Other users have no such problems.  The SmartWatch DZ09 watch we are currently reviewing is very cheap.  And picking at the teeth of an almost gifted horse is a bad manners. </p><p>  But most reviews are positive.  Owners note a quick reaction of the interface, a stable connection with a smartphone, the strength of the case and much more.  These comments are noteworthy, as users write about their personal experience with these smart watches.  Also note the presence of very convenient search functions of the device, an alarm about the remaining charge on the smartphone.  True, not everyone has figured out a pedometer yet.  But this is not so important.  The main thing is that all other functions work as they should. </p><p>  So, focusing on the information received, what can we say about the SmartWatch DZ09.  The reviews paint us through and through a positive picture.  There are, of course, some unpleasant little things, but for the money this is quite normal.  If you take a look at the offers of other manufacturers, you will understand that this device still looks decent and is built with high quality.  Other companies from the Middle Kingdom do not show such zeal to make a quality product.  In the photo, of course, you will not see anything.  You need to compare real prototypes.  Based on this, we can say that against the background of competitors, the optimal choice is SmartWatch DZ09 smartwatch.  The instruction is only in Chinese.  But this is not scary.  Everything is intuitive. </p><p>  Some focus on reviews as a universal measure of quality.  But this is a big mistake.  You need to be guided by your impressions of devices.  To do this, it is very useful to hold a "live" gadget in your own hands.  If your friend has such a watch, ask him to vilify for a day.  Then you can decide exactly whether you need this device or not. </p><h2>  Connect to smartphone and PC </h2><p>  It is very simple to connect the watch to the phone.  Just go to the settings of the device and select the Bluetooth tab.  Before that, do not forget to turn on the transmitter on the watch.  In the settings of the smartphone we will find the clock.  They can be called whatever you like, but you are definitely not mistaken.  Look for something similar to the ‚ÄúSmartWatch DZ09 smartwatch‚Äù, ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù, ‚ÄúConnection‚Äù.  Then you will have to enter the password for pairing.  After that, the connection will be established.  Now you can fully use your watch.  Just do not forget to install all the required applications on your smartphone for all functions to work.  You can find them in the Android store. </p>

    <p> But connecting a clock to a computer is problematic.  And why is it needed?  All that is required can be immediately dropped onto a memory card.  Connect the gadget to the PC is required only for flashing.  In other cases, a connection to a computer or laptop is not required at all.  Some may want to use a smartwatch in tandem with a laptop.  Will have to upset these users.  The gadget is designed to work only with the Android operating system.  Connecting to devices on another platform is not possible.  By the way, a standard cable that comes with the gadget is enough for flashing.  Now let's look at some features of using smart watches from China. </p><h2>  Terms of Use </h2><p>  Since this product comes from the Middle Kingdom, in no case try to check the SmartWatch DZ09 smart watch for strength.  The reviews convincingly prove that they will not survive such a treatment with themselves.  Do not drop them or cling to their jambs.  No need to check the glass for scratch resistance.  Particularly curious are cautioned that testing their ability to repel water is also not worth it.  They are not waterproof.  It is also not recommended to expose the watch to overheating or to allow prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. </p><p>  A little more about how not to ruin the smartwatch SmartWatch DZ09.  Reviews convincingly show that using the gadget in a very dusty room is also impossible.  Fine dust clogs the ventilation openings, covers with a thick layer of microcircuit, and as a result we have overheating and failure.  Do not experiment with this.  If you follow all the above rules, your watch will live happily ever after. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize our research.  On the one hand, a smart watch is a very useful gadget that can make life easier.  But on the other, it confuses the need to constantly charge the device.  And how without it?  Nevertheless, this device can become a full-fledged and indispensable assistant.  As for the specific model, SmartWatch DZ09, there is no certainty here.  It seems like the gadget is cheap, and copes with its functions.  But some aesthetes can be scared away by the appearance (although it‚Äôs very much nothing) and the quality of the materials.  Such people usually choose devices more expensive.  But most users will be delighted with such a device.  This device can be a great gift at an undemanding price. </p>
