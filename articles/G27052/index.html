There are many models on the market, and making the right choice is quite difficult.  First of all, it is important to note that the devices are very different in parameters.  There are also design features.  However, general recommendations can be given. </p><h2>  How to choose a device? </h2><p>  The output voltage parameter cannot exceed 12 V. If you select a simple model, then the power should be about 40 watts.  The overload indicator averages 12 A. Many modern modifications are sold with high-quality fuses.  The heating protection system is provided for them in the first class. </p><p>  It is also important to pay attention to design features.  First of all, the clamps of the model are checked.  The housing must be airtight.  The voltage switch is most often used rotary type.  Many modifications are made with the function of continuous charging.  Also, before the purchase, the light indication of the system is checked. </p>

    <h2>  Homemade 10 V </h2><p>  Homemade charging for a 10 V car battery is very common.  A distinctive feature of these modifications is the presence of a converter.  Do-it-yourself charging for a car battery with rotary controls. </p><p>  Transformers are commonly used step-down.  Resistors for models are used inverter or phase type.  If we consider the first option, then the capacitors are installed with a lining.  The conductivity index on the winding should not exceed 5 microns.  It is also important to check the negative resistance of the charger.  The clamps of the model are installed last. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Homemade modifications to 12 V </h2><p>  Homemade charging for a 12V car battery consumes quite a lot of electricity.  To make the modification yourself, you will need a step-down transformer.  Resistors can be used only pulse type.  In total, two capacitors are selected for the model. </p><p>  To increase conductivity, an expander is used.  The stabilizer is installed behind the lining.  Negative resistance in the circuit should not exceed 40 ohms.  Regulators are used both rotary and push-button type.  The first option involves the use of a converter.  Modifications with push-button controls are rare.  To install them, special tetrodes are soldered.  At the end of the work, it remains only to connect the clamps for connecting to the battery. </p>
