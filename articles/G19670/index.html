After a short period of calm, closed borders and a boycott of Turkish resorts by our travelers, their sympathy for the Antalya shores has not died out.  This is evidenced by the size of tourist flows on the hospitable shores of the Mediterranean. </p><p>  Western Aegean resorts (Marmaris, Bodrum, Fethiye) are in demand among European tourists, but the Mediterranean (Alanya, Kemer, Belek, Side) is the "patrimony" of Slavic travelers.  Istanbul and Ankara are popular destinations for sightseeing tourists. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of vacation in Alanya </h2><p>  Alanya is a wonderful, cozy, very atmospheric and fun resort region on the Antalya coast of Turkey.  In addition, Alanya, along with Kemer, is the most ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù region in the Mediterranean.  The resort is budgetary and democratic, therefore, its popularity among our compatriots is off scale.  Most hotels operate on an all-inclusive basis, the beaches are pleasant, sand and pebble, the infrastructure is colorful and developed, including water parks, restaurants, shopping centers, diving clubs, golf courses and tennis courts.  Everyone can find entertainment and activity to their liking. </p><p>  And Alanya is a very picturesque area: rocky mountains, pine groves, tangerine plantations, olive and grape plantations only emphasize the pleasant resort color of this region. </p><p>  The only drawback of Alanya as a resort is its remoteness from Antalya Airport.  Transfer to the hotel from the airport, as a rule, takes 2-3 hours.  But at present, the reconstruction of the local airport of Alanya - Gazipasa airport, which will be able to accept international charter flights, is underway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA in Alanya: general information </h2><p>  The budget hotel for outdoor activities is located 1 km from the center of Alanya, on the second coastline.

The location of this hotel complex is its huge advantage. </p><p>  Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4 * is located just a kilometer from Alanya and 150 meters from the pebble beach.  Thus, the hotel complex is great for active travelers, admirers of urban and educational vacations, and classic beach tourists. </p><p>  Antalya Airport is 120 km away, while Gazipasa Regional Airport is 43 km away. </p><p>  Nearby hotels are ALAIYE HOTEL and SUNPARK MARIN. </p><p>  The hotel has a wonderful location, almost in the center of the budget and fun resort of Alanya.  This location is ideal for family travelers and youth.  However, Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4 * is unlikely to suit lovers of the classic Turkish excursion, as, indeed, any other hotel in Alanya.  This region is remote from the famous attractions of a la Pamukkale, Istanbul, Ephesus, Cappadocia, etc., at an impressive distance.  Seven-hour trips to the famous monuments of antiquity and architecture is not exactly the occupation that is optimal for the tourist who can enjoy the sea, sun, service and all the all inclusive bonuses all day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA Description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2060260.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The staff clean the rooms daily, change of bed linen - every other day. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The hotel has its own plot on the city beach.  It is shared with the Cleopatra Tac Hotel.  Cleopatra Beach in Turkey today is considered the most picturesque and equipped in the region.  There is a myth that may be based on historical facts: they say that this beach was equipped by Mark Anthony himself to receive his eminent beloved Cleopatra with the maximum imperial comfort. </p><p>  A couple of centuries, the legend that sand was brought here from Egypt was carefully planted and maintained.  Scientists have found that the sand on Cleopatra's beach in Turkey is identical to the sand on the shores of Egypt and North Africa. </p><p>  Of course, the veracity of this information is unlikely to be verified.  But the fact that the city beach of Alanya is considered one of the most comfortable and popular in the region, already says a lot.  Sand on the coast mixed with small pebbles.  Because of this, seawater is clean and clear, even despite high waves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cleopatra Beach Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2060258.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Also, this beach is one of the cleanest and most well-groomed in all of Turkey, he is the deserved winner of the prestigious Blue Flag award.  The beach has everything for the safety and comfort of tourists: lifeguards, cafes, shops, vending machines, sports equipment rental, toilet, showers, changing rooms. </p><p>  Sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach are paid (approximate cost is 200 rubles per day), mattresses are free, beach towels are not provided at the hotel.  There is a road between the hotel and the beach. </p><p>  In the winter season, the beach is open, but not equipped, bars, shops, lifeguards, etc. do not work. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel operates according to the classical scheme of the Turkish hotel service.  It is almost impossible that a budget hotel oriented at the reception of Russians / Ukrainians does not work on all inclusive.  It so happened that for our compatriots, rest in Turkey and <em>‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù</em> are synonyms. </p><p>  Thus, the food in the Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4 *, of course, is provided by the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem. </p><p>  But each hotel has its own nuances, they need to be clarified and double-checked at the stage of choosing a vacation spot. </p><p>  In Tac Premier, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem does not work around the clock, but from 10:00 to midnight, and in the winter until 23:00.  As part of the concept, guests are offered breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and late dinner in the main buffet restaurant. </p>

A working bar in the main restaurant is a big plus for the hotel.

    <p>  Special menus: The hotel has a diet menu and a vegetarian table.  There is no children's menu. </p><h2>  Hotel service: free services, entertainment, sports options </h2><p>  Service is often a litmus test of the quality of the hotel as a whole.  Even the newest, most sophisticated luxury hotel can spoil its ratings due to a lame service.  On the Antalya coast of Turkey, where the work of most establishments is seasonal, most often the quality of service "subsides" in those segments where hoteliers manage seasonal workers.  These are animators, bartenders, waiters, maids, etc. </p><p>  Alas, the Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4 * is no exception, some tourists noted in their reviews the rudeness of the reception staff and the negligence of the maids. </p><p>  As part of the "all inclusive" hotel guests are provided with such free services: animation, housekeeping, currency exchange, Internet, fitness center and sauna at certain times. </p><p>  Doctor, laundry, spa, conference room rental - at an additional cost. </p><p>  The animation in the hotel, according to vacationers, is calm and unobtrusive.  The team consists of 3 people, there are Russian-speaking animators. </p><p>  In the evening, hotel guests can go to a show program or a performance of animators, but the disco in the hotel does not work.  This drawback is partially offset by the proximity of the center of Alanya, where there are many clubs and other establishments with a "boiling" nightlife. </p><p>  In the winter season, the Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA is much less diverse, since the animation team works only from April 15 to October 15. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Alanya is a popular holiday destination for the whole family.  The city beach is ideal for swimming for children and inexperienced swimmers.  And within walking distance are supermarkets, parks, cafes, pharmacies and other facilities that are so necessary for family travelers. </p><p>  Also, almost all hotels, even the most budget ones, make attempts to improve their service, imprison it for the reception of tourists of all age groups. </p><p>  At Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA, the service for children is not as diverse as in some hotels in Alanya, but it is nevertheless well-designed to provide small tourists with the necessary comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2060256.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the room you can order a free cot for children up to 3 years.  The restaurant has high chairs.  A children's pool and a playground are on site. </p><p>  The hotel has children's animators, but there is no babysitter, nor is there a mini-club, rental of prams, a children's menu, water slides, etc. </p><p>  Note that Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4 * is not the best choice for travelers with children from 0 to 4 years.  But for schoolchildren, the hotel is ideal.  After all, they are already interested in excursions, trips to the zoo, water park, mountains, a shopping center, etc. and will be able to fully appreciate the advantages of the hotel's location. </p><h2>  Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a high rating, it is popular among both local tourists and Russian travelers.  This is natural, because the hotel has a very good location.  Almost all tourists in the reviews emphasized the advantages of the hotel's location: in the center of Alanya, near the Cleopatra beach, in the immediate vicinity of interesting Alanya sightseeing sites. </p><p>  Even in a positive way, tourists spoke about food.  They wrote that the food was fresh, tasty and varied, the restaurant's work schedule was convenient, the waiters were polite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tac Premier Hotel &amp; SPA 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2060265.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The beach next to the hotel was also praised by almost all hotel guests.  But here the price of sunbeds / umbrellas, paid drinks, etc., and the overcrowding of the beach strip upset vacationers. </p><p>  The repair in the rooms, the quality of cleaning, the speed of check-in received negative reviews.  Tourists write about cases of neglected cleaning, maids neglect some duties (do not change towels, do not bring water, do not wipe dust).  Also, the reviews of tourists contain unflattering comments about the facts of breakdowns in the rooms, check-in in the lower category room, etc. </p>
