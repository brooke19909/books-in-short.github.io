This American company is mainly engaged in the production of electronics, clothing, vehicles and engines for construction.  Her inventions are not afraid of dirt, water and other physical influences. </p><p>  The smartphone developed by the company's specialists also fits the described characteristics, it withstands falling from a two-meter height onto a concrete coating, works at very high and low ambient temperatures, and functions even after half an hour in water.  This device was created specifically for representatives of the mining industry and builders, because they constantly have to stay in extreme conditions.  The <span>Caterpillar CAT B15</span> smartphone (user reviews confirm this) is really not afraid of dust and dirt getting on it, you can safely take it with wet hands and operate it freely.  Of course, from such a device you should not expect outstanding characteristics or bright design ideas embodied in it, but for work it will become simply irreplaceable. </p><h2>  Test </h2>

Specialists showed visitors the unusual capabilities of this unit: it was mixed with concrete in a concrete mixer, immersed in a container of water, thrown onto solid objects, and then simply wiped with a cloth and turned on, and viewers could make sure that the phone was functioning as before.  Thus, we can say that the Caterpillar CAT B15 passed the crash test perfectly.  The smartphone in appearance is very brutal, suitable for real men involved in active sports, extreme sports.  The mobile phone has special protective functions and is far from fragile.

Such devices do not have special security locks or valves on the rear surface.  Accordingly, we can not be fully confident in the operability of smartphones after severe falls, when splashed into water or in very dusty rooms.  This applies not only to work in extreme conditions, but also to use in everyday life.  For example, if you fall into a puddle, the back cover can easily fly off, the entire filling of the phone will get wet, and the device will stop functioning.  Such shockproof and waterproof devices are only suitable for accurate use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caterpillar cat b15 review" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/652029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The presented smartphone Caterpillar CAT B15 has completely different characteristics, because its manufacturers are well aware of hard work in extreme conditions and tried to develop a device for use in such circumstances.  The company has long begun to produce items that help in the construction business.  Everyone knows the wear-resistant shoes of this brand, which fell in love with workers from different parts of the world.  Recently, the Caterpillar CAT B15 smartphone has also begun to be in demand, the reviews of the owners of which are mostly positive.  Experts share the optimism of users. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Caterpillar CAT B15: performance reviews </h2>

The communicator runs on a regular MediaTek platform, has very modest functional properties and a small screen resolution.

    <h2>  Supply </h2><p>  The Caterpillar CAT B15 smartphone goes on sale in a small rectangular box of <span>yellow color</span> with the company logo on it.  The packaging is very nice to hold in your hands, it is made of high-quality cardboard of high density.  On the box itself, there is, besides the company logo, an image of a smartphone and several concise inscriptions.  Looking at such packaging, you can immediately understand that manufacturers are serious people who are used to doing everything efficiently, accurately and strictly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone caterpillar cat b15" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/652031.jpg" width="600"></div>  Opening the box, we can see a small arsenal of equipment, consisting of a charger, stereo headset, connecting cable, operating instructions and documents on the smartphone.  Of particular note is the interesting design of the instructions, because it is made in the form of the phone itself, with cropped corners.  The kit also contains special metal screws and rubberized caps for greater ease of use and mounting them to the body of the mobile device.  If during operation the rubber lining is worn out, it will be possible to replace it personally with a new one, using for this purpose spare parts from the device‚Äôs complete set.  Apparently, the manufacturer made sure that the mobile phone withstood the harsh operating conditions and did not fail at a crucial moment.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Confession </h2><p>  The mobile device has undergone many tests, according to the results of which it was awarded the IP67 certificate, which guarantees complete protection against ingress of moisture and dust.  The phone can be under water for a long time or withstand a stream of water under low pressure, acting on it from all sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caterpillar phone" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/652032.jpg" width="600"></div>  The rubberized case of the Caterpillar CAT B15 mobile device allows you to reliably protect your smartphone from damage when falling from a high height, it has increased shock resistance.  All of the above is confirmed in practice.  The manufacturer officially declares that the product withstood the drop from a two-meter height.  The company also guarantees that in such a situation the phone will not lose its functionality.  The instructions indicate that the manufacturer is responsible for the strength of the mobile device in the event of accidental shock or fall.  However, the warranty does not apply to the conditions of deliberately hard handling of the phone.

    <p>  The screen of the smartphone is covered with a protective glass, it can be conveniently controlled even with wet fingers.  This property in conditions of rain, snowfall or working with water becomes very relevant.  A mobile device can not only be taken with wet hands, they can even take photos under water.  Of course, the quality of the images leaves much to be desired, but this was to be expected, because the flash does not work in such conditions. </p><h2>  General view </h2><p>  Externally, the Caterpillar CAT B15 smartphone looks rather rude, it is angular, thick and heavy in weight.  The dimensions of the communicator are justified, because the manufacturers tried to reliably hide the fragile filling of the device and placed a thick rubberized plastic between the electronics and the case.  Caterpillar calls the Cat B15 alluminium body the phone‚Äôs case, but it‚Äôs not possible to say for sure whether the metal frame is actually inside or whether the protective pads made of this material are simply placed on the device‚Äôs filling.  In any case, taking the smartphone in hand, you can feel the power, reliability coming from it and evaluate the build quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caterpillar cat b15 crash test" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/652033.jpg" width="600"></div>  The thickness of the mobile phone is 15 mm.  Compared to conventional communicators, this is quite a lot, but we can not find fault with this parameter, because it is necessary for reliable protection against damage.  The whole body consists of rubberized plastic and metal side inserts, there is no shiny or glossy surface.  Due to the small roughness of the device, it is very convenient to hold in hands.  Fingerprints on the mobile phone do not remain, because it is matte.

    <h2>  Additional protection </h2><p>  The back of the smartphone has a removable panel that closes with a lock, which eliminates the possibility of its opening in the event of a fall or other physical and mechanical influences on the device.  This detail allows the smartphone to be used by travelers, rescue workers, hunters and fishers, athletes and other people for whom the reliability of equipment is especially important.  Under the cover there are slots for two SIM cards, additionally protected from water and dirt.  Near the battery is a memory card.  Removable media cannot be reached without removing the battery, as it reliably supports them. </p><h2>  Display and its frame </h2><p>  The screen of the mobile phone is resistant to scratches, because it is covered with Corning <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  Near the display there are thick metal and plastic frames.  Below are the touch keys, which are highlighted in light yellow.  It is impossible to independently adjust the duration of the backlight, it is set automatically.  The camera window is hidden under the glass, and there are also control sensors.  The lower touch buttons and the screen respond well to touch, inhibition or erroneous pressing of adjacent buttons was not noted.  On the sides of the device there is an audio output connector, a power button, volume keys, a camera, a microphone and a microUSB output.  All function buttons are hidden under rubber plugs and screwed with metal screws for reliability.  When the protective material is worn out, it can be replaced with a new one yourself or in a mobile phone repair salon. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  <span>The battery</span> in the Caterpillar CAT B15 is removable.  Its volume is 2000 mAh.  You can play the video at an average brightness level at high resolution for 7-7.5 hours.  And you can read books in electronic format continuously for much longer.  You will have 14 hours at your disposal.  These results are quite good for a normally functioning screen with dim backlight and low resolution compared to other smartphones of this type. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

If you want to save money, it is recommended to order a phone from abroad directly, via the Internet.  Even with delivery, the smartphone will cost you much cheaper.  That's all there is to say in general terms about the Caterpillar CAT B15 communicator.  Review completed.
