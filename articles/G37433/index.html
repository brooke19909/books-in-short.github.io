    <p>  Hotel Bella Vista Resort has a huge advantage, namely, a favorable location.  To begin with, it is worth saying that the hotel complex is located on the territory of the New City with all its entertainment and attractions, and the sea is just a stone's throw from here.  Very close to the hotel territory there is a large market where you can buy almost everything, from food to souvenirs, clothes and jewelry.  Hurghada International Airport is located 5 km from the hotel - you can get to it in 15-20 minutes, which is also convenient. </p><h2>  Hotel Bella Vista Resort (Hurghada): short description </h2>
