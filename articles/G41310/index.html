  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a flashlight out of paper, but not simple, magical?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The phrase "paper flashlight" does not mean a device for lighting, but only carries the designation of a kind of decoration made of colored paper.  True, this adornment came to modern life precisely as luminous "sky lanterns" from China.  Then, with the help of such paper structures, inside which the lamp was placed, messages were transmitted over long distances during military operations.  Indeed, under the influence of hot air, "sky lanterns" rose high above the ground and soared in the air, visible very far away. </p><p>  This device later began to be used during the holidays, so the shell began to be decorated in every possible way.  Only in 2006, Russia again began to use flying lamps in paper balloons, which were launched in memory of the victims of the earthquake.  Up to this point, the concept of "paper lantern" directly determined the decoration of the holidays. </p><p>  There are many workshops that tell and demonstrate how to make a flashlight out of paper.  The easiest way was included in the program of labor lessons in the elementary grades of the middle of the last century.  To make such a toy, it is enough to take a sheet of colored paper, fold it in half lengthwise so that the colored side is outward.  Now we make cuts across the sheet from the side of the bend, not cutting a little to the very end, so as not to get ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù. </p><p>  By expanding the sheet, you should glue the transverse edges running parallel to the incisions.  You can insert a cardboard tube of a different color inside the flashlight by attaching its outer edges with glue to the edges of the flashlight.  It is only necessary to take into account that the tube should be in height a little lower than the flashlight, so that it looks like a skirt on it, and is not tightly tightened. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now that you know how to make a flashlight out of paper in such a simple and quick way, with a little imagination, you can easily use this skill to not only decorate the Christmas tree, but also the holiday table - and not only the New Year's one. </p><p>  During a romantic dinner, such a decoration will perfectly replace a candlestick or cup holder.  Having made tiny lanterns, you can hang them on the tubes for cocktails or make earrings for the baby from them.  And if the holiday is planned in nature, where expensive dishes are practically not taken, then they can easily camouflage an ordinary pan, turning it into an elegant salad bowl. </p><p>  Since making a flashlight out of paper is not at all difficult, this procedure can be trusted with children of 7‚Äì9 years old.  For them, this lesson will be both interesting and useful.  Moreover, the kids will feel that they are also taking part in the preparation of the holiday, and this will greatly delight them and <span>increase their self-esteem</span> in their own eyes. </p><p>  There are practical tips on <span>how to make</span> your own <span>flashlight</span> in a more complicated way.  A tube is made for him - the main part of the future cylinder, which can be decorated with a wide variety of applications, foil or even sew beads and beads.  Paper circles of a slightly larger diameter are glued on top and bottom of the tube than her, so that the edges of the circles protrude - that‚Äôs the cylinder!  You can skip the thread through the centers of the base circles, securing it with a loop at the top and leaving the end free at the bottom. </p><p>  Since you want to make a flashlight out of paper as colorful as possible, it is recommended to hang several other multi-colored other circles decreasing in diameter from the bottom of the cord hanging from the base of the craft, or make ‚Äúbumps‚Äù - bells from these circles, having previously cut a small segment of the circle and gluing it in the place of the incision.  At the very end of the thread, you can attach a brush or bell. </p><p>  And in Nosov‚Äôs wonderful stories there is a short description of how to make a lantern with your own hands, not only for decoration, but ... magical!  The principle of execution is very similar to the one just described, only without pulling the cord.  But the most important point here is a small window ‚Äì eye at the base of a miracle ‚Äì kaleidoscope.  The opposite base is not fully glued, but only two quarters of the circle so that the glued parts are located opposite.  It is best to make it from transparent or translucent paper. </p><p>  It turns out two fairly large slots into which you can insert a strip of paper with the "frames" drawn on it - comics.  While one of the guests will look into the ‚Äúmagic eye‚Äù, the paper tape with the drawings should be moved, similar to the way a filmoscope works.  Naturally, such a ‚Äúmagic lantern‚Äù works best if you direct it into the light.  Comic book drawings should also be done on thin and light paper. </p>
