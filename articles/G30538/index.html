    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  The country boasts a rich history, attractive culture, as well as picturesque nature.  In this regard, from year to year for an increasing number of tourists, the Republic of Albania becomes the object of travel.  Sights from the time its territories were under Roman rule have been well preserved to this day in the city of Durres.  Here you can see the ruins of the fortification walls, several castles and fortresses, as well as the Amphitheater built in the second century.  Archaeological work is being carried out in the region of Appolonia, and all the finds are displayed in the local museum.  One of the most interesting sights here is considered the so-called Mosaic House, which is surrounded by very beautiful fountains and statues.  In principle, any of the cities of the country can show its visitors many interesting places. </p><p>  Its population calls the city of Shkodra the cultural capital of the state.  The permanent local symbol is the Sheikh Abdullah Al-Zamil Mosque.  On the territory of the city is also one of the main Orthodox shrines - the Franciscan ancient church.  A lot of interesting legends and stories are connected with the Rosaefan fortress.  It was built in the fifth century and served to protect the trade routes passing here.  Until our time, the building was well preserved, despite the fact that it more than once reflected the long sieges and raids. </p><p>  Particularly rich in picturesque places is the capital of the state.  The main decoration of Tirana is its central square, surrounded by several pretty interesting buildings.  These include an international hotel and a historical museum. </p>
