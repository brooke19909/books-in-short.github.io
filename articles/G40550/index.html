A tyrant named Pisistratus reigned from 560 to 527 with short interruptions.  His father was Hippocrates, the hero of our article himself came from a noble family, his ancestors were relatives of the ancient kings of Athens. </p><h2>  Place in history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board of Pisistratus" class="if uuid-2475008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475008.jpg"></div><p>  The tyranny of Pisistratus has remained in the history of Ancient Athens.  He became a prominent figure in the political arena when he began to command the Athenian forces during the war with the Megarians.  On the battlefields, he achieved several victories, soon took a place in the ranks of Solon, and later created his own political group of diacrii. </p><p>  If we talk about the significance of this historical figure, it is necessary to mention that they began to call the tyrant of Pisistratus after he first captured the Acropolis in 560 BC, having received at his disposal a detachment of bodyguards from the people.  However, he failed to hold on to power for a long time.  Powerful groups of aristocrats joined together to drive him out of the city. </p><p>  Peisistratus waited until a feud and enmity began between the aristocrats themselves.  The leader of one of the groups then turned for help to the very hero of our article.  Peisistratus regained power, but again could not hold it for too long.  But this time he did not wait for the official overthrow, but withdrew into voluntary exile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Away from Athens, Pisistratus spends about 10 years, all this time he has been active, preparing his return to power.  Finally, in 546 BC, he landed with a detachment in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Marathon and occupied Athens, eliminating the opposition in which the aristocrats were located almost without loss.  He is the third time, now they are finally setting their tyranny in Athens.  It conducts an aggressive foreign policy, the main purpose of which is to spread the influence of the Athenian policy throughout Greece.  With the tyranny of Pisistratus in Athens, several fundamentally new festivals and cults are introduced, he seeks to make the city a major religious center, which causes hostility from Delphi. </p><p>  Here are the highlights of the fate and reign of Pisistratus.  And in order to better understand this personality, let us dwell in more detail on his biography. </p><h2>  Tragic omens </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelpage.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Athens" class="if uuid-2475013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475013.jpg"></div><p>  Peisistratus was born in 602 BC.  He was born in Athens.  There is a legend according to which his father Hippocrates, when his son was not yet born, arrived in Olympia for popular sports games at that time.  Right during the sacrifice, the boilers containing the sacrificial meat flared on their own, even though there was no fire under them yet.  The chilo from Sparta, who witnessed this incident, advised Hippocrates to never have children, but he did not listen to him, and soon Pisistratus was born. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This family had their own residence, located in the Attica region called Diakria.  It was the eastern coast of the country, separated by high mountains from the lowland center of Athens.  By the time of the birth of Pisistratus, his family owned a house in the city itself, but due to the fact that he was born in the village, the attitude of those around him was somewhat arrogant.  Many considered him a stranger. </p><h2>  Military success </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.art.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Importance of Tyranny of Pisistratus" class="if uuid-2475012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475012.jpg"></div><p>  Pisistratus became a prominent figure in Athens when he stood at the head of the Athenian forces.  It happened in the war against the Megarians.  The hero of our article managed to win several glorious victories, for example, to take control of Nisea, as well as the megaric harbor located in the Saronic Gulf. </p><p>  The military expeditions of Pisistratus were so successful that his popularity began to grow rapidly.  However, as a result, the outcome of the war was decided at the arbitration court, which took place in Sparta.  The island of Salamis, due to which the war broke out, remained for Athens, and the region of Nisea came under the control of the Megarians. </p><h2>  The beginning of a political career </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancientgreekbattles.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tyranny of Pisistratus" class="if uuid-2475010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475010.jpg"></div><p>  A ticket to the life of the tyranny of Pisistratus and Pisistratides, in fact, was given by Solon, who played a significant role in the life and career of the hero of our article.  The hero of our article began his career in the ranks of Solon's supporters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Let us now tell in more detail about the tyranny of Pisistratus, about how he first came to power.  He entered the Athenian Agora on a wagon in 560 BC.  He was wounded several times, claiming that political opponents tried to kill him as soon as he left for the field.  A popular meeting was held at which he turned to the people with a request to provide him with a bodyguard detachment.  From this, in fact, the tyranny of Pisistratus and Pisistratids began. </p><p>  However, some ancient authors claimed that he wounded himself by staging the attacks in order to seize power with the help of guards.  Among modern historians, some support this version, while others admit that enemies could indeed attack it.  Presumably, the version of the staging of the attack developed solely because of the negative attitude of the Athenians to tyranny. </p><h2>  Pisistrat in power </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsweek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient athens" class="if uuid-2475014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475014.jpg"></div><p>  Peisistratus received the required bodyguards, who were armed with batons.  Now it is not possible to establish the size of the detachment; according to various sources, it was from 50 to 300 people.  It was with their support that the hero of our article managed to seize power by establishing the tyranny of Pisistratus and Pisistratids in Athens. </p><p>  In all likelihood, he became a tyrant with the sanction of the people, having received power in a completely legal way.  Therefore, his support was not warriors with batons, but the sanction of the demos.  Researchers are sure that if the people were against tyranny, Pisistratus would be overthrown almost immediately after seizing power. </p><p>  It is interesting that almost immediately after the seizure of power by Pisistratom, Solon began to advocate for his overthrow, but did not find support from citizens.  The aristocracy at first vaguely reacted to the accession of the hero of our article, but then representatives of several noble families united among themselves to overthrow him.  At the same time, he was apparently allowed to stay on the territory of the Athenian polis in the town of Bravron. </p><h2>  Return to power </h2><div class="photo" data-original="earlyworldhistory.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create Tyranny of Pisistratus" class="if uuid-2475009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475009.jpg"></div><p>  Megacles, who led one of the aristocratic clans who advocated the overthrow of Pisistratus, eventually quarreled with other aristocratic families.  Therefore, he began to advocate for his return to the throne.  He even married his daughter named Kesira.  Megakl seriously hoped that Pisistratus would then become an obedient instrument in his hands. </p><p>  To restore power to Pisistratus, Megacle spotted a woman named Fiya.  He dressed her in armor, since she was supposed to portray the goddess Athena, accompanied by her, Pisistratus solemnly and rode into the city. </p><p>  Describing this simple trick, Herodotus almost directly called him an ordinary trick, wondering how the Athenians succumbed to such an obvious trick. </p><p>  Among modern scholars, there is an opinion that in reality none of this happened, others tend to believe that it was a standard religious act.  Apparently, the religiosity of the Greeks played their role, which could easily perceive a person for the embodiment of a deity. </p><p>  Presumably, Pisistratus could exploit the standard for the Greeks model of a sacred marriage, which is between a goddess and a hero. </p><h2>  Second tyranny </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rulers in Athens" class="if uuid-2475015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2475015.jpg"></div><p>  The second tyranny of Pisistratus in Athens begins with his marriage to the daughter of Megacles.  Moreover, according to Herodotus, he lived with Kesira in an unnatural way, not wanting to have children from her.  When her father found out about this, he decided to take revenge on Pisistrata. </p><p>  To do this, he teamed up with Lycurgus to overthrow the tyrant.  But this time he did not wait for the conspiracy, but withdrew into voluntary exile.  The creation of the tyranny of Pisistratus for the second time took a lot of effort, and it lasted less than a year. </p><h2>  Life in exile </h2><p>  In exile, he spent about ten years.  Presumably from 556 to 546 BC.  He establishes settlements, develops gold mines, enters the support of allies, does everything to regain power. </p><p>  For 10 years in exile, he manages to save a serious amount to prepare a campaign for Athens.  Pisistratus recruits mercenaries with whom he landed in the Marathon.  There he is joined by numerous allies. </p><p>  The aristocracy, which was in power at that time, showed strange passivity.  Most likely, they did not expect that the people would support them.  When it became known that Pisistratus was going to Athens, a detachment of soldiers came out to meet him.  At the town of Pallenida, the hero of our article went on the attack while the Athenians rested after breakfast.  He managed to catch opponents by surprise. </p><h2>  The period of the third tyranny </h2><p>  Describing the essence of the tyranny of Pisistratus during this period, ancient sources claim that he carefully took care of his own safety.  For example, he took the children of his political opponents hostage. </p><p>  At the same time, public affairs were decided in the spirit of civil equality, not tyranny.  Speaking briefly about the tyranny of Pisistratus, it should be noted that he examined civil matters from the standpoint of the public good.  In general, many characterize him as a meek and humane person, which does not always correspond to the image depicted in the Athenian chronicles. </p><p>  Under this tyranny, many noted that Pisistratus himself was a courteous and democratic person who tried to solve all matters by law.  At the same time, many noble Athenians were forced into exile as political opponents of Pisistratus.  Those who remained were forced to cooperate with the tyrant. </p><p>  During his third reign, the hero of our article did not touch the state authorities.  It is interesting that his power was not legally formalized in any way; he ruled the country on the rights of a charismatic leader. </p><h2>  At the end of life </h2><p>  Shortly before his death, Pisistratus conceived one of the most ambitious projects of that time.  It was the temple of Olympian Zeus, which was supposed to appear on the outskirts of Athens.  In terms of size, it was to become one of the largest religious buildings in Greece.  It was built for a very long time, at some point they even abandoned it, only in the II century the temple was completed. </p><p>  Arguing what is the significance of the tyranny of Pisistratus, it should be noted that he tried in every possible way to give Athens the status of a major religious center, which constantly caused discontent among Delphi, where there were many of his opponents.  However, they failed to commit a single successful attempt.  In 527 BC, Pisistratus died his death. </p><h2>  Reign of sons </h2><p>  After his death, power passed to the sons, Hipparchus and Hippus.  At the same time, the second was actually in charge of the leadership, and the first was more interested in literature and art. </p><p>  Over time, the situation in Athens worsened significantly.  There was even a conspiracy against the brothers in order to kill them.  It can only be called successful partly, only Hipparchus was able to take the life. </p><p>  The surviving Hippias launched brutal repression against his opponents, setting up a real terror. </p><h2>  Klisfen Reforms </h2><p>  One of the main opponents of pisistratides was Klisfen, who proposed a draft reform.  They had to once and for all undermine the foundations of the tribal nobility, put an end to the tyranny of Pisistratus.  Clisfen's reforms were successful as a result.  The aristocratic system was undermined with the help of the Spartans, a popular uprising began.  After the final defeat of the clan aristocracy, it was Klisfen who became the new head of state, opened a new page in Athenian history. </p><h2>  The meaning of tyranny </h2><p>  First of all, the essence and significance of the tyranny of Pisistratus consisted in maintaining state order while observing the interests of various social strata of the population, but also for the sake of their personal goals.  This policy of the father was continued by his sons. </p><p>  It was possible to maintain a certain social calm, as well as actively stimulate cultural and economic development and exert a beneficial influence on the formation of Athenian society.  It is important that none of the tyrants has ever repealed the laws adopted by Solon, and in public life the strengthening of the polis orders, which were also laid down by Solon, continued.  In this regard, they did not pursue their own policies, relying on past beneficial experiences. </p><p>  The reign of Pisistratus and his sons today is evaluated differently, but it can be said with confidence that they played an important role in the development of the Athenian state, left their indelible mark on ancient Greek history. </p>
