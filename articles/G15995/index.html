Initially, when the nature of certain phenomena was not scientifically proven, people came up with explanations, referring to gods, evil spirits and other magical creatures.  For example, lightning was explained as the wrath of the Almighty, the missing things - to the intrigues of the brownie, and those who got lost in the forest claimed to be following the lights.  And it is from there that all kinds of conspiracies, <span>amulets, charms,</span> signs and rituals take their roots.  After all, magical creatures must be appeased to help, and evil ones to be scared away. </p><p>  Years, centuries have passed, many phenomena no longer cause awe and are understandable even to schoolchildren, but to this day, almost everyone believes in the supernatural.  People honor God, pray, ask the Almighty for help, wear a cross or the image of saints on their chests, still explaining the incomprehensible by the will of God.  In addition, pagan traditions are still popular, for example, a nickel under the heel for good luck in the exam or three times spit over the left shoulder and knock on the tree, so as not to incur trouble.  Also, many have their amulets and talismans: a lucky ticket, a mother‚Äôs ring, socks that bring good luck.  The main thing in them is a person‚Äôs faith in their ability to help in a difficult situation.  After all, if you know that they help you, it‚Äôs easier to make a decision and take a step. </p><h2>  Types of amulets </h2><blockquote><p>  The amulet is a superstitious object with a witchcraft ability to protect its owner from various disasters. </p></blockquote><p>  The following types of amulets are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Verbal.  These include conspiracies aimed at protecting against diseases, malicious intent, theft, slander, and everything else that can negatively affect a person.  It is believed that verbal amulets have a certain text, which is enough to memorize, and everything will work out, but this is not so at all.  The main thing in the manufacture of charms of all kinds is not the external form, but the spiritual content.  One must sincerely believe in the power of the subject and wish good to the one for whom he is preparing.  And words must come from the heart. </li><li>  Graphic.  It can be embroidery, tattoo, drawn on the surface or tree-burned images, symbols or words. </li><li>  Object amulets - objects that carry a charge of energy aimed at protection.  Usually they make such amulets with their own hands. </li></ul><h2>  Amulets of the world </h2><p>  The most common amulet in Europe is a Celtic amulet.  Most often, it has the shape of a circle, made of metal, stone or wood. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amulet tree of life" class="if uuid-2345353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2345353.jpg"></div><p>  The ancient Celts believed that the spirit of nature is divided into four components: water, earth, fire and air.  Each component corresponds to a specific set of characters.  Depending on the goals of this amulet, they applied one or another symbols and images with their own hands.  The bespoke amulet did not possess even a tenth of the force, like the one that they created for themselves or loved ones.  The peculiarity of such amulets is that they will work only for those whose souls are pure and their thoughts are not fraught with evil. </p><p>  Egyptian amulets differ from others in that they do not have any established form.  They can be any objects, rings, stones, wood, pin, coin, etc., which bear the symbol of God or magic words.  Such an amulet will work until the whole base object.  However, despite the apparent simplicity of manufacturing, it is quite difficult to make this type of amulets with your own hands, since it is necessary to take into account many parameters, starting from the phase of the lunar cycle, ending with the weather at a specific time.  Therefore, amulets were made by specially trained priests who possessed sufficient magical powers and the necessary knowledge. </p><p>  A popular Indian amulet is the Dream Catcher. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.qumball.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charm Dreamcatcher" class="if uuid-2345307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2345307.jpg"></div><p>  The round base, made of willow twig, symbolizes the infinity of the cycle of life and death.  A web is weaved on it, in the center of which a hole is left.  For her, it is better to take animal veins, linen thread or leather lace.  The web catches luck, happiness, health on its networks, passing all evil through the center so that it does not affect the owner of the amulet.  Decorate it with beads and feathers of an owl (for women) or an eagle (for men).  To create such amulets with your own hands, you need to take the feathers of only living birds, since otherwise they do not have positive magical energy and using them radically changes the work of the amulet. </p><p>  In oriental culture there is a very simple and melodic amulet - Music of the Wind.  Many have come across them, as they are very popular.  Metal, glass or wooden sticks in a stream of wind touch each other, making a melodic chime.  It is believed that he attracts luck.  You can make a talisman with your own hands, or buy a ready-made one.  You need to hang it above your head near the window.  Sound Music of the wind should only from the air flow, and not from mechanical stress, because only the wind brings good luck! </p><h2>  Slavic charms </h2><p>  The life of the Slavs was filled with protective magic.  In the house you could meet many do-it-yourself amulets.  During the construction of the house, wool, ash from the previous place of residence, sometimes the head of cattle, for example horse, was laid at the corners of the log house.  They were called to protect the house from evil.  A horseshoe hung above the front door, luring luck, and a terrible wooden face was attached to the door itself, so that it scared away everyone with bad intentions.  A charm in the form of a panicle was also popular.  It was placed on the street with the handle down, and vice versa, bagels, krynki with milk, pots and cereals were made from salt dough for decoration, the sun or a sunflower were made from fabric, and ribbons were sewn.  Clothes and curtains were decorated with embroidered embroidery, knotted amulets were made, and many others.  And, of course, dolls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic charms" class="if uuid-2345250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2345250.jpg"></div><p>  Dozens of types of charms made by yourself in the form of dolls are counted: </p><ul><li>  Bereginya; </li><li>  Ash; </li><li>  Krupenichka; </li><li>  Herbalist; </li><li>  Swaddle; </li><li>  Lovebands </li><li>  Desire; </li><li>  Ten-handled; </li><li>  Plantain; </li><li>  Day Night. </li></ul><p>  They were created for every occasion, be it household chores, a wedding, an upcoming road, or having a baby.  When creating dolls, charms, you must adhere to several rules: </p><ol><li>  Do-it-yourself amulets, like many other things in Slavic culture, need to be on the growing moon. </li><li>  The doll must be done in one go.  You can‚Äôt be distracted or finish it on another day, as it was believed that the new approach destroys the energy of the previous one and the doll is not holistic. </li><li>  A distinctive feature of the dolls was the lack of a face.  It was believed that an evil spirit would not be able to take hold of such amulets and harm a person, therefore the front part of the head was left clean or, in extreme cases, the face was marked with a cross. </li><li>  <span>Use only natural fabrics and threads: linen or cotton.</span>  <span>Synthetic fabric does not absorb the soul, and accordingly, such a talisman will not work.</span> </li><li>  To keep the amulet strong, it is necessary to use not a new fabric, but rags of clothes in which something good happened. </li><li>  When creating do-it-yourself dolls with amulet, scissors and needles cannot be used.  The fabric must be torn off and the details tied.  An exception can only be a doll outfit, and the less use of tools, the better the amulet will be. </li><li>  It is necessary to carefully monitor the number of threads and knots.  They should always be an even number. </li></ol><h2>  Doll column "Bereginya" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Charm Bereginya" class="if uuid-2345255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2345255.jpg"></div><p>  This doll is designed to protect the family from evil intentions and adversities.
