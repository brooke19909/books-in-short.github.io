He was born in 1732 and from a young age sought knowledge, as evidenced by the fact that he was able to independently study the country's military history and topography.  At the age of sixteen, George went on his first topographic expedition, and a year later got a formal job as a topographer in his native state.  In 1754, the future president was awarded the major rank in the local colonial militia.  Some time later, George Washington, whose photo is on the left, was elected to the state legislature.

    <p>  On the eve of the American War of Independence, which lasted from 1775 to 1783, he spoke to the Continental Congress, where he announced his desire to become a military leader.  Washington's candidacy was approved unanimously, and he himself was promoted to the rank of general.  The army subordinate to him consisted mainly of various militias, which could not boast of professionalism and good armament.  The general hoped to turn her into regular troops.  Some time later, opponents of Britain from Europe (the rulers of France and Spain) began to support the <span>US army</span> with ammunition <span>.</span>  The results were not long in coming, and on March 17, 1776, George Washington, together with a twenty-thousand-strong army, won his first big victory in the battle that took place during the siege of Boston and led to significant British casualties.  However, there were failures, as a result of which the Continental Congress escaped from Philadelphia on September 12, giving the general the authority of a dictator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Having received the approval of the American government, George Washington began to invite European military specialists.  Thanks to them, the militias gradually faded into the past.  At the same time, France declared war on England, after which she began to support the US rebels even more actively.  On October 19, 1781, the British Royal Army capitulated.  A year later, on November 30, 1782, the Paris Treaty was signed, according to which US independence was officially recognized. </p>

    <p>  George Washington after the war had such high popularity and authority that in 1789 he was elected the first <span>American president,</span> and in 1792 - re-elected to this post.  It is possible that this success could be repeated for the third time, but he himself refused to run.  In such a crucial position, the president continued his conservative policy.  An interesting fact is that it is he who is considered one of the founders of the bipartisan system that exists in the United States today. </p><p>  He spent his last years on his estate, where he died at the age of 67.  President George Washington has done a lot to develop his country and increase its military power.  For this, compatriots awarded him the honorary title "Father of the Fatherland."  It should be noted that he played a key role during the national war for the independence of the North American colonies from Britain.  Among other things, Washington actively advocated the gradual abolition of slavery in the country.  Even in his will, he ordered the release of black slaves belonging to him.  Not surprisingly, for such merits, the capital of the <span>United States of America</span> was named in his honor. </p>
