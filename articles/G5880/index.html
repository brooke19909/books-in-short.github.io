It is located two kilometers from the border with Abkhazia.  Thus, it is the southernmost resort of the Krasnodar Territory.  Why does he have such a strange name?  The fact is that in Soviet times there really was an agricultural enterprise under that name.  But now it has ceased to exist, and the district is traditionally called the "State Farm" Russia "."  Adler, expanding, included these lands in his territory, and recently it has practically merged with the <span>Olympic Park.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="State Farm Russia Adler" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1823090.jpg" width="600"></div>
