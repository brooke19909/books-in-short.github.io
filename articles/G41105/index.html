    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive comments, there are also comments on the Ibis Al Barsha Hotel 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists contain a certain amount of negativity about the quality of service and the work of the hotel as a whole.  Despite the fact that the advertisements stated carpet in the apartment, in some rooms it was not.  Although the channel package is large, there is practically nothing to watch, since only Chanson is presented from Russian-language programs. </p><p>  The windows do not open in the rooms, and therefore it can be very stuffy in the room (even despite the presence of air conditioning), and it is also impossible to dry things, towels are always wet.  The hair dryer in the bathroom does not work very well, so the hair has to be dried for a very long time.  The windows of the rooms located at the end of the building practically abut against the neighboring building, so ask for other numbers when checking in.  The area in which the hotel is located is quite new, and therefore there is practically nowhere to walk there. </p>
