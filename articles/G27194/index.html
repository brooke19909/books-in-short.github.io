    <h2>  Village Vityazevo </h2><p>  Attica Hotel is located in the resort town, which is located eleven kilometers from the famous Anapa.  It is also called "Little Greece."  Once there was an ancient colony.  After all, almost all the inhabitants of the village have Greek roots.  Therefore, in the architecture and design of many modern, especially private hotels, you can notice the features connecting the new comfort with ancient culture.  The mountains in this area are far from the village, and it is surrounded not by forests, but by vineyards.  This further enhances the impression of a Mediterranean country.  All entertainment is located on the waterfront or main boulevard.  And if you want a rich nightlife, then Anapa is suitable for you.  Attica Hotel (Vityazevo) is a good starting point for a trip to the main resort.  There you will find a rich excursion program and trips to local natural attractions.  The village also boasts its own Greek-style water park, dolphinarium and the Byzantium entertainment palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attica Vityazevo hotel prices" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1502185.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water recreation </h2><p>  The hotel itself has two whole pools.  They are heated and also decorated in the same style as the entire complex.  An artificial waterfall, a jacuzzi, a safe compartment for bathing babies - this is not all that awaits you if you do not want to go to the sea, but decide to sunbathe on the territory of the Hotel Attica (Vityazevo) complex.  But, as befits a Greek resort, the hotel advises its guests thalassotherapy.  After all, the ancient sages and healers spoke about the treatment by the sea, especially upset nerves.  To get to the coveted beach, you need to walk along the street with trade tents, where you can buy something if necessary.  The beach is sandy, with a gentle, child-friendly entrance.  Indeed, this is not the open sea, but the <span>Vityazevsky estuary.</span>  The water is very warm, and you can swim in it already in May.  Across the wide, fifty-five-meter beach - dunes of white sand.  True, in the season there can be a lot of algae.  And in the estuary there are healing muds that heal skin and eye diseases, indigestion and musculoskeletal system, and many others. </p><h2>  Reviews for the Attica Hotel (Vityazevo) </h2><p>  Tourists believe that this hotel is comfortable, at home, luxurious, as abroad, and at the same time, you can fully feel the local flavor.  They are delighted with the refined design of the hotel.  The staff and all employees are responsible, polite.  Huge chic balconies, protected by a special mesh, so that there is no danger to children.  The hotel infrastructure is very practical and thoughtful.  Unlike large boarding houses, where everything is standardized, vacationers here fell into family comfort.  Tourists write that they felt here as close friends.  The hotel is remembered for a long time and leaves a desire to come here again.  Therefore, if you decide to rest in Vityazevo, the Attica Hotel is a very good choice. </p>
