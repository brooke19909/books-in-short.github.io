If so, then most likely you live in this direction and daily go to work or study in Moscow.  And, perhaps, somewhere here is the house of your friends or your girlfriend and it is very important for you to arrive at the meeting on time.  As you can see, there are a lot of options for why you are interested in the schedule of the Khimki - Leningradsky Railway train.  This direction is considered one of the most popular, and at rush hour trains move, almost completely filled.  And if the indigenous inhabitants of the capital are well versed in all the nuances of the movement of electric trains of suburban communication, then visitors can be quite difficult to figure it out.  Therefore, in the article we will give full information in the direction of Khimki - Leningradsky Train Station: schedule of trains, stations and stops.  We will also talk in more detail about the starting and ending points of this popular route. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stihi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leningrad Station" class="if uuid-2567273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567273.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description of the Leningrad station </h2><p>  In the afternoon, a large passenger flow leaves from the <span>station Leningradsky Station</span> in Khimki.  Basically, it consists of residents of the region who return home after a working day.  Few of the passengers who are always in a hurry know the history of this station and can tell about its distinguishing features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Leningradsky Station (Khimki for many years was the terminal station of suburban trains) is the very first built in the capital.  He is the brainchild of one of the most famous architects of the nineteenth century, who had a hand in the construction of many objects, including the Cathedral of Christ the Savior - Konstantin Ton. </p><p>  If we describe in more detail the Leningradsky Station (Khimki today is one of the key stations of the direction), then it should be noted that it is made in the Russian-Byzantine style.  Located on Komsomolskaya Square, it stands out from other buildings in Moscow. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that from the moment the first train was launched, the station does not belong to the Moscow Railway at all.  Initially, it was run by the Leningrad Railway, and now the station is under the control of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Interestingly, over the years of its existence, the Leningrad Station has been renamed more than once.  He was Nikolaevsky and Oktyabrsky and only then the current name was assigned to him. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.77602770000001" data-lng="37.6554251" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/4/9/4749.png"></div><p>  It is today in the <span>direction of Leningradsky</span> Station - Khimki more than ten electric trains per day, and in the year the station was built, the message was never opened.  The first train was launched by rail only in the fifty-first year of the last century, although by that time as early as ten years the building was built and ready for operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The station was a dead end station; it did not transit through it.  The building itself is a magnificent architectural ensemble, consisting of a central two-story part and two outbuildings, which housed halls for three categories of passengers.  Luggage spaces and separate exits for members of the imperial family were equipped here.  In the central part, the architect designed spacious waiting rooms.  The highlight of the Leningrad station (Khimki as a station in the nineteenth century simply did not exist yet) was a clock tower.  They had characteristic European features.  Therefore, the station from afar and nearby resembles the town hall of an old town in the center of Europe. </p><p>  Four years after commissioning, the station became known as Nikolaevsky in honor of the Russian emperor.  After the revolution, many similar structures of the capital underwent large-scale alterations, but they did not touch the Leningrad station, which at that time was renamed Oktyabrsky. </p><p>  From the thirty-fourth year of the last century, changes began to occur inside the building.  To the convenience of the workers, cash desks expanded, information bureaus, a post and telegraph office, and <span>savings banks appeared.</span>  In order to make it more convenient for mothers to travel with the kids, a special room was equipped at the station.  Once these rooms were accessible only to members of the Romanov family, but remodeled they were not much reminiscent of the royal chambers. </p><p>  In the middle of the last century, there was a need for updating dilapidated interiors.  For this, a special project was compiled by the Soviet architect Dushkin.  By the eighties, the station was already struggling poorly with a sharp increase in passenger traffic, so the building underwent reconstruction and new constructions appeared in the spirit of the times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Leningradsky railway station today </h2><p>  Nowadays, the station has ten tracks that are equally divided between commuter and long-distance trains.  During the construction in the last century, the architect provided a landing stage for the entry of trains, but in the Soviet years it was dismantled.  And a little later a new waiting room appeared in its place. </p><p>  The issue of returning the pre-revolutionary name to the station has still not been resolved.  Many citizens and members of the public advocate for the initiation of this process, however, this topic remains at the level of discussion. </p><p>  In the 2000s, the station gradually began to lose the distinctive features of the Soviet past.  The bust of Lenin was removed from the square, and after another reconstruction, the star did not return to the spire of the turret.  Today the building looks quite modern, but one can learn about its past from established bas-reliefs depicting historical figures who had one way or another related to the station itself and the railway as a whole. </p><p>  If we talk about passenger traffic, then it becomes more and more every year.  Even after a quick glance at the train schedule from the Leningradsky railway station to Khimki, it‚Äôs enough to understand how busy the train movement is.  In general, up to one hundred and sixteen electric trains leave from here per day.  On weekends, this amount is reduced to ninety-four.  According to the latest data (2014), every month the Leningrad Station serves more than two million passengers using suburban routes. </p><p>  They have five endpoint options: </p><ul><li>  Zelenograd (Kryukovo station). </li><li>  Solnechnogorsk (station Sunflower). </li><li>  Wedge. </li><li>  Konakovo. </li><li>  Tver. </li></ul><p>  Usually, an electric train travels to two to three hours to its final points.  However, it‚Äôs not so long to go to Khimki station from the Leningradsky station - only about half an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inhimkicity.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khimki station" class="if uuid-2567275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567275.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of Khimki station </h2><p>  This station is the key for the city in which it is located.  Moreover, it is located on the main railway line.  The station is characterized as intermediate and quite a lot of trains pass through it during the year.  Judging by the passenger flow, it numbers about three million people a year.  The distance from the city to Moscow is small.  If someone is looking for options on how to get from Leningradsky Station to Khimki, then the best and fastest way will be the train.  Since both cities are separated by a distance of less than twenty kilometers. </p><p>  The station itself consists of one central passenger platform and two side.  Suburban trains run on four tracks.  It should be borne in mind that Khimki does not serve long-distance trains.  If you have a trip to the south or to another place, then you will first need the Khimki-Leningradsky Train electric train, and only then you can leave Moscow from anywhere in our country. </p><p>  Suburban trains leaving for the capital usually leave from the first platform.  But from <span>Moscow (Leningradsky railway station)</span> to Khimki, electric trains arrive on the second platform.  It is considered new, as it was renovated five years ago.  You can get to it through a covered passage. </p><p>  I would like to add that the Swallow high-speed trains run in this direction.  From the Leningrad station in Khimki, passengers arrive at them in fifteen minutes.  Such trains are on the third platform, and regardless of which direction the departure goes. </p><p>  In the morning and in the evening there is the largest congestion in the direction of Art.  Khimki - Leningradsky railway station.  Therefore, the maximum interval between trains does not exceed twenty-five minutes.  The minimum interval between departures is twelve minutes.  In the daytime, the time interval increases to four hours. </p><h2>  A few words about the past station </h2><p>  For a long time, all passengers traveling by train from the Leningradsky railway station to Khimki knew that the station was the final one.  Further, electric trains did not go and sent back to Moscow.  However, about nine years ago, the situation changed.  Most of the trains from the Leningradsky Station (Moscow) in Khimki began to stop like at a regular station.  This is due to a change in the route, now it lasted until Zelenograd, which became the end point of the path. </p><p>  A few years after that, on business days, one or two trains went to Khimki as to the final one, but now a similar route has been canceled. </p><h2>  The future of Khimki station </h2><p>  According to some forecasts, the train schedule from Khimki station to the Leningradsky station will become denser.  And this means that passenger traffic in this direction will increase significantly.  Therefore, a renovation plan was developed for the Khimki station, which should be implemented in four years. </p><p>  According to the project, the station will consist of a spacious modern building, where there is a place for all the necessary infrastructure.  Innovative elevated crossings are also planned, which will have an elevator lift system.  In addition, plants will be planted in the territories surrounding the station and the reconstruction of railway tracks. </p><p>  It is not known whether all these ideas will be implemented by the deadline specified in the project, but in any case, beyond recognition, they will change the face of the key railway station for Khimki. </p><h2>  Direction Leningradsky Train Station - Khimki: stations </h2><p>  In the train schedule, any passenger can see at which stations stops will occur.  At the Leningrad station for this there is a large digital display, and in Khimki, the schedule is so far simply posted on information boards.  However, even those passengers who overcome this route twice a day do not know anything about the stations themselves, which they will need to travel. </p><p>  There are seven stations between Khimki and the Leningrad station (in the schedule this is usually indicated): </p><ul><li>  Riga. </li><li>  Ostankino. </li><li>  Petrovsky-Razumovsky. </li><li>  NATI. </li><li>  Mosselmash. </li><li>  Khovrino. </li><li>  Left-bank. </li></ul><p>  At all of them, the parking time is minimal, so the passenger sometimes does not even have time to make out this place from the window of the electric train.  And sometimes their story is quite interesting and closely related to the development of Russian railways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="szd.rzd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="local trains" class="if uuid-2567287" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567287.jpg"></div><h2>  Station Riga </h2><p>  On the route Leningradsky Train Station - Khimki (we will talk about the schedule of electric trains a little later), this station is the first.  It is located from Moscow at a distance of only two kilometers.  Therefore, almost all passengers see it, regardless of where they leave. </p><p>  Officially, the station was opened in the fifty-eighth year of the last century.  However, until that date, it was actively used.  In the same year, with a small interval in Moscow, the Riga metro station was opened for passengers.  They both got their names from the station located nearby. </p><p>  Unfortunately for many passengers, there is no covered passage between the first and second platforms and the metro station.  This creates some inconvenience in the offseason, when it is cold and rainfall.  In addition, they are located away from the main tracks.  Therefore, passengers have to go a long time to get on the platform.  However, access to the city is closer to these platforms than to the third and fourth. </p><p>  They seem to passengers to be quite comfortable.  First of all, because of the bridge, allowing you to quickly go to the metro station.  Despite this, for eight years, all <span>commuter trains have</span> arrived at the station either on the first or second platform. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the box office building did not work for many years.  This created a lot of additional inconvenience for passengers.  About nine years ago, they were renovated and began to function. </p><h2>  Ostankino Station </h2><p>  This station was opened before the revolution, therefore it is one of the oldest in this direction.  The name was given to her by a village located once on this place.  At the end of the century before last, it became part of the capital.  Now only this station and the television tower, known not only in Russia but throughout the world, remind of him. </p><p>  Ostankino station looks quite modern.  It consists of three platforms and four paths.  To each you can go through the <span>underpass.</span>  Passengers are protected from falling onto the rails by a high fence, and to reduce the number of fare dodgers, they introduced turnstiles five years ago. </p><p>  Initially, the construction of the station was designed for three ways.  Therefore, when commissioning the fourth route, one of the platforms had to be rebuilt.  It was rediscovered about five years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="station building" class="if uuid-2566920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2566920.jpg"></div><h2>  Station Petrovsko-Razumovskoe </h2><p>  The history of our country can sometimes be studied in small towns and villages that do not exist today.  So it was with Petrovsky-Razumovsky.  Immediately after the revolution, it was absorbed by Moscow and today it only remains the name given once to the station that existed near the village. </p><p>  Petrovsko-Razumovskaya was opened in the seventies of the nineteenth century and since then has been an extremely important transport hub.  Today, the station serves up to four million passengers per year per year. </p><p>  Due to the fact that it was built on the model of stations of the nineteenth century, it had to be rebuilt several times.  As a result, two side platforms appeared, and the movement of trains occurs along four routes. </p><p>  The old station building is a classic example of Russian architecture.  Unfortunately, today it is closed.  It has not been used for many years for its intended purpose. </p><h2>  NATI station </h2><p>  The name of this station sounds a little eccentric, but in fact there is nothing strange in it.  The station was opened near the Scientific Automotive Institute, but was not in great demand until the beginning of the 2000s. </p><p>  Four years ago, the station and tracks had to be temporarily closed.  This was necessary because of the repair work that had to be done in the shortest possible time.  In just a few months, the station was transformed.  In this regard, an order was issued to include it in the list of obligatory stops in the <span>direction of Leningradsky</span> Station (Moscow) - Khimki.  In the schedule, she appeared two years ago.  But there is an exception. </p><p>  Only the high-speed ‚ÄúLastochka‚Äù, departing from the Leningradsky station to Khimki, can stop at the NATI station. </p><h2>  Mosselmash Station </h2><p>  Trains began to stop here four years after the end of World War II.  It was then that the station was commissioned.  It is interesting that in these years it was called Khovrino, as it was and remains to this day within this station.  However, in the sixty-fourth year of the last century, it was decided to rename the station.  The name was given to her by a nearby plant. </p><p>  For trains, suburban platforms are used.  It is convenient that they are interconnected by a bridge. </p><h2>  Khovrino Station </h2><p>  We already mentioned it in passing in the previous section, but the station itself occupies a more important place in the history of Russian railways.  The exact date of its discovery is unknown.  The documents have two dates, separated by almost ten years.  Roughly Khovrino was put into operation in the late nineteenth century. </p><p>  Initially, the station was opened as a freight transport hub and today the vast majority of such trains are here.  The village of Khovrino in the nineteenth century was an independent settlement.  Since the station was within its limits, the name received the corresponding.  In the sixties of the last century, the village became part of Moscow. </p><p>  The station is very conveniently located.  Passengers, having gone beyond its borders, can immediately take the desired bus.  Therefore, it is always crowded here.  In the near future it is planned to open the second Khovrino station.  This will slightly offload the two available platforms.  However, it is likely that due to an increase in passenger traffic, a few more trains will have to be added to the schedule. </p><p>  If we talk about the history of the station, then it owes its appearance to summer residents.  With the onset of summer, they came to these places en masse and the need for transport was very acute.   ,       ,   ,       . </p><p> At the beginning of the twentieth century, a huge new station appeared on the site of one platform; it was opened with great pomp.  And this was completely justified, because Khovrino turned into a real railway village with several buildings, mills, offices and towers.  Of all this splendor, only one station building has survived to this day.  It is abandoned and does not give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow beautiful it was here before. </p><h2>  Station Left Bank </h2><p>  The platform was opened in the thirty-eighth year of the last century.  Interestingly, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the station belonged to Krupskaya.  The need for a transportation hub arose after the transfer to the village of a whole branch of the library institute.  People were in urgent need of affordable transport, so a platform and access roads to it were built in two years near the village of Left Bank.  At the end of the twentieth century, the station was reconstructed several times. </p><p>  Today, the platform can take impressive trains of fourteen cars in length. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vistanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electric train &quot;Swallow&quot;" class="if uuid-2567305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567305.jpg"></div><h2>  Duration of Stops </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of the movement of electric trains in the direction we are interested in is the shortness of the stops.  Up to Khimki, the electric train does not stand at the station for more than one minute.  During this time, some passengers need to get out of the car, and others to go into it.  This is usually done in a hurry, especially during peak hours. </p><p>  It is interesting that the train moves very quickly.  The average time interval between stations is three minutes.  That is, from one platform to another, the train takes only one hundred and eighty seconds.  The exception is three stations: </p><ul><li>  from the station in Moscow to Riga six minutes; </li><li>  from Riga to Ostankino the electric train runs for four minutes; </li><li>  from Khovrino to the Left Bank, the journey lasts four minutes. </li></ul><p>  I would like to clarify that several types of trains run in this direction.  Therefore, the travel time may slightly differ from the figures given by us in this section. </p><h2>  Schedule of trains "Moscow - Khimki" from Leningradsky station </h2><p>  As we have already found out, the direction we are describing is very popular.  Therefore, passengers are often interested in the schedule of electric trains, especially since it has the property of being adjusted.  This happens quite often and forces you to check the schedule of the Khimki - Leningradsky Train Station for today or tomorrow before the trip.  And even with this approach, unpleasant overlays happen. </p><p>  In the summer months, about three hundred trains a day leave from the Leningradsky station to Khimki.  On average, one train leaves every four minutes.  The endpoint of the route is most often cities such as Klin, Zelenograd, Solnechnogorsk, Tver. </p><p>  However, passengers should always consult the schedule, where the train stops are indicated.  The fact is that there are marked stations where this electric train will not stop.  For example, at certain hours, the train going to Klin passes Khimki without stopping.  Then, at another time, he stops on all platforms along the route. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripsmile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="route &quot;Swallows&quot;" class="if uuid-2567080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567080.jpg"></div><h2>  High-speed train "Swallow" </h2><p>  Two years ago, an event happened, which was waiting for many people who daily go to work in Moscow.  Finally, a new electric train entered the line, which is capable of covering the distance to Tver in just an hour and a half.  Previously, this required more than two and a half hours. </p><p>  On such trains ride not only the residents of Tver, but also Zelenograd.  They, too, in their bulk, work in the capital, and therefore need transport that will significantly reduce travel time. </p><p>  During rush hours, when the railway traffic is at its peak, additional trains leave the route.  Thus, tension at intermediate stations is relieved.  Schedule of trains from Moscow, we provide below the text.  According to him, the first train leaves at five in the morning, during this period the time interval between departures will be from ten minutes to half an hour.  Passengers should take into account that the Leningradsky Station - Khimki (Swallow) electric train passes certain stations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripsmile.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Timetable" class="if uuid-2567118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2567118.jpg"></div><p>  This schedule is subject to change, so we advise you to check with the information bureau of the Leningradsky railway station or take information from the Internet before traveling. </p><p>  The cost of tickets for the "Swallow" depends on the end point of the route.  If you go to Khimki, then pay only one hundred and five rubles.  Tickets are subject to all the usual benefits.  That is, pensioners and people with disabilities get them at a reduced price, and students for half the cost. </p><p>  I would also like to say about the train itself.  Since the "Swallow" is a fundamentally new approach to commuter trips, the passengers here are always very comfortable and calm.  They can use Wi-Fi, charge their gadgets and even take off their outerwear.  In the new generation trains, dry closets are installed, which is already highly appreciated by millions of passengers. </p>
