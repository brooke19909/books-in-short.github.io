Bulgaria is an ancient country with a rich history, and there are many attractions.  One of the most important and interesting structures is the Assumption Cathedral (Varna).  We will tell about the history and features of this temple. </p><h2>  History of construction </h2><p>  Bulgaria has a long and dramatic history.  At the end of the 14th century, the lands of this country were occupied by the Ottoman Empire.  And for 5 centuries, Bulgaria could not gain independence.  At the end of the 19th century, with the assistance of the Russian army, the country managed to throw off the Ottoman yoke, in honor of this it was a pleasure to decide to build a new temple in Varna.  The Bulgarians understood the role of the Russian army in their liberation and were infinitely grateful to Emperor Alexander II for their help.  Therefore, the Assumption Cathedral (Varna), it was decided to devote to the recently deceased wife of the Russian Tsar Maria Alexandrovna.  The laying of the first stone of the cathedral was an important and solemn event; it happened on August 22, 1880.  The Bulgarian Metropolitan Simeon served a solemn prayer service on this occasion. </p><p>  But 5 years have passed from laying the first stone to the start of construction.  The fact is that the money necessary for the construction of the cathedral was collected by the whole world.  Simple Bulgarians, prosperous aristocrats and foreign citizens, including quite a lot of Russians, donated.  The king of Bulgaria made a significant amount, and a special lottery was organized, as a result of which 15 thousand tickets were distributed.  In 1885 the cathedral was completed, but another 5 years were required to eliminate all the imperfections.  And in 1886 the first liturgy was served here.  But the internal painting and decorating of the temple continued until the 1960s.  And today, the cathedral continues to raise funds for improvement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bnr.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral" class="if uuid-2960111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2960111.jpg"></div><h2>  Architectural style </h2><p>  Assumption Cathedral (Varna) was built in the eclectic style traditional for the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.  The prototype of the cathedral was the temple in Peterhof.  The initial project was developed by the architect Maas from Odessa.  Subsequently, the local architect M. Kupka finalized the plan.  This three-nave, cross-domed temple combines the features of traditional Byzantine and Russian cathedrals, as well as elements of European Gothic.  During the construction of the building, the Bulgarian king put forward the idea that the cathedral should be visible from any corner, and a special elevation was chosen for this.  The bell tower of the cathedral offers magnificent views of Varna.  In the construction of the church took a large number of local craftsmen.  The foundation material was stones of the destroyed Turkish citadel, and stones of Bulgarian deposits were used for decoration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varnaru.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral" class="if uuid-2960122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2960122.jpg"></div><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  For the interior design of the Assumption Cathedral (Varna), craftsmen from all over Bulgaria were invited.  Some of the icons for the temple were made by Russian masters.  The design of the iconostasis and the throne of the archbishop was undertaken by the brothers Philip and Vasily Filippov.  The patriarchal throne was made by skilled craftsmen from Macedonia, it is considered a real masterpiece of wood carving.  In 1902, the Russian emperor presented the cathedral with 40 beautiful Russian icons.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a team of Russian and Bulgarian artists led by Professor Rostovtsev painted the cathedral, they created magnificent frescoes that became a real gem of the interior of the cathedral.  The compositional center of the interior of the cathedral is the altar in the name of the Assumption of the Virgin.  The northern throne of the cathedral was consecrated in honor of St. Alexander Nevsky, the southern - in honor of the Bulgarian St. Nicholas of Myra, better known to Russians as Nikola the Wonderworker. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The final touch in the design of the church was the beautiful stained glass windows that appeared only in the 60s of the 20th century.  Already in the 21st century, an icon of the Royal Martyrs was brought to the cathedral from Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varnaru.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assumption Cathedral" class="if uuid-2960112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2960112.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral today </h2><p>  The program of tours to Bulgaria from Moscow certainly includes a trip to Varna and a visit to the Assumption Cathedral.
