Cost of vacation in Turkey</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Turkey has long been one of the most popular tourist destinations for citizens of the Russian Federation.  Of course, most of them want to relax in Antalya, since this area is considered the most developed in terms of infrastructure.  However, other Mediterranean resorts on the Turkish coast are also perfectly prepared to meet tourists from all over the world.  In addition, in cities located some distance from the international airport, for example, in Alanya, the prices are relatively low.  Do not believe?  Judge for yourself.  Here you can relax in a five-star hotel at the prices of a budget three-star.  For example, choosing the 5 * Insula Resort &amp; Spa hotel, located on the coast of Alanya, you will need to pay about 15,000 rubles (per week) for your stay.  This is surprisingly small!  In Antalya, a hotel of this category will cost twice as much. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of vacation in Turkey </h2><p>  For many Russians, this southern country is associated with cheap service.  However, turning to a travel agency, they understand that such information is not entirely true.  And that in Turkey, vacation can be both budgetary and very expensive.  It all depends on the class of the resort in which the selected hotel is located.  In Antalya, which is the capital and air gate of the Turkish Riviera, the cost of living in five-star hotels is much higher than in remote areas, for example, in Alanya.  So, in the aforementioned Insula Resort Spa 5 * (Turkey), as already noted, a weekly tour costs about 350 dollars, while in Antalya rooms in a deluxe hotel cost from 700 dollars a week and more.  The price is also affected by the price of the transfer and the number of excursions included in the package.  On average, sightseeing tours cost $ 200-300 more.  In a word, those tourists who want to get the highest level of service, but want to save money, can choose the resort of Alanya.  Of course, you can relax in an expensive resort by choosing <span>good</span> <span>4</span> * <span>hotels in Turkey</span> .  However, why stay in a four-star hotel when you can book a 5 * hotel at the same price, but in Alanya?  In addition, this city is interesting in terms of cognitive relaxation.  There are many attractions here.  Tours at the Insula Resort <span>Spa 5 *</span> hotel usually include a rich excursion program, which makes them popular in the tourist market. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Alanya: walled city </h2><p>  This resort is 125 km from <span>Antalya</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  It is popular among young people.  There are many entertainment venues: discos, nightclubs, bars, etc. Because of this, it is considered the noisiest of the Turkish resorts.  The hallmark of this town is a fortress dating from the 4th century BC.  In addition to hotels of various categories, campsites and pensions are scattered throughout the coast.  The disadvantage of the coast is that there is sparse vegetation.  However, the hotel administration, in order to correct this "flaw", is intensely engaged in landscaping its territories.  So, for example, around the building of the Insula Resort Spa 5 * there are many tubs with palm trees and other tropical plants, and well-groomed lawns and flower beds are pleasing to the eye.  The coast of Alanya is divided into several areas: Avsallar, Mahmutlar, Konkaly, and others. In the last of the above, the aforementioned hotel is located. </p><h2>  The southern village of Konakly </h2><p>  There are approximately 30 hotels on this territory.  Until recently, there were almost no five-star hotels, but in recent years, due to the increase in the flow of tourists and the popularization of the resort, the need has arisen for the construction of extra-class hotels.  In addition, many four-star holiday homes have undergone reconstruction, which significantly increased their degree of comfort.  As a result, some of them added one more to their 4 stars.  For example, the Royal Vikingen Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, built in 1990, began to be called Insula Resort Spa 5 * since 2013.  After renaming and upgrading the service, the hotel has improved significantly.  As for the village of Konakli in general, it offers tourists a lot of entertainment, small pebble and sometimes sandy beaches, the opportunity to engage in water sports, as well as attractions for adults and children, and much more.  By the way, the swimming season here begins in May and closes at the end of September.  In the high season, the average air temperature in these parts is +27 ¬∞ C. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  From both Russian capitals, and also from other large cities, both scheduled and charter flights are carried out to Antalya.  If you bought a tour to the Insula Resort Spa 5 *, then flying to Antalya is the right decision.  From here it will already be possible to get to Konakli by road.  Typically, trips to this five-star hotel include a transfer fee, and then upon arrival at the airport you will be met by a tour operator and will comfortably deliver you to the complex.  The journey from Antalya to Konakli takes about 2 hours.  However, don‚Äôt worry, roads are Turkey‚Äôs special pride.  They are always in excellent condition.  If you refused the transfer, then you can get to the hotel either by taxi (for a couple of hundreds of euros!), Or by dolmush or bus (for several tens of liras), depending on the distance.  By the way, Russian tourists do not need a visa to enter Turkey.  However, without it, you cannot stay in the country for more than 60 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insula resort spa 5 turkey" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/527063.jpg" width="388"></div>

On the other hand, tourists are very pleased with the cuisine, service, staff attitude.  In many reviews, you can find words of gratitude to the animators, thanks to which the rest turned out to be very rich and interesting.  But many people rate the beach at 3 points, because the sand here is loose, which means that the bottom is not sandy, rocky, and if you don‚Äôt stock up with special slippers, you can injure your legs.  In addition, the big disadvantage is that this hotel is located on the edge of the road, so vacationers complain about the noise and the inability to at least occasionally open the windows. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So you know what this hotel is.  Turkey, Insula Resort and the wonderful coast of Alanya are waiting for you! </p>
