    <h2>  What is a pronounced tropical climate? </h2><p>  Goa is located in the Northern Hemisphere, as is Russia.  But unlike the Russian Federation, it is already very close to the equator.  Therefore, the climate in Goa is characterized as pronounced tropical.  What does it mean?  For a person who is not initiated into meteorological processes and does not know about the impact of the monsoon on the climate, let's say simply.  There are two seasons in Goa.  The first is dry, when the minimum amount of precipitation falls, the humidity decreases, and the sea is very calm.  This period is justifiably considered a high tourist season.  It occurs in November, the winter months and March.  In April and May, the dry season continues, but it can no longer be called a high tourist season.  The heat intensifies to +37 degrees in the shade.  May in Goa is considered the hottest month of the year.  Finally, the rainy season continues throughout the summer months and September. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  October is considered a transition period.  And the question of when it is better to go to Goa can be answered this way: from November to February.  But what about March?  This month meteorologists attribute to summer in terms of temperature.  But March is also considered a dry season.  Let's deal with this in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="March Goa Weather" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133944.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Weather in Goa in March </h2><p>  Yes, many tourists claim that the temperature in this state is more comfortable for Europeans in the winter.  Since March, the thermometer is inexorably creeping up day after day.  The average daily temperature is +27 degrees.  But meteorologists also include in this indicator the first hours after dawn, when it is still quite fresh.  And if we consider the day as a period from 11 to 16, then at this time the thermometer shows all +33 degrees.  And this is at the beginning of the month.  There are also very hot years.  For example, in 2014, the temperature in Goa in March was +37 degrees in the shade.  Do not wait for coolness at night in the first month of spring.  In January, tour operators advised their customers to take long-sleeved clothing on a trip to Goa.  In March, the temperature at night does not fall below + 24-25 degrees.  The sun of the tropics knows no mercy.  Be sure to take a protective cream and a hat with you on a trip to India. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="When is it better to go to goa" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133947.jpg"></div>

The first month of spring refers to the dry season.  Precipitation in March is only three millimeters.  In simple terms, only one day in a month can be rainy.  And even then it will not be a prolonged downpour, but slight precipitation for half an hour.  The sky above the heads of tourists in March is mostly clear.  Minor small clouds may appear.  But these harbingers of the wet season are rare guests even at the end of the month.  But the humidity is slightly higher than in February.  This figure averages March at 71 percent.  But for the tropics, this is quite acceptable.  Tourists claim that they did not have the feeling of a Russian steam bath in Goa in March.  Especially easily tolerated tropical (and increasingly increasing towards the end of the month) heat off the coast.  During the day, a fresh breeze blows from the sea, so the heat becomes invisible.  But air conditioning in the room is a prerequisite for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Of course, tourists going to Goa want to not only get a bronze tan.  How about water treatments in Goa in March?  It should be said that the Arabian Sea off the west coast of India is never cold.  Another thing is storms.  In the winter months, the water element calms down.  There is practically no wind, the waves are small.  But March reminds tourists that the high season is coming to an end.  The monsoon wind begins to blow, which by June will bring heavy rainfall to India.  True, in March it is small, only seven kilometers per hour.  He does not cause serious storms.  But there are years with extreme performance.  So, in March 2008, a very strong storm passed off the coast of Goa, accompanied by a downpour.  But such cases occur once every few years.  Tourists who visited Goa this spring assure that the weather was wonderful all month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa tours in March" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133940.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays, events </h2><p>  When planning a trip to Goa for March, you should be aware that your vacation can be not only beach, but also informative.  In India, as in the northern latitudes, celebrate the departure of winter.  Such Shrovetide is called Holi in the country, and Shigmo in Goa.  The culmination of the holiday is Wadlo, which lasts for five days.  In the cities and towns of Goa, people pour water on each other and showered with dye in powder.  So at such a time you should not wear expensive and new clothes, and the camera needs to be hidden in a waterproof case.  Suddenly Shigmo is accompanied by a carnival, street processions and dances. </p><p>  In some years, at the end of February, but most often at the beginning of March, the holiday of Shivratri is celebrated.  God Shiva is considered the patron of spiritual development.  Therefore, on his holiday seminars and trainings on the study of yoga are organized.  And it will be interesting for Christians to take part in the procession of all saints, which is celebrated on the fifth Monday of Great Lent (according to the Gregorian calendar).  On this day, residents of Old Goa, many of whom profess Catholicism by virtue of the Portuguese colonial past, take out 31 statues from the cathedral. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa march reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133946.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cons of the March holiday </h2><p>  This month closes the high season curtain.  Air temperatures are no longer as comfortable for a European as in winter.  And at the end of the month the heat becomes simply unbearable for many.  Humidity also increases.  The steam room effect is not there yet, but it is already difficult to breathe.  The weather in Goa in March can be changeable.  There are no great storms yet, but the wind creates a steady surf.  For young children and people who cannot swim, this can be a problem.  Due to the heat and stuffiness, I no longer want to go on excursions.  Tourists in their reviews say that they were limited only to boat trips and participation in the open-air-trans-party.  Going to Goa in March, you must book an air-conditioned room.  Without it, rest will turn into torment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa in March prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133945.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pros of March holidays </h2><p>  In the summer months, Goa is cooler than in spring, due to heavy rainfall and clouds tightly covering the sky.  Therefore, those who wish to "calcify the bones" can safely go here in March.  Surfers will also find great surf with long waves.  The best spots for professionals are Twin Peaks and Ashvem Rock.  And beginners can try to ride a wave on a board in Shanti, Kivis and Arambol.  But the best advantage of a holiday in Goa in March is the price.  They are markedly reduced compared to the winter months.  If you are an unassuming tourist and consider North Goa (this part of the state is always cheaper than the southern one), then a week-long stay for two with a flight from Moscow can cost you fifty thousand rubles.  A similar tour, but to a five-star hotel (if you take a "burning" ticket) will cost from 59,000 to 88,600 rubles.  (from 1000 to 1500 dollars) per person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goa Travel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133950.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Goa in March: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited this ‚Äúmost non-Indian state of the country‚Äù in the early spring of 2017 claim that the weather was wonderful throughout their vacation.  The Arabian Sea is very warm, its temperature reached +28 degrees.  There wasn‚Äôt much excitement, but if you want complete calm, then you should choose resorts with a beach located between two capes, such as Palolem and Agodna in the south, Fort Aguada (Coco Beach) and Vagator in the north.  At the beginning of the calendar spring there is still no rainfall, you only need an umbrella from the sun.  The wind is constant, but not gusty and not strong. </p><p>  Hotel prices are slightly lower than in winter, but they are higher than in summer when the tropics have rainy season.  But the fan can no longer cope with the increasing heat.  In the first month of the calendar spring, many interesting events take place in India.  You can enjoy Ayurvedic treatments, go on various excursions, and become a member of colorful festivals.  So, you can safely go on tours to Goa in March - you have a good rest. </p>
