Like delicate coconut filling, snow-white sand underfoot.  Juicy leaves of palm trees, as if sprinkled with oil and grated to a gloss.  The gentle turquoise of the lagoon, mixing at the horizon with ocean aquamarine ... languid bliss, like milk chocolate, is poured in the air ... Paradise pleasure!  Do such places really exist on our planet or all of these are Photoshop tricks?  Even as they exist!  This is Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana <span>(Dominican Republic).</span> </p><p>  If you like three kilometers of white as snow and fine, like fine flour, sand, then here you are.  As a bonus, a developed beach infrastructure is attached.  And on this chic coast there is a no less luxurious hotel complex called Vista Sol Punta Cana Beach Resort Casino 4 *.  The characteristics of this hotel will be devoted to our article.  The review of the hotel is based solely on reviews from tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Where is it located and what is it </h2><p>  The eastern tip <span>of Haiti is</span> interesting in that there are virtually no hurricanes.  All the rampage of the elements usually fall on the west coast, and while they get to Punta Cana, they subside.  Even during the rainy season, which in the Dominican Republic lasts from May to July, precipitation falls only for two hours a day.  And this means that throughout the year you can relax on the beach of Bavaro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact that the hotel complex Vista Sol Punta Cana Beach Resort 4 * has a direct relationship to this coast is evidenced by its former name: Carabela Bavaro Beach Resort.  In July 2013, the famous chain of Vista Sol Hotels bought Carabel.  Rebranding with a parallel overhaul benefited the hotel.  Small two- and three-story buildings are buried in lush tropical greenery.  Peacocks walk slowly through this marvelous garden.  Guests receive a free shuttle service to the Tower Casino, which is why the word Casino is often found in the name of the hotel.  Nearby is the village of El Cortecito, and the nearest town, Higuey, is forty-five kilometers away.  Transfer from Punta Cana Airport takes about twenty minutes. </p>

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  Guests of the hotel complex Vista Sol Punta Cana <span>Beach Resort 4 *</span> live in ten buildings.  Five of them have elevators.  Double rooms are divided into standard, superior and junior suite rooms.  For large families, there are duplex - twin rooms with a common door.  The junior suites are a bedroom and a living area.  These rooms are located in buildings directly on the beach.  But even in the simplest rooms for guests there is a balcony or terrace.  The standard rooms have an empty small fridge, and in the superior and suites there is a minibar with free drinks.  A manual air conditioning will provide a climate in the room that you prefer.  Each room has a TV with satellite channels.  But, as our compatriots annoy in their reviews, there are no Russians among them.  But tourists are surprised to note that there is an iron and an ironing board, which is not often seen in the "four".  Maids even change their linen without tipping and clean the rooms every day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Vista Sol Punta Cana 4 * (Dominican Republic) operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Moreover, unlike other club hotels, here really any drinks and snacks are free.  The main restaurant, Norei, serves buffet meals.  For the early birds in a hurry to take a lounger at dawn, there is good news: it is not necessary to leave the beach for breakfast.  After all, right on the coast is the Beach Snackbar hotel bar.  It serves a <span>continental breakfast</span> and snacks all day. </p><p>  The hotel has as many as four à la carte restaurants.  In order to have dinner in them, only a preliminary reservation at the reception is required.  These are specialized restaurants: “Mama Mia” - Italian cuisine, “El Mariachi” - Mexican, “Creperi” and “El Almirante” - international.  The feast of the stomach can be continued in the bars: “Balandro”, “Ankla”, “Katelepo”, “Cabo”, “La Cubierta”. </p><p>  The hotel even has a Self service bar - self-catering.  And, of course, the pool also has three bars.  Estimates that tourists give to a varied and hearty meal at the Vista Sol Punta Cana Hotel are 3-5. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Bavaro (Dominican Republic) </h2><p>  This wonderful beach is famous throughout the country.  The smallest snow-white sand has an amazing property of not repenting under the baking Caribbean sun.  Palm trees grow on all three kilometers of this long beach, creating an extra shadow.  In addition, eight hundred meters from the coast is a coral reef.  It is not only a magnet for divers and snorkellers.  The reef also protects the shallow waters from cold currents, high waves and dangerous sea creatures. </p><p>  Although the coastal strip <span>in the Dominican Republic</span> is in the public domain, the Vista Sol Punta Cana Beach Resort 4 * hotel has a separate corner on it.  Rangers vigilantly ensure that hotel loungers are not occupied by an outside audience.  All seats are reserved for holders of hotel bracelets. </p><p>  Bavaro beach has a very developed entertainment infrastructure.  Young people especially like to ride kiting.  It is interesting to watch their pirouettes in the sky even for those who are far from water sports. </p>

    <h2>  Pools </h2><p>  Many tourists sing <span>praises to these</span> artificial lagoons with islets of greenery and bars in the form of native huts.  The hotel complex Vista Sol Punta Cana Beach Resort 4 * has three outdoor pools with crystal clear fresh water.  Two of them are adjacent to the Jacuzzi.  For children, the hotel has two small ponds. </p><p>  The entire terrace along the shores of artificial lagoons is lined with sunbeds and umbrellas with mattresses.  Beach towels are provided free of charge.  Due to the size and meandering shapes of these tanks, there is no sense of crush and walrus rookery.  You can always find a free sunbed and enjoy relaxing in peace and quiet. </p><p>  This can not be said about the beach.  Bavaro is too famous for being forgotten by active tourists from all over Punta Cana and even the Dominican Republic.  It is often crowded here, especially in winter - during the "high season". </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel complex Vista Sol Punta Cana Beach Resort Casino 4 * (Dominicana) has a developed infrastructure.  A hairdresser and laundry services are available at an extra charge.  Currency can be changed without leaving the hotel.  You can also rent a car to freely explore the sights of the country.  For shopaholics, there are a number of boutiques and a supermarket nearby. </p><p>  It is not necessary to bring a memory card full of wonderful pictures.  The photo store will print them in the format you need. </p><p>  In case of a sudden illness or injury, the doctor is constantly on duty at the hotel.  The main thing is not to forget to take out medical insurance.  Then the services of a doctor will not cost you a dime. </p><p>  The territory has its own massage room, which tourists recommend visiting. </p>

    <h2>  Vista Sol Punta Cana 4 * reviews (Dominican Republic) </h2><p>  Most of the guests were satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  Many liked the decoration of the rooms, decorated in bright rich colors.  All furniture and plumbing are new.  The suites located directly on the beach look especially luxurious.  But from other buildings to the sea you need to go a couple of meters - the whole hotel is built parallel to the coastline. </p><p>  Children liked the animals on the territory - peacocks and other exotic birds. </p><p>  For those who do not know foreign languages: a Russian-speaking girl works at the reception.  In the mini-club, one of the animators will also perfectly communicate with your child. </p><p>  All tourists claim that you cannot limit yourself to staying at Vista Sol Punta Cana.  The Dominican Republic, Punta Cana in particular, is crowded with various attractions.  And they are also worth a look. </p>
