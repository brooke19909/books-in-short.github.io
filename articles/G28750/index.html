Of course, you will not get warm in Turkey in January, but Tunisia will be a good alternative even in November.  In addition, to purchase a mild tan in the middle of autumn is the best result of an excellent holiday. </p><p>  North Africa, despite its "cold name", attracts many tourists precisely out of season.  When the city has slush, strong winds and freezing rain, Tunisia will ‚Äúcome to the rescue‚Äù and provide an unforgettable vacation in the middle of autumn. </p><h2>  Fairy tale city </h2><p>  Hotel El Mouradi Hammamet Menzah 4 *, which will be discussed, is located in the beautiful sunny city of Hammamet.  The name of this settlement from the Turkic language means "place for swimming", and it is absolutely justified.  Hammamet is a fairy tale city.  There are clean beaches, magnificent architecture, led by the old quarter of Medina.  The resort has many hotels and treatment centers.  Walking through the streets of the city, you can easily hide in the shade of olive trees and orange plantations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi hammamet menzah 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432455.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are even a couple of streets that are ‚Äústrewn‚Äù with discos and bars.  The most popular night club is Oasis.

You can wander around the bazaar with pleasant little things and sit in cozy restaurants.  By the way, there are about 20 of them in the territory of this complex. </p><p>  Perhaps it is worth recalling another <span>attraction of Hammamet</span> that every tourist should visit - the home of a millionaire from Romania, which was built in the last century.  Around the building rise cypress trees, near a wide pool surrounded by columns.  Inside the house are many luxurious bathrooms and bedrooms.  By the way, in the garden of this house is the famous amphitheater, inviting here in July / August to the art festival. </p><h2>  What do they say? </h2><p>  Basically about the hotel El Mouradi Hammamet Menzah 4 * positive reviews.  To avoid disappointment, you should immediately examine the hotel and understand that this place will be a bit noisy for lovers of "sleep longer".  The first thing tourists face is flying.  The fact is that you need to be careful in choosing the city of arrival.  The fact is that the nearest airport is in Anfida, it is a 15-20 minute drive from the hotel.  Some inattentive travelers arrive in the town of Monastir, from where you need to get more than an hour and a half. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi hammamet menzah 4 tunisia hammamet" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432451.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists noted the similarity of the hotel with a well, inside which is a swimming pool.  It looks very nice, but in fact it turns out that it is better to have windows on the opposite side.  The fact is that more than once there were complaints about morning activities near the pool.  A sutra here is already gathering a crowd of people ready to sing and dance in the water.  Also, babies wake up early.  But closed windows and doors are not enough to muffle the noise of both morning walks and night gatherings. </p><p>  Those who traveled in May complained about the cool water in the pool and the sea.  But these are more climate issues.  There were also problems with the beach.  As you know, the hotel has its own coastal area.  But here both local and tourists from other hotels can come here, since the beach is free.  Therefore, many find a way to make their way to neighboring territories for a fee. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is good.  Few complained about the lack of diversity.  Breakfast includes a lot of pastries and fruit.  That was the problem with the late dinner.  In the evening, the hotel likes to serve fast food: pizza and burgers.  Such food is certainly more suitable for guests returning from discos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="el mouradi hammamet menzah 4 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1432456.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The impression of a vacation in Tunisia is twofold.  The thing is that this is a poor country living at the expense of tourism.  People work for the benefit of this industry, but the culture of communication is often not enough.  Not every traveler will like some familiarity from the hotel staff, as well as their love of money.  It is noticed that if you give the waiter ‚Äútea‚Äù, he will begin to work better and fuss more.  On the beach, annoying merchants strained with food and camels.  Otherwise, a vacation in Tunisia brings a lot of positive impressions. </p>
