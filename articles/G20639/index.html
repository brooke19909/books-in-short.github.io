The warm Black Sea, the Caucasus mountain ranges, fresh air, rich southern vegetation - all this is located here.  Thousands of tourists every year seek to visit this wonderful land.  Some people drive their own cars, while others prefer to fly very quickly by plane.  But there are many who like to travel by train. </p><h2>  Sochi - "paradise" </h2><p>  In the Krasnodar Territory, the most popular city is Sochi.  It is located 1700 kilometers from Moscow.  They sing songs about Sochi, compose poems and write poems.  But he gained even more popularity after he was declared the capital of the 2014 Olympic Games.  When this happened, Sochi immediately began to prepare in every possible way for such a bright event.  Workers day and night were engaged in the construction of Olympic and infrastructure facilities.  One of the most important tasks was also to ensure the comfort and safety of arriving passengers. </p><p>  Accordingly, the restructuring of railway stations and airports has begun.  Already by 2013, the construction of many facilities was completed - they grew like mushrooms in the recently empty areas.  Local residents treated the construction of such a scale with understanding and patience.  As a reward for this, they received the equipment of their hometown with all sorts of innovations in the sports world and an endless stream of foreign tourists.  And not only the residents of Sochi were involved in all this action.  The construction also affected the surrounding areas and localities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What Adler is famous for </h2><p>  About half a century ago, Adler was annexed to Sochi and became its district.  The main attraction of this settlement is the <span>Olympic Park,</span> which holds competitions in almost all ice sports. </p><p>  The railway station of Adler was and remains one of the largest transport hubs on the entire Black Sea coast.  Currently, it has a very large territory, which includes several buildings. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye is the new station building, its area is more than 23,000 square meters, it is the height of a ten-story building.  The main goal of building a terminal of such enormous size was to fully service the flow of passengers from all over the world who arrived in Sochi at the 2014 Olympics. </p><p>  The construction of the new building lasted about four years.  The project was developed by Russian and German architects under the leadership of Alexei Danilenko.  The result was an ideal train station, which later became a winner in several categories of the competition held among the best facilities erected for the 2014 Olympic Games.  The ceremony dedicated to the opening of this facility was attended by many famous people.  Of course, the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin could not miss such an event. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Locals are very proud that they have such a wonderful train station.  It is very pleasant to spend time here, almost like in modern shopping centers. </p>

    <h2>  How many train stations in Adler </h2><p>  In addition to the new large terminal, the old building has been preserved in the city.  It is somewhat more modest in size, but this does not detract from its architectural features.  It was built in the fifties, when Adler was not yet part of Sochi.  The old building has a very interesting and beautiful design: there are columns and stucco elements covered with gold paint, and the windows and entrance structure are made in the form of arches.  Currently, in the old building of the railway station there are: a museum, a restaurant, a superior hall, a dining room, ticket offices, etc. </p>
