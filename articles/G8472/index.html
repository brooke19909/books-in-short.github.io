In addition, more than one and a half thousand people can simultaneously relax at the concert venue, where famous groups come to perform in the city.  A monument to the French revolutionary Francisco de Miranda was erected on one of the central sections of the park.  This monument is a place that newlyweds traditionally come to with flowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parks of St. Petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470247.jpg" width="600"></div>  The people have preserved many legends about the importance of this pedestal for the couple, what role plays in their future fate.  Some even believe that going after marriage registration to the Park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg is a prerequisite that must be met.  Also, there are always a lot of lovers who still do not think about the wedding, but simply want to take a walk and enjoy communication.

    <h2>  "Divo Ostrov" </h2><p>  Krestovsky Island in St. Petersburg is known for its magnificent amusement park.  Its name is familiar to most locals.  It is called "Divo Island".  This is truly a fabulous corner.  Even children know that the island on which this wonderful park is located is Krestovsky.  St. Petersburg attracts many travelers in part because of it.  This park opened in the spring of 2003. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="amusement park in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470248.jpg" width="400"></div>  Its location is very good, as there is a metro station nearby.  And most importantly - the green park is located in one of the ecologically clean places.  Divo Ostrov provides visitors with many services.  Everyone can choose the rides as they wish, visit one of the five thematic cafes, the menus and designs of which are very different.  At several venues, shows and performances of artists are held.  What is very important - everything is thought out here so that recreation and entertainment on the rides are safe for customers: equipment was purchased from well-known manufacturers.

This is his undoubted advantage.  During the summer season, all attractions operate here, and with the onset of cold weather on weekends and holidays, the park opens for walks.  Wrong are those who think that Divo-Ostrov is good only for children's recreation and entertainment.  Everyone is welcome here, from young to old, and confirmation of this is the organization of a memorable vacation for people of any age, although, of course, they come here most often with kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krestovsky park St. Petersburg" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470249.jpg" width="300"></div>  All available attractions are divided into family, children and extreme.  So, for example, "Roller coaster" has already become an extreme classic.  But there are also attractions here that are not found anywhere else in the world, because they were made to order.

    <h2>  Park created in memory of the Victory </h2><p>  Previously, there was an abandoned place on the site of Victory Park, which they were going to equip for a long time.  But the war began, and it was no longer before the development of the wasteland.  Years passed, and now on Victory Street, on the corner of Moskovsky Prospekt, there is the Memorial zone of the park.  It reminds us of the siege of Leningrad and the wartime that the city survived.  Today Victory Park is famous for its dendrological garden, where at present about sixty various shrubs and trees are planted, among which there are such representatives of green plantations as oak, birch, <span>blue spruce,</span> larch, poplar, elm, maple, chestnut. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Victory Park in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470251.jpg" width="600"></div>  All parks of St. Petersburg are striking in their splendor, but this one is beyond competition.  There are also bird cherry, ash, mountain ash, viburnum, linden, lilac.  Spirea, cotoneaster, dogrose, <span>alpine currants</span> also grow <span>.</span>  In addition, from the beginning of spring to the end of autumn, every year in the flower beds you can see up to ninety thousand flowers that daily delight people with their uniqueness and beauty.  Victory Park in St. Petersburg is a favorite place for lovers of beauty.  Here you can really enjoy the magnificent nature.

    <h2>  Another historical place </h2><p>  Alexander Park was created by decree of Nicholas I, it took almost a decade - from 1842 to 1852.  Today this place is considered one of the best in the city.  After the October Revolution, Alexander Park and the People‚Äôs House became known to many: Lenin came here to give his speeches, there were meetings of revolutionaries, and often ordinary festivities were organized here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Park St. Petersburg" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470250.jpg" width="600"></div>  Alexandrovsky Park has seen many significant events in its lifetime.  St. Petersburg can be proud of such a wonderful historical place.  Unfortunately, in the early thirties, the building of the People‚Äôs House died in a fire.  After some time, a new architectural structure was built in its place, the premises of which housed the Lenin Komsomol Theater.

    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  Towards the centenary of St. Petersburg, a large reconstruction was carried out in the park: firstly, the lighting was updated, then the fence was painted, and most importantly, a variety of shrubs and trees were planted, a lot of well-groomed lawns appeared.  And for the city anniversary, locals received expensive unique gifts from Switzerland - original metal benches and amazingly beautiful floral watches.  It is impossible to convey in words the lofty feelings that arise in every person who visited the Alexander Park!  St. Petersburg is an amazing city with many wonderful places.  This park is definitely one of them. </p><h2>  Wonderful place for families </h2><p>  Seaside park from two sides - north and south - comes close to the seashore and is limited to island coastlines.  Its central part is a huge area, and from it, like the sun's rays, alleys are sent in all directions.  Seaside Park is often compared to the Botanical Garden, because its plant world is very rich and diverse.  Among this green kingdom are six ponds.  The most famous of them is not without reason that it bears the beautiful name ‚ÄúSwan Lake‚Äù: it is a bird nursery and the place where they live.  We can say that their house is Seaside Park.  St. Petersburg is one of the Russian cities famous for its rich fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaside Park St. Petersburg" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/470252.jpg" width="600"></div>  Among other things, here you can take long walks along shady alleys and relax on the banks of small ponds.  And nearby, attractions were built to entertain visitors, restaurants and cozy cafes.  Not far from them is a huge free ice rink, whose area is about three thousand square meters.  There is a place in the park dedicated to memorable military events.  Here you can see the pillbox of the period of the Great Patriotic War.  Parks of St. Petersburg are famous throughout the country, and they all deserve attention.  Every visitor should visit at least some of them.
