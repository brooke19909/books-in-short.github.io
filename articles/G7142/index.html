In this device, the internal memory reaches 256 MB, so the main necessary plug-ins are already installed and do not require additional configuration.  In addition, a simple LED display has been added for ease of use.  Linux is installed on the receiver, and Fortis (Korea) is the device‚Äôs developers.  In the updated receiver, you can open Internet browsers, as well as watch videos from YouTube, while the maximum playback quality will be 1080p.  In addition, you can use DLNA services and Internet-TV, view the current weather forecast, and play media files in MKV, Xvid and DivX formats.  At the same time, Openbox S4 PRO + is economical in terms of electricity consumption, and during operation its case does not heat up much.  This is due to the modern STMicroelectronics processor - STi7110. </p><p>  By the way, for ease of use, the receiver has a special VesaMount mount, with which you can fix it to the back of the TV.  The card reader is universal, and supports almost all cards of operators.  To do this, you need to install and configure the necessary emulators.  This device has a high-quality satellite tuner, thanks to which you can receive signals in the standards - DVB-S and DVB-S2 (with QPSK and 8PSK modulation). </p><p>  If you compare the Openbox S4 PRO + and Vu + Solo2 receivers, which also appeared on sale <noindex>  <span>here</span> </noindex>  , it is worth noting that the latter is also the brainchild of a Korean company and is equipped with the Linux operating system.  This is an updated version of its predecessors, and thanks to the new more powerful processor (Broadcom BCM7356) is now equipped with additional features.  Two non-removable tuners of the DVB-S2 standard come with it, so you can receive signals in the DVB-S and DVB-S2 standards.  The device works perfectly with external equipment through protocols: DiSEq C 1.0,1.1,1,1.2, as well as through USALS.  The advantage of this receiver over Openbox is the presence in it of 1 gigabyte of RAM.  And the installed network controller allows you to transfer data at a speed of up to 30-40 MB per second.  You can familiarize yourself with the devices in more detail by reading the detailed characteristics of these devices. </p></div></article>
