It will also be useful to understand the pros and cons of this product.  After all, the choice of a modern smartphone is not so simple.  Many buyers for a long time can not decide which phone they need.  We have to study not only the advantages and disadvantages of offers, but also consumer reviews.  Despite the fact that opinions differ quite often, you can extract something useful for yourself from them.  So what features delight or upset customers in the <span>Prestigio</span> Grace Q5 <span>phone</span> model?  What should you focus on first?  How good is a smartphone? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the studied product?  The thing is that the Prestigio Grace Q5, reviews of which will be presented later, is a modern phone from a rather successful creator.  Prestigio is trusted by customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio grace q5 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416501.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The smartphone allows you to realize all the modern features.  You can call him, and use the Internet, and even take photos and videos.  The most ordinary smartphone of our time.  Outwardly, he is not much different from his "brothers."  What characteristics does he have?  What should buyers pay attention to to decide exactly how much the smartphone meets the needs of the majority? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The first thing they pay attention to is design.  The thing is that externally, as already mentioned, Prestigio Grace Q5 is not much different from other models of smartphones.  It is quite large in size, without sharp corners.  The front panel is primarily a display. </p><p>  Ultrathin model can not be called.  After all, the thickness of the device is 8.3 millimeters.  Not too little by modern standards.  Prestigio Grace Q5 receives positive reviews for its size.  Large, but in the hand, as buyers say, lies comfortably.  The phone is almost 71 millimeters wide and 142.5 inches high. </p><p>  There are several types of colors.  Classic black is preferred.  The device weighs a lot - 150 grams.  According to customers, if such a phone is in your pocket, you can not forget about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about prestigio grace q5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416502.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Of course, the fundamental detail of almost any smartphone for the modern user is the display.  It is he who receives a lot of attention when choosing gadgets. </p><p>  Customer reviews for the Prestigio Grace Q5 in this area are mostly positive.  The display has a diagonal of 5 inches, it is made using multi-touch technology.  The screen resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels, which is a very good indicator for a modern mobile. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The picture on the display is clear.  The screen is well protected from scratches, but it is not shockproof.  Regarding the Prestigio Grace Q5, reviews indicate that it is worth watching that the display does not have unnecessary damage.  Otherwise, certain problems may arise.  About them a little later. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The next important feature is the device‚Äôs camera.  A modern telephone is not just a technique that allows you to make calls.  It must be a multifunctional device.  Many use smartphones instead of cameras. </p><p>  Prestigio Grace Q5 reviews in this area are mixed.  The thing is that the phone has two cameras: a front 5 MP and a rear 8 MP.  As buyers assure, not the best performance, but not bad.  For amateur pictures and good video communication, as well as for selfie, this phone is 100% suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="customer reviews about prestigio grace q5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416503.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At night, the camera shoots well, in motion - somewhat inferior to most similar phones.  But at the same time, it is still possible to make high-quality pictures.  There is a flash and autofocus.  In skillful hands, the images are almost perfect.  Just what modern buyers need.  8 megapixels for the rear camera with autofocus and face recognition technology - this is enough to have good photos. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  A few more important components are different types of memory.  Reviews about the <span>Prestigio</span> Grace Q5 <span>smartphone</span> leave very mixed reviews in this area.  After all, here everyone has their own significant requests.  Camera, display and design are characteristics that do not determine the power of the phone.  Where memory plays a big role here. </p><p>  In total, the smartphone has 2 memory - operational and normal.  The first provides 1 GB, the second - 8. RAM, as many say, is not enough.  Indeed, for a modern smartphone, especially a gaming one, such indicators are a drawback.  Only reviews of Prestigio Grace Q5 indicate that this product is not a gaming gadget.  Games are launched on it, but the smartphone‚Äôs power is not enough for the latest innovations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="customer reviews on prestigio grace q5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416504.jpg"></div>

    <p>  There is not much usual "user" memory, but if you wish, you can install an additional card to increase the space.  As a rule, there are no complaints about the place on the phone.  Just keep in mind that the maximum enthusiasm for free space is 32 GB.  As the reviews on the Prestigio Multiphone Grace mobile phone indicate, if you use a memory card of 64 GB or more, the device‚Äôs operating system will begin to fail and freeze as 32 gigabytes fill up. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The telephone operating system is another important feature.  The thing is that customer reviews about Prestigio Grace Q5 indicate that customers are satisfied with this component.  There is nothing particularly new here. </p><p>  The smartphone has Android 5.1.  The classic and familiar interface for many allows you to easily manage the gadget without any problems.  Nothing freezes and does not bug.  Sometimes, of course, the phone slows down a bit.  Especially if the device has been used for a long time or many programs are running in the system.  However, if you believe the reviews, then similar problems are observed in all phones. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery of the device deserves special attention.  The operating time of the smartphone also affects the responses.  Regarding this component, reviews about the Prestigio Grace Q5 phone are mixed. </p><p>  On the one hand, the smartphone works efficiently and for a long time - 2 days without recharging with active use.  On the other hand, some consider this a short time, although in practice this is not so.  In the talk mode, the gadget lasts for 8 hours, like most analogs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone prestigio grace q5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416505.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Only one drawback is that in the event of a battery breakdown or malfunction, difficulties will arise with the replacement of a component.  Owners of the Prestigio Grace Q5 indicate that it is difficult to get any spare parts from the phone.  This must be considered before buying a smartphone. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what the Prestigio Grace Q5 5506 reviews are.  Cons and pros of this device also became known.  But an important role is also played by such a component as the cost of the gadget. </p><p>  The thing is that many are satisfied with the price of the Prestigio Grace Q5.  According to customers, this is a mid-range device.  On average, a model costs 7,500 - 8,000 rubles.  It's not that expensive.  For the proposed phone and even more so. </p><p>  Yes, you can find a smartphone less expensive, even with similar characteristics.  But, as buyers assure, the quality of the device will not be the best.  You should also pay attention to this so as not to make a mistake in choosing a phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone reviews prestigio grace q5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1416506.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  What other characteristics does the gadget under study have that were not mentioned?  Customer reviews of the Prestigio Grace Q5 indicate the following: </p><ul><li>  the presence of touch buttons; </li><li>  quad-core processor; </li><li>  the ability to connect 2 SIM-cards; </li><li>  the presence of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi; </li><li>  built-in voice control function; </li><li>  flashlight; </li><li>  processor frequency 1.3 GHz. </li></ul><p>  There are no more significant characteristics.  The main points that you should pay attention to are indicated in the reviews about the smartphone. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  What happens when you consider all the disadvantages of the Prestigio Grace Q5?  What are the disadvantages of this device?  Often, customers cannot determine exactly what to look for.  This makes people think that the device under study is the best that can be, and even at an attractive price. </p><p>  At the moment, the main nuances that deserve special attention: </p><ol><li>  Repair problems.  There are no spare parts for the phone, but it‚Äôs problematic to buy spare parts for the Prestigio Grace Q5 in most regions.  You have to either order them and go around without a phone for a while, or refuse the device. </li><li>  Performance.  Over time, the phone starts to slow down and does not respond too quickly to the signals sent.  This is a clear sign of wear.  On new devices this problem does not happen. </li><li>  Average power.  The Prestigio Grace Q5 is not suitable for modern games, despite the new operating system.  Although some applications on the gadget are launched.  The smartphone is designed primarily for business use.  Or for not the most powerful and demanding games. </li><li>  Lack of covers.  To find additional protection for the gadget can be very problematic.  This small flaw is emphasized quite often. </li></ol>
