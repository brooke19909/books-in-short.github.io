Some naively believe that all fees in favor of the state are limited solely to the payment of personal income tax in the amount of 13%.  However, in reality, the total amount of deductions from wages is several times larger.  Let's find out how much employees actually pay to the state budget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tussendromenenleven.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payroll deductions today" class="if uuid-3141398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141398.jpg"></div><h2>  Payroll deductions </h2><p>  For some, this type of income may be the only one.  Agree, it is unfair that many employees do not know how much the employer actually pays.  After all, it is he who performs the function of a tax agent.  From the point of view of the legislation, wages are profits, therefore it is necessary to pay taxes established by the state. </p><p>  The state receives about forty percent of the income of any employee.  Surprised?  After all, this amount significantly exceeds personal income tax, but at the same time, as a rule, they are silent about these fees.  The employer acts as the tax agent for the hired personnel and theoretically makes these deductions from their own income.  But in fact, payments of all deductions are transferred to each employee individually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Formally, social deductions from wages are not called taxes.  They are considered mandatory by all legal entities.  These funds should not be deducted from employee salaries.  Legislation obliges employers to pay these funds at their own expense.  For this reason, employees are often hired informally to avoid paying impressive deductions.  However, you must understand that these actions are illegal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.computerbild.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payroll deductions" class="if uuid-3141389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141389.jpg"></div><h2>  Interest </h2><p>  Let us finally find out what deductions from wages go to state funds. </p><p>  The well-known personal income tax, which is thirteen percent, is mandatory.  If the employee was credited with ten thousand rubles, of which 1,300 rubles will have to be paid in favor of the state.  However, before transferring a salary to an employee, the employer makes three more types of deductions, which are not known to everyone: </p><ul><li>  Contributions to the Pension Fund. </li><li>  Contributions to the Social Insurance Fund (FSS). </li><li>  Contributions to the Federal Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund (FFOMS). </li></ul><p>  Let's find out more about each type of deduction. </p><h2>  Individual income tax </h2><p>  It is worth noting that it is not always thirteen percent.  This rate is valid only for residents of the Russian Federation.  For non-residents, slightly different conditions apply.  The rate in this case is already thirty percent.  When calculating personal income tax, absolutely all income received by an employee must be taken into account, namely salaries, bonuses, etc. A similar procedure for calculating personal income tax is valid for employees who are employed by the employer under a contract. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An important nuance is that every employee who regularly pays personal income tax in favor of the state has the right to claim a tax deduction under certain conditions.  For example, in the event of the presence of two minor children, the amount by which personal income tax will be charged should be reduced by two thousand eight hundred rubles.  Thus, with a salary of ten thousand rubles, personal income tax should not be accrued for the whole amount, but for seven thousand two hundred rubles. </p><p>  Also, the right to a deduction appears for those who pay for medicines, expensive treatment and purchase real estate.  In this way, it is possible to return part of the deductions of taxes on wages.  This is a content topic, so it is not covered in detail in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crioc.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="social deductions from wages" class="if uuid-3141390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141390.jpg"></div><h2>  Pension deductions from wages </h2><p>  This is the most important and most impressive category.  Its size is twenty-two percent.  Thus, if an employee earns all the same ten thousand rubles, his employer must transfer two thousand two hundred rubles to the Pension Fund. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that before the economic crisis that happened in 2014, all contributions were divided into two categories.  Sixteen percent of the employers transferred to the insurance part of the pension, that is, to payments to current pensioners.  Six percent was the funded part of the pension, which the employee could dispose of at his own discretion.  Of course, the state did not allow to cash out these funds, but the employee had a choice: to leave the funds in the Pension Fund or transfer to another organization, which will increase the savings.  However, this opportunity was frozen.  Now, instead of cash, workers are awarded points, which the government further proposes to exchange for retirement benefits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cookies.rtlnieuws.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payroll percentage" class="if uuid-3141392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141392.jpg"></div><h2>  Social insurance fund </h2><p>  This is the smallest category.  The percentage of deductions from wages is 2.9.  Thus, with a salary of ten thousand rubles, an employee transfers to the FSS only two hundred and ninety rubles.  These funds are spent on payments during the decree, as well as on sick leave.  If the employee falls under one of the conditions, the Social Insurance Fund compensates him for the funds that were previously paid by the employer. </p><h2>  Federal Compulsory Health Insurance Fund </h2><p>  The amount of deductions is 5.1%.  If an employee is charged ten thousand rubles, then the employer transfers five hundred and ten rubles to the FFOMS.  This is the cost of medical care.  Thanks to the implementation of these contributions, the state maintains a healthcare system, and for citizens this means some guarantees.  Everyone with a compulsory medical insurance policy has the right, fixed by law, to receive medical care if necessary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ervaringsgids.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many deductions from wages" class="if uuid-3141393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141393.jpg"></div><h2>  Examples of calculation of deductions </h2><p>  All numbers seem quite abstract, if you do not consider them with a specific example.  Let's try to determine what deductions will be made to funds from wages at the level of 20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Personal income tax (13%) - 2,600 rubles.  These funds are deducted from the amount accrued to the employee. </p><p>  All other amounts come from the employer's fund.  Since he acts as a tax agent, the employee may not be aware of the payment of other funds. </p><p>  Pension contributions (22%).  In our example, in monetary terms, they will amount to 4,400 rubles. </p><p>  FFOMS (5.1%).  This is a deduction for medicine.  In our example, with a salary they are 1,020 rubles. </p><p>  FSS (2.9%).  In our example, 580 rubles. </p><p>  Total, with a salary of 20 thousand rubles, 17,400 rubles are transferred to an employee.  Also, in addition to 2,600 rubles PIT, the employer additionally transfers 6,000 rubles to various funds. </p><p>  Now you know how many deductions from wages are made not only from the wages of the employee, but also from the employer's profit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.snelgeldverdienen.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payroll taxes" class="if uuid-3141394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141394.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment period </h2><p>  The legislation establishes requirements not only for the size of paid deductions.  No less important is the frequency with which they should be implemented.  So, contributions to the Pension Fund, as well as the FFOMS, must be made monthly until the fifteenth day of the month following the reporting month in which the salary was accrued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bouwkwaliteitcoach.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pension contributions from wages" class="if uuid-3141395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3141395.jpg"></div><p>  If this number falls on a holiday or day off, it is permissible to transfer funds to the next business day following it.  If the date established by law is overdue, unpaid contributions shall be recognized as arrears and shall be collected from the employer without fail.  Control is exercised by the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the employer transfers salaries in two parts, tax deductions should be made once a month.  In this case, the calculations use the full amount for the month. </p><p>  If you sum up all the payments, it turns out that this is a pretty impressive figure.  For this reason, often employers act according to the old scheme, paying employees a small salary officially, and the rest of the salary is paid in cash so as not to pay taxes.  In this case, the employee may lose part of the funds for social guarantees, for example, for the payment of sick leave or maternity, as they will depend on the amount transferred to the funds. </p>
