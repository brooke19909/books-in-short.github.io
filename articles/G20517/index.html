A more detailed description of the Parana River is provided in this article below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Parana River" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690150.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <h2>  Name Origin </h2><p>  There are several options for translating the name of this aquatic artery.  The most popular of these is the "river, huge as the sea."  Another famous name was the "river of misfortune."  One of the ancient <span>Indian tribes</span> called it so because of the numerous stormy waterfalls.  Quite often in historical information you can find the name "sea mother".  In general, the following fact should be noted: whatever the name of this water stream of a tribe, it in any case emphasized the harsh nature of the Parana River, its strength and great significance for people's lives. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  It is believed that it was discovered by a traveler from Spain named Juan Diaz de Solis.  It was he who became the first European to visit her <span>mouth.</span>  <span>This</span> happened in 1515.  Only five years later Magellan visited here.  In 1526, S. Cabot studied in detail the features of the area.  Moreover, he became the first representative of Europe who managed to enter the mouth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="description of the Parana River" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690156.jpg" width="600"></div>

The total length of this waterway is 4380 kilometers.  As for the area of ​​the pool, it is 4250 square kilometers.  As noted above, the water artery affects the territory of three states, representing their partial natural border.  The upper course is characterized by high porosity.  In addition, there are also waterfalls. </p><h2>  Leaking </h2><p>  Parana originates in Brazil.  It is formed by the confluence of the rivers Rio Grande and Paranaib.  From this moment on, the water stream moves towards the Paraguayan town of Salto del Guaira.  Previously, the waterfall of the same name was located here, the height of which reached a mark of 33 meters.  However, in 1982, Itaipu hydroelectric station was built in its place with a dam, which for a long time remained the largest on the planet.  In the same place, Brazil borders with Paraguay.  After that, the direction of the Parana River turns south, and even later - west.  This continues for 820 kilometers.  The second largest hydroelectric power station was built at this site.  It is called Yasireta, and was put into operation in 1994.  It should be noted that this is a joint Argentine-Paraguayan project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of the parana river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690153.jpg" width="600"></div>

Further, in Argentina, its width reaches a mark of three kilometers.  In Santa Fe, the flow deviates slightly eastward and then reaches the final stretch.  Its length is about 500 kilometers.  On it, the nature of the course of the Parana River can be called very calm.  Moving to the Atlantic Ocean, the water artery begins to disintegrate into numerous branches and channels.  As a result of this, a delta is formed further, the width of which exceeds 60 kilometers, and the length - 130 km.  The Uruguay River flows directly into it, after which the world famous mouth of the Rio de la Plata is created with two powerful streams. </p><h2>  Water regime and climatic features </h2><p>  The Parana River is predominantly rain fed.  The period of the highest flood lasts from January to May.  Abundant summer rains are characteristic of the territory where the upper part of the pool is located.  From June to August, a strong jump in water level occurs for the second time.  In most of the basin, up to two thousand millimeters of precipitation falls on average per year.  In general, the water level is uneven.  The annual flow of water is about 480 cubic kilometers.  The amount of sediment carried to the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> is quite impressive.  It reaches 95 million tons per year.  Trace from them can be seen at a distance of 150 kilometers from the coast.  The mouth has a funnel shape.  The exit to the ocean itself consists of an internal and external zone.  The first of them reaches a length and a width of 180 and 80 kilometers, respectively.  Her water is fresh.  As for the depth, it does not exceed 5 meters.  The second of the mentioned zones is characterized by the predominance of salty sea water and a depth of up to 25 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nature of the Parana River" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690157.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shipping </h2><p>  Sea ships, together with other vessels, whose draft does not exceed 7 meters, can go at the mouth to a distance of 640 kilometers to the port of the Argentine city of Rosario.  The Parana River is characterized by high hydropower potential.  Its total value is estimated at 20 GW.  A large hydropower complex has been built in the area of ​​Urubupung Waterfall.  The largest ports built on the river are Rosario, Pasados ​​and Santa Fe. </p><h2>  Significance for the population </h2><p>  This aquatic artery is of great importance for the life of the population.  Almost the entire southern part of the mainland is inextricably linked with it.  It is not surprising that many Argentine, Brazilian and Paraguayan cities are located on it.  One of the most significant of them, without a doubt, is Buenos Aires.  Its population exceeds the mark of three million people.  In addition to it, several more cities have been built on the shores, in which more than three hundred thousand people live, as well as many small villages and villages.  The Parana River feeds thousands of fishermen.  All this together creates not just a huge agglomeration, but a whole macroeconomic region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="source of the Parana River" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690158.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The river is the habitat of many representatives of flora and fauna.  In the territory of national parks located in the water area, some animals and plants are found that are classified as almost extinct species.  In the green forests on the banks of Parana live jaguars, anteaters, wild boars, tapirs.  It is home to more than a dozen varieties of birds and insects.  As noted above, a huge amount of fish is found in the waters.  There are so many of them that the catch is carried out on an industrial scale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Parana river direction" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/690151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tourist attraction </h2><p>  The Parana River annually attracts a huge number of tourists.  One of the most interesting places in its water area is Iguazu - a waterfall located on the border of Argentina and Brazil.  Translated from the language of the Indians, its name means "big water."  By itself, it is a delightful sight.  The fact is that a horseshoe-shaped step was created here by the water flow, the width of which is about three kilometers.  Thus, you can fully see the waterfall only from the window of the plane.  It should be noted that both countries on whose territory it is located declared adjacent territories covered by virgin, picturesque forests as national parks.  They have the same name and both are classified as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. </p>
