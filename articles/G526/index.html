This material is easy to find in creative goods stores today, and working with it is almost as simple as <span>modeling clay.</span>  That is why almost any person can make earrings from polymer clay, there would be a desire. </p><p>  For the manufacture of such jewelry you will need only multi-colored <span>polymer clay,</span> finishing varnish and accessories for earrings, which can be purchased at any store of fabrics and accessories for sewing.  Glass or tile, stack, blade is useful for work.  Finished products are baked in the oven or boiled in a pan with water. </p><p>  There are two categories of plastic on sale: expensive imported and domestic cheaper.  For the initial experiments, the second one is also suitable.  Its disadvantages are that during heat treatment, especially when cooking, the brightness of the color is lost. </p><p>  <strong><span>Polymer clay earrings</span> in the shape of a rose</strong> </p><p>  Carnation roses can be made of pink or red plastic and accessories.  The flower is created on glass or other smooth surface from round cakes.  The first is twisted into a roll and becomes a cent.  Next, the following are glued around it.  The edges of the upper petal overlap the edges of the lower ones, the upper part of each slightly bending to the outside.  Both roses are made from the same number of petals and a single size.  The lower part of the flower should be dense so that it does not fall apart.  On the same glass, the finished figures are placed on the oven grate and baked at a temperature of 110-130 degrees, depending on the manufacturer.  For specific recommendations on temperature and firing time, read the packaging. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Burnt and cooled flowers are carefully separated from the glass with a blade or knife.  Wait until it cools down - getting burned with hot plastic is easy!  Position the knife or blade horizontally, move it jerkily, evenly.  The main thing is not to break the flower.  Removed roses with a drop of any superglue, preferably colorless, glue to the studs.  Wait for the glue to dry - and the polymer clay earrings are ready!  You can wear and amaze others with original jewelry and your own talent. </p><p>  <strong>Chocolate earrings</strong> </p><p>  A small piece of brown plastic can be turned into stunning chocolate earrings.  In addition to it, 2 shvenzy, a dozen little rings of golden wire and a small segment of a thin satin ribbon of a suitable color will be useful to you.  Of the tools you need a blade, a toothpick and a sheet of paper. </p><p>  To make your own ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù polymer clay earrings with your own hands, make a square of paper of the size you want to make a ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù.  Apply this pattern to a 2 mm thick cake and cut the protruding edges with precise movements of the blade.  It should make a smooth clay square.  Divide the chocolate bar into slices with a toothpick: put it in the middle and push it to create a groove.  Then, in the same way, create a perpendicular split.  In the corner with a toothpick, make a hole for the svenza.  Bake products. </p><p>  From the ribbon, tie 2 small decorative bows and drop a drop of glue into the center of each.  Attach a wire ring to each bow.  Now assemble the earring in the following order: earring, empty ring, ring with a bow, "chocolate". </p><p>  Finished work can be coated with a special composition to give greater shine and brightness.  Ask at the store how to varnish polymer clay so that it does not turn pale and does not become brittle.  In addition to specialized tools, building varnishes are also suitable, the main thing is that they are transparent and do not give yellowness. </p><p>  A little trick: to avoid fingerprints on the products, as a last step before baking, rub even surfaces with a small piece of paper the size of a fingertip.  Work will turn out with a perfectly smooth surface. </p>
