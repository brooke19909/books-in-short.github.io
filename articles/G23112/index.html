How to get to the club? </h2><p>  From Yekaterinburg we are moving towards the Chelyabinsk tract.  On this road we go to the traffic police post, which is located at the turn to the city of Sysert.  Before reaching the police cordon, you need to turn right, and then immediately left (under the bridge).  Now the path will run through Kadnikovo.  Immediately after the village, turn left.  <span>The green roofs of the</span> equestrian complex will be visible from here.  Of course, this path is not the closest, but as simple as possible. </p>
