Their <span>mythological thinking was</span> based on emotional and intuitive insights into the mystery of this limitless Chaos, the source of life in the world, and man was perceived as part of cosmic unity.  In the early stages of history, the legends and myths of ancient Greece reflected ideas about the surrounding reality, played the role of a guide in everyday life.  This fantastic reflection of reality, being the primary source of the formation of the worldview, expressed the powerlessness of man before nature, its elemental forces.  However, the ancients were not afraid to learn a world filled with fearsome <span>mythical creatures.</span>  Myths and legends of Ancient Greece indicate that the unlimited thirst for knowledge of the world has prevailed over the fear of an unknown danger.  It is enough to recall the numerous exploits of mythical heroes, the fearless adventures of the Argonauts, Odysseus and his team.

This made them closer and more understandable to ordinary people, most of whom perceived these traditions as their oldest history.  Mysterious, beyond the understanding and influence of a simple layman, the forces of nature became more explicable for the imagination of a simple person. </p>

In myths, memories of a distant and little-known past and poetic fiction are harmoniously interwoven.  No other human creation is notable for such richness and fullness of images.  This explains their unforgettableness.  Myths and legends of ancient Greece gave images often used by art <strong> </strong>  in different ways.  Inexhaustible legendary plots were often used and are still popular among historians and philosophers, sculptors and artists, poets and writers.  In myths they draw ideas for their own works and often bring in them some new <span>mythological worldview that</span> corresponds to a certain historical period.
