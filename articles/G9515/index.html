    <h2>  Character traits </h2><p>  A lot of his letters have survived to this day, in which he talked about his life, shared his thoughts.  Therefore, even after many years, one can characterize his personality, understand what kind of person he was.  To everyone who reads them, it becomes clear that Zaslonov Konstantin was loved and respected in the team.  It was not without reason that he was trusted when he ran the train depot and when he became commander of a partisan detachment.  People obeyed his will, despite the fact that at the beginning of the war Konstantin Zaslonov was only 31 years old, and he took a leading position in the depot at 27.  This happened because he thoroughly knew his job, tried to delve into everything he undertook, and then teach others. </p>

    <h2>  Hero Preferences </h2><p>  Konstantin Zaslonov was admitted to the management of the Roslavl station depot of the Smolensk region and Orsha of the Vitebsk region after he graduated from a professional railway school, and then worked for five years in simple positions.  He was a locksmith, and <span>an assistant to the engineer,</span> and a locomotive foreman.  This helped him to master the engine business thoroughly, especially since he loved technology and showed interest in all new products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He also had a dream, which is difficult to understand in our time, especially youth.  He wanted to become a member of the Communist Party, and not just to become, but to be worthy of it, therefore, even as the commander of the partisan detachment, Konstantin Zaslonov doubted whether he deserved the confidence of the party comrades so that they could accept him into their ranks.  He was accepted as a candidate member of the CPSU (b) in August 1942, two months before his death. </p><h2>  On the way to your goal </h2><p>  Konstantin Zaslonov was born in a simple working family on January 7, 1910. This event occurred in Ostashkov, Kalinin Region.  He had a chance to visit the farm laborer by the fist, to learn bootmaking skills. </p><p>  After the revolution, he was educated, and was sent to Leningrad.  There he began to study as a railroad worker, but a year later he was called to work.  Having worked in various depots, at the beginning of the war he was in Belarus.  After the Nazis arrived, Konstantin Zaslonov was evacuated to Moscow, but could not be there and wrote a letter asking him to allow him to create his own partisan detachment.  The request was granted, and he crossed the front line with a group of 40 people in October 1941. </p>

    <h2>  Military routine </h2><p>  It turned out that there were a lot of fascists in the Belarusian land, where Konstantin Zaslonov went, the photo of which you can find in this article.  They could not reach their goal, namely Orsha, as a whole group.  Therefore, it was decided to wade alone and, having got a job at the Orsha station, to get together again and engage in partisan activities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Zaslonov himself was easily hired, because he was an excellent specialist, and the Germans needed knowledgeable people to restore the locomotive movement.  Soon the detachment began subversive work.  All its members had to hide in the woods.  They were busy blowing up trains.  The Nazis had a hard time. </p><p>  From Zaslonov‚Äôs reports it is clear that his detachment derailed trains, blew up railway bridges, smashed fascist garrisons, destroying the enemy, his equipment and weapons, inflicting irreparable damage on the Germans. </p><h2>  The best partisans </h2><p>  Konstantin Zaslonov was an excellent commander.  His detachment was called "Uncle Kostya", which speaks of the respect that the partisans had for their young commander.  Zaslonov led sternly, clearly giving orders, seeing great goals in front of him.  He did not spare traitors, spies, provocateurs and advised others to get rid of them at any cost. </p><p>  Zaslonov was a dangerous enemy for the Nazis.  They appointed a reward of 50,000 marks for his head.  In addition, who caught Konstantin alive or killed him, they promised to present the award - the Iron Cross and arrange a heavenly existence in Germany.  And the peasants were promised to give two estates for this. </p><p>  Killed Barriers, heroically fighting with punishers.  Moreover, the partisan detachment ambushed them himself, having received information about the movement of the Nazis.  A fierce battle ensued near the road between the villages of Kuzmino and Utrilovo, during which a squad leader was killed. </p>
