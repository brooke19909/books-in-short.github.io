    <h2>  Mobile device design </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most original flagship smartphone of the last decade.  The main objective of the invention of a device with such a housing is the convenience of using it as a handset and watching videos. </p><p>  The thin plastic case of the product looks very stylish.  A 6-inch mobile device LG G Flex weighs 177 g. The original form of the smartphone overshadows the lack of external elegance.  The back panel is made of self-healing material.  If you accidentally scratch the body of the smartphone, it will ‚Äúupdate‚Äù itself, but this applies only to minor scratches. </p><p>  The mobile device has several similarities with the LG G2, for example, the identical buttons "volume control" and "power" on the back. <br>  Despite the external fragility, the product is made with high quality.  The classic type of body will appeal to both male and female.  Unfortunately, removable panels are not provided, so you have to use a smartphone of a standard color Titan silver.  The built-in antenna is invisible, does not bulge and does not cause inconvenience during use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen of the mobile device has an extension of 1280x720 pixels.  The mobile device is equipped with an HD OLED screen that supports 16 million colors.  Thanks to the body with a bend, the colors become more distinct, and the impression of the IMAX effect is created.  The display has the ability to bend.  The highlight of the screen is the maximum approximation of the picture to the panoramic.  The viewer thinks that events are happening around him.  Looking through the LG G Flex reviews, you can see that they mainly concern the display.  Users note the relevance of this form.  The smartphone holder can use it with gloves, as the display sensor is very sensitive.  In addition, the screen is equipped with a gyroscope, accelerometer and multi-touch function. </p><p>  Contrast and brightness are very high quality.  These options are important for viewing data in aggressive sunlight.  According to studies, the brightness is 311 Cd / m <sup>2</sup> , which is more than enough. </p>

It is worth using it in a portrait position, because due to the curved shape the text is more comfortable to type in this way.  While the user enters the <span>front camera lens, the</span> screen remains on all the time. This function works more accurately than in Samsung phones.

    <p>  In this model, the Quick Remote function has appeared, thanks to which the phone turns into a remote control.  In addition, the owner can see simultaneously two open applications, which was adopted from Samsung.  You can notice the potential increase in the number of combined tasks that the operating system called Android, unfortunately, can not yet boast. </p><p>  The famous company Qualcomm is developing excellent graphics for mobile devices, which in quality can create competition for Nvidia products.  Naturally, the installed Adreno 330 easily copes with games for this OS. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Selfie is currently doing absolutely everything.  The next-generation smartphone has a useful feature for such users.  While you are taking various poses, a yellow color appears that flashes.  This means that the mobile device is conducting face recognition.  When the camera finds you, the light stops blinking and changes color to green.  This function is not only convenient, but also is a significant advantage over other smartphones.  You can always use the flash if you wish.  The main camera is 13 megapixels, and the front camera is 2 megapixels.  The following image formats are supported: BMP, GIF, PNG, MPEG-4, H.264, JPEG, H.263.  The mobile device LG G Flex has a slight drawback - the device does not have an optical <span>image stabilizer,</span> despite the high quality of the picture. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  LG G Flex has a weight that is only a few grams superior to the popular Galaxy S3, but the <span>battery capacity of the</span> first option exceeds in this case the second.  Most buyers pay attention to the quality of the battery, since the duration of the device is always important.  The lithium-polymer (Li-Pol) battery has a capacity of 3500 mAh, which, without a doubt, ensures long uninterrupted operation of the mobile device.  The smartphone battery is not removable. </p>

    <h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  LG G Flex is equipped with a built-in GPS-receiver in the car DVR.  Using the global satellite system, you can determine your location.  Data is not always 100% accurate.  The clarity of coordinates directly depends on the number of satellites falling into the field of view of the receiver.  The included DVR with GPS receiver records video with coordinates.  You can always watch the footage on the computer by installing the player first.  In the video, in addition to the image, you will see a map of the area where the location of the car is indicated. </p><h2>  A-GPS system </h2><p>  Sometimes you have to wait a certain time before the first readings of the receiver.  In LG G Flex black, the A-GPS system will reduce the duration of a cold start.  To get started, the receiver must determine the exact location of the satellites.  Assisted-GPS was designed to accelerate the time of the appearance of the first coordinates from the operator‚Äôs server, which provides these services.  In the absence of this system in your smartphone, a <span>cold start</span> lasts from 0.5 to 2 minutes, in LG G Flex this process takes no more than 20 seconds.  It is worth considering that at present the service is in most cases provided free of charge. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone is equipped with intellectual text input, which allows you to write more competently.  You will also find a <span>digital compass</span> that can be useful for travel enthusiasts.  Another advantage is considered integrated access to networks on the Internet.  The phone is convenient for residents of megacities, as a special microphone actively suppresses excess noise, allowing you to talk in any public place.  The mobile device executes all voice commands.  For many users, NFC support and the ability to quickly view documents or photos, as well as their instant editing, are useful.  Of the standard functions necessary almost every day, the model has a voice recorder, calendar, clock, alarm clock and calculator.  Business people will love the planner, where you can schedule their plans, and the currency converter. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, the smartphone LG G Flex.  His review turned out to be more than fruitful.  It turned out that the phone is an almost perfect mobile device.  The most original form, the "strong" processor and low weight stimulate an exact hit among the leading smartphones in terms of sales and quality, released in 2014.  Perhaps the model will even take first place.  Of course, an obstacle to leadership may be the lack of an image stabilizer and Full HD display in the camera, but this is offset by other advantages. </p><p>  Naturally, the main goal of the product is the demand from customers, so manufacturers annually invent something new.  Since the smartphone came out not so long ago, after only a certain time it will be possible to take stock of the number of purchases made.  Most likely, an unusual form of a mobile device, as well as useful functions, can become a stimulus for acquisition.  Of course, there will be those who will simply be surprised when looking at the new product and pass by. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  LG mobile phones have always been in demand, since among them there are inexpensive models that are relevant for people with low or medium incomes.  Regardless of the cost, all devices are made with high quality, which means a long service life.  True, you can not name the budget model LG G Flex.  The price for it in different stores ranges from 24,000 to 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  At the moment, the opinions of the few owners of this device are the same.  Customer reviews relate to the original appearance and strong processor.  Car drivers appreciated the quality navigation system.  No negative reviews were found.  There is a small drawback of the developers - while listening to music, the device screen fades, but as soon as you stop the music, the screen returns to its previous colors. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the model came out not so long ago, there are no problems with the selection of accessories.  Users note the variety of covers in various colors, which compensates for the absence of interchangeable panels.  The headset can also be chosen to taste.  Owners like to wear the device in the back pocket of their trousers, as it does not cause inconvenience due to the curved shape.  The glass of the smartphone will not crack - it can withstand up to 100 kilograms. </p>
