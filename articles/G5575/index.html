Especially when it comes to the Chinese assembly.  OnePlus One is sold in two boxes at once.  The first is a telephone, the second is a charger.  Perhaps the presence of several boxes is the only drawback. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Otherwise, there is nothing surprising.

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  An important point for many is the design of the smartphone.  OnePlus One reviews in this area earns mostly good.  All this is due to the fact that the model has no features.  The appearance of the phone can be called standard, without frills.  As some buyers say, the look of the gadget is concise. </p><p>  The shape of the smartphone is standard, the back panel is slightly curved.  Despite this, holding the gadget is still convenient.  In general, the device is not scary.  Some buyers note that the appearance of OnePlus One is not surprising.  A typical smartphone without frills and features.  Available in standard colors - white and black. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Body composition </h2><p>  The phone case consists of several components.  The inner part is made of magnesium alloy.  This component is hidden from the user's eyes.  The outer case is made of plastic.  In addition, the gadget has a metal protective frame and glass. </p><p>  OnePlus One receives positive reviews because the plastic used is impact resistant.  Matte finish allows you to maintain a pleasant appearance.  On a smartphone, it is very problematic to make scratches.  If they appear, they will obviously not be noticeable.  OnePlus One is rough to the touch. </p><h2>  About assembly </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to the assembly of the device.  Smartphone OnePlus One owner reviews are often called monolithic.  But in fact, the back cover of the device is removed.  It is assumed that the user does not disassemble the gadget too often.  Therefore, in general, the lid is fixed.  But at home, removing it is not difficult. </p><p>  Of the moving parts in OnePlus One, only the keys and the space for the SIM card.  The build quality of the phone is generally pleasing.  The buttons fit snugly against each other, there are no gaps on the smartphone.  It is felt that the smartphone being studied is a really reliable device that you can trust! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oneplus one smartphone owner reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1649997.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The OnePlus One smartphone receives positive reviews for its size.  Not always, but very often.  After all, the device as a whole has standard sizes.  At first glance it seems that the device is very large.  And indeed it is. </p><p>  Some customers call VanPlus one of the largest smartphones on the market today for such products.  Its dimensions are 75.9x152.9x8.9 mm.  The device weighs 162 grams.  This is even more than the iPhone 5S!  A weighty and large gadget that will always be felt both in the hand and in the pocket. </p><p>  According to consumers, at the very beginning of using OnePlus One it seems that it is simply huge.  But over time, the hand gets used.  Initially, the usability of the gadget depends on how much a person is used to large smartphones. </p><p>  Many note that due to the weight of the device, wearing it in jeans or a handbag is convenient.  But in summer shorts - no.  After all, OnePlus One is a dimensional and heavy smartphone. </p><p>  Perhaps the device‚Äôs dimensions can be called the main drawback.  It is this characteristic that most often causes dissatisfaction among buyers.  Especially for those who are not used to working with large phones. </p><h2>  About controls </h2><p>  Like most modern smartphones, OnePlus One has several controls.  They are provided for a minimum - "volume" on the left side of the gadget, power button, touch buttons (3 pieces) under the screen.  This is where all the controls end. </p><p>  It is noted that the buttons on the smartphone are not too convenient.  The thing is that they are narrow, flat and small.  Therefore, adjusting the volume and turning the gadget on / off will not be so simple.  But you can get used to all of this.  Especially considering the fact that the power button is used extremely rarely - it is allowed to unlock a mobile device without it, using the touch screen. </p><p>  On the left side of the gadget there is a hole for the SIM card.  To remove the slot, you must use a special paper clip.  It is included with the OnePlus One.  Reviews emphasize that such a solution is very convenient - you do not need to disassemble the phone to replace the SIM card. </p><p>  The top end of the gadget is equipped with an additional microphone, as well as a standard headset jack.  Below is a stereo speaker and a connector for connecting the device to a computer and a main microphone. </p><p>  In addition, the front of the smartphone has a camera, proximity and light sensors, a spoken speaker.  All this has not surprised customers for a long time - we can say that in general, OnePlus One has standard controls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone oneplus one reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1649998.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Now a little about the basic characteristics of the gadget.  What makes the OnePlus One stand out?  A feature that is considered one of the most important is the screen settings.  It has already been said that the studied device as a whole can be called overall.  Basically it is because of the size of the display. </p><p>  OnePlus One is a 5.5-inch smartphone.  A very large screen, on which everything is visible - this is what pleases almost all customers.  You can play on such a smartphone, and browse the Internet, and read books.  Eyes will not get tired even after a long work with the device. </p><p>  Resolution also pleases - 1920 x 1080 pixels with a pixel density of 401 ppi.  The display is protected with the optional <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3 coating. </p><p>  It is noted that according to the main characteristics of the image display, the smartphone can be called good.  The image on the screen is bright, clear, saturated.  The viewing angle also leaves no one indifferent - it is maximum.  The color rendition of the phone is close to real (natural), there is no bias towards too bright or dark tones.  The brightness margin of the smartphone is above average. </p><p>  If the standard screen settings do not suit the buyer, he can adjust the display of the picture in the settings.  There are several standard modes - ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúbright‚Äù.  For them, OnePlus One gets user reviews.  The gadget also provides the ability to manually adjust the image quality. </p><p>  Some consumer opinions indicate that yellowness sometimes appears on the screen.  There is no clear evidence of such a phenomenon.  Therefore, it is customary to believe that OnePlus One does not have any yellowness. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone screen is considered to be very high quality and good.  It provides for maximum color rendering, color balance, contrast, "warmth" tones.  Everything to display pictures without distortion! </p><h2>  For shooting </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear what approximately the OnePlus One receives reviews.  The characteristics of this smartphone can be called generally good.  In any case, according to numerous opinions, the gadget offers good opportunities to its owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oneplus one reviews photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650000.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, you can take very high-quality pictures using the device.  The main camera is designed for shooting with a quality of 13 megapixels.  It has a flash, but there is no autofocus.  Therefore, it is far from always possible to make high-quality pictures.  The flash is often used as a flashlight. </p><p>  Shooting settings are presented in 3 parameters: general, video, camera.  You can choose the saving format, resolution, and shooting quality.  Most buyers say that the photos are pretty good, ‚Äúabove average,‚Äù but not perfect.  Basically, OnePlus One reviews get pretty good for the main camera.  It is noted that shooting outdoors is better than indoors. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the smartphone has one front camera of 5 megapixels.  This is enough to take good pictures, as well as communicate using video calls. </p><p>  For editing photos, the gadget provides a standard Android photo editor.  Therefore, anyone who wants to take up editing pictures can bring their ideas to life in just a few taps. </p><p>  The standard video mode is FullHD.  OnePlus One has this characteristic very pleased.  The smartphone allows you to get good pictures and make great videos. </p><h2>  Smartphone operation </h2><p>  An important point when choosing any phone is its battery life - without recharging.  OnePlus One gets mixed reviews from users in this area.  The phone has a Li-Pol battery with a capacity of 3100 mAh.  This is a good indicator for a modern smartphone. </p><p>  In practice, it is noted that the gadget works well.  With the active use of the device, the battery lasts an average of a day.  Therefore, you do not have to worry about the gadget shutting down at the most inopportune moment. </p><p>  Despite this, there are still complaints about the flagship.  For example, OnePlus One takes a long time to charge.  Without active use, the device may lie for several days in working condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oneplus one reviews specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1649999.jpg"></div>
