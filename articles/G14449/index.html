    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the advantages, there are also some disadvantages in the operation of the Mythos Palace Resort SPA 4 * hotel.  Guest reviews are especially noted for the following: </p><ul><li>  insufficiently clean room cleaning even with good tips; </li><li>  very monotonous breakfasts that quickly get boring; </li><li>  the prices in the restaurant are unreasonably high, and the quality of the dishes is very mediocre, and therefore, if you want to get acquainted with traditional Greek cuisine, it is better to visit neighboring cafes (there are cheaper and tastier); </li><li>  very rarely change towels (and then, after a personal request); </li><li>  the decoration of the rooms is already quite worn, and therefore requires repair and even replacement of some interior items; </li><li>  from the windows of the apartments the sea is very poorly visible, and therefore it is better not to overpay and take rooms with garden views. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A rather positive impression is being made about the Mythos Palace Resort SPA.  Reviews of tourists are generally positive in color.  Claims are not very significant.  Basically, guests are not satisfied with the quality of cleaning, but it depends on who is lucky with the maid.  It is also worth noting that the food prices in the restaurant are too high, and the quality of the dishes is below average.  But this is not critical, because near the hotel there are a huge number of catering establishments.  In general, the hotel is very popular because of the quiet atmosphere and beautiful green area, similar to a real Garden of Eden.  On a five-point scale, tourists rate it at four. </p><p>  This hotel has an excellent location.  It is such that from most bungalows located on the territory of the hotel, guests go directly to the beach.  It is clean enough.  It is also important that the swimming area is completely cleared of sharp traumatic stones, as well as sea urchins and stars.  Near the hotel there is a bus station and a train station.  This gives you a unique opportunity to independently go anywhere in the island for an independent tour.  After this, be sure to visit the spa, where you can relax. </p>
