In each of them there live people who rarely think about how a particular locality appeared, and are not interested in what urban planning is, why this system helps not only build the necessary objects, but also competently and logically combine them into a single composition.  How this area and architecture are interconnected when they appeared and united, which served as an impetus for their high development, all of this will be discussed in detail later. </p><h2>  History of Urban Planning </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.greecetravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of urban development" class="if uuid-3124082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108378/3124082.jpg"></div><p>  It did not begin with the emergence of urban development departments.  Officially, this term in its modern meaning was established at the end of the 19th century.  However, in order to answer the question of what urban planning is, it is necessary to get acquainted with its history, which begins from the time primitive people appeared.  Then it was not possible to move freely around the globe, so the families were very large, including all relatives.  Such a community really resembled a mini-city, where there was a living area, space for crafts and other necessary plots and premises.  Over time, large families began to unite and exchange with each other the most valuable and useful.  So trade relations began to emerge, the foundation of which was craft activity.  This showed his difference from the village, which accounted for most of the agricultural work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As communities united, cities began to have a clear zoning.  Residential quarters began to be located separately from commercial and business.  The first developed cities appeared in the Ancient East, Egypt and Greece.  All of them were built near the rivers.  The best examples of orderly development are ancient cities located in what is now Iraq and Iran.  The streets there were built only at right angles, the location on both banks of the rivers made it possible to clearly divide the city into business and residential areas.  Many cities in other countries were built on the same principle.  Great attention was paid to the formation and decoration of the city center, often it was the main square surrounded by buildings, the appearance of which was assembled into a single composition.  True, for some time in the Middle Ages in Russia and Europe, chaos was observed, which was due to frequent wars.  Settlements were more reminiscent of fortresses than settlements.  The formation of town-planning committees was due to the fact that in many historical cities ancient buildings began to require restoration, and the tourist attractiveness of these places also gained relevance.  With the development of transport links, it became easier to travel, and, of course, city leaders wanted to present themselves and the city from the best side. </p><h2>  History of the formation of architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mymodernmet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of architecture" class="if uuid-3124098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108378/3124098.jpg"></div><p>  What is urban development?  This is a system that cannot be developed without architecture.  It all started with the simplest, because in ancient times, beauty faded into the background, the main thing was to survive and protect.  The first houses were built literally from improvised materials: large stones, wooden branches, even river mud was used for decoration.  The source of the construction of beautiful buildings was the faith in pagan gods and their worship.  For example, the shape and height of the Egyptian pyramids symbolize that only selected people are worthy of the protection and disposition of the sun god.  Tombs and dolmens are the first architectural landmarks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Architectural masterpieces have always been created taking into account philosophical and religious beliefs, as well as the climatic features of the area.  The first stone masterpieces appeared in Ancient Egypt due to the fact that in this area the extraction of stone was carried out, which is abundant there.  In ancient Babylon, raw brick buildings were built, first of all, high temples with semicircular domes deserve attention.  Persia became famous for its palaces, and in ancient Greece they tried to give the beauty of buildings to ordinary people, without social status.  It was believed that every person is a god living on Earth.  Countries in which Islam is the main religion willingly introduced the styles of those states that they managed to defeat in wars.  This manifested itself in the construction of temples and palaces.  The hallmark of the architecture of Ancient Russia are wooden buildings.  This style is called "Russian wooden architecture."  After the adoption of Christianity, it began to be supplemented by the traditions of Byzantine architecture. </p><p>  From the second half of the 19th century  In Russia and Europe, a tendency has begun to unite different styles and trends; it continues to this day.  However, no matter how they are synthesized, three parameters remain unchanged: any building should be pleasing to the eye, provide comfort, be reliable and durable for many years.  It should be noted that this goal is being achieved.  Throughout the world, you can find unique buildings that delight the eye and soul for several millennia and have a rich history, but there are also completely new buildings that are no less interesting.  This means that architecture is evolving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  landscape architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanmark.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="landscape architecture" class="if uuid-3124104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108378/3124104.jpg"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine any modern settlement without trees, shrubs and other vegetation.  Their value has been appreciated at all times.  The Babylonian gardens of Babylon became the most famous.  Initially, their main task was to emphasize the beauty of the mansions of noble people.  In addition to the composition of plants, they were complemented by sculptures, pools and gazebos.  Such gardens are the ancestors of modern city squares and parks.  Temples were not deprived of attention either. </p><p>  As for city streets, they began to actively green them in the 20th century.  The rapid development of industry and transport contributed to this.  If in past centuries plants were planted exclusively for beauty, now they have one more task - to improve the microclimate: to make the air cleaner, to reduce the noise level.  This is especially true for large cities with a population of about a million people and for those where heavy industry and metallurgy are developed. </p><p>  It should be noted that in Russia before the reign of Peter the Great, attention was not paid to gardening at all.  Gardens were exclusively practical, were used for growing fruits.  The first masterpieces of landscape architecture appeared in the early 18th century, when the introduction of European culture began in Russia and the construction of St. Petersburg was underway.  The summer garden and suburban parks are world-class pride and cultural heritage. </p><h2>  Structure of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="launchworkplaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="structure of the department of urban planning." class="if uuid-3124141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108378/3124141.jpg"></div><p>  The post of chairman is held by the chief architect of the city, his main assistants are advisers.

A document confirming their legitimacy was approved by the Government of the Russian Federation in 1998.  It is updated annually, but the basic rules have remained unchanged for 20 years. </p><ul><li>      ,    ,      ,      ,         ,  ,    . </li><li>        ,           . </li><li>       ,       ,        , , ,     -.        , ,      . </li><li>                2-3 .  ,      ,     . </li><li> In regions where there is a high probability of earthquakes, the zones should be allocated in accordance with the degree of danger.  In the most earthquake-prone areas it is better to place light buildings, sports fields, parks. </li><li>  Summer cottages are located taking into account the prospective growth of the village.  The minimum distance between them and the city should be 5-7 km for small cities and at least 15-20 km for megacities. </li><li>  In residential areas it is allowed to have multi-unit and private houses, business, cultural and other objects that do not harm the environment and human health. </li><li>  According to the laws of the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning, the development of business and industrial zones is recommended in the immediate vicinity of the main city highways.  However, residential quarters are best located on calmer streets.  Despite the fact that motor transport does not seem harmful to many, nevertheless, its quantity can degrade air quality, because it gives a lot of exhaust gases to the atmosphere. </li><li>  When building industrial zones, it is important that the plants are delimited by the degree of harmful environmental impact.  You should not have in one quarter, for example, a metallurgical plant and a bakery. </li><li>  The distance between railway lines and residential buildings should be at least 150 m. If it passes near summer cottages, the exclusion zone can be reduced to 100 m. </li><li>  When placing urban facilities, attention should be paid to the wind rose.  It is necessary to identify the prevailing direction of air flow.  Residential buildings, office buildings and social facilities should be located in the direction of the main wind.  Heavy enterprises on the opposite side.  This will help protect communities from the harmful effects of factory emissions. </li><li>  Protected areas controlled by the city are protected by the state in accordance with the law on nature conservation.  They are forbidden to use for construction and any economic activity, hunting and fishing.  Allowed only the construction of individual structures that are directly related to these places and do not contradict the norms of urban development of the districts. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.brinknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="urban planning. Conclusion" class="if uuid-3124178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108378/3124178.jpg"></div><p>  Urban planning and architecture are two important systems that help maintain the harmonious appearance of the city through the competent use of land.  All artistically planned neighborhoods, parks, business and even industrial zones are indicators of the continuous development and improvement of these areas.  For many centuries, principles, vision, ideals and even the meaning of terms have changed in them.  For example, we all know that an architect is a specialist who designs buildings.  However, several centuries ago, he was not only the creator of ideas, but also took an active part in the construction of future facilities, being a senior builder. </p><p>  In each district, region, oblast, urban planning and architecture have passed and are continuing their individual development paths.  If you recall the history, you can cite many examples of cities that have not survived to the present day, but in ancient times were prosperous and with high prospects.  Some managed to resist and become centers that organically combine antiquity and modernity.  There are also very young settlements, but in their beauty and logical reasoning, they are not inferior to the older ones. </p><p>  Of course, the concept of the age of cities is relative.  Of much greater importance is the desire of specialists responsible for their appearance to continuously move forward, to take responsibility for the laws and inspire residents with their own example, to introduce new projects aimed at improving the quality of life.  Ordinary citizens, being in a constant bustle, rarely think about how the places where they were born, grew up, got an education and work appeared.  What is urban development?  This is an interesting industry with its unique structure, rules and laws aimed at improving the human condition. </p>
