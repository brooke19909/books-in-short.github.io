There are more than 2,000 such organizations in the world, the list of botanical gardens in Russia reaches 73, all of them are united by the main goal - the conservation and use of plant resources to enhance human well-being.  Gardens have a different geographical location and are extremely important for the development of society as a whole.  They are concentrated in a variety of varieties and species of plants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="janalinesworldjourney.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://janalinesworldjourney.com/2014/04/09/wordless-wednesday-spring-time-in-russia/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lush Gardens" class="if uuid-2460745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460745.jpg"></div><p>  The development of garden construction and decorative structure issues occupies a key place in the botanical gardens.  Most of these organizations serve the departments of botany at universities, and operate as a base for educational institutions.  Botanical gardens contribute to the growth of highly qualified specialists in the field of botany.  Despite all these advantages, the main goal is to develop and maintain the plant world. </p><h2>  The history of the development of botanical gardens </h2><p>  The very first botanical gardens in Russia began to appear in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  The purpose of their creation was the cultivation of medicinal crops, but over time, other plant species began to appear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the development of green areas has a close relationship with the development of botany as a science.  From the beginning of the 18th century, pharmacist gardens began to appear in our country, growing valuable pharmacy plants from which preparations were made.  The spread of such gardens began during the reign of Peter I, in St. Petersburg, Voronezh, Moscow and many other cities. </p><h2>  The role of botanical gardens in the world </h2><p>  Floristic research and encompassing forwarding activities have contributed to the deepening of knowledge of the flora and plant nature of our country and all green cultures around the world.  Thanks to this, the rarest representatives of wild flora and new cultures began to develop.  Botanical gardens systematically organize expeditions and trips, conduct comprehensive scientific research in the field of experimental botany, examining the main problems that plants face during acclimatization, and study environmental issues, biology, physiology and the geographical location of plants.  These studies have benefited the mobilization of domestic resources. </p><h2>  The main botanical garden of the RAS named after N.V.  Qitsina </h2><p>  The main Russian Museum of Plant Nature was created in Moscow in January 1945.  Its fundamental goal was to preserve the rarest green spaces - the Leonovsky Forest and the Erdenevsky Grove, whose area occupied more than 300 hectares.  Architects Rosenberg and Petrov made a great contribution to the landscape design, thanks to which the garden was as close as possible to the natural conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main botanical garden of the RAS named after N.V.  Tsitsina collected in his collection more than 15,000 species of plant wealth, of which 1900 are representatives of trees and shrubs, about 5000 different types of plants from the tropics and subtropics, as well as an endless flowering garden.  This wildlife museum conducts excursions in its arboretum, where visitors walking around the museum get acquainted with a huge variety of plant cultures, learn about the benefits and harms of organisms, and also learn many new facts about indoor floriculture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Botanical_Garden,_Moscow.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden named after Qitsin" class="if uuid-2460742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460742.jpg"></div><h2>  Amur Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The Amursk Botanical Garden was founded in 1994, its territory covers 200 hectares.  About 400 representatives of vascular plants are located on the indicated area, of which 21 are listed in the Red Book.  This museum participates in exhibitions, filming on television, conducts lectures on landscape design. </p><p>  There are three zones in the Amur garden: the first zone is an island, the second is the right bank of the river, and the third is an administrative site.  A large area of ‚Äã‚Äãforests belongs to nature reserves, and in some parts there are guided tours that are divided by complexity, distance, and age group of visitors.  The key route has seven main locations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.expedia.com/pictures/russia/moscow/moscow-botanical-gardens.d6066627/gardens-parks/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2460740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460740.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Petersburg Botanical Garden at State University </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden of St. Petersburg State University is located in the city itself and is greatly affected by the effects of transport and environmental pollution.  It began to be created in the 19th century.  Active replenishment of the collection began in 1844, and in 1947 its official name was approved - the Botanical Garden at State University.  The main goal of this organization of that time was the educational process.  The number of species increased to 2500 by 1896, and in 1901 the arboretum was founded. </p><p>  This organization is a subdivision of a state university, as a result of which its collection is selected in such a way that the educational process at the botanical departments takes place visually.  Thanks to this, students have the opportunity to gain deep knowledge in the study of botany.  Russian Botanical Gardens make a valuable contribution to the development and training of society. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden greenhouse reaches 1300 square meters, and the number of its representatives is 2200 different varieties of subtropical and tropical crops, herbaceous plants, shrubs.  Also in the garden collection there are more than 800 species of cacti and succulents.  An interesting fact is the availability of specimens that managed to live for more than 70 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Botanical_Garden#/media/File:Botanical_Garden_V.L._Komarov_Botanical_Institute.jpg"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2460739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460739.jpg"></div><h2>  The most northern botanical garden in Russia </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden, located beyond the Arctic Circle, was founded in 1931.  The aim of this project is to study the behavior of plants from different climatic conditions in the low temperature zone.  Over the entire period of the garden's existence, about 30,000 species of flora visited it, of which 3,500 were able to adapt to difficult conditions.  Also, various studies are carried out in the park. </p><p>  The composition of the collection of the botanical garden includes more than 650 representatives of moss, more than 400 species of different plant crops, approximately 1000 varieties of wildlife from the subtropics and tropics.  Patency of visitors per year totals more than 3500 people.  Snowdrops, live herbaria and a rocky garden are some of the most unique representatives of this place.  The garden also interacts with more than 30 countries of the world, with which it exchanges seeds and plant sprouts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pri.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-07-18/worlds-northernmost-botanical-garden"><img itemprop="image" alt="Polar Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2460743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460743.jpg"></div><h2>  Great contribution to education </h2><p>  Botanical gardens are engaged in mass education.  Many gardens have specialized nurseries that supply institutions and people with planting and sowing materials.  They also provide advisory support, give advice on the use and application of various plants, pay attention to botanical work in schools, create circles for young botanists, and organize training gardens for nature lovers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.publicdomainpictures.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Gardens of Russia" class="if uuid-2460744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2460744.jpg"></div><p>  Regardless of the directions, botanical gardens have a common important goal - the creation and maintenance of valuable plant crops and the dissemination of knowledge about wildlife and the benefits of the living world to humans.  The Botanical Gardens of Russia serve as a vivid example of landscape design, and are also a great place for the rest of the population, which arouses in people a love for the living corner. </p>
