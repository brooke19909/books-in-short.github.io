    <h2>  The concept and structure of non-financial assets </h2><p>  Non-financial assets are objects that are used by business entities, while they bring them potential or real economic profit as a result of their operation.  What subspecies are they divided into? </p><p>  Depending on the method of creation, non-financial assets are divided into non-production and production.  Let us consider in more detail what they are. </p><h2>  Production non-financial assets </h2><p>  Production assets <span>are fixed assets</span> (PF), which are used repeatedly or continuously for a long time (at least a year) for the production of goods and services.  But there are exceptions.  The fixed assets do not include goods that are single-use: coal, plants, animals, and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-financial assets include" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/355293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fixed assets (tangible) include (or non-financial assets include): buildings (non-residential), structures, equipment and machinery.  It also includes: vehicles, various kinds of equipment (household and industrial), perennial plantations, livestock (except young animals and intended for slaughter), material fixed assets that are not in other groups (libraries, animals in zoos). </p><p>  There is also the concept of intangible fixed assets.  What it is?  They are intangible production assets.  They are presented by information that is on a closed material carrier.  What does it mean?  The cost of intangible production media is determined by the price of this information, not the media itself.  Intangible funds (basic) include: computer software, <span>exploration,</span> entertainment, literature and art.  This also includes high technology (industrial) and others. </p><p>  Intangible assets (in accounting) are recorded without division into production and non-production groups.  This negatively affects the statistics.  When assessing the role of PF in production, it is important to divide them into active and passive. </p><p>  In accounting, a similar concept of ‚Äúfixed assets‚Äù is used, which refers to non-financial assets.  This concept can be considered from the other side.  Assets can be attributed to <span>fixed assets</span> if the following conditions are met: </p><p>  1. The organization does not intend to resell these assets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  2. The institution expects profit in the future. </p><p>  3. Exploitation <span>of assets by an organization for</span> more than 12 months or more. </p><p>  4. Use in production, in the performance of work, services or in managerial needs. </p><p>  The composition of ‚Äúfixed assets‚Äù should include the same objects as in ‚Äúfixed assets‚Äù, plus capital investments for improving the condition of land, rental objects, land, and units of natural use. </p><p>  In accounting, there is no concept of ‚Äúintangible fixed assets‚Äù.  What does it look like?  The residual value of fixed assets is included in the balance sheet. </p><p>  Next stage.  Fixed assets are reflected in accounting at primary cost. </p>

They consist of products created at the current stage and in the early periods.  At the same time, they are stored for sale, use in production or for other purposes.  What is it?

    <p>  Non-financial assets are also values.  They are expensive goods that are not intended for production and consumption.  These values ‚Äã‚Äãretain their value over time.  These include: stones and precious metals (not used at the enterprise as a resource base for production);  works of art and antiques;  values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not attributed to other categories (high-value jewelry, collections). </p><h2>  Non-productive intangible assets </h2><p>  What it is?  Non-productive intangible non-financial assets are legal forms that are formed in the production process and are capable of moving from one unit (institutional) to another.  These include documents allowing the owner to engage in specific activities.  At the same time, they exclude from this functioning other units (institutional), except by permission of the owner. </p><p>  These assets include: </p><p>  1. Leases and various agreements with the right to transfer (acquired good-villas - the conditional estimated value of the reputation). </p><p>  2. Objects of patenting - the latest inventions, which are characterized by technical novelty, which are granted judicial protection on the basis of the law. </p><h2>  Tangible non-productive assets </h2><p>  Consider this concept.  Tangible non-productive non-financial assets are economic (natural origin) funds.  They can be: renewable or not naturally (land; water bodies on its surface with the right of ownership extending to them).  What else is included in this group?  These are underground resources (water), minerals (mineral wealth), natural biological reserves (uncultivated) - animal and plant life. </p><h2>  Non-financial assets in budget accounting (BU) </h2><p>  In the <span>budget accounting,</span> state (municipal) property is reflected as non-financial assets.  The main document governing the management of the management of these facilities is the Instructions on the management (order of the Ministry of Finance of August 26, 2004 No. 70n). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="non-financial assets in budget accounting" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/355290.jpg?1395087626705" width="318"></div>

    <p>  BU non-financial assets can be divided into groups: fixed assets (machinery and equipment, structures, residential and non-residential premises, vehicles, industrial, household and soft inventory).  Also included: library fund, jewelry, jewelry and other fixed assets.  The list continues with <span>non-produced assets</span> (subsoil resources, land, electromagnetic spectrum and others).  Intangible assets, inventories (dressings and medicines, food, construction, fuel and lubricants, etc.), depreciation - all this is included in this group. </p><p>  More details about non-financial assets in budget accounting can be found in the order of the Ministry of Finance of August 26, 2004 No. 70n. </p><h2>  Accounting for investments in non-financial assets </h2><p>  What it is?  To account for investments in non-financial assets, account 010600000 (investments) is used.  This method is not the only one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting for investments in non-financial assets" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/355286.jpg?1395087688463" width="287"></div>  Grouping accounts are also used: 010610000 - ‚Äúcontribution to the immovable property of the institution‚Äù, 010630000 - ‚Äúinvestment in other property of the organization‚Äù, 010640000 - ‚Äúcontribution to the objects of leasing‚Äù.
