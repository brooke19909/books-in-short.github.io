    <p>  Before considering what morphology studies, it must be noted what this section of grammar is studying.  Thus, morphology studies the word as <span>part of speech,</span> as well as the ways of its formation, its form, structure and grammatical meanings, as well as its individual parts.  For example, according to the rules of the Russian language, a word can change according to cases, numbers, gender, and so on. </p><p>  It must be pointed out that morphology and syntax together form a grammar, so often enough this last term is used as a synonym for morphology. </p><p>  This section of grammar itself has two subsections: a morphemic that studies the word itself, as well as its components and grammatical semantics, which considers the formation of words and their change.  Thus, we can distinguish that studies morphology.  So, she defines a word as a linguistic object and describes its internal structure.  Thus, according to these tasks, this science describes the properties of a word and its sound composition, as well as its grammatical meaning. </p><p>  The term "morphology" also refers to the part of the language in which there are rules for understanding and structure of words in the language.  For example, the Russian language, whose morphology is closely interconnected with Russian grammar, sets forth the corresponding rules, that is, it is a collection of data on all existing types of rules. </p><p>  It should be noted that the <span>grammatical meaning of words</span> is a change in the same word, which has the same lexical meaning, but different grammatical meaning.  For example, go, go, going, etc.  The grammatical meaning expresses relationships through language, and there can be several meanings of these.  For example, the words "I live," "I breathe," have the ending "y," which indicates the relationship of the action to the speaker in the singular and present tense.  It can also be expressed using additional words.  For example, funnier - funnier. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, all the words of a particular language can be divided into classes - the parts of speech that make up the subject of morphology.  Therefore, the answer to the question of what morphology studies is quite simple. </p><p>  Parts of speech, in turn, have a grammatical meaning, <span>morphological features</span> and a <span>syntactic role</span> in the sentence.  They are independent (noun, adjective, numeral, pronoun, verb and adverb) and official (prepositions, particles and conjunctions). </p><p>  <span>The independent parts of speech</span> express the subject, its signs, quantity, action and condition and point to them.  They are inclined according to the cases and conjugated, and in the sentence they play the role of both primary and secondary members. </p><p>  <span>The service parts of speech</span> do not express the subject, signs and action, and do not act as members of the sentence.  They express the relationship between the parts of speech, as well as to connect the parts and members of the sentence and to give a tone to the utterance. </p><p>  It should also be noted that as the language develops, there is a transition of words from one part of speech to another.  In this case, the meaning of the word, its morphology and syntax changes.  For example, the word ‚Äúworker‚Äù can have two meanings and answer both the question ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù And the question ‚Äúwho?‚Äù </p><p>  So, quite often there is a transition from <span>the adjective</span> and participles to the noun, participles to the adjective, participles, adjectives and nouns into the pronoun, and also nouns into the dialect. </p><p>  So it‚Äôs not difficult to understand <strong> </strong>  what morphology studies.  Once again, it is worth recalling that this section of the grammar considers the word as part of speech, as well as its shape, structure and meaning.  In conjunction with syntax, morphology forms a grammar that is part of any language.  Therefore, it is an integral part of it. </p>
