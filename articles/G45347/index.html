    <p>  In the very center of the city, in the West Park, there is an amazing ancient Egyptian temple Debod.  The structure, which appeared in ancient times, experts in Egypt dismantled into stone blocks.  They were transported to Madrid and reassembled on the very spot where a unique archaeological monument still stands. </p><p>  The temple dedicated to Isis was opened in 1972.  It must be remembered that within 30 minutes only 30 people can get into it (there are strict restrictions on visits). </p><h2>  Crystal Palace </h2><p>  Tourists who come to Madrid in January cannot pass by the best example of architecture made of glass and metal.  The majestic palace, which can be found in Retiro Park, is recognized as the best place for photography, so no guest leaves the capital of Spain without vivid pictures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The transparent pavilion, which appeared one and a half centuries ago, previously represented a spacious greenhouse for tropical plants.  Today it is a famous exhibition hall. </p><h2>  Madrid is festive </h2><p>  The capital of flamenco is charming in summer.  But in winter, when it comes time to play <span>Christmas</span> lights with lights <span>,</span> she is especially beautiful.  The festive atmosphere captures tourists who admire the colorful illuminations that adorn the ancient city. </p><p>  Not a single holiday goes without gastronomic madness.  Those who arrive in Madrid in January 2018 will take part in an interesting festival that will bring together gourmets from around the world.  The large-scale event, held under the motto "Delicious Madrid", lasts two weeks, and during this time city restaurants and bars will compete for the title of best in the Gastrofestivale.  The feast of taste introduces everyone to the high art of cooking, and this is the case when gastronomy and culture are combined into a single whole. </p><h2>  Old-fashioned ice cream </h2><p>  For those who are visiting Madrid for the first time, we recommend stopping by Helader√ças Giangrossi Caf√©, open all year round.  Here, ice cream is made manually according to old recipes, and the owners of the establishment know for sure that a cool treat is not street food.  That is why they created a pleasant atmosphere in their institution, which raises the mood. </p><p>  What varieties of delicious product are not here!  Ice cream with mascarpone cheese, carrots, ginger, lemon and berries will appeal to both children and their parents.  And for those who have their eyes flashed from diversity, we can advise you to order a tasting set with mini horns. </p><h2>  Carnival procession ending the Christmas holidays </h2><p>  The Spanish capital in early January is enveloped in a fabulous extravaganza.  This is a special time, the crown of which becomes an unusual event resembling a carnival procession.  The "Three Kings Parade" ends with the Christmas holidays, and the main attribute of the celebration are gifts for the children. </p>

    <p>  A cheerful little girl beating the drums leads bright processions that take place in all cities of Spain.  A colorful holiday full of magic is awaited not only by children, but also by adults who believe in miracles and plunge for several days into a magical childhood. </p><h2>  Shopping in Madrid in January </h2><p>  The capital of Spain is a true paradise for true shopaholics.  On January 7, sales in stores begin, and discounts on branded clothing and equipment reach 90%.  Although Barcelona is an ideal place for shoppers, Madrid also has plenty of places to go for a walk. </p><p>  As tourists admit, the discount season here begins much earlier than in other cities.  Therefore, immediately after the <span>New Year</span> , thousands of shopping lovers rush here, having previously studied all the areas where trendy shops are located. </p><h2>  Madrid in January: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Most travelers claim that winter is the best time to relax in Spain.  It is too hot here in the summer, and it is simply impossible to walk for a long time looking at the main monuments under the scorching sun.  But in January, Madrid is an ideal place to get to know it.  This is the tourist season, when there is a significant reduction in prices for tickets and accommodation.  There are few guests here at this time, so you can easily get to know the main attractions of a picturesque city with an amazing atmosphere. </p>
