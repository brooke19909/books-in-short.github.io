Its origin is associated with the period of the Roman Empire.  Throughout its existence, this word has changed its meaning several times and is currently used only in professional dictionaries. </p><h2>  Condition in Roman Law </h2><p>  The first information about the conditions arose at the sunset of the <span>Roman Republic</span> as special circumstances associated with the application of Roman laws in practice.  Guy, a <span>well-known lawyer of the</span> classical era, distinguished two forms of legal requirements, each of which included the word ‚Äúcondition‚Äù.  What is condictio in <span>roman law?</span>  The main meaning of this term is the legal requirement to withdraw money or property in favor of the plaintiff. </p>

    <p>  The form of appeal to the Roman court was fixed once and for all, and its wording was so complex that it resembled some kind of religious ritual.  For simpler claims, the condictio form was invented, and the shortened form of the claim was called percondictionem. </p><p>  Later, in civil law, the word ‚Äúcondition‚Äù is firmly fixed.  What such a concept means in jurisprudence, special legal articles and dictionaries will better explain.  And we will go to the next meaning of this word. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conditions of Anna Ioannovna </h2><p>  In Russian history, the concept of ‚Äúcondition‚Äù is associated with the reign of Anna Ioannovna.  After the death of Peter II, the future <span>state system of</span> Russia was to be decided by this empress, who was a distant relative of Peter I. As a result of the coup, she had the opportunity to become the heir to the throne.  Its powers were to be determined by members of the supreme secret council - the "supremes."  The conditions put forward by them were a document defining the powers of the empress and to some extent restricting the autocracy.  The project, outlining the framework for monarchical power in the country, was drawn up by Prince Golitsyn in the image of European <span>constitutional monarchies.</span> </p>

    <h2>  How were conditions accepted? </h2><p>  What initial requirements the Empress of Condition set for her, what such a restriction meant to her, is unknown.  The original text of the document was not found, it is only known that it was part of a broader plan for the state structure of the state.  The public was offered in a highly edited version of the condition.  The definition of the final version of the conditions put forward by Anna Ivanovna was transferred to the shoulders of the Stated Commission, which consisted of representatives of the nobility.  Of the seven main projects, the most restraining condition was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a ‚ÄúHigher Government‚Äù, which provided for the election of members of this authority, as well as the replacement of governors, senators and presidents of both colleges.  At the same time, the Supreme Privy Council was abolished, so most members spoke out against the "High Government". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚ÄúHigher Government‚Äù did not find a response in society.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãelection was not directly attributed, so many saw in the conditions the possibility of usurping power.  The grumble that began was actively supported by the odious supporter of absolutism F. Prokopovich.  Delegations of noblemen and clergy were sent to the Empress, demanding the abolition of Condition and a return to single-handed rule over the state. </p><h2>  Gap in condition </h2><p>  Devotees of Anna guardsmen forced supporters of the "High Government" not to advertise their views.  After this, the second petition to the empress was urgently submitted, according to which she was offered to become the same autocratic ruler, like all the rulers preceding her.  At the beginning of February 1713, in the presence of the entire staff of the officers' meeting, Anna Ioannovna publicly broke the conditions.  In the Russian Empire, absolute imperial power is established. </p>

    <p>  Catherine II welcomed the gap in condition, as she believed that the people could not rule the country, and democracy would destroy the Russian state.  But already in the 19th century, the gap in standards was considered by historians as the first attempt to limit royal power and establish a more democratic regime in the country. </p><h2>  Consequences of breaking agreements </h2><p>  After the gap in condition, there was a significant increase in the influence of the middle and small nobility, as well as the officers on the adoption of state decisions.  <span>The Privy Supreme Council</span> was dissolved, and supporters of the "High Government" fell into disgrace or were repressed.  The opposition has disappeared in the country.  The influence of foreign advisers was limited, decisions were made mainly by Russian managers. </p>

    <h2>  Condition in modern vocabulary </h2><p>  After the eighteenth century, the word "condition" surfaced infrequently.  Currently, it is used in professional speech by specialists in several areas.  For example, commodity experts quite often use the word ‚Äúcondition‚Äù.  What does this concept mean?  Basically - the quality of the goods, compliance with its specific characteristics.  A product that has not passed inspection is called "substandard." </p><p>  This word is often used in the work of felinologists and dog handlers.  In their dictionary, ‚Äúcondition‚Äù is a combination of the necessary qualities of the animal, without which the pet will not be able to take part in exhibitions and competitions. </p>
