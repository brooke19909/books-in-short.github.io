In the 9th century, the island of Crete was captured by Arab soldiers.  Heraklion was renamed in the Arabic manner to the city of Handak (that is, the "moat" in Arabic).  In the 10th century, the Byzantines came here and renamed the city again - it began to be called Megalo Castro ("big fortress").  At the beginning of the 13th century, immigrants from Venice settled on the island of Crete, who named the city in their own way - Candia.  The period of being in Venice is considered the time of the highest prosperity of the city, especially in the aspect of culture and architecture.  In the 17th century, already under Turkish rule, Kandia once again underwent renaming, becoming Handakas.

    <p>  An interesting fact is that in single rooms, two people can also stay and not feel discomfort due to the sufficient area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms.

Dinner starts at 19 hours and continues until 21:30 in the restaurant, and again a buffet is waiting for tourists.  Prepaid meals include a wide variety of drinks, including local wines and beers.

    <p>  The capital of the island of Rhodes, the city of the same name, is interesting by the dissimilarity of its two parts - historical and modern.  In the first there are ancient, causing incredible delight among tourists and pride among local residents, the fortress walls.  Their appearance was predetermined by one of the popular names of Rhodes - "island of the knights."  Many streets in this part of the city have retained their historical appearance - and so much so that visitors have the impression that they were in those very times of the Middle Ages.  Here is the legendary Palace of the Grand Masters.  Outside, it is a large tower, an ancient, powerful gate.  Inside there are elegant halls with an expensive interior, reflecting the different historical periods of the city's development. </p><h2>  Oceanis in Crete: what tourists say </h2><p>  Russian tourists who visited the Oceanis Hotel 3 * (Heraklion), willingly leave reviews about this place.  Many of them admit that when booking a room here, they are fully aware that these are three stars - that is, the quality of housing and service will most likely differ from those that are typical for five-star hotels.  And therefore, such tourists attribute any possible discomfort to the relatively low level of "starryness" of the Oceanis Hotel 3 * hotel complex.  Moreover, Crete, according to some analysts of the tourism market, is not yet the most developed region of Greece by the Russians.  Therefore, estimates of tourists from Russia at the moment are not so many.  But it is quite possible to assume that for guests Oceanis Hotel 3 * Greece will certainly appear in the most vivid colors. </p><p>  Among the advantages noted by some Russians in the reviews, there is an opinion about the reception staff.  Commenting on their arrival at the Oceanis Hotel 3 * in Crete, tourists emphasize the friendliness and friendliness of the workers at the reception, their willingness to assist in solving everyday issues, to help in the development of the geographical features of the area. </p>

    <p>  Party lovers celebrate the upscale performance of local DJs and hosts.  Tourists respond positively to the quality of the service (among the criteria is a regular change of linen in the room).  The quality of cleaning is generally recognized as good, the staff is very polite and not at all exacting to the size of the tip (there are facts when the hotel staff even refused to take anything from tourists). </p><p>  Many guests note the high quality of equipment that is in the hotel - all devices work, hot water is supplied without interruption.  People note that the thematic content of the animation evenings was pleasant to the children. </p><p>  Some Russians are impressed by the fact that the main contingent of the hotel is tourists from Western Europe (England, Belgium, Ireland, etc.), which made it possible to communicate with people of a different culture, to practice their language. </p><p>  Many tourists liked visiting the clean and comfortable pool at the hotel, participating in animated shows organized near it. </p><p>  "Oceanis" in Rhodes, tourists believe, combines all the features of an upscale hotel.  Many travelers are sure that he fully justifies, or even surpasses, declared stardom.  Perhaps, some suggest, this is due to great competition - the hotel is surrounded by a large number of other fashionable complexes, and therefore you need to expose yourself only in the most positive light.  One way or another, but the tourist who chose this hotel on the island of Rhodes, should like a vacation. </p>
