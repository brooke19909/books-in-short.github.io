Founder of the roman empire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Octavian Augustus is one of the most famous Roman military leaders.  No wonder he is called the father of the <span>Roman Empire.</span>  How many years <span>Octavian August</span> ruled <span>,</span> and how he created his empire, is described in this article. </p><h2>  Ascension to the throne </h2><p>  The path to <span>absolute power</span> began for Octavian quite early.  To the question of how many years Octavian August ruled, it is difficult to give the only correct answer.  The fact is that for some time Octavian ruled Rome informally, he received full legal power from the Senate later.  To understand how this happened, you should study the biography of Octavian. </p><p>  The future emperor was born in 63 BC  He came from a noble family - his mother was Julia Caesar's niece.  His great-grandfather, Julius Caesar, who later adopted the young patrician, liked the excellent upbringing and remarkable organizational talent.  At the age of 18, he was already introduced to the Senate, where he managed to win over even the most experienced politicians with flattery and eloquence.  With his generosity and gentle treatment, he managed to win over the people and the army. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many years did Octavian August rule" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/835181.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Triumvirate </h2><p>  Having concluded an agreement with Anthony and Lepidus, he created a military alliance, called the Second Triumvirate.  Thanks to his leadership talent, the future emperor gradually defeated the army of the Republicans and divided the Roman lands between himself and his allies.  The power of Octavian Augustus extended to all of Italy and its provinces, Anthony went to Asia, and Lepidus - African possessions.  Together with Lepidus, he suppressed the last foci of the republican rebels, after which Lepidus lost his land, and in return received the life, liberty and modest position of the great pontiff.  The possessions of the recent ally Anthony were confiscated after the Peruzian war.  So the triumvirate fell apart, and Octavian became virtually the only ruler of Rome. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reign of Rome </h2><p>  The sovereignty of Octavian Augustus demanded the legalization of his rule.  From year to year he was elected consul, but constantly exceeded his authority, further disregard for the legal side already threatened with uprisings. </p><p>  In 28 BC  e.  Octavian Augustus came to the Senate, and declared that civil wars were over, peace reigned in the lands of Rome, and he resigned all his powers, thereby returning power to the people and the <span>Senate.</span>  <span>Senators,</span> fearing the cunning of Octavian, vied with each other to convince them to change their minds.  A few days later he was awarded the title of Augustus, which emphasized the sacredness and inviolability of his power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Power of Octavian Augustus" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/835182.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the army he was awarded the title "emperor", which means - lord, commander.  So the Roman soldiers called commanders who did not know defeat.  Caesar's nickname was family, but after initiation, it turned into the family name of the rulers of Rome.  So, Emperor Octavian Caesar Augustus took the throne of the Roman state. </p><h2>  Long years of power </h2><p>  How many years Octavian Augustus ruled, so much time he strengthened monarchical power in his country.  The expansion of the borders of the state, strong ties within the country, a clearly functioning state bureaucratic apparatus allowed Octavian to create a full-fledged powerful state.  <span>The system of government</span> created by this ruler turned out to be so perfect that it functioned for another three centuries after his death. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autocracy of Octavian Augustus" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/835186.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The actual reign of Augustus began in 43 BC, when he was first elected consul.  With short breaks in this position, he spent almost 20 years.  In 28, his power was enshrined in law - Augustus became the life ruler of Rome.  The emperor died in 14 A.D. </p><p>  Thus, the question of how many years Octavian August ruled can be answered: 56 years of actual power, of which 42 he was emperor and absolute monarch of the Roman Empire. </p>
