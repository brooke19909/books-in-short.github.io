  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is scrapbooking?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scrapbooking is a type of <span>decorative art</span> with which you can make and decorate photo albums, cards, etc.  Now you can independently decorate both different books and notebooks.  You only need the desire to craft, but here there are fantasies where to roam.  Understanding what scrapbooking is easy.  This type of needlework is associated with the creation of paper crafts and additional items.  These elements can be a variety of household items: threads, cords, beads, shells and everything at hand. </p><p>  What is scrapbooking we learned thanks to England.  There, back in the 17th century, a history book was published in which the last pages were blank and the reader could fill them with his notes.  Then they began to create different notebooks, diaries, in which they made notes and decorated them with flowers, beads, photographs.  Moreover, such products had spiritual value, since, in addition to important notes, they contained a piece of the soul.  Translated from English, ‚Äúscrapbooking‚Äù means ‚Äúscrapbook‚Äù.  And such a name appeared in the 30s of the XIX century. </p><p>  Scrapbooking makes it possible to produce and decorate not only albums (the most diverse forms: a folding book, a house, an accordion album), today it is also popular to <span>make scrap cards,</span> calendars, business cards, photo frames.  And these are wonderful gifts for friends and relatives. </p><p>  You can still decorate photos, combine pictures, make frames using computer programs.  This is the so-called digital scrapbooking. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To better understand what scrapbooking is and to start this type of needlework, you need to know what materials and tools are needed. </p><p>  So, the main material is paper.  There is a special paper that does not turn yellow and does not affect the photographs; we can say that it is durable.  It can be plain, patterned, glossy or matte, with various details.  But such paper sets are not in every city.  They are often ordered online or abroad.  For scrapbooking, watercolor and designer paper are great. </p><p>  Carefully select and glue.  It should not turn yellow and stain.  Before buying, it is better to consult with the master.  Often, <span>double-sided tape is</span> used instead of glue <span>.</span>  Since it is a bit voluminous, the craft turns out to be more interesting.  Mounting on such an adhesive tape has a higher strength. </p><p>  Scrapbooking tools also include scissors, often curly, a clerical knife, hole punchers (especially corner and edge hole punchers) that allow you to make lace patterns, stamps with drawings or individual figures. </p><p>  Tracing paper, colored paper, cardboard, markers, pens, crayons can come in handy in decorating the product. </p><p>  Scrapbooking in Russian uses a lot of jewelry, which can be very different.  This is a professional hardware, and improvised materials that can irreplaceably look in the decor of your favorite thing. </p><p>  Often used sewing accessories, for example buttons, which can be useful for the core of flowers, beads, beads, rhinestones, sequins.  Shells and pebbles are used to reach the desired volume.  Textile materials are also used: <span>satin ribbon,</span> lace, braid, cord.  These are commonly used scrapbooking materials. </p><p>  The original element of scrapbooking is a label that is inserted into an envelope or pocket or glued to the desired location on the page.  It can carry a graphic or text message, it can be any form you need. </p><p>  When asked what scrapbooking is, one can answer that it is entertainment, it is an interesting leisure for the whole family.  It will help develop creativity and brighten life.  This type of art will be a fascinating activity for both children and adults. </p>
