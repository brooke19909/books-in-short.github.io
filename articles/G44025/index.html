    <p>  If you did not have time to have breakfast, then in the afternoon you can taste snacks and salads in the bar of the neighboring building.  Guests can enjoy alcoholic drinks at the bar for lunch and dinner. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel 5 * consists of two five-story buildings, between which there is a pool.  The hotel has several restaurants and bars that offer Turkish and Italian dishes, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  For business events and meetings, the hotel has two conference rooms.  In addition, the hotel has dry cleaning, laundry, shops, a hairdresser, spa.  At the reception, guests can exchange money and rent a car. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Munamar Beach Residence Hotel 5 * (Marmaris) is located in close proximity to the coast.  Only the city promenade separates the hotel from the beach.  The road to the sea, even from a distant building, takes no more than three minutes.  The hotel complex has its own sandy beach, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  How good is it and is it worth recommending to vacationers? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="munamar beach residence hotel 5 marmaris" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1731393.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Munamar Beach Hotel &amp; Residence Hotel 5 * is located in the small village of Icmeler.  If you want to find a calm and quiet place to relax, then you can safely choose this complex.  Those tourists who prefer active entertainment should find a different place for themselves.  The hotel itself is located in a quiet place, there is practically no animation in it, so you need to invent entertainment yourself.  The hotel has one feature: children under 16 are not accepted here.  This means that there are no kids here at all.  Whether it is good or bad is up to you.  According to tourists, the hotel is really quiet and calm, but on the coast, as on any beach, there are many children.  The beach of the hotel does not have protection, therefore tourists come to it from hotels of the second and third lines (they can be seen by the color bracelets). </p><p>  The complex has a favorable location, because it is located on the beach.  Near the hotel there are cafes, restaurants, ATMs and shops.  Everything that tourists may need is located within walking distance.  It is worth noting that the location is one of the advantages of the hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel room reviews </h2><p>  How good is Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel?  Reviews of tourists say that all the apartments of the hotel have a very small area.  They have long been in need of repair and updating of interiors and furniture.  In general, their equipment is quite acceptable for relaxation, but the hotel looks very tired.  According to guests, the complex is currently not very consistent with its five-star status.  However, if you do not plan to spend a lot of time in the room, then you can not pay attention to minor flaws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="munamar beach residence hotel reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1731391.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  As for the quality of room service, the maids change their clothes every day, and they clean them several times a week.  Replenishment of detergents and cosmetics, as a rule, occurs after a reminder.  Not all vacationers are satisfied with the cleanliness of rooms and the quality of their cleaning.  Experienced tourists do not recommend leaving a tip in this institution, since cash bonuses do not affect service. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are equipped with small balconies, some of them have side sea views.  However, according to tourists, it is better to book apartments with direct views of the coast. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The advantages of Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel 5 * (reviews confirm this) include food.  Perhaps in the hotel restaurant you can see not the greatest variety of dishes, but the quality and quantity of food, all guests are very satisfied.  Every day on the tables there is a good selection of dishes, among which there are not only national Turkish, but also European.  Therefore, you can always choose for yourself something suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="munamar beach residence hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1731395.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Pleasant guests and a decent selection of fruits and vegetables.  But there are no freshes in the institution's menu.  There is a vending machine in the hall where you can get drinks like ‚ÄúUPI‚Äù.  For lunch and dinner, guests are offered alcohol.  But they are not served on the table.  Visitors pick them up at the bar on their own.  But as for drinking water, it can be taken in refrigerators throughout the hotel, including the bar next to the beach. </p><p>  According to tourists, the hotel food is good and of high quality, but the service in the restaurant leaves much to be desired.  Waiters do not always cope with a large influx of guests.  As a rule, visitors have to look for an empty seat and ask them to cover the appliances that are served after you sit down at the table.  The restaurant hall is stuffy, as staff never include air conditioning. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel is a good place for a secluded getaway.  Especially here will appeal to those people who do not like noisy and crowded places, as well as entertainment events.  Tourists have long been accustomed to the fact that Turkey is certainly All Inclusive and animation.  However, in ‚ÄúMunamar Beach‚Äù there is no such a busy schedule of entertainment programs that are practiced in other institutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel munamar beach residence hotel 5" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1731396.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  All animation is reduced to aqua aerobics classes in the mornings in the pool and evening show program.  The rest of the time, guests are left to their own devices and can relax on the beach, entertaining themselves with numerous sea sports.  In addition, lovers of attractions can go on exciting sightseeing trips. </p><p>  Between the two buildings of the hotel there is a small pool with a relaxation area (there are sun loungers and umbrellas).  However, our compatriots prefer to relax on the beach, because it is located in close proximity.  To get to the coast, just cross the city promenade.  Such a close location to the sea is a serious advantage for a hotel specializing in beach and sea vacations. </p><p>  The hotel complex has its own beach, on which there are free sunbeds and umbrellas.  However, the beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is open for tourists from other institutions, so there are few people on the coast.  When planning a vacation in the Icmeler region, you should know that the sea in this region is not very warm, it only warms up well by the end of August.  And at the beginning of summer it is a bit cool and is more suitable for adult tourists. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel has a sand cover and a nice smooth sunset.  A ranger works on the coast, who monitors the cleanliness of the coast.  He daily removes large debris, but cigarette butts, unfortunately, remain in the sand.  In general, the beach is quite acceptable for a good vacation. </p><p>  Experienced tourists recommend lovers of active nightlife and fun to visit Marmaris. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Icmeler is located just seven kilometers from Marmaris in a beautiful bay.  More recently, the city has become an independent resort, and until recently it was considered part of Marmaris.  And now the town is growing and gaining more and more popularity among tourists.  Icmeler is rich in picturesque places and popular among divers, as the local waters are rich in marine life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="munamar beach residence hotel hotel reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1731402.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Excellent transport links are established between him and Marmaris, so that tourists have the opportunity to visit the Greek Rhodes, the turtle island of Dalyan, as well as Pamukkale with its many thermal springs. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Munamar Beach &amp; Residence Hotel is a good beachfront hotel.  A varied diet, a beautiful and gentle sea, a sandy beach and a relaxing holiday are all that the complex offers its guests.  The hotel is suitable for unpretentious tourists who know how to ignore some of the shortcomings and appreciate the advantages of the establishment. </p>
