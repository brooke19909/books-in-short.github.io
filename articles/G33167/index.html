This is possible only if a pedagogical approach is implemented in all areas of life.  Only then will it be possible to predict the effectiveness of educational and educational activities. </p><p>  Thus, the tasks and functions of pedagogy are associated with the description, explanation and forecasting of events and processes taking place in the educational sphere.  This is what determines the need to divide tasks into theoretical and practical.  The tasks and functions of pedagogy are formulated on the basis of scientific principles, and then embodied in actual activities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

S. Makarenko paid attention to the specificity of the object of pedagogy.  He did not agree with most researchers of that time.  A.S.  Makarenko considered erroneous their opinion that a child acts as an object of pedagogy.  This science studies the aspects of activity aimed at the formation of socially significant personality traits.  Consequently, the object of pedagogical science is not a person in the educational process directed at him, the totality of pedagogical measures that determine the development of the individual.

But, none of them affects the essence of the activity that determines the daily processes of growth and development of the child, as well as the interaction of teachers and schoolchildren.  Only pedagogy is engaged in the study of patterns, trends and prospects for the development of the educational process as one of the factors in the formation of a person‚Äôs personality. </p><p>  Thus, the subject of this collective social science includes the laws of the formation of the process of education in time, which are closely related to the canons of the development of social relations.  Also, the <span>object, subject</span> and functions of pedagogy reflect the totality of features and conditions for the implementation of pedagogical impact. </p><h2>  Pedagogy as a science </h2><p>  The most important functions of pedagogy as a science are related to the knowledge of the laws governing the upbringing, education and training of an individual and the development of optimal means of solving the basic tasks of a person‚Äôs personal development. </p><p>  For concretization, experts identify the theoretical and technological functions of pedagogy. </p><p>  The implementation of each of them implies the presence of three activity levels. </p><p>  <em>Levels of Theoretical Function:</em> </p><ol><li>  <em>Descriptive, or explanatory</em> , on which advanced and innovative pedagogical experience is studied. </li><li>  <em>Diagnostic</em> , in the framework of which the state, conditions and causes of the phenomena accompanying the interaction of the teacher and the child are revealed. </li><li>  <em>Predictive</em> , involving experimental studies that reveal pedagogical reality and finding ways to transform it.  This level is associated with the creation of theories and models of the interaction of participants in pedagogical relations, which are used in practice. </li></ol><p>  <em>Technological Function Levels:</em> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  <em>Projective</em> , including the development of an appropriate list of methodological material (curricula, programs, manuals, etc.), the content of which embodies the theoretical foundations of pedagogy. </li><li>  <em>Converting</em> , associated with the implementation of scientific achievements in the educational process in order to improve it. </li><li>  <em>Reflective, or corrective</em> , involving an assessment of the impact of pedagogical research on educational and educational practice, the results of which can be adjusted, given the relationship between science and practice. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="functions of pedagogy as a science" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33887/799435.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The main categories of pedagogy </h2><p>  The functions of pedagogy are manifested differently depending on the category within which the impact on the child is carried out. </p><p>  Any <span>theoretical basis</span> should be based on a clear distinction between ordinary ideas and scientific knowledge.  The former are reflected in the everyday practice of education and training.  The second is the generalized results of pedagogical experience, which are represented by categories and concepts, laws, methods and principles of the organization of the pedagogical process.  The formation of this science was accompanied by a gradual differentiation of concepts, which became a prerequisite for the formation of three pedagogical categories: education, training, education. </p><h2>  Parenting </h2><p>  Modern science interprets the concept of ‚Äúeducation‚Äù as a social phenomenon, characterized by the transfer of historical and cultural values, which subsequently form the corresponding experience, its transmission from generation to generation. </p><p>  Teacher Functionality: </p><p>  1. The transfer of experience gained by mankind. </p><p>  2. Introduction to the cultural world. </p><p>  3. Stimulation of self-education and self-development. </p><p>  4. The provision of pedagogical assistance in the event of difficult life situations. </p><p>  The result of the educational process is the formation of a child‚Äôs individual attitude to understanding the world, other members of society and himself. </p>

    <p>  The tasks of upbringing always reflect the historical need of society for preparing future generations capable of realizing certain social functions and social roles.  That is, the totality of the systems that determine the content, nature and tasks of this pedagogical category is in accordance with the established ethno-national traditions, features of the socio-historical formation, a certain value hierarchy, as well as with the political and ideological doctrine of the state. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  The next category is ‚Äúeducation‚Äù, by which specialists understand the interaction of the teacher and children, aimed at the development of students. </p><p>  The tasks of the teacher: </p><p>  1. Teaching, that is, the purposeful transfer of knowledge, life experience, methods of activity, the foundations of culture and science. </p><p>  2. Guide the development of knowledge, the formation of skills. </p><p>  3. Creating conditions for <span>personal development of</span> students. </p><p>  Thus, the essence of the dialectic relationship ‚Äútraining-upbringing" consists in the development of the individual‚Äôs activity and personality traits, based on taking into account his interests, acquired ZUN, abilities. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  The third pedagogical category is education.  This is a multifaceted process that includes several areas of activity, in particular, the formation of students' value attitude to society and themselves;  set of activities for training and education. </p><p>  The presence of various types of educational institutions determines the specialization of pedagogical categories.  Their classification reflects the levels: kindergarten, elementary school, high school, etc. Accordingly, the substantive and methodological side at each stage of education are specific.  Categories of preschool pedagogy have their own characteristics, related to the fact that the main <span>leading activity</span> for a child of 2-7 years old is the game.  Parenting for this age is the basis of development.  And then, when study takes the leading place in the life of a student, the ratio of the importance of pedagogical categories changes. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, pedagogy should be considered a science of the essential laws and methodological foundations (principles, methods and forms) of training and education of the individual. </p><h2>  Preschool Pedagogy </h2><p>  The object of pedagogy, the impact of which is aimed at a <span>preschool child, is</span> specific.  Its peculiarity is determined by age, and as a result, by thinking, attention, memory and the main activities of children under the age of 7 years. </p>
