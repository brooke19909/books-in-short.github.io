It is located simultaneously in Asia and in Europe.  By its length, the country takes the second place among the CIS territories and the ninth in the world.  Kazakhstan borders on several countries at once: Russia (in the north and west), Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan (in the south) and China (in the east). </p><p>  The state is divided into 14 regions and 2 large centers.  The largest cities are Astana and Almaty.  Of particular importance is the city of Baikonur, which was rented by the Russian Federation until 2050. </p><p>  Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.  The official languages ‚Äã‚Äãare Russian and Kazakh.  According to the <span>form of government, the state</span> is a presidential republic.  Currency is tenge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan climate" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1123626.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General characteristics of the climate </h2><p>  Quite often the question is asked about the climate in Kazakhstan.  It has very clear features of a sharply continental zone.  In January, the temperature ranges from -19 to +1 degrees, depending on the location.  In July, the average indicators are +17 ... +31 <sup>about</sup> .  The summer period is accompanied by very dry weather;  in some areas, temperatures can reach +50 degrees.  Winter is practically non-snowy and quite cold - the maximum figure that has been recorded is -58 <sup>o</sup> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Climate-forming factors and climate features of Kazakhstan allow us to grow more than 6 thousand plant species here.  In this area, aquatic representatives of the flora are also able to exist, but there are fewer of them.  Sivers apple tree is growing on the territory of the state, which is recognized as the ancestor of modern species of this fruit.  It is mainly located only in Kazakhstan, which means that it is the local climate that is suitable for full-fledged life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="climate-forming factors and climate features of Kazakhstan" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1123627.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  clothing </h2><p>  The weather and climate of Kazakhstan are very predictable, so you can give some tips on choosing clothes.  In winter, it is best to wear warm shoes, sweaters and down jackets.  We should not forget about hats, scarves and mittens (gloves), as without them it will be difficult.  The weather is harsh this season, and you can‚Äôt do without additional protection. </p><p>  Permanent winds - this is how summer Kazakhstan can be characterized.  The climate constantly contributes to raising the sand in the atmosphere.  Therefore, you need to take care of umbrellas, glasses or special raincoats. </p><p>  Spring and autumn will bring to life a constant and abrupt change in temperature.  You need to understand that at night it will fall by many degrees, so it is better to change shorts and a T-shirt to something warmer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Seasons </h2><p>  Due to the fact that Kazakhstan, whose climate is continental, is characterized by hot summers and cold winters, it is easy to guess that dryness is the second name for the weather in this region.  The state is famous for its long and large-scale sandstorms, which mainly occur in the north.  The sky is rarely cloudy, both in the cold season and in the warm season. </p><p>  Winter can be easily experienced due to the minimum rainfall.  In the east, strong winds most often blow - the only minus of this period.  The climate features of Kazakhstan are in the almost complete absence of snow, although the temperature can "please" too low marks.  They can be explained by cold <span>air masses.</span>  If snow falls, it does not differ in huge snowdrifts. </p><p>  If the south winds came from Iran, it means that you can meet spring.  As a rule, they are delayed only in the southern part of Kazakhstan.  In May and June, moving air flows are rare.  In July, a pernicious dry wind is characteristic, destroying huge stocks of rural products. </p><p>  Autumn is quite short, because already in November snow can fall, and the temperature drops to -10 <sup>o</sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="climate features of Kazakhstan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1123628.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate-forming factors and climate features of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  The climate in Kazakhstan depends on several factors: </p><ul><li>  Atmospheric circulation.  Oceanic air masses move too quickly to the territory of the state (in just 3 days). </li><li>  <span>Solar radiation.</span>  It is so large that it exceeds 2 thousand hours.  Moreover, this figure is much higher than that shown by Moscow, being with Kazakhstan on the same latitude.  This is due to reduced cloud cover. </li></ul><p>  Other VMs, other than those coming from the ocean, also affect the climate.  Wet, moderate masses bring thaw in spring and cold in winter.  And clouds can cause precipitation.  Arctic VMs contribute to severe deterioration of climatic conditions.  And the tropical masses resume the regime of sultry summer without a drop of rain.  Here is such an amazing Kazakhstan, whose climate is diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather and climate of Kazakhstan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1123629.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Precipitation </h2><p>  Most of the precipitation falls almost at the same time of the year - in spring and summer.  The driest months are July and August.  The longest period, which was not accompanied by rain, was recognized as the last month of the summer of 2012.  It did not rain for 30 days.  Every season, rainfall pleases residents only in the mountainous regions of the state.  Kazakhstan, whose climate can cause jute, is often covered in ice.  It is because of this that the mass death of animals begins, because the grass is covered with frozen water - there is no food.  Snow is least likely to fall in the south and southwest.  Record heights can be observed in the north. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the climate in Kazakhstan" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1123631.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Astana </h2><p>  Astana is the capital of such a large state as Kazakhstan.  The climate of this city is very interesting.  The average annual temperature is not more than 4 degrees.  In the world, this capital is recognized second in its cold weather.  It is explained by the distant location from the ocean, which means that warm air masses are rare.  The maximum temperature in summer is 20 ¬∞ above zero.  Most often, this mark occurs in July.  <span>Wind speed</span> (in meters per second) - 3.8. </p>
