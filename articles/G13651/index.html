Prices for "mobile phones" crawled down.  An ordinary person could already afford to have several such devices.  In this regard, a new problem arose: what to do with an unnecessary old telephone?  Is it possible to throw it in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old phone" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15218/341236.jpg" width="300"></div>  container with general rubbish?  Will it harm the environment?  On the other hand, in its design, working details have been preserved.  Can I use them somewhere?  Let's look at these issues in more detail.

    <h2>  What is the problem?  Threw it out, that's all! </h2><p>  Oddly enough, disposing of mobile phones is not an easy task.  It is a complex technological process and does not promise economic benefits.  Therefore, the solution of this issue at the legislative level is assigned either to specialized state enterprises, or to a company engaged in the production of devices or their import into the country.  There are disposal points in many large cities of Russia.  There you can hand over your old phone.  However, it is worth recognizing that this area in our country is still poorly developed.  Not every village has the ability to safely dispose of a mobile device.  This is especially true of its most toxic part - elements of the food system.  Then it‚Äôs worth a try </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ringtone old phone" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15218/341238.jpg" width="294"></div>  Look at another option where you can attach your old phone.

The details of a device that has served its useful life may come in handy in their activity.  Usually they have the most popular keys, back covers and screens.  The master will have to hand over the unnecessary <span>battery</span> to disposal himself.  Most likely, he will already have experience with such a procedure, and he will carry out everything according to the applicable standards. </p><h2>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãan old phone </h2><p>  If the device is still in working condition, it makes sense to try to sell it.  You can start a buyer search by viewing ads on this topic in print media and on the Internet.  It will also be useful to place a message about the sale yourself.  Many people who do not have a large budget of personal funds are not averse to purchasing a used item.  They will be happy to respond to the announcement.  In addition, it is worth watching the promotions of large trading companies.  Often, they are invited to exchange the old phone for a new one.  You can get rid of an unnecessary device here by making an additional profitable purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exchange old phone for new" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15218/341213.jpg?1393096090377" width="351"></div>

    <h2>  "I'll give my pet in good hands ..." </h2><p>  There are situations when it seems that the phone is outdated morally.  Everything works in it.  However, the design is already out of fashion.  The device‚Äôs capabilities are not enough to listen to a modern fashionable ringtone in good quality.  I want to replace the old phone with a new model.  It‚Äôs a pity to sell it or sell it for spare parts.  In this case, you can give your favorite ‚Äúmobile phone‚Äù to those people for whom <span>fashionable devices</span> do not really matter.  For example, a senior citizen or a child.  Such gifts help establish good <span>interpersonal relationships.</span>  In the end, an unnecessary machine can simply be put aside in a drawer until better times.  There is always the possibility that a newly purchased phone will fail.  And then you need the help of an old reliable friend. </p>
