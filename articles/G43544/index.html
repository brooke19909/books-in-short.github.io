  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modular origami. Cactus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Flowers are different: yellow and red, large and fragrant, small, fluffy ... But they are the same in one: each flower is a unique creation of nature, each is good in its own way, but always pleasant.  In general, the presence of flowers in the house favorably affects the mood of its inhabitants, creates a unique atmosphere of comfort.  But where can I get fresh flowers all the time?  If you do not belong to the oligarchs, then surely this question will arise with you.  And there is a way out - you can create flowers yourself!  And, believe me, skillfully made, exhibited in exclusive, made by their own hands, vases, such flowers will delight and delight at the same time: after all, in addition to aesthetic decoration, they will be decoration and design. </p><p>  Origami flowers are the embodiment of nature's perfection in paper.  This is a double perfection: first, the mother earth creates beauty, then a person with the help of his genius repeats the natural beauty in other materials and using special techniques.  <span>Paper flowers are</span> pleasing to the eye and warm the soul just like living flowers.  The only way they differ significantly is the lack of smell.  But they serve the owners much longer and <span>protect nature.</span>  In addition, work on a small masterpiece will unite the whole family for several evenings, and it is worth a lot! </p><p>  And now about what can be done using the "modular origami" technique.  Cactus!  Surprised?  But in fact, a <span>cactus blooms</span> extremely rarely, and not everyone can admire its truly magnificent flower.  And here is an ever-flowering option.  Origami cactus is ideal for the described technique.  The modules, when properly connected, create a texture that is very similar to the thorns of our good friend.  But the cactus <span>from the origami modules</span> does not prick - it just pleases the eye!  In addition, you can attach as many paper colors to your main cactus ‚Äúball‚Äù as your imagination allows.  And the living cactus is still unknown how many will give out.  Flowers are also created using the origami technique.  Thus, the modular origami "cactus" consists of two parts, as it were: the creation of the plant itself and the flowers on it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no wide variety of schemes for creating an origami cactus on the net - probably because the cacti themselves are not very diverse.  On the other hand, the resemblance to a living flower is so successful that I probably do not want to invent the best in connection with the already good one.  It mainly varies in size, color, originality and color performance. </p><p>  The most important question of origami masters is to select the most suitable material from which to prepare the modules.  So, craftsmen here also found an original solution to the problem, which makes it easy to make unique.  Take it just ... stickers!  Properly cropped in order to twist the origami module, they will serve as an excellent basis for your craft.  Firstly, the paper is thick, and secondly, the color of the stickers can be really very attractive and bright.  Thirdly, to create the ‚ÄúModular Origami Cactus‚Äù craft, you do not need a very large number of modules - the plant itself will require about 200 folded triangles, about 100 modules will need to be prepared for a vase, and flowers are not an element that is expensive for materials (rather, it is laborious). </p><p>  That's all the secrets of how to create a modular origami ‚Äúcactus‚Äù.  By and large, for those who already know about the technique of creating "elongated" balls from origami modules, there is no need to look for a diagram: a simple photograph will be enough to understand the sequence of making crafts.  Of course, a few evenings will be spent on ‚Äútwisting‚Äù the modules - but on the other hand, a pleasant <span>rare flower</span> that blossoms in your house will retain its freshness and brightness of colors for a long time.  Happy creative minutes to you and your loved ones! </p>
