    <p>  Many residents of the country at least once in their life rested at the famous resort in Sochi.  And very close to the sea is the sanatorium "Turquoise" (Lazarevskoye).  Address - Krasnodar Territory, the city of Sochi, the village of Lazarevskoye, Victory Street, 167. </p><h2>  General description of the health resort </h2><p>  Of course, the favorable location of the sanatorium is one of its most important advantages.  After all, the buildings were built almost on the Black Sea coast - the distance to the beach is only 70 meters.  From the northern winds, the village of Lazarevskoye is protected by the peaks of the Caucasus Range, which creates unsurpassed, unique landscapes.  And very close are the mouths of two mountain rivers - Svir and Psezuapse.  Yes, and Olympic facilities are not so far away. </p><p>  The sanatorium itself has a rather large territory of its own, over which a whole team of landscape designers worked.  Intricate bushes, bright flower beds, exotic plants, cleaned walkways and comfortable benches in the shade of trees will delight every vacationer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The health resort consists of two buildings - these are Turquoise and Black Sea.  They not only accommodate living rooms, but also a diagnostic center and treatment rooms. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Biryuza" (Lazarevskoye): description of rooms and living conditions </h2>
