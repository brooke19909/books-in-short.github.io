  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the human brain</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is useful not only to a specialist doctor, but also to every educated person to know the basic information about the structure of the brain.  The brain, its properties and vital functions in many respects remain a mystery to modern science.  A huge section in medicine is devoted to the study of the brain. </p><p>  <strong>Brain departments</strong> </p><p>  For beginners to study the structure of the brain, you need to know that there are five main departments: middle, oblong, posterior, intermediate, final.  The structure of the midbrain, posterior and medulla, has many similarities with the spinal cord.  These departments have nerves for communication with internal organs, muscles, skin and are united by the general scientific term ‚Äústem part of the brain‚Äù.  The <span>diencephalon is</span> also often referred to this part <span>.</span> </p><p>  The device of the final brain, and especially its hemispheres, has significant differences from the departments of the stem.  The accumulation of nerve cells here reaches 109. This is a huge number of neurons located in several layers.  Evolved as a result of labor and speech, the <span>human brain</span> is the most developed among all existing on the planet.  The cerebral hemispheres are, in fact, a material substrate that defines higher nervous activity. </p><p>  <strong>Brain shells</strong> </p><p>  Studying the structure of the brain, one cannot miss the attention of its shell.  The brain, like the spinal cord, is surrounded by 3 membranes: internal, middle and external. </p><p>  The inner shell (soft) is directly adjacent to the brain and accurately repeats its relief.  Plexuses of blood vessels are located in the ventricles of the brain, producing protective <span>cerebrospinal fluid.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The middle shell (arachnoid) does not enter the furrows, but spreads between the convolutions, forming spaces (tanks) in which the cerebrospinal fluid circulates. </p><p>  The outer shell (hard) has special processes (outgrowths) that are located between the parts of the brain and protect it from concussion.  The most significant are the cerebral crescent associated with a longitudinal groove between the hemispheres, and, in addition to it, will outline the cerebellum separating the cerebellum and the hemispheres.  Sinuses are located in the outer shell (special channels through which outflow of venous blood occurs).  The main sines include sagittal (lower and upper), transverse (right and left), sigmoid (right and left) and direct sinus.  The function of blood supply to the brain is carried out by the internal vertebral and carotid arteries.  They also formed the arterial circle, which is located at the base of the brain. </p><p>  <strong>Appointment of the cerebral cortex</strong> </p><p>  Studying the <span>human brain,</span> structure and functions, we observe that certain centers of the cerebral cortex have a direct connection with certain processes of the body.  Animal experiments have shown that centers do not have a clear functional distinction.  During the experiments, a certain part of the cerebral cortex was destroyed, which theoretically was responsible for certain actions.  At the same time, a picture was often observed when another part of the cerebral cortex took over the destroyed functions.  This property is associated with a high level of plasticity of the cerebral cortex.  Therefore, many scientists still deny the very concept of "centers".  In general, modern science recognizes the fact that different regions of the cortex have different purposes, but there is no strict separation between them.  The centers of these areas are clusters of analyzer cores.  In peripheral areas, cells perform less specialized tasks.  Certain sections of the cortex provide movement, skin and proprioceptive sensitivity, the ability to hear, see and other functions. </p><p>  This is, in general terms, the structure of the human brain. </p>
