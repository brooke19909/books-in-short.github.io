Snow-white beaches will appeal to lovers of a relaxing pastime, and young people will appreciate the stormy parties that are held throughout the country.  For history buffs, there are many ancient Buddhist monuments and temples in Thailand.  Choosing a place for a budget holiday, you should pay attention to The Jomtien Twelve 3 * hotel (Thailand, Pattaya).  What is this hotel like? </p><h2>  Basic hotel information </h2><p>  The small hotel offers tourists 60 rooms, which are designed for two people.  It was built in 2005 in an area not far from the beach.  Travelers from all over the world stop here, but most of all tourists are from Asia.  The Jomtien Twelve Hotel is also preferred by locals.  In addition to their native language, the staff speaks English.  Therefore, Russian-speaking tourists who do not know the basic knowledge of this language, it will be difficult to understand the hotel administrator. </p>

Tourists will be able to enter their room no earlier than 14:00 local time.  By the way, the time difference with Moscow here is +4 hours.  At the end of the vacation, you must leave the hotel no later than 12:00.  The hottest season in Thailand is considered the period from March to May.  Nevertheless, tourists come here all year round, because even in the winter months the temperature in the country rarely drops below 20 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Hotel The Jomtien Twelve Hotel 3 * (Pattaya) boasts a favorable location.  It is located in the southern part of the resort, in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJomtien Beach.  Unlike the northern part of Pattaya, it is suitable for a relaxing holiday.

The path to the sea will take only a couple of minutes.  Pattaya Pedestrian Street, where you can buy inexpensive things and souvenirs, is 5 km from the hotel.  It is also worth visiting the local aquarium, 2 km away from the complex.  You can get around the resort by taxi or tuk-tuk (small buses with an open top). </p>

Guests can use the fitness room or relax in the hot tub.  The hotel also has its own terrace, surrounded by a lush garden where you can stroll in the afternoon or evening. </p><h2>  Relax in a hotel with children </h2><p>  Unfortunately, The Jomtien Twelve 3 * hotel (Thailand, Pattaya) does not provide suitable conditions for tourists with children.  Coming here with a small child, it is worth considering that the hotel has no cradles for babies.  But the main restaurant is equipped with high chairs for feeding.  If necessary, children can leave the nanny, who offers their services for an hourly fee.  Parents will have to do leisure activities for their children on their own.  On the territory of the hotel there is no mini-club, no children's animation, no playground, no pool. </p><h2>  Advantages of the hotel </h2><p>  Before buying a trip to Thailand, you should definitely read the opinions of tourists about hotels.  The Jomtien Twelve Hotel has positive and negative reviews.  First, we list the main advantages of relaxing in this place: </p><ul><li>  Clean and comfortable rooms that are consistent with the cost of living.  All rooms are carefully cleaned daily. </li><li>  Good breakfasts.  The hotel provides about 6 dishes to choose from, while you can take as much as you want. </li><li>  Good location.  Walking to the beach in less than a minute, and the center can be reached in half an hour. </li><li>  The Internet works without interruptions, and its speed is good, so you can even watch movies and listen to music. </li><li>  A clean beach with few local people.  It is not crowded, and the sea is very warm. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Hotel Disadvantages </h2><p>  The Jomtien Twelve Hotel is not an ideal place to relax.  According to tourists, it has serious shortcomings that can overshadow a vacation in Thailand.  Consider the most significant of them: </p><ul><li>  Rooms that do not have a balcony or terrace have nowhere to dry clothes.  Even in the bathroom there are no special hangers or ropes. </li><li>  Moody staff.  Administrators work slowly, no one smiles.  They do not understand English well. </li><li>  Near the road it is very noisy, so you should take rooms with access to the sea.  Old air conditioners are also very noisy. </li><li>  The closets in the rooms smell of mold and dampness. </li><li>  Dark rooms that overlook neighboring buildings. </li><li>  In the rooms ants crawl. </li><li>  Towels are issued stained in blood. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, we can conclude that The Jomtien Twelve hotel will be a good option for travelers who want to save money.  For a small fee, it provides ample amenities.  It is worth recommending this hotel to tourists who prefer not to sit in the hotel, but to organize their leisure activities on their own.  People looking for a relaxing beach holiday can be bored here.  Families with small children should still choose a different hotel.  This place is more targeted at youth companies. </p>
