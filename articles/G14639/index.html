    <p>  Despite the fact that holidays in Altai are not in great demand, it is here that you can enjoy the real Russian nature, which has not lost its originality and naturalness.  Resting here is not a cheap pleasure, but it's worth it, you can easily forget about all your problems and unresolved tasks and relax. </p><p>  All the fuss here recedes into the background, and a person learns to live in harmony with his own "I", which is why many people call Altai a magical place.  The worldview is simplified so much that even simple things appear in a completely different perspective, many businessmen and busy people come here to dump their thoughts and just live aimlessly for several days. </p><p>  Before the trip, it is best to clarify where you can relax in Altai in the summer at a low price, since the cost of a tourist permit may be higher than you expected.  As an option - to go on vacation and the "savage", but this is best done in a friendly company than alone, it is also worth taking care of organizing your vacation in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Teletskoye Lake and its surroundings </h2>
