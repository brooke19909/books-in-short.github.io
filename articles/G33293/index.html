In 1697, after the Russian troops ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù the Turks more and more, they erected the fortified town of Achuyev in the village.  After the capture of territory by Russian troops, the city lasted until 1777.  Hence the name of the modern settlement, in which a little less than 500 people live today. </p><p>  The main feature of the settlement is its unique geographical location, the sleeve of the Protoka river, which belongs to the Kuban delta in the place where it flows into the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  In the encyclopedic dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron about Achuyevo, Slavic region of the Krasnodar Territory, there were only eulogies about fishing.  It is here that you can catch red fish, white shamai and ram. </p>

    <h2>  Fish factory and local people </h2><p>  By the way, the huge amount of fish in these places was used by the Cossacks who came here in 1793, they immediately erected a fish factory.  According to some reports, about 18 thousand rubles were earned in the first year of operation of the enterprise. </p><p>  However, in the 40s of the last century, the fish factory was transferred to private hands, and catches decreased by 50 times.  Whether this is the inability to conduct business, or uncontrolled fishing is unknown.  As a result, the activity of the enterprise began to ‚Äúfade‚Äù.  Now the plant is working, but it cannot be said that it is too successful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The population in the village increased very slowly.  In 1910, about 200 people lived here, that is, exactly as many as were required for fishing and processing of the catch.  But the second problem of the settlement was roads, or rather, their absence.  It was possible to solve the problem only in 1930, it was then that the highway and even infrastructure appeared in the form of preschool institutions (kindergarten and nursery) and a school, a culture club. </p><p>  The village of Achuevo of the Krasnodar Territory completely disappeared from the face of the Earth 2 times over the entire period of its existence.  The first time this happened during the civil war, and the second time a hurricane wind completely destroyed the village in 1969. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  The village cannot boast of developed infrastructure, especially for vacationers.  But they mostly come here to fish or to hunt. </p><p>  In the village of Achuevo, Krasnodar Territory, there are no hotels and restaurants, only the houses of local residents, houses of foresters and even a children's camp.  But in the area there are many estuaries, channels and canals, precisely those places where there will be magnificent fishing.  After all, it was not for nothing that under Ivan the Terrible it was from this locality that black caviar and sterlet were delivered. </p><p>  But do not break the law and use prohibited methods.  In recent years, local fish surveillance has already accumulated rich experience in successfully combating poachers.  It is best to contact the local fishing community, purchase a license literally for a nominal fee, and enjoy the beauty and catch calmly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hunting </h2><p>  But the rest in Achuyevo of the Krasnodar Territory is famous not only for fishing, hunting lovers come here.  Many reservoirs provide shelter for ducks, drakes, geese.  In sparse thickets there are wild boars, brown hares, foxes, pheasants and raccoons. </p>

    <h2>  What should not be forgotten? </h2><p>  Going on a vacation in Achuyevo of the Krasnodar Territory, reviews confirm this, remember that the infrastructure is not yet developed here.  First of all, the nearest ATM is located in the station.  Petrovskaya, however, like a gas station. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that there are many mosquitoes here, so it is better to stock up with mosquito nets and special means to protect against insects. </p>

    <h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  Despite the almost complete absence of comfortable conditions for recreation and underdeveloped infrastructure, the village has quite big prospects in the near future to become a real resort.  Indeed, there is everything for this: it is an opportunity to organize fishing and hunting, the provision of balneological services, the availability of space for mooring of small-sized marine vessels.  Today, according to preliminary estimates, 45 hectares of the coast is ready for development.  Therefore, there is hope that in the near future Achuyevo will become the resort mecca of the Kuban. </p>
