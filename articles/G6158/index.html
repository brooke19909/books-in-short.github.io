Make pants for the boy on an elastic band.  These pants are perfect for daily wear, and you can also sew a festive version.  Patterns of six different styles you can find in this article. </p><h2>  Plain pants </h2><p>  There is nothing easier than to <span>sew pants</span> for a boy on an elastic band.  The pattern consists of only two parts.  Accordingly, the product will need to be supplemented with wide elastic bands that will support the pants on the belt and be fixed at the ankles.  In such trousers the boy can walk and walk around the house.  They do not constrain movements, and in them the child will feel comfortable.  But for a festive event, such pants are not suitable.  They are too simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of children's trousers for preschool children" class="if uuid-2229408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2229408.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of children's trousers for preschool children is given above.  To stitch such pants, you should scale the picture and print it in the right size.  To do this, you need to measure the length of the trouser leg of the child, as well as his waist circumference.  Based on these dimensions, we scale the pattern.  Now you need to cut it on the fabric.  There is nothing complicated.  We circle the pattern on the material and cut out the details.  We make side seams.  A wide elastic band must be sewn into the upper part of the product, as well as into the legs.  Pants can be made with patch pockets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Long pants </h2><p>  It is good to sew such trousers from <span>waterproof fabric,</span> and to use a synthetic winterizer as a lining.  These pants will protect the child from the cold wind and slanting rain.  And to sew them will be completely easy.  <span>The pattern of trousers</span> for a boy on an elastic band is presented in the article.  It needs to be scaled, printed, and then transferred to the tracing paper through the window.  As a result, you should get two shelves - back and front. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of children's trousers with an elastic band for a boy" class="if uuid-2235639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235639.jpg"></div><p>  We translate the patterns on the fabric.  You should get 4 parts.  Do not forget that the right and left trouser-legs should be cut in mirror image.  If you plan to sew trousers on a lining, it means that you will need to cut another 4 parts from sintepon and from lining material.  Now you need to sew all the details in pairs.  First of all, on all legs, we lay the side seams.  If the product is sewn with a lining, then the inside is first assembled, and only then it turns around the outside.  The last step is to gum in.  It should be inserted both in the belt and in the legs. </p><h2>  Jeans </h2><p>  These trousers will be similar to those that appear in the first paragraph of this article, but the difference will be in the average seam, or rather in its presence.  In this model, it is assumed.  But why bother doing an extra seam if you can do without it?  The fact is that clothing, consisting of a large number of parts and having structural tucks, always sits better.  Therefore, do not spare the time to create a product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pants on an elastic band for the boy a pattern" class="if uuid-2236059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2236059.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of trousers on an elastic band for the boy is attached above.  We will sew such pants from denim material, as the guys often fall, and the thin fabric will quickly become worthless.  We cut out 4 details from the fabric and begin to sew them in pairs.  First we make the legs, and then attach them to each other.  Sew the gum last.  In this model, it will be a decorative element, so you should pick it up to match the fabric. </p><h2>  Short trousers </h2><p>  To make such panties will be a rather difficult task.  After all, this style is a complete copy of the adult model.  The pattern of children's trousers with an elastic band is not difficult for the boy.  First, you need to adjust it to the height of the child.  When this action is completed, you need to transfer the pattern to paper.  It should be cut in dashed lines, that is, to separate the front and rear pockets.  They will require separate patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ready-made pattern of trousers for a boy on an elastic band" class="if uuid-2235369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2235369.jpg"></div><p>  Now you need to start manufacturing fabric parts.  When they are ready, you can proceed to sewing trousers.  The first thing that gets together is the big details.  Then, front and rear pockets are sewn to the legs.  And only after that the trouser legs are stitched together.  Lastly, the elastic is sewn into the belt.  Be sure to process the edges of the legs.  It is not necessary to sew in the elastic there, you should tuck them and sew. </p><h2>  Shorts </h2><p>  The finished <span>pattern of pants</span> on an elastic band for the boy is presented below.  On it you can sew as full pants and shorts.  Everything will depend on the size and length that you give the product.  Scale the pattern, and then cut it out.  Now you should transfer all the details to the fabric.  You need to choose a dense material, even for summer.  Why?  Most boys are quite active, so they can‚Äôt sit still and run all the time.  From constant friction, the pants quickly become unusable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pants on an elastic band for a boy: pattern" class="if uuid-2229412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2229412.jpg"></div><p>  After all the details are cut, you can proceed to sewing.  First you should sew decorative overlays.  Then you need to sew the legs.  And only after that you can download the product.  On the pattern you can see the belt.  You must first sew the fabric to the elastic, and then attach to the top of the trousers.  If desired, the pants can be decorated with the application of the favorite cartoon character of the son. </p><h2>  Pants for the smallest </h2><p>  The pattern of trousers on an elastic band for a boy who has recently turned six months old will look like the one shown in the image below.  Sewing such pants on your own is easy, you just need to know exactly the growth of your baby.  Based on this parameter, you should scale the attached image below.  We translate the pattern onto paper, and then cut out the details from felt or any other soft fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of children's trousers for preschool children" class="if uuid-2229600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2229600.jpg"></div><p>  We proceed to sewing the product.  The first step is to sew the trousers together.  Then you need to attach a pad to them.  We sew it to the bottom of the trouser leg, and in order for it to be easily fastened, buttons or velcro should be installed on the pants.  Now it remains to assemble the product and stitch the elastic.  For such trousers, you can sew a sweater in the kit, the pattern for which is shown in the same image. </p>
