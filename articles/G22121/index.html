    <p>  Exceeds the length of this unusual street and the length of Ukraine from its western to eastern borders. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The longest street in the world originates from the center of Toronto, from the seafront promenade located near <span>Lake Ontario.</span>  Young Street seems to cut the city into two.  It leaves the center towards the north and goes around two lakes - Cochrane and Simko.  Then the street makes a smooth U-turn and ends at the very border with the Canadian <span>state of Minnesota.</span> </p><h2></h2><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Initially, various parts of Young Street were Indians' trails.  This road was used by troops and discoverers from Europe.  A little later, the British bought a thousand square kilometers of land in these places.  And in 1793 the street was given a name.  Governor John Simcoe, who was a British citizen, named her in honor of <span>George Young.</span>  He ordered to clear the street and make the area passable.  His order was carried out by the owners of land adjacent to this territory.  And already from 1816 on this road there was a constant roar from carriages, crews and carts.  By the mid-nineteenth century, the longest street in the world (Young Street) had become rightfully central in the city of Toronto. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Present day </h2><p>  Central Toronto Street never ceases to amaze with its diversity.  There are skyscrapers on it, which are adjacent to the classical buildings.  Next to them are Victorian mansions. </p>
