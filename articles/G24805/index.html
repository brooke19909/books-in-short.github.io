    <p>  Why are buttons needed?  It would seem that the answer is obvious.  For the convenience of wearing clothes.  But if you make an excursion into history, you can find out amazing and curious facts. </p><p>  In ancient times, people wore clothes from hides.  About any buttons then there was no question.  But walking that way was pretty uncomfortable.  The impromptu robe constantly swung open and strove to jump off the shoulders.  Then our ancestors began to cut holes in the skins and fastened them with animal bones or wooden sticks.  They did not even think about <span>how to sew buttons.</span>  But inexorable time flew, new fabrics appeared, and fasteners also changed.  In the Middle Ages, instead of bones and sticks, pebbles with drilled holes began to be used, on which loops were thrown.  It is these pebbles that served as the prototype of modern buttons.  Buttons themselves appeared much later.  Initially, they performed the function not of a fastener, but of decoration.  Sometimes one button cost more than the whole costume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was then that the tradition of attaching this jewelry to clothes arose.  Advice on how to sew buttons was passed from mouth to mouth.  Seamstresses and maids taught this, both merchants and noble people spoke about this.  The buttons were different in shape.  However, their main types have survived to our time: on a leg, with two and four holes. </p><p>  The methods of fastening this small part are still alive.  There are certain rules for how to sew buttons: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why do you need buttons" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/133493.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <ol><li>  Always start sewing from the wrong side. </li><li>  It is enough to make 5-7 stitches so that the button fits tightly on the clothes. </li><li>  If the fabric is too thick, do not pull the button strongly, let it slightly move away from the surface.  This will prevent damage to the product if the button suddenly comes off. </li><li>  For outerwear and knitwear, it is better to use two buttons.  One, decorative, will be located on the front side, and the second - auxiliary - on the wrong side.  This will make the seam more durable and help to avoid tearing the fabric. </li></ol><p>  Has anyone ever wondered why buttons on men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes are from different sides?  There are three hypotheses in this regard.  The first claims that women were previously dressed by maids, so it was convenient for them to fasten the hooks if they were on the left side.  There is a second assumption: the mother most often holds the baby‚Äôs head near the left breast, closer to the heart.  With her right hollow clothes, it is easier for her to cover him from the cold, which is why they made her open to that side. </p><p>  According to the third version, men take weapons in their right hands.  In order to repel an attack at any time, this hand should not freeze.  So he warms her in the bosom.  Therefore, the left side of the clothes swings open. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why on men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs clothes buttons from different sides" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/133498.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <p>  But all these hypotheses are purely conditional.  Men's braids have clasps on the left side.  Also, Orthodox priests buttons on the cassock are located on the left. </p><p>  And there is an interesting sign: how to sew buttons to become happy.  So, when fixing a button with four holes, keep in mind: </p><ul><li>  cross stitches will make you beautiful and healthy; </li><li>  two horizontal parallels will develop intuition; </li><li>  the square will bring harmony with the outside world. </li></ul><p>  It would seem that a small, nondescript button ... But how many interesting things are connected with it! </p>
