  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian style of the house: modernity, architecture and design features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, people who are drawn to nature, is becoming more and more.  Residents of large cities prefer to have a house in the style of a Russian estate in the country. </p><p>  The choice of land in the real estate market is quite wide, while you need to properly approach this issue, given some important points. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russia-siberia-altai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="style features" class="if uuid-2734283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734283.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to assess the remoteness of the land from highways.  It is advisable to find out what types of transport you can get to your site.  If there are no normal roads nearby, building a house will be an expensive pleasure, since materials will have to be transported in some other way. </p><p>  The best option is the location of the land near the traffic intersection, but away from heavy traffic.  Check also the proximity to the site of utilities, especially power lines.  In this case, in the process of construction work, you can use electric energy, which will significantly speed up the process.  Factors such as the proximity of roads, engineering systems, remoteness from settlements, will affect the value of the land. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myuniquerussia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="houses from timber in the Russian style" class="if uuid-2734751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/2734751.jpg"></div><h2>  Plot design </h2><p>  Before choosing projects of houses in the Russian style, be sure to analyze the terrain, assess the condition of the soil.  Professionals advise building houses from timber on such land plots, where there is a small hill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this case, the groundwater will be located quite deeply, and there will not be any special problems when arranging the foundation of a timber house.  As soon as the land will be picked up, you can proceed to the procedure for processing documents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sims4updates.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian elements of construction" class="if uuid-2734291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734291.jpg"></div><h2>  Paperwork </h2><p>  At this stage, we advise you to use the help of a professional lawyer so that after a while it does not turn out that, besides you, this land has several more owners. </p><p>  Having completed all the work related to the paperwork for the land, proceed to the analysis of the location on the site of a residential building, other utility rooms.  Such work is important to carry out before construction.  You can purchase a finished house project in the Russian style, see the photo in the catalog.  The second option is the development of an individual project in which all your desires will be taken into account.  Design documentation should be agreed with representatives of local authorities.  Only after this it is possible to proceed to the construction of a house from a beam, as well as to the construction of other buildings on a personal plot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="journal.goingslowly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="distinctive style elements" class="if uuid-2734306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734306.jpg"></div><h2>  Style features </h2><p>  What characterizes the Russian style?  The construction of houses of this kind is becoming increasingly popular.  The image carries the centuries-old culture and folk traditions of our country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Russian style of the house is not only a unique building, but also a building with excellent thermal insulation, environmental characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian hut" class="if uuid-2734308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734308.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Among the advantages, we note the use in the construction of natural materials.  Russian style - houses that combine natural stone and wood.  These materials make it possible to create a beautiful home with an original and functional design.  Finished buildings are a manifestation of respect for the historical heritage of their people.  With the correct production of the base from the timber, the selection of the interior, you can turn the house into a modern museum, which will contain elements related to the culture of our people. </p><p>  Russian style compares favorably with other design solutions with beauty and attractiveness.  With the help of a variety of decorative elements, you can design both the facade and the interior of the house. </p><p>  Among the few shortcomings that this style has, we highlight the high cost of materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jumpic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tribute to traditions" class="if uuid-2734318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734318.jpg"></div><h2>  Characteristics </h2><p>  What distinguishes the Russian style?  The houses are built from logs or beams of coniferous wood.  Among the features of construction in Russian style, we note the use of a significant number of patterns for the exterior cladding of a house.  Most often, builders decorate railings, platbands, shutters, pediments with carved ornaments.  There are such masters of woodcarving in which the patterns are never repeated. </p><p>  The Russian style of the house from a bar is characterized by a clarified large maid.  Once a large stove was placed in it, now its place is taken by a heater or an electric fireplace.  A mandatory element of a timber house is an unheated corridor - a canopy. </p><p>  As a decoration and a functional element of the Russian house, designers consider the stove.  In winter, it will become an excellent source of heat, and in summer it will play the role of a decorative element of the Russian style.  Among the required details, without which it is impossible to imagine a genuine Russian style, there are wooden floors.  If our ancestors used wide boards for the floor, then these days they have been replaced by a laminate with imitation of natural wood, parquet board, natural parquet.  For facing the fireplace in this interior direction, limestone or natural stone is used. </p><h2>  Varieties of Russian style </h2><p>  There are three areas: </p><ul><li>  Russian country, which is characterized by the use of numerous decorative interior items: chests, wooden barrels; </li><li>  Russian hut, not suggesting unnecessary decor; </li><li>  The tower, which is the most luxurious option, involves the use of a variety of expensive decorative elements. </li></ul><h2>  Decoration Features </h2><p>  Among the features of the Russian estate, professionals note the use of through and embossed carvings, carved windows and shutters, facing the top of the roof, installing an openwork visor above the porch. </p><p>  In the decoration of the house in the Russian style, traditionally use antique pieces of furniture and floral ornaments.  To create the necessary atmosphere, wooden tables and large benches are installed as furniture.  Openwork napkins with hand embroidery are placed on the table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forums.cgsociety.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uniqueness of carved elements" class="if uuid-2734311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2734311.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What version of the project to take for the construction of a new house?  It is difficult to unequivocally answer this question, since many nuances must be taken into account.  To choose a ready-made standard house project in the Russian style or to develop your own ‚Äúdream house‚Äù with designers and architects - it depends on financial capabilities and personal desire.  Do you dream of living in a house that no one has yet invented?  In this case, order your own project of a timber house, made in the Russian style.  Experienced architects, innovative technologies, material resources, as well as original engineering structures will be required to translate your bold architectural designs into real life. </p><p>  Do not forget that the cost of design work is estimated in the range of ten percent of the total cost of construction. </p><p>  If you want to build an unconventional house or build a castle in the style of the Middle Ages, get ready for the fact that you have to order an individual project.  Nevertheless, we advise you to dwell on proven versions of houses in the Russian style, because the project will be cheaper, and there are much more guarantees that the finished house will be convenient in operation.  You will only have to adapt a typical project to the characteristics of the land plot.  For example, you can think over the foundation option for the future carved tower, purchase materials and begin construction. </p>
