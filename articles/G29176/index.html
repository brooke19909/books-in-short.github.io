This is not surprising if you look at the history of this time in terms of social development.  <span>The industrial revolution,</span> which began more than a century ago, led to serious changes in the economic system and social organization.  This refers, firstly, to the formation and development </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conservative forces" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/249942.jpg" width="300"></div>  capitalist relations based on trade and competition, and secondly, the complication of the stratification of society itself: the emergence of such categories in it as the bourgeoisie and the working class.  The old feudal <span>subsistence</span> system was dying, and with it its values ‚Äã‚Äãwere dying.  They were replaced by new ideas, developed mainly by thinkers of the New Age: John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, <span>Thomas Hobbes,</span> Charles Montesquieu and others.

    <p>  <strong>The great French revolution and conservative forces</strong> </p><p>  Actually, this event has become extremely revolutionary for the historical development of Europe.  For the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe French Enlightenment about the legitimacy of the rebellion of the people against the "bad" monarch was realized.  The identity of the latter has finally ceased to be inviolable.  The revolution became a precedent for all the other peoples of the continent and gave a start to the formation of national civil societies.  At the same time, the Great French Revolution had a very </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conservative and non-conservative forces" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/249944.jpg" width="400"></div>  dark pages in its history.  First of all, this is Robespierre terror.  The response to mass repression was the famous work of the Englishman <span>Edmund Burke.</span>  In his Thoughts on the French Revolution, he emphasized the negatives and horrors that she brought to many people of that era.  It was this pamphlet that laid the foundation for conservatism as an ideological trend, which suggested opposing the unbridled impulses of the liberals.  During the XIX and partly XX centuries, he received a significant theoretical justification of his fundamental foundations.

Conservative forces also advocate the universal preservation of traditional orders and values: social, political and spiritual.  So, in domestic politics social traditions are defended.  This is a <span>national culture,</span> patriotism, <span>moral standards</span> that have been established for centuries <span>, the</span> primacy of state interests over personal ones, the authoritative position of traditional institutions, such as the family, school, church, the continuity of social development (which, in fact, is the preservation of traditions).  The work of conservative forces in foreign policy involves betting on the creation of a strong state built on a hierarchical system.  The development of the country's military potential, the use of force in international relations, the preservation of historically traditional alliances, and protectionism in foreign trade are welcomed. </p><p>  <strong>Neoconservatism</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conservative work" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/249943.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  The conservative forces of the new order fully accept the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need for development.  However, they advocate for cautious and unhurried reforms.  Examples of such policy makers include US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister <span>Margaret Thatcher.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Conservative and non-conservative forces</strong> </p><p>  It should be noted that conservatism is a combination of political movements.  For example, fascism is also a completely conservative movement that has placed state power and greatness at the forefront.  The opponents of the conservatives are a whole range of alternative currents, left and right: liberals, in opposition to which conservative forces, socialists, communists and so on took shape. </p>
