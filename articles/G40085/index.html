Thanks to the variable depth of field, the on-screen video acquires physical bulkiness, which gives the images wonderful interactive quality.  3D technology typically requires the use of Blu-ray discs and is generally not supported by traditional DVD players. </p><h2>  Setting up a home stereo cinema </h2><p>  Surround image players function just like regular players, reproducing content from DVDs without problems.  When choosing a 3D Blu-ray player, owner reviews recommend that you consider the settings of your existing home theater.  In addition to a surround video player, a compatible HDTV is required.  To make a decision on the purchase of a device, the user must evaluate the characteristics of the existing equipment.  Although the cost of the system can be very high, 3D electronics really have unique advantages when playing movies.  In addition, you may need the HDMI and USB ports necessary for the player to perform the functions of the main device for working with multimedia content. </p>

    <p>  Although volumetric image technology, which does not require special glasses, has already been exhibited at exhibitions of electronic innovations, most consumers will need active or passive glasses, which are purchased separately from the Blu-ray player to view three-dimensional content.  Active glasses provide optimal performance, but they are usually more expensive than passive models, such as those used in movie theaters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to evaluate 3D Blu-ray players? </h2><p>  Feedback from users who have had the opportunity to make a consistent comparison of many Blu-ray players suggests that there are several key areas that you should pay attention to before making a purchase.  First of all, you need to find out the download time, the quality of the software, as well as the speed of the main menu.  To the average user, the basic performance of 3D players of different price categories will seem almost the same.  But for the more sophisticated, features such as upscaling to <span>4K resolution</span> and advanced HDMI color calibration play a key role in ensuring a high level of image quality. </p><p>  Similar to the internal characteristics of 3D Blu-ray players, connectivity may vary between players, which should also be taken into account.  For example, if all the rest of the home theater equipment is connected via optical cables, then the player with coaxial output will not work well with the entire system and will require the purchase of a separate converter. </p><p>  Along with the price and quality of playback, there are other indicators that determine how well the player will combine with other consumer electronics.  When buying a new model, the following factors should be considered. </p>

    <h2>  Streaming Application Support </h2><p>  Modern 3D players come with additional tools that may be useful to consumers.  Like most other home theater components, players are capable of supporting streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.  DLNA support is also important.  The technology allows you to broadcast multimedia content to a TV over a local network.  In both cases, the <span>best players</span> can function as efficient multi-tasking home entertainment centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions and Design </h2><p>  If the home theater system is already overloaded with additional devices, then the physical dimensions of 3D Blu-ray players are also recommended by user reviews.  Standard 3D video players usually follow a general trend, becoming thinner, lighter and requiring a minimum number of connections. </p><p>  Large multi-purpose models can combine 3D functionality with other features such as media server functions and streaming media support.  Devices of this type are much more versatile than standard players, but they are usually comparable in size to home AV receivers. </p>

    <h2>  Should I buy players with a resolution of 4K? </h2><p>  The name 4K is used to refer to televisions with a resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels, which exceeds the standards of HDTV receivers in 1080p or 720p format.  Generally speaking, such devices benefit from higher image quality, but since this is a relatively young technology, the availability of UHD content is very limited.  In addition to the pioneer risk, the new 3D Blu-ray player models with 4K resolution have the advantage of being able to maximize the visual performance of an ultra-high definition home television. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Remote control </h2><p>  Like all home devices, 3D players come with their own remote controls to control features such as playback and volume control.  Their design can vary significantly depending on the manufacturer, and their sizes range from a small wallet to bulky devices covered with buttons.  If there is no desire to get another remote control, then some manufacturers offer applications for smartphones or tablets that allow you to remotely control a three-dimensional video player. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Any instruction manual for 3D Blu-ray players begins with a description of how to connect the player to the TV.  This can be done directly using an HDMI cable by connecting it to the corresponding connectors.  Then, change the source to HDMI on the TV.  In addition, the connection can be made through the receiver or amplifier, which provide the transmission of 3D-signal by connecting its input to the player, and the output to the television receiver.  After that, you need to activate the digital output of the player.  In addition, depending on the model of the player, you may need to connect to the receiver or amplifier through analog, coaxial or optical ports.  Next, you need to establish a network connection by connecting the device to the access point via the Ethernet connector or by selecting the desired wireless connection.  After adjusting the image in accordance with the screen settings, loading a disc and wearing 3D glasses, you can enjoy watching a stereo movie. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  User reviews call the optimal 3D Blu-ray player a universal player with support for the best functional capabilities of surround image viewing systems.  ORRO BDP-103, for example, takes up a lot of space, but provides a variety of interfaces and image settings that allow it to become a central element of the living room.  The LG BKS4000 Karaoke Player offers a complete microphone, catalog, and 4000-song CD.  The Sony BDP-S6500 basic model combines the best features of home theater systems, including 4K support.  Finally, the Panasonic DMP-BDT460 offers an intuitive user interface and capabilities appropriate for high-end systems, including integrated 2D to 3D conversion.  In addition to these options, an overview of 3D Blu-ray players allows you to highlight the Denon DBT1713 and Yamaha BD-S677 players that cope well with their task.  Although they have some minor flaws in playing back three-dimensional content, this is more than offset by the excellent support for streaming multimedia as a hub for a home theater. </p><p>  Below is a brief overview of the 3D Blu-ray players of the new models, featuring the best value for money. </p>

    <h2>  Yamaha BD-S677 </h2><p>  With limited versatility, the player's specifications and functionality allow it to become a solid foundation for a home theater system.  The Yamaha BD-S677 3D Blu-ray Disc Player is a kind of exception because it is one of the few devices that do not support Netflix and Hulu Plus streaming.  But this is offset by other strengths of the model.  Given that Yamaha began as a manufacturer of musical instruments, it is not surprising that this surround video player has great sound.  It will not only satisfy any audio file with SACD playback, but it also supports many types of discs and audio files, including DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD.  The menu navigation is very convenient.  The player loads in a record short time of 2.1 seconds.  However, few people buy 3D-players just for the sake of high-quality sound.  Video is also very important.  S677 provides a fairly high-quality image, but the player lacks additional functionality in the form of 4K scaling and a 2D / 3D converter.  The device is compatible with Miracast, which allows you to transfer media from a smartphone or tablet.  Also available are applications for Android and iOS, which turn the phone into a remote control.  Despite support for YouTube and VUDU for video, Picasa for photos, and Dropbox for playing cloud-based media files, the inability to serve streaming network broadcasts can be a decisive shortcoming. </p><h2>  LG BP550 </h2><p>  The model combines features and design focused on entry-level home theaters.  The player measures 269 x 196 x 43 mm and weighs 0.86 kg.  Thanks to standard support for 24-fps playback, there are no problems with 3D content.  LG's Blu-ray player delivers a decent download time of 8.8 seconds.  To fulfill the role of a media center, the model lacks color depth and 4K support.  But the BP550 is compatible with standard audio formats such as Dolby TrueHD, although it has only a coaxial output.  The latter may be an obstacle for systems using optical audio ports.  A significant part of the capabilities of the LG Blu-ray player is provided by its software.  The operating system has large icons and a simple menu.  LG supports DLNA and video streaming service applications such as Netflix.  There is Wi-Fi, Ethernet and a mobile application. </p>

    <h2>  Philips BDP7501 </h2><p>  Philips 3D Blu-ray player is a small device measuring 221 x 221 x 61 mm and weighing 1.6 kg.  The BDP7501 reproduces the image in Ultra HD quality (including enhancements such as HDR and Wide Color Gamut) and allows you to play standard discs (both 2D and 3D), DVD and CD, and perform 4K scaling.  Connectivity is limited to 2 HDMI outputs (of which 1 is for audio only).  There are no other output ports (analog or digital).  There is an input USB port for access to digital photos, video and music content using flash or other compatible drives.  The BDP7501 is equipped with Ethernet and Wi-Fi for direct access to Netflix and YouTube (up to 4K), and to digital media files from compatible network devices such as PCs and media servers.  However, Philips 3D Blu-ray player does not provide access to the popular streaming services Amazon Video, Hulu, Vudu or Pandora.  To do this, you need the latest Smart TV model or an external media streamer.  Streaming offers are a weak point of the device, but Ultra HD support is its main advantage. </p>
