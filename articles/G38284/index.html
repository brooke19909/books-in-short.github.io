Park Hotel not only practices a quiet and relaxing holiday in the lap of nature, it will delight visitors and active activities. </p><h2>  Rest of aristocrats </h2><p>  The total territory of this complex near Moscow is 44 hectares.  On this square there is a thematic square with alleys, ponds and arbors.  Many centuries in a row noblemen and aristocrats walked through this forest. </p>

    <p>  However, not only a quiet holiday the complex offers.  Tennis, swimming pool, treadmills like those who love sports games.  Relaxing and beauty treatments can be booked at the SPA.  A cozy restaurant offers tasty food, dance and a good time. </p><p>  In the hall on the ground floor there is also table tennis.  However, visitors are divided, it is better to take rackets and balls from home, as they are hired for a tidy amount at the hotel. </p><p>  On a unique and picturesque land stands the Park Hotel Vozdvizhenskoe.  Serpukhov is a city near which there is a complex rich in amazing monuments of architecture and culture of past centuries.  Therefore, you can order an interesting excursion and enrich yourself spiritually, the guests are sure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work gaps </h2><p>  Visitors complain that literally on the threshold of the hotel they were waiting for the first disappointment.  Often, especially before the holidays, large queues are formed before registration - you have to wait a long time.  If adults relate to such a problem with understanding, then the children are completely unaware of what is happening, and begin to act up from boredom. </p><p>  As noted earlier, the complex is very large, but many visitors say that it is uncomfortable, there is no pleasant atmosphere. </p><p>  The staff does not cope with all the tasks.  This is another drawback that the Park Hotel Vozdvizhenskoe cannot overcome.  Jobs in this institution are constantly open.  Many visitors note that they will return to the complex only after the service changes. </p>

    <h2>  All to the table! </h2><p>  The guests leave completely different reviews about the kitchen.  Many say that the menu is exquisite, the dishes are delicious, but the portions could be larger.  The food is very hearty, so no one goes hungry.  Dietary products.  There are no fried, fatty and harmful dishes on the tables.  Therefore, in addition to rest, people improve their health.  Menus change quite often. </p><p>  Other guests declare that those who like ordinary cuisine will like the restaurant.  But in reality, such an advertised complex as Vozdvizhenskoe should offer much more.  Park Hotel does not pay attention to what is happening in the kitchen.  Dishes are served cold.  There are practically no fresh vegetables and fruits on the tables.  Moreover, some visitors complain that cooks can even spoil simple products like potatoes, pasta and fish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Water treatments </h2><p>  You can wave by swimming in the pool.  It is located in the second building nearby.  The water temperature is kept at +28 ¬∞ C.  There is also a sauna.  However, many visitors note that it is often closed. </p><p>  The pool is comfortable.  Length reaches 25 meters.  Of course, guests share, the design could be better, but the interior does not affect entertainment.  The pool is deep enough to swim freely in it. </p><p>  The Vozdvizhenskoe complex is criticized a lot.  The park hotel has a swimming pool, but most guests note that it is out of date since the Soviet period. </p><p>  On days when there are a lot of visitors, there are not enough lockers to leave personal items.  There are also few changing cabins and showers.  Sometimes there are no towels and bathrobes, people complain.  In the women's room, there is only one hair dryer for drying hair, so you have to wait your turn.  In addition, the water is very chlorinated.  Such disinfection is immediately reflected by an allergy on delicate baby skin. </p><p>  Local residents often come to the pool, so there is much less room for people living in a hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Little critics </h2><p>  On the territory of the complex in winter they put a slide.  Even if there is little snow, children can have fun and actively relax on artificial ice rides.  There is also an ice rink.  Sometimes guests complain that children are not allowed in the above places.  Therefore, at a time when adults can just walk and enjoy the winter landscapes, children have nothing to do, parents say. </p><p>  It has its own children's room Park-Hotel Vozdvizhenskoe.  Reviews about the corner, however, are negative.  The hall is very small, there are few activities for tiny guests.  Therefore, the guys do not want to spend time there.  Many guests say that in other similar institutions, children's rooms are much more interesting and larger. </p><h2>  Additional entertainment </h2><p>  The administration offers a concert program for the holidays.  But people who often relax in neighboring Moscow Region establishments believe that the level of this pension is very low.  The show is absolutely uninteresting and simple.  Animators do not know how to work with small guests. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes management holds various contests and competitions.  Almost everyone speaks positively of such fun.  Among the prizes can be free skate rental, a subscription to the sauna and free access to barbecue facilities.  Of course, these gifts are popular with the public.  Preparation for the relay races, which the Vozdvizhenskoye complex (park hotel) conducts, also pleases vacationers. </p><p>  However, some guests say that sometimes surprises are very simple and cheap.  Especially mean gifts disappoint children. </p><h2>  Unpleasant moments </h2><p>  In the rooms, almost everyone complains about it, it is cold in winter.  But, if you ask the workers for a heater, it will be installed without any problems and free of charge.  This is one of the pleasant moments that guests note. </p><p>  The rooms themselves are very small and poorly decorated.  No different from other park-hotel "Vozdvizhenskoe".  Serpukhov district is rich in various motels and pensions.  And most of the neighbors of this institution are much better, visitors say. </p><p>  Many have the impression that the hotel does not cope with a large number of tourists.  Often there is not enough food and appliances for everyone.  The staff does not have time to clean the rooms. </p><p>  There is also a low temperature in the corridors and the restaurant.  Therefore, families who have already visited this institution are advised to take a lot of warm clothes with them.  It is especially necessary to dress children.  Plus, in the summer, nets hang on the windows to protect the premises from insects. </p>
