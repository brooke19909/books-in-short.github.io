Beautiful scarves, magnificent collars, warm sweaters and other accessories will not leave indifferent even the most demanding fashionistas. </p><p>  Thanks to patterns and combinations of different types of yarn, you can change the texture, add delicacy to the product, create unique things.  The implementation of the Norwegian gum with knitting needles makes the canvas elastic, soft and luxuriant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Norwegian rubber mitts" class="if uuid-2591498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2591498.jpg"></div><h2>  Application </h2><p>  The pattern is not recommended as a border for the edges of the product, as the Norwegian elastic is prone to deformation.  Thanks to the combination of the front and back loops, a beautiful relief ornament is created that tightens the knitting.  The technique has become popular in other versions as well; now knit scarves and collars, beautiful dresses and stylish winter skirts with Norwegian rubber, create interior design elements, for example, beautiful rugs, etc. </p><p>  There are many options for use, but the main plus is that the gum goes well with other patterns, complements them.  You can combine openwork knitting with a dense pattern or enlarge the technique by doubling the loops. </p><p>  In terms of implementation, the technique is simple and even a beginner needlewoman can cope with it.  The main thing is the desire to learn, the availability of materials and a detailed scheme. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classic technique </h2><p>  To complete the Norwegian gum with knitting needles of medium thickness yarn, knitting needles (you can use circular or regular).  The work process consists of alternating links and repeating rows.  Norwegian elastic on circular knitting needles are performed exactly the same as on regular ones.  The only difference is the tension of the threads and the ability to create large-sized products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.tincanknits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern norwegian gum" class="if uuid-2591492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2591492.jpg"></div><ul><li>  On the knitting needles an even number of loops.  Two edge links are also added for the beginning and end of the row.  Since the elastic pulls together the threads, without the design loops, the web will curl inward. </li><li>  The first row is performed by alternating the back and front elements.  In the process of knitting, it is necessary to monitor the tension of the thread.  You need to start the line with the edge loop, which is not knit, but simply removed.  Then follows the wrong side, followed by the front.  End the purl row. </li><li>  The second row is performed according to the scheme: the edge loop is removed, then the wrong loop, then the front, but!  For the front, the needle is not threaded into the loop on the spoke, but into the one underneath.  Then again the wrong side and the face in the loop next below.  End the wrong side. </li><li>  The following lines are a repetition of the previous ones. </li></ul><p>  A feature of the technique and its difference from other types of gum is knitting the links under a whole loop from the previous row, and not behind a separate thread wall.  A Norwegian knitting gum with knitting needles is ideal for creating hats, warm scarves and voluminous clothing.  You can visually increase the loop by mixing different colors.  This add a ready-made thing to splendor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Option for snud </h2><p>  A clamp made in this technique will be not only warm, but also voluminous.  For a standard length of two turns around the neck, 60 loops and 2 additional edge loops are dialed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weareknitters.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scarf with norwegian elastic" class="if uuid-2591387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2591387.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The main row is performed by alternating three facial and three purl loops.  This will create bulk.  You can knit Norwegian elastic with knitting needles through two loops, but then the edges of the pattern will not be so noticeable. </li><li>  The second line begins with three wrong links and three facial ones.  The process consists of repeating the elements that are performed under the loop, and not behind the walls of the threads, as in ordinary English gum. </li><li>  The following rows are a repetition of the previous two. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.allfreeknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The product is made in a lush Norwegian gum" class="if uuid-2585873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2585873.jpg"></div><p>  When the product reaches the desired length, it is necessary to close the loops of the last row and with the help of a hook connect the edges of the canvas from the wrong side.  After that, you can turn out the snood. </p><h2>  Motif blanket </h2><p>  In addition to creating things and accessories, you can use Norwegian elastic with knitting needles and to create decorative elements.  A soft plaid of multi-colored motifs made with knitting needles will look beautiful.  For work, you can use both acrylic yarn, which has sufficient strength, and threads with wool filling, then the thing will be soft and pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  Experienced craftsmen advise combining several shades from one gamut to make the product bright.  The size of the motive will depend on the parameters of the plaid itself.  To create a product of 1.5 x 2 meters, you will need a rectangle length of 15 cm and a width of 20. </p><p>  For the base, 26 loops are typed (here you can do without edge elements, since all motives will be sewn together). </p><p>  The first row is performed with the alternation of two front elements with a pair of purl.  The second line is knitted with offset loops in order to get a beautiful pattern.  You can fulfill the motives of only one type of pattern or combine several elements, which will give the product openwork and lightness. </p><h2>  Fluffy technique </h2><p>  Knitting with Norwegian elastic knitting needles is not limited to just one pattern.  You can find many options and combinations of elements, resulting in a voluminous and beautiful product. </p><p>  Magnificent knitting is used for comfortable autumn and winter things.  It is advisable to use wool or thick knitted yarn.  To create a scarf, you need to dial 30 loops plus one loop for symmetry (to finish the wrong side) and two additional links for the product border. </p><div class="photo" data-original="longlakeyarns.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="element of norwegian gum" class="if uuid-2591505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2591505.jpg"></div><p>  The first and second rows are performed in the alternation of the back and front elements of one link.  The following lines are sewn into punctures under the loops so that the arcs turn out to be voluminous. </p><p>  Further, the process consists of repeating two elements in a pair of rows.  The result is a beautiful fluffy knit with large even loops.  The finished product can be decorated with a fringe or tied with lush columns with a hook. </p><h2>  Knitwear Care </h2><p>  Since yarn can lose its strength and color saturation over time, care must be taken to carefully store the product.  It must not be washed in hot water using active cleaners.  For woolen clothes, special powders of soft action are bought. </p><p>  It is recommended to dry things in a horizontal position so that the edges do not stretch and the knitting itself does not deform.  It is forbidden to apply the iron to the products, as this may harm the pattern. </p><p>  So that things do not lose their appearance and color over time, you can rinse them after washing with water and vinegar or lemon juice.  If you properly care for knitted accessories and store them carefully, then a beautiful scarf made by yourself or a cape made with Norwegian elastic with knitting needles in a circle will please you for more than one year. </p>
