In addition to inspiration, the master must follow strictly defined rules with which they appear: contrast, placement, balance, the rule of observing third and many others.  But the rule of the golden section is still recognized as priority, it is the rule of thirds. </p><p>  <strong>Just about complicated</strong> </p><p>  If, in a simplified form, the basis of the <span>golden ratio</span> rule is presented <span>,</span> then in fact it is the division of the reproduced moment into nine equal parts (three vertically by three horizontally).  For the first time, it was specially introduced by Leonardo da Vinci, building all his compositions in this peculiar grid.  It was he who practically confirmed that the key elements of the image should be concentrated at the intersection points of the vertical and horizontal lines. </p><p>  The <span>golden ratio</span> rule in photography is subject to some correction.  In addition to the nine-segment grid, it is recommended to use the so-called triangles.  The principle of their construction is based on the rule of thirds.  To do this, a diagonal is drawn from the extreme upper point to the lower, and from the opposite upper point, a ray dividing the already existing diagonal at one of the internal intersection points of the grid.  The key <span>element of the composition</span> should be displayed on average in size from the resulting triangles.  Here it is worth making a remark: the above diagram of the construction of triangles reflects only their principle, and, therefore, it makes sense to experiment with the given instruction. </p><p>  <strong>How to use a grid and triangles?</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>golden ratio</span> rule <span>in photography</span> is subject to certain standards depending on what is displayed on it. </p><p>  Horizon factor.  According to the rule of thirds, it should be arranged in horizontal lines.  Moreover, if the imprinted object is above the horizon, then the factor passes through the bottom line, and vice versa. </p><p>  Location of the main facility.  A classical arrangement is one in which the central element is located at one of the intersection points.  If the photographer selects two objects, then they should be diagonally or at parallel points. </p><p>  The use of triangles.  The golden ratio rule in this case departs from the canons, but only slightly.  The object does not have to be located at the intersection point, but is located as close to it as possible in the middle triangle. </p><p>  Direction.  This principle of shooting is used in dynamic photography and consists in the fact that two thirds of the image space should remain in front of a movable object.  This will provide the effect of moving forward and indicating the target.  Otherwise, the photo may not be understood. </p><p>  <strong>Golden Ratio Adjustment</strong> </p><p>  Despite the fact that the rule of thirds in the existing theory of composition is considered classic, more and more photographers tend to abandon it.  Their motivation is simple: <span>analysis of paintings by</span> famous artists shows that the golden ratio rule is not maintained.  One can argue with this statement. </p><p>  Consider the well-known Gioconda, which opponents of the rule of thirds use as an example (forgetting that da Vinci himself was at the forefront of its practical use).  Their arguments are that the master did not consider it necessary to arrange the key elements of the picture at the intersection points, as required by the classical image.  But they overlook the factor of horizontal lines, according to which the head and torso of the image are arranged in such a way that the silhouette as a whole does not "hurt the eye."  In addition, the spiral is used to a greater extent in this work, which in most cases is forgotten by theorists of photography.  And so it is possible to refute the statements regarding almost every creation cited as an example. </p><p>  The golden ratio rule can be used, or you can refuse it if you want to emphasize the disharmony of the composition.  However, to say that it is not key in the formation of an art object is impossible. </p>
