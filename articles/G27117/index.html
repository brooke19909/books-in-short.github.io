There are a lot of them, the number is in the billions.  Their role in nature and human life is different, the assessment varies from positive through neutral to negative.  Consider what bacteria representatives have learned to live in close contact with human organisms, and what significance they have. </p><h2>  Bacteria - Living Organisms </h2><p>  These oldest inhabitants on our planet are unicellular organisms of microscopic sizes.  It is known that the approximate time of their appearance is 3.5 billion years ago.  For a long time, there were no other living creatures on Earth except them.  Only then did the rapid process of evolution begin, and life began to flourish in all its diversity. </p>

    <p>  Humanity learned a lot of interesting things about bacteria only in the 17th century, thanks to the works of Antonio Van Levenguk.  It was this naturalist who first invented the <span>magnifying device</span> through which these tiny creatures could be seen. </p><p>  Over time, a great deal of theoretical material has been accumulated, confirmed by practical research.  Information has become available to people about how microbes look, what structure they have, and the significance of bacteria in human life has been determined. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Structural features </h2><p>  So, it became clear that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms, that is, they do not contain a formed nucleus in their cells.  In addition, they are characterized by a number of the following features in the phenotype and internal structure: </p><ol><li>  The body shape can be different: spherical (cocci), rod-shaped (bacilli), in the form of a bunch of grapes (staphylococci), vibrios, spirillas and others. </li><li>  They can exist singly, but often whole colonies are created. </li><li>  Colors in most cases do not have, but some forms can be beautiful purple or green.  Colonies are most often stained due to the release of special pigments into the surrounding space. </li><li>  The genetic material inside the cell is represented by a DNA molecule that is distributed at the center of the structure. </li><li>  The movement in space is carried out by flagella, gas vacuoles or a mucus capsule covering the body. </li><li>  Outside, the body is covered with a cell wall and a capsule, under which all the organelles of the cell are located. </li><li>  The structural parts of the cell are similar to those found in animals, plant structures.  Special are carbohydrate or lipid droplets of inclusions that perform an energy function. </li><li>  Instead of a nucleus, a nucleoid consisting of a DNA strand is present in the cell. </li></ol><p>  In fact, living bacteria have a rather interesting structure.  The lifestyle of these microorganisms also aroused burning curiosity of scientists around the world.  Thanks to their labors, mankind gained access to new information, which is undoubtedly of great importance for science as a whole and its individual branches.  The scope of our article does not allow us to discuss all these points in more detail.  Therefore, we will focus only on the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthese organisms and pay special attention to their role and significance in our lives. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bacteria lifestyle </h2><p>  Thanks to the incredible unpretentiousness to the living conditions, the bacteria were able to spread around the globe.  For them, neither cold, nor too high temperatures, nor acidity or basicity, soil salinity are barriers.  Bacteria, photos of which can be found in the article, populate: </p><ul><li>  water </li><li>  air; </li><li>  soil; </li><li>  hot thermal springs; </li><li>  Deserts </li><li>  snow and ice; </li><li>  oxygen free habitats. </li></ul><p>  Obviously, the spread of these creatures is widespread.  It is difficult to find at least one object in any environment on which bacteria would not meet.  Even the purest spring water contains enough of them. </p>

    <p>  The life of bacteria is reduced to the fundamental processes: nutrition, reproduction, movement in search of food, experiencing adverse conditions.  Like all unicellular, they have no other purpose of existence. </p><p>  By the method of nutrition, that is, energy absorption, they are all divided into: </p><ul><li>  autotrophs; </li><li>  heterotrophs. </li></ul><p>  The first group includes different bacteria.  Photo can be seen below.  In general, such groups can be distinguished among them. </p><ol><li>  Photosynthetic - they themselves accumulate the energy of the sun during photosynthesis. </li><li>  Chemosynthetics - oxidize inorganic compounds (sulfur, nitrogen, iron) and process them into organics. </li><li>  Methane, or methylotrophs - use the energy of oxidation of carbon-containing substances to ensure vital activity. </li></ol><p>  Heterotrophic species consume prepared organic matter.  To obtain them, microorganisms use different methods.  So, three groups of heterotroph bacteria can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  saprophytes - decompose the dead remains of plants and animals; </li><li>  symbionts - enter into mutually beneficial cohabitation with the owner; </li><li>  parasites are harmful and destructive to the health of the host form. </li></ul><p>  Also, the vital activity of bacteria has another feature - spore formation.  In a period of extremely unfavorable conditions, the cell is able to stop inside itself all the processes of life and as if fall asleep, covered with a dense shell.  This condition is called a spore.  So the body can live for decades, while waiting for suitable environmental conditions.  Spores are extremely resistant to freezing and heat treatment even of long duration. </p>

    <h2>  Value for man </h2><p>  The fact that the organisms in question are our constant companions throughout life was not immediately clear.  A major role in establishing this fact was played by I.I. Mechnikov.  It was he who conducted a series of numerous studies proving the enormous importance of bacteria in human life. </p><p>  It turns out that our skin, the <span>mucous membranes of the</span> nose and mouth, the inside of the gastrointestinal tract, and the organs of the small pelvis are all densely populated by various forms of microorganisms.  They help us fight infections, digest food, cleanse ourselves from the inside out.  In return, they themselves receive good living conditions and food.  That is, living bacteria inside a person live in close symbiosis with him. </p><p>  If the natural state of the intestinal microflora, skin, stomach and other organs is disturbed, then people develop multiple diseases, often proceeding in a very serious form.  That is why probiotics were created by scientists, doctors and microbiologists.  These are strains of living bacteria of a certain type, which can serve to replenish and restore the body's natural microflora. </p>

    <p>  This value of prokaryotes is not limited.  Man uses them in agriculture, food industry, space industry, science and technology, biosynthesis and molecular biology, and many other fields. </p><h2>  Live bacteria for the intestines: name </h2><p>  If we talk about the specific types of these microorganisms that inhabit a person from the inside, then in the first place should be designated the most "rich" place - the intestines.  It is this organ, consisting of several departments and reaching a length (in an adult) of up to 12 m, is an excellent home for a variety of representatives of prokaryotes. </p><p>  There are two main genera, consisting of several families and many species and strains that do not just inhabit the said organ, but are vital for each person.  These are living bacteria for the intestine, the name of the genus is pronounced in Russian as lactobacillus and bifidobactrium. </p><p>  Each of these species plays an important role in the metabolic processes of the intestine.  Therefore, we consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  Lactobacillus bacteria: characteristics and significance </h2><p>  Living bacteria for the intestine, the name of the genus sounds like lactobacillus, are the natural inhabitants of the intestinal microflora, provided it is in a normal state.  They have a positive effect on the general condition of this body, as: </p><ul><li>  activate the work of many important enzymes and proteins involved in immune processes; </li><li>  act as antagonists to pathogenic microbes, saving the body from intoxication; </li><li>  accelerate the healing (regenerative) processes in the mucous membranes and so on. </li></ul><p>  It is these bacteria that are used in the production of dairy products.  That is, their strains are part of the starter cultures of various types, from which are made: </p><ul><li>  live yogurts; </li><li>  kefir; </li><li>  yogurt; </li><li>  cocktails and other products. </li></ul><p>  There are a lot of species of this kind of prokaryotes.
