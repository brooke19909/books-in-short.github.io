  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a vortex electric field?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the questions that can often be found in the vastness of the global web is how the vortex electric field differs from the electrostatic one.  In fact, the differences are dramatic.  In electrostatics, the interaction of two (or more) charges is considered and, importantly, the lines of intensity of such fields are not closed.  But the vortex electric field obeys completely different laws.  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><p>  One of the most common devices that almost every person encounters is a meter for accounting for consumed electrical energy.  Only not modern electronic models, but "old" ones, which use an aluminum rotating disk.  It is ‚Äúinduced‚Äù by the induction of the electric field.  As you know, in any conductor of large volume and mass (not a wire) that penetrates a changing magnetic flux, in accordance with <span>the Faraday law,</span> an electromotive force and an electric current, called eddy, arise.  Note that in this case it does not matter at all whether the magnetic field changes or the conductor itself moves in it.  In accordance with the law of electromagnetic induction, vortex-shaped closed circuits are created in the mass of the conductor, along which currents circulate.  Their orientation can be determined using the Lenz rule.  It states that the <span>magnetic field of the</span> current is directed so as to compensate for any change (both decrease and increase) in the initiating external magnetic flux.  The counter disk rotates precisely due to the interaction of an external magnetic field and generated by the currents arising in it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How is the vortex electric field connected with all of the above?  In fact, there is a connection.  It's all in terms.  Any change in the magnetic field creates a vortex electric field.  Further, everything is simple: an <span>EMF (electromotive force) is</span> generated in the conductor and a current arises in the circuit.  Its value depends on the rate of change of the main stream: for example, the faster the conductor crosses the field strength lines, the greater the current.  The peculiarity of this field is that its tension lines have neither a beginning nor an end.  Sometimes its configuration is compared with a solenoid (cylinder with turns of wire on its surface).  Another schematic representation for explanation uses the vector of <span>magnetic induction.</span>  Around each of them, lines <span>of electric field strength</span> are created <span>,</span> really, resembling vortices.  Important feature: the last example is true if the magnetic flux intensity changes.  If you ‚Äúlook‚Äù along the induction vector, then with increasing flow the vortex field lines rotate clockwise. </p><p>  The induction property is widely used in modern electrical engineering: these are measuring instruments, and <span>alternating current motors,</span> and in electron accelerators. </p><p>  We list the main <span>properties of the electric field</span> : </p><ul><li>  this type of field is inextricably linked with charge carriers; </li><li>  the force acting on the charge carrier is created by the field; </li><li>  the field weakens with distance from the carrier; </li><li>  characterized by lines of force (or, which is also true, lines of tension).  They are directed, therefore, they are a vector quantity. </li></ul><p>  To study the properties of the field at each arbitrary point, a test (test) charge is used.  At the same time, they strive to select a ‚Äúprobe‚Äù so that its introduction into the system does not affect the acting forces.  This is usually a reference charge. </p><p>  Note that the Lenz rule makes it possible to calculate only the electromotive force, but the value of the field vector and its direction are determined by another method.  This is a system of Maxwell equations. </p>
