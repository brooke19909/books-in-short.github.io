    <h2>  Everything is subject to evolution, even musical instruments </h2><p>  Once upon a time, playing the harpsichord, one of the first home keyboards, was available only to the children of either very wealthy parents or very talented.  Teaching a child music and now requires a certain financial investment from the family, perseverance and perseverance.  Through a peculiar evolution in the invention and improvement of musical instruments, the harpsichord was transformed into a piano.  The piano has been used as a home version of the piano for many years for teaching in music schools and at home.  In modern conditions, for the initial familiarization of children with music, a synthesizer for beginners is increasingly being acquired. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="synthesizer for beginners" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/373353.jpg?1397397105749" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps some people see only the external differences between these two categories of keyboard instruments.  Although the differences are much greater than the general qualities. </p><p>  1. A synthesizer is much lighter and more compact than a piano and, especially, a piano. </p><p>  2. Some models have fewer octaves than classic instruments. </p><p>  3. It is much easier to place a beginner synthesizer in the room than a bulky acoustic instrument. </p><p>  4. The electronic musical "teacher" can work both from a stationary electric network, and on batteries. </p><p>  5. A piano cannot be placed on a table or on a person’s lap (weight over 250 kg). </p><p>  6. You need to tune the piano at least once a year.  The synthesizer is tuned once - upon purchase. </p><p>  7. Acoustic <span>keyboards</span> make quite loud sounds.  The sound power of the synthesizers is adjusted in accordance with the selected mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  8. A child can independently acquire initial communication skills with musical sounds using an inexpensive synthesizer with software for gaming. </p><p>  9. The mechanics of pressing the synthesizer keys are identical to the same process in the piano. </p><p>  10. A melody played on a power tool can be recorded and arranged immediately. </p><p>  11. A professional instrument or synthesizer for beginners has built-in speakers in the case to change the <span>sound volume.</span> </p><p>  12. More than 90 different types of arpeggiation (sound effects with passages) are recorded in the instrument's memory. </p><p>  13. The possibility of additional SD-memory and USB-memory increases the ability of music electronics. </p><h2>  About some of the useful features of music digital electronics </h2>

    <p>  A musical synthesizer for children and adults in the memory of its training program contains more than 100 tunes in various styles.  Each lesson is divided into several consecutive classes, which greatly helps learning.  In addition, the instrument itself “tells” whether the desired rhythm of the melody is respected, whether the child presses the keys correctly, with those fingers (the so-called “finger” is practiced).  In case of an error, a certain sharp signal sounds and a hint follows on how to correct the situation.  At the end of the lesson, the instrument can even “praise” the child by setting the appropriate score, up to loud and positive </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="price synthesizer" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/373351.jpg?1397397694206" width="600"></div>  applause.

    <h2>  Karaoke, synthesizer and TV </h2><p>  The synthesizer for beginners has the functions of special sound effects.  Support for the game is provided by the accompaniment of a professional orchestra or instrumental ensemble.  Any recorded melody can be reproduced by the sound of a guitar, flute, saxophone, piano with simultaneous accompaniment of a bass part, drums or accordion. </p><p>  Today on the market of musical instruments there are many brands of synthesizers - for example, <span>Casio.</span>  <span>The synthesizer,</span> among other things, will help to arrange a home evening of music.  Voice and pre-recorded accompaniment will sound in the speakers.  When you connect this music system to the TV, lyrics can be read from the screen. </p><h2>  How to develop instrumental playing skills? </h2><p>  Modern educational synthesizers (prices from 4,000 rubles) contain melodies stored in memory, divided into short, light musical phrases.  The child acquires the skills of independent play by completing gradually increasing tasks.  In addition, in the automatic mode, the instrument assesses the student’s readiness to switch to the level of tasks of a different complexity.  A synthesizer for a 5-year-old child contains in his song bank a record of a large number of special exercises that develop finger fluency.  For playing the keyboard, this skill is of great importance. </p><h2>  Opportunities for Little Composers </h2><p>  A child learns to relate easily and joyfully to creativity, creating music, and a synthesizer for beginners is an excellent assistant in this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="musical synthesizer for children" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/373352.jpg?1397397542750" width="332"></div>  What can a training synthesizer do?

    <p>  - Simulate music of various styles: jazz, rock, blues, pop, classical.  Thanks to the regulation of percussion, the line of harmonics and clicks, sound special effects, Leslie will perfectly sound any melodies performed on a classic electric organ.  Sounds are regulated directly during the game and are recorded in memory. </p><p>  - The signal digital processor diversifies and enriches the sound with tones.  More than 232 different programs change, process and store sounds in the instrument's memory.  In addition, it is possible to edit any saved record. </p><p>  - The multi-track sequencer function allows you to play and record parts of different musical instruments (bass, solo, winds, strings, drums), and then combine all this into a single composition.  The music created in this way can be listened to on a computer, posted on the Internet. </p><p>  - The step-by-step recording and editing functions allow you to record complex passages and replace a fake chord or note if necessary.  The volume of each individual sound is changed using this function. </p><p>  - A virtual 16-channel mixer that controls the sound volume of each instrument in a music recording, makes it possible to choose the best version of the sound of the instruments in each particular <span>piece of music.</span> </p><h2>  Some tips for choosing a synthesizer </h2><p>  Teaching children, synthesizers, prices - everything matters for </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="casio synthesizer" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/373350.jpg?1397397895263" width="500"></div>  parents.

    <p>  In order to buy the best instrument that helps the child in acquiring musical knowledge and skills, you should know that the number of keys on the synthesizer should be 88. That is how many keys on the piano keyboard.  It is also necessary to take into account the age of the child, since it will be difficult for a child to master a professional instrument, and for an older one it will be boring to play a synthesizer for kids. </p><p>  Sales consultants at a music store will always help you make the best choice.  If you can consult with professional tuners or educators, then you need to do this in the interests of your child.
