Administratively, this territory belongs to the Sverdlovsk region.  The reservoir was built on the Chusovaya River.  Used for household needs of the city of Yekaterinburg.  On its banks is the village of Verkhnemakarovo.  It was she who gave the name to the reservoir.  They began to fill it back in the 70s.  However, the work on cleaning the territory was not carried out in full.  This led to the fact that a lot of debris is found at the bottom of the reservoir.  Near it there are many summer cottages, there is a farm, a fish hatchery and a sawmill. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, at present, the SES has banned swimming in this reservoir.  The state of water did not affect the underwater animal world.  There are still a lot of fish, so the Verkhnemakarovskoe reservoir is popular among fishermen. </p><h2>  Short description of the reservoir </h2><p>  This reservoir has existed for over 45 years.  It was built as a backup source.  Unfortunately, at present, the city‚Äôs needs for water supply have increased significantly, so there is a constant decrease in water levels.  From the center of the reservoir to Yekaterinburg, the distance is more than 25 km.  However, its lower part is located on the border with the Chkalovsky district.  Several small rivers and streams flow into the reservoir.  Only <span>the Chusovaya River</span> flows out <span>.</span>  The dam is located 3 km higher from the village of Verkhnemakarovo.  There are several recreation centers on the shore of the reservoir: Avtomobilist, Trubnik, and Kurganovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Characteristic </h2><p>  Verkhnemakarovskoe reservoir has an elongated shape.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãhis mirror is more than 17 square meters.  km  Currently, the pond is more like a river.  Near the shore, a depth of 3-5 m, the maximum is considered no more than 11 m. The reservoir itself is located at an altitude of 317 m above sea level.  The bottom near the coastline is sandy, closer to the center - silty.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Kurganovo, you can see many islands.  They were mainly formed due to lower <span>water levels.</span>  There are both low and high sections along the coastline.  Hilly terrain prevails here.  However, there are mountain formations with a height of about 400 m. Boggy areas also appear. </p>

    <p>  Closer to the settlements near the coast there are fields that are irrigated at the expense of the reservoir.  A mixed forest grows on the banks.  There are also sites with pine forest.  They were chosen by tourists to relax with tents.  The advantage of this area is a small concentration of people.  The coastline is indented, there are many bays that are overgrown with sedge and reeds.  Flowering of water begins in the month of August. </p><h2>  Verkhnemakarovskoe reservoir - how to get there? </h2><p>  Many travelers are interested in the question: how to get to the reservoir?  It goes to public transport.  A regular bus travels from the city of Yekaterinburg.  The final stop is the village of Kurganovo.  From it you will need to walk to the reservoir.  This distance is about 1 km.  However, you need to be prepared for the fact that on a country road there are wetlands.  But there are transitions through which you can go through these areas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Those who travel by car must leave Yekaterinburg in the direction of Polevsky.  Near the village  Kurganovo driver will see the bridge.  If you cross through it, you can turn into the city of Degtyarsk.  Before entering the city (the village of Vyazovaya) there will be a turn to the right, it is he who leads to the reservoir itself.  If you follow this route, you can go to the dam. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Verkhnemakarovskoe reservoir, a photo of which can be seen in the article, is popular among fishermen.  Access to the reservoir is free.  There are a lot of fish, such as bream, carp, burbot, pike and others.  You can fish both from the shore and from the boat.  If you swim to the middle of the reservoir, then the catch will consist of larger individuals.  For example, in order to catch a bream, you need to pre-feed the place.  The depth should be at least 4 m. For bait, you can use semolina or barley.  The best bite in the morning: from 4:00 to 10:00.  You can catch perch all day.  He pecks at a worm or bloodworm.  The specimens are not very large, but in a few hours you can catch about 30-40 pieces. </p>

    <p>  It is recommended to go to a pike in a boat with a motor.  You can use spinning with bright bait.  Due to the fact that there are a lot of snags at the bottom of the reservoir, pike will not take long to wait.  Large enough individuals are found.  Despite some shortcomings, the Verkhnemakarovskoye reservoir (most of the positive reviews of fishermen about it) is ideal for a wild vacation.  On its territory you can make bonfires, so many vacationers cook their own fish on an open fire. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Kurganovo" </h2><p>  In the village of Kurganovo there is an excellent <span>recreation center.</span>  Here you can spend time both as a family and in company with friends.  There are tents and gazebos on the territory where they organize wedding parties, receptions and other events.  On sunny days, vacationers go to the reservoir for a swim.

For accommodation, rooms are equipped in accordance with European standards.  They are located in several buildings. </p>

The recreation center provides banquet facilities for celebrations.  It can be weddings or corporate parties. </p><h2>  Responses about the reservoir </h2><p>  Currently, reviews of the reservoir are disappointing.  Many vacationers have noticed that the water level has decreased significantly.  If you look from a distance at the Verkhnyakomarovskoe reservoir, then the water appears blue, however, you can see nearby that it changes color to black.  All this is associated with significant pollution.  That is why the SES recently forbids swimming in this reservoir.  But the feedback from the fishermen, on the contrary, is positive.  They still admire their catches. </p>
