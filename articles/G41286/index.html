Quite often, the irrational use of money in the family provokes scandals.  Some cells in society are falling apart due to financial problems.  Therefore, today we will study the structure of the family budget.  We have to study the basics of family <span>finance planning</span> .  In addition, we consider a few secrets of saving in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bif.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Proper use of money in the family" class="if uuid-2486627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486627.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  <span>What is a family budget?</span>  The structure of this important component of the life of the cell of society is complex and multi-component.  And not everyone understands how to conduct home accounting.  But then we will study the relevant issues. </p><p>  The family budget is home finance.  Money that comes into the family from different sources.  They must be rationally distributed.  After all, only then can the cell of society live normally and even save money for some needs. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The structure of the family budget, as we have said, is diverse.  It includes many items.  To begin, consider the largest sections. </p><p>  Among them are income and expenses.  It is this balance that must be observed in every cell of society.  Then you will be able to live within your means and even make major purchases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, each major section of the budget is divided.  Structuring can be completely different, at the discretion of the one who plans the expenses in the family.  Next, we study the most common items of expenses and income. </p><h2>  Home Accounting Features </h2><p>  But first, find out why it is specifically necessary to maintain a family budget.  What does he allow to do? </p><div class="photo" data-original="anti-rock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family budget items" class="if uuid-2486624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486624.jpg"></div><p>  Doing home bookkeeping is a time-consuming process, especially at first.  At the moment, the functions of the family budget may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  saving money; </li><li>  creation of savings; </li><li>  rational spending training; </li><li>  family living for available money; </li><li>  elimination of the need to obtain loans for certain needs. </li></ul><p>  In any case, if the family does not have a budget, sooner or later problems may arise in the cell of society.  For example, due to loans or unreasonable expenses. </p><h2>  Family Budget Types </h2><p>  Some people ask - "Tell us about the structure of the family budget."  Typically, women ask for such requests - they have to plan their purchases all the time and not allow spontaneous expenses.  Especially with severe limited funds. </p><p>  The family budget is different.  At the moment, we can distinguish these forms of finance in the family: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  joint; </li><li>  separate; </li><li>  mixed. </li></ul><p>  All these types have their own characteristics.  Depending on the chosen methodology of monetary ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù, the structure of incomes and expenses of the family budget will change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toolformoney.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family Budget Program" class="if uuid-2486625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486625.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a joint budget </h2><p>  The most common and easiest option for the development of events is a joint budget.  In this case, the income structure of the family budget will include all the finances received by the family.  Both from the husband and from the wife. </p><p>  In other words, with a joint budget, the income of all family members will be added up.  Further, the funds received are distributed for general needs.  We will talk about the classification of expenses later. </p><p>  A shared budget implies that everything in the family is common.  This situation helps maintain family relationships.  Especially if the woman went on maternity leave. </p><h2>  What is split budget? </h2><p>  What is the structure of the family budget?  She, as we have said, can be different.  You can find a separate budget in the cells of society. </p><p>  This is the least acceptable scenario.  Often it is taken as a ‚Äúlast resort‚Äù in fostering financial literacy for spouses. </p><p>  With a separate budget, the structure of income and expenses for each family member will be separate.  A husband‚Äôs salary is his money.  They go only to his needs.  Earning a spouse - her funds that she can spend on her needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Such a model of financial behavior is disastrous.  It is not suitable for families with children.  After all, then one of the family members will be left without income.  Plus, there will be common children who will have to be supported. </p><h2>  What is a mixed budget? </h2><p>  What is the structure of the family budget?  In the mixed type of financial management, husband and wife distribute their income in a slightly different way than in the cases listed above. </p><p>  With a mixed budget, the couple usually invests in the common fund in equal shares or in proportion to earnings.  First, common family needs are formed.  They are allocated funds from each spouse.  Leftovers can be spent on your desires. </p><p>  The expenditure item ‚Äúchildren‚Äù usually also implies mutual investments from the spouses.  But in real life, more and more often children are supported by working women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yourmoneyrelationship.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Costs and revenues - how to keep a family budget" class="if uuid-2486628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486628.jpg"></div><h2>  What incomes consist of </h2><p>  Now let us consider in more detail what is the structure of the income of the family budget.  This is an extremely important point.  Let us examine the issue using the example of a joint budget in the cell of society. </p><p>  In the column "income" you can write: </p><ul><li>  earnings; </li><li>  scholarships; </li><li>  Prizes </li><li>  gifts; </li><li>  cash compensation; </li><li>  awards; </li><li>  kalym; </li><li>  social benefits; </li><li>  help from friends / relatives. </li></ul><p>  In other words, any material income.  It is advisable to divide them into regular (like wages) and irregular.  It is better to rely on constant sources of income when planning finances. </p><h2>  <span>Classification of expenses</span> by importance </h2><p>  The structure of family budget expenditures is even more complex than income.  Here, each cell of society independently determines the articles of its needs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family expenses" class="if uuid-2486626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486626.jpg"></div><p>  You can carry out a certain classification of all expenses in the family.  For example, by importance.  At the moment, it is customary to distinguish: </p><ol><li>  Important / required expenses.  These are all necessary expenses.  These include food, rent, expenses for the "communal", loan payments, household and family items.  The costs of medicine, clothing and shoes are also included here.  This article should ideally not exceed 50% of all family income. </li><li>  Desirable.  This is all that you want to buy, but without which in austerity mode you can do.  For example, a new phone, cosmetics, hobby and entertainment expenses, cafes, books, sections. </li><li>  Luxurious.  It is customary to make major purchases here.  Typically, such expenses correspond to high earnings or large family needs.  For example, appliances and gadgets of the latest models, cars, apartments, villas and so on. </li></ol><h2>  Classification by frequency </h2><p>  The structure of the family budget in terms of spending can be divided by frequency. </p><p>  Here are the sections that are most common: </p><ol><li>  Monthly.  This is a waste that you cannot live without.  For example - pocket expenses, mugs, gardens, sections, payment of housing, purchase of groceries. </li><li>  Annual.  This includes taxes, vacation, payment of insurance. </li><li>  Seasonal  These are expenses that occur only at a certain point in time.  For example, large purchases for the winter, preparing children for school and so on. </li><li>  Variables  A very ambiguous category.  It includes all inconsistent expenses.  Paying for medicine, medicine, clothes, shoes and buying household appliances, for example.  Everything that money is spent on is a real need. </li></ol><h2>  Size classification </h2><p>  We almost studied the structure of incomes and expenses of the family budget.  You can classify spending by size. </p><p>  Namely: </p><ol><li>  Minor expenses.  These are products, travel by transport, purchase of newspapers and magazines, household expenses. </li><li>  Average expenses.  These include clothing, entertainment, small equipment and so on. </li><li>  Large purchases.  Furniture, vacation, repair, large equipment. </li></ol><p>  To save, it is recommended to reduce large and medium costs.  But do not forget about the small ones.  It is possible that among them there are optional expenses. </p><h2>  How to do home bookkeeping </h2><p>  We studied the structure and types of the family budget.  And how to keep accounting now? </p><div class="photo" data-original="myrouble.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Accounting Software" class="if uuid-2486630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486630.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to follow these principles: </p><ol><li>  Record in a special table all sources of profit.  In the end, calculate the total amount. </li><li>  Record all required and current expenses in the same plate.  It is advisable to keep checks from stores. </li><li>  Add up all monthly expenses in each category. </li><li>  Compare spending and income to the family budget. </li></ol><p>  Today you can find a lot of programs and applications for maintaining a family budget.  Some simply compose a polysyllabic table in Word or write notes in special notebooks. </p><h2>  How to save </h2><p>  A few words about how to save.  Reasonable savings will help save money and not live to the detriment of yourself. </p><p>  Here are the principles every home accountant should be aware of: </p><ol><li>  Record each purchased product in the book of expenses and income.  This will help analyze spending and eliminate optional and spontaneous purchases. </li><li>  In strong saving mode, go to the store only with a list of products.  Do not deviate from it. </li><li>  To purchase long-term storage products (pasta, cereals, "freezing") at wholesale bases. </li><li>  Try to buy products and things at sales.  This applies even to children's things.  Children's stores constantly arrange profitable sales. </li><li>  Refuse loans, installments and credit cards. </li><li>  Do not borrow.  It is advisable not to lend money to anyone.  This can be done only when the family is ready to "release" the borrowed funds. </li><li>  Set aside 10-15% from each source of income.  From these funds, the so-called NC will be formed.  So it is called an <span>emergency stock.</span>  It is used in case of emergency.  For example, for treatment or life in case of reduction at work. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  In fact, doing home bookkeeping over time becomes a fairly simple affair.  The main thing is to correctly analyze your purchases and be able to refuse excesses. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The structure of the family budget was presented to your attention.  Now it‚Äôs clear how you can save and distribute cash. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mycity-web.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Family and money" class="if uuid-2486629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2486629.jpg"></div><p>  At first, home accounting scares and delivers a lot of trouble.  But over time, a home accountant will be able to easily distribute money in the family.  Especially when it comes to a joint budget. </p><p>  Important: even with a sharp increase in income, do not abandon the previously developed principles of maintaining home finances. </p>
