The consequences of war for the country</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As you know, fascist Germany during the Second World War had 2 main allies, who voluntarily helped Hitler and had their own political and economic goals.  Like Germany, Italy suffered enormous human and material losses in World War II. </p><h2>  Benito Mussolini's policy that led Italy to war </h2><p>  The development of Italy and Germany of the 30s had a lot in common.  Both states became economically strong, but all sorts of protest movements were suppressed and a totalitarian regime was established.  The ideologist of Italian fascism was the Prime Minister of the state, Benito Mussolini.  This man had monarchical manners, but it cannot be said that he, like Hitler, was preparing for war.  By the <span>beginning of World War II,</span> his country was not economically and politically prepared.  The main goal of <span>Benito Mussolini</span> is the creation of an economically strong totalitarian regime. </p>

    <p>  What did Mussolini achieve before 1939?  Note a few points: </p><p>  - the <span>fight against unemployment</span> through the implementation of the system of public work; </p><p>  - expansion of the public transport system, which improved communication between cities and the country as a whole; </p><p>  - The growth of the Italian economy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the shortcomings of the Mussolini regime was its expansionist orientation.  This will lead to grave consequences for the country by 1943. </p><h2>  Italy in World War II: the initial stage </h2><p>  This country started fighting quite late.  Italy in World War II began to take part in June 1940.  The main factor that did not allow entering the war earlier was the absolute unpreparedness of the army and the economy for active hostilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy after the second world war" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29179/817775.jpg" width="344"></div>

    <p>  Mussolini's first active action was the declaration of war on Great Britain and France.  Italy entered the war after the Wehrmacht troops occupied all of Scandinavia, many European countries and began fighting on French lands.  Analyzing the course of events, we can say that Italy entered the war under pressure from Germany.  Hitler traveled to Rome several times during 1939-1940 to demand the beginning of vigorous action on the part of Mussolini against common opponents. </p><p>  The Nazis never considered Italians to be serious partners.  Italy during the Second World War carried out any team from Berlin.  Throughout Italy‚Äôs participation in the war, its troops were randomly scattered on all fronts of hostilities, including in Africa.  If we talk about purely hostilities, the first act of the participation of the state of Italy in the Second World War was the bombing of Malta on June 11, 1940. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The actions of the Italian troops in August 1940 - January 1941 </h2><p>  According to the chronology of the military operations of Mussolini‚Äôs troops, we clearly see two areas of attack of the attacking side.  Let us analyze the main offensive operations of Italians: </p><p>  - The invasion of Egypt on September 13, 1940.  The troops moved from Libya, which had long been an Italian colony.  The goal is to seize the city of Alexandria. </p><p>  - In August 1940 there were attacks in the direction of Kenya and British Somalia from Ethiopia. </p><p>  - In October 1940, Italians attacked Greece from Albania.  It was in these battles that the troops met the first serious rebuff.  Full unpreparedness for the war and the weakness of the troops of Italy showed up. </p>

    <h2>  Italy: defeat </h2><p>  The fate of Italy in this war, in principle, was absolutely logical.  The economy could not bear the load, because there was a very strong military order, which the industry could not fulfill.  Reason: lack of raw materials and fuel base in the required quantity.  Italy during World War II, especially ordinary citizens, suffered greatly. </p><p>  It makes no sense to describe the military operations of 1941-1942.  The fights were held with varying success.  Mussolini's troops often suffered defeats.  In society, a protest heat gradually increased, which manifested itself in the intensification of the communist and socialist movements, in strengthening the role of trade union organizations. </p>

    <p>  In 1943, Italy was already quite weak and exhausted by hostilities.  It was no longer possible to confront the opponents, so the country's leaders (except Mussolini) decided to slowly withdraw the country from the war. </p><p>  In the summer of 1943, troops of the <span>anti-Hitler coalition</span> landed in Italy <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Italy after World War II </h2><p>  Consider the consequences of war for this country.  They can be divided into several groups: political, economic and social. </p><p>  The main political result was the fall of the Benito Mussolini regime and the return of the country to the democratic course of development.  This was the only positive moment that the war brought to the <span>Apennine Peninsula.</span> </p>

    <p>  Economic implications: </p><p>  - a drop in the level of production and GDP by 3 times; </p><p>  - Mass unemployment (officially more than 2 million people were registered who were looking for a job); </p><p>  - Many enterprises were destroyed during the fighting. </p><p>  Italy in World War II was held hostage to two <span>totalitarian political regimes,</span> which as a result ceased to exist. </p><p>  Social Implications: </p><p>  - Italy after World War II, more than 450 thousand soldiers were missing and about the same number of wounded; </p><p>  - at that time, mainly young people served in the army, so their death led to a demographic crisis - about a million babies were not born. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After the end of World War II, Italy was very weak economically.  That is why the number of communist and socialist parties and their influence on the life of the state constantly increased.  To overcome the crisis in 1945-1947, more than 50% of private property was nationalized in Italy.  The main political moment of the second half of the 40s - in 1946, Italy officially became a republic. </p><p>  Italy never again left the path of democratic development. </p>
