The length of the water stream is 55 km.  Like Small Kirzhach, it is available for rafting. </p><p>  Near the village of Ivashevo, both rivers merge into one, continuing their flow in a southerly direction, until they flow into the waters of Klyazma, 10 km from the city of Pokrov. <br>  Kirzhach is a river, a photo of which can be found in an article related to the Oka Basin District.

However, in the post-war period, in rural areas it was forbidden to use one's own sources; it was necessary to connect to state power systems.  So Fineevskaya hydroelectric power station ceased its activities.  And in 1967 it was completely dismantled.  Now only the ruined walls are left of the former hydroelectric power station, although it is considered a local attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kirzhach river how to get there" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1337243.jpg" width="500"></div>
