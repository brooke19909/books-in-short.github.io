This was the result of a national liberation movement known as Risorgimento.  That is how it was possible to unite all independent Italian states into one country, having established power in the Sardinian kingdom. </p><p>  The ruling in Italy was the Savoy dynasty.  Only in 1946, when a nationwide referendum took place in the country, Italy abandoned the monarchist system in favor of the republican one.  Almost immediately after this, the royal family left the country. </p><h2>  Foundation of the kingdom </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.linkiesta.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National liberation movement" class="if uuid-2543331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543331.jpg"></div><p>  The prerequisites for the formation of the kingdom of Italy became a national movement.  The fact is that until 1861 on its territory there was no single state.  Independent territories were scattered throughout the Apennine Peninsula, and its northeastern part was completely under the protectors of the Austrian Empire, where the Habsburgs ruled. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, the liberation war began for the unification of Italy.  Mostly they were conducted under the flag of the Sardinian kingdom.  At first, any military operations against Austria failed, but they played an important, even decisive role in raising patriotic feelings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, the medieval kingdom of Italy was located in the north of the country.  It was founded in 781.  But then it was included in the Holy Roman Empire.  The takeover began in 951, and ended after about ten years.  After that, until the middle of the XVII century, her emperors simultaneously held the title of Italian kings. </p><h2>  State in Northern Italy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="if uuid-2543333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543333.jpg"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that during the time of Napoleon there was a state in the northern part of the peninsula.  The Kingdom of Italy (1805-1814) was reorganized from the Italian Republic, in which Napoleon himself became president.  In the new kingdom, he received the status of ruler, and his stepson named <span>Eugene Bogarne</span> became vice-king. </p><p>  This kingdom included Venice, Lombardy, the Duchy of Modena, the Papal State, part of the Kingdom of Sardin, as well as Trentino Alto Adige. </p><p>  Until 1809, Dalmatia, Istria and Kotor were part of the kingdom.  They were included in the Illyrian provinces.  Moreover, in fact, the state did not have independence, subject to the French Empire.  All resources were used to achieve her goals.  During the coalition wars, bridgeheads against the Austrian Empire were located on the territory of the kingdom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When Napoleon failed and also renounced power, Eugene Beauharnais tried to crown.  But in the Senate at that time there was a strong opposition, which raised an uprising in Milan.  Therefore, Beauharnais plans were frustrated.  Eugene was given to the Austrians who occupied Milan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ilmantellodellagiustizia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Risorgimento in Italy" class="if uuid-2543329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543329.jpg"></div><h2>  Unification Start </h2><p>  As a result of the war between the Austrians, Italians and French, as well as the subsequent landing of the troops of Garibaldi, the union of the Sardinian kingdom with Romagna, Tuscany, Modena, Parma, as well as the <span>kingdoms of both Sicilies took place.</span>  The Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed March 17, 1861 by the Parliament of Sardinia.  King <span>Victor Emmanuel II</span> became its head <span>.</span>  The unification of Italy, the proclamation of the Italian kingdom took place in Turin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.investingbb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Victor Emmanuel II" class="if uuid-2543334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543334.jpg"></div><p>  However, at that time, it was not possible to unite the entire territory of the kingdom of Italy.  Austria retained power over part of the Apennine Peninsula, and in Rome, which was occupied by French troops, the Pope ruled. </p><p>  When the Austro-Prussian war broke out, Italy sided with Prussia, having been able to add the remaining lands to its territory based on the results of this confrontation.  In the fall of 1870, Italian troops entered Rome to finally drive the French out. </p><p>  In 1870, the Papal Region was officially liquidated, the capital of the kingdom moved from Florence to Rome.  Italy was the first state that managed to establish control over the entire Apennine peninsula, with the exception of the miniature enclave of San Marino.  Previously, only Byzantium succeeded. </p><h2>  Fascists come to power </h2><p>  The political system of the kingdom was radically changed when in 1921 <span>Benito Mussolini</span> created the National Fascist Party.  Immediately 38 deputies from this association were elected to parliament. </p><p>  The following year, a march to Rome takes place, the fascist party seizes power in the country, and Mussolini becomes chairman of the government.  Since then, Italy has become a fascist state.  People in power are persecuting political opponents and opponents.  During their reign, more than 4.5 thousand people were accused for political reasons, most of them are communists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.axishistory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mussolini in power" class="if uuid-2543332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543332.jpg"></div><h2>  Kingdom in World War II </h2><p>  Since 1940, Italy enters the Second World War on the side of Germany.  Her troops occupy part of the Balkan Peninsula, as well as France.  He fights in North America, but soon loses Ethiopia. </p><p>  When the <span>Italian army is</span> defeated on the Black Continent, allies land in Sicily.  Mussolini replaced by Marshal Badoglio.  And by September 1943, Italy was joining the United Nations. </p><p>  Mussolini is trying to resist, even creating an alternative government in the north of the country, which participated in the war until 1945. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946) coincides with the territory of modern Italy.  In fact, the union ends only in 1870. </p><p>  Italy also has kingdoms in northern Africa.  In particular, under its protectorate are Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Libya.  In 1936, Italian East Africa was formed in the east of the continent.  By 1939, the kingdom conquered Albania, during the war it temporarily occupied Greece, Yugoslavia, British Somalia and Egypt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fascist party in Italy" class="if uuid-2543328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2543328.jpg"></div><h2>  Political structure </h2><p>  Italy exists as a constitutional monarchy.  The king performs the functions of the executive branch, leading the ministers, whom he himself appoints.  There are two chambers in parliament.  These are the Senate and the Chamber of elected deputies.  They limit the power of the ruler. </p><p>  At the same time, ministers are directly subordinate to the king, but, as practice shows, the government does not manage to remain in power, having lost the support of the parliament. </p><p>  Deputies are elected by a majority vote in single-member constituencies.  To win, you need to collect more than half the votes of voters who came to the polls. </p><p>  A proportional electoral system appears only after the First World War.  The socialist party is becoming the largest party, but it still does not manage to form a government.  Parliament is divided into groups. </p><p>  When Mussolini came to power, a fascist dictatorship was established, and the proportional system was canceled.  From now on, the constitution acts only formally. </p><p>  The flag of the Kingdom of Italy resembles a modern one.  It also shows green, white and red vertical stripes.  Only in the middle was the crown. </p>
