Costa Brava hotels - photos, prices and reviews from tourists from Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many tourists can already hear that they during their vacation stayed at the Esmeralda 3 * hotel.  Spain, of course, is a fairly large country.  However, not every of her hotels is to the liking, and sometimes affordable, of our compatriots.  And the Esmeralda 3 * hotel, located in the Costa Brava, suits many travelers with its value for money.  In addition, its location is convenient enough for trips on excursions to various attractions of Spain.  Although for the best choice, it is worth familiarizing yourself with other hotels in Spain, in particular the Costa Brava.  By the way, it should be borne in mind that not only in Spain is the Esmeralda 3 * hotel.  Rhodes (Greece) has on its territory a hotel with the same name.  Therefore, getting acquainted with the living conditions at the Esmeralda hotel or booking a room in it, it is important not to confuse the location.  Of course, the island of Rhodes can offer a vacation no less pleasant than the Costa Brava, but such surprises are still better to avoid. </p>

However, prices for accommodation in local hotels can be very different.  It all depends on the landscaping, "stardom", location relative to the sea and many other factors.  Therefore, if the cost for you is not the last factor when choosing a place to stay in Spain, be sure to devote enough time to studying it.  It's no secret that the cost of living in a hotel such as, for example, Esmeralda Hotel 3 *, is much lower than, say, in Cala del Pi 5 *. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure options at the Esmeralda </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the Esmeralda 3 * hotel is located near the beach, most vacationers tend to spend their time there.  You can also go sightseeing from nearby attractions from the hotel. </p><p>  As for spending time in the hotel itself, it offers a swimming pool where you can enjoy swimming, as well as take sunbathing, relaxing on sunbeds.  The hotel bar offers guests a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, which are very handy on hot days.  It is worth noting that there is no animation in this hotel, so if you are hungry for entertainment, then you better look for a different option.  Or think about where you can spend interesting leisure outside the hotel. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  Tourists from Russia, once staying at the Esmeralda 3 * hotel, leaving their reviews, agree on one thing: the prices for accommodation here are quite reasonable.  In addition, everyone is pleased with the proximity of the beach.  True, many say that in order to get on it, you must cross the road, although many hotels, the location of which is the Costa Brava, suffer from this drawback.  The 3 * hotels located on this coast often receive very flattering reviews, as they offer good entertainment opportunities that many Russian tourists in Esmeralda lack so much. </p><p>  Some guests of the Esmeralda also mention in their reviews a ‚Äútiny‚Äù bathroom, where the toilet is combined with a shower.  In addition, all tourists claim that in reality this hotel is positioned as a two-star (despite the information on numerous resources on the Internet, according to which the hotel has 3 *). </p>
