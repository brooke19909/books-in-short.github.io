A beautiful city, although a little grayish: gray buildings accumulated in a row, smoking plants and factories, piles of garbage.  Nevertheless, nothing will prevent the city from attracting tourists from all over the world.  Firstly, Kharkov was until recently the <span>capital of Ukraine,</span> and secondly, its sights will not leave anyone indifferent.  For example, Freedom Square is the largest in Europe.  In summer, mass events are constantly held here: fairs, pop stars, celebrations of the city‚Äôs birthday and more.  By the way, the birthday of Kharkov falls on August 23.  If you want to visit this first capital, try to participate in this festival.  You will certainly get a lot of positive emotions after the first minutes of your stay in the city square.  In addition, what is an exciting trip to a huge zoo or a walk in Gorky Park, where you can ride a <span>cable car</span> and raise your blood adrenaline level.  You eat in a booth, and under the bottom there is a chic fluffy forest, people even think that you are on a heavenly Olympus.  The Assumption and Intercession Cathedral, the Monastery, the Annunciation Church are always waiting for you.  Only <span>in Kharkov</span> you can admire the monument to all lovers.  Describe the advantages of the city for a long time.  Frankly, rest in Kharkov is a great opportunity to combine business with pleasure, and you yourself will see for yourself. </p><p>  The choice remains with the placement, that is, the <span>hotel.</span>  Kharkov <span>hotels</span> will suit every taste and budget.  It all depends on your desires and material capabilities.  So, if you are a lover of chic relaxation, you will need luxury hotels.  The most expensive are Kharkov hotels such as Chichikov and Cosmopolitan Hotel.  What is the difference between them?  Firstly, the Cosmopolitan Hotel is located in the village, a 20-minute drive from the city, and Chichikov is right in the heart of the town.  Secondly, in terms of service, the first place is occupied by the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Here you have a variety of rooms from luxury to standard.  The suite has everything you need and more.  The standard includes one wide bed, a small TV and a wardrobe.  But, in any room it is always clean and comfortable.  Of course, the only drawback is the expensive price.  A night spent in the Cosmopolitan standard costs about $ 150.  The hotel itself is made in an elegant style of glass.  Inside, the decor is modern.  Here is also the Davinci restaurant, spa, massage room.  At the Cosmopolitan Hotel, all celebrities stay, both foreign and ours. </p><p>  Hotel Chichikov has a larger number of rooms.  The <span>deluxe room</span> even has a jacuzzi, which is not in Cosmopolitan.  The price of the standard is a little cheaper - $ 100.  The only negative is the slightly nervous staff.  And so everything is just wonderful, and even in the city center. </p><p>  In addition, there are three-star hotels in Kharkov, such as Kievskaya, <span>Hotel Kharkov,</span> Victoria, Mir.  They can rent a regular number for no more than $ 50.  Of course, they are not as chic as rooms in Cosmopolitan or in Chichikov, but this is an economical option.  These Kharkov hotels are located 10 minutes from the center.  The very first hotel is the Kharkov hotel.  If you go into the rooms themselves, you can see that the repair was done a very long time ago.  But, then everything is clean, always the maids are cleaned on time and do not require a tip. </p><p>  In addition, in Kharkov there are a lot of <span>private hotels,</span> with a number of rooms of 15 rooms or less, for example, Gloria, Star, Victory, etc.  Prices depend on the amenities in the room itself.  But, on average, the price is not more than $ 20 per day. </p><p>  As you can see, Kharkov hotels are as diverse as the city itself.  You will certainly pick up your ideal option.  The main thing is just not to rush into the choice. </p>
