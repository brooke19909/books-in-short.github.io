    <p>  The state should act in the interests of citizens, therefore, it conducts appropriate policies (demographic, environmental, social, economic and others).  In this case, a price and financial-credit mechanism is used as a means. </p><p>  <span>The budget system</span> includes relations that are associated with the accumulation of material resources.  Money is stored in extrabudgetary funds, which are designed to ensure the effective implementation of the functions of the state.  This happens in the form of annual withdrawal of a certain part of GDP in the form of taxes. </p><p>  <span>Insurance contributions</span> to <span>extrabudgetary funds are</span> paid by: </p><p>  - all workers who create intangible and material wealth through their own labor and receive income from this; </p><p>  - Entrepreneurs, including investors. </p><p>  There are four extrabudgetary funds in total: </p><p>  - social insurance; </p><p>  - employment; </p><p>  - pension; </p><p>  - medical insurance. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail the premiums to extrabudgetary funds.  The Pension Fund of the Russian Federation is accountable to the government of the country.  This institution monitors the full and timely receipt of contributions.  The tariff amount is set as follows: </p><p>  - for the majority of employers (production, trade, provision of services) - 28% of all income, for example, work under a contract of assignment, contract; </p><p>  - for state farms, collective farms, including enterprises working in the field of agricultural production - 20.6% of wages; </p><p>  - for farmers, peasant farms, individual entrepreneurs, family communities of the Far North peoples, lawyers, notaries, private security guards, detectives - 5% of the amount of income; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - for institutions and enterprises that pay royalties - 26% of the amount received; </p><p>  - for citizens who buy self-employed workers for personal purposes (repair, building a house, etc.) - 28% of the payment amount. </p><p>  The calculation of insurance contributions to the Social Fund is mandatory for all employers.  The monetary savings of <span>the Social Insurance Fund</span> cannot be transferred to the budgets of the Russian Federation.  It is ruled by the Russian government. </p><p>  <span>The insurance rate is</span> set for institutions, enterprises, organizations and other households in the amount of 5.4% of the payment for work.  This fee is also paid by citizens who use hired labor in their personal households, farms, peasant farms, and family communities of the peoples of the Far North. <br><br>  The employment fund is intended to pay for activities that are related to the implementation of the employment policy of the population.  It is formed due to: </p><p>  - contributions of employers; </p><p>  - payments from earnings of employees; </p><p>  - appropriations from the local and republican budgets. </p><p>  Payers are various organizations and other farms.  The size of the tariff is 1.5% of the salary.  The fee is not paid by citizens who have bought the labor of hired specialists for their own purposes, entrepreneurs and other citizens who are not officially employers.  Farmers 'and peasants' farms and family communities of the peoples of the Far North also make insurance contributions to extrabudgetary funds. </p><p>  Health insurance funds accumulate state-owned funds.  They are created by local governments. </p><p>  Compulsory medical insurance in the Russian Federation is payable in the amount of 3.6% of the salary.  Of these, 0.2% to the Federal Fund, the remaining 3.4% to territorial ones. </p><p>  Paying fees: </p><p>  - organizations, representative offices and branches of foreign legal entities; </p><p>  - farming, peasant farms, family communities of the peoples of the Far North; </p><p>  - citizens who bought hired labor; </p><p>  - private detectives, security guards, notaries, lawyers; </p><p>  - persons of professions related to creativity. </p><p>  Insurance contributions to extrabudgetary funds are subject to mandatory payment by all authorized market entities. </p>
