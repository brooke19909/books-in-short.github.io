There are a bunch of available models with a ton of useful features.  One of them is the ZTE Blade G Lux.  Reviews indicate that this is an ultra-budget model designed to perform the simplest tasks.  At the same time, the device looks interesting and behaves vigorously enough for its price.  Therefore, today we are talking about this Chinese smartphone. </p><h2>  General view </h2><p>  So, to get started, get acquainted with the device.  It is presented in two color variations - black and white.  Outwardly, it looks quite nice, due to the luminous circles it is very similar to Meizu (we are talking about physical navigation buttons on the front panel under the screen).  In general, the ZTE Blade G Lux v830 (reviews confirm this) is assembled according to the classical scheme: on the right side panel there are “rockers” - sound adjustment keys, as well as a button for unlocking the screen.  There is a front and main camera, due to which the device, apparently, wants to claim a higher price class. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  As customer reviews note about the ZTE Blade G Lux, the appearance of the smartphone does not have any special features - it is a simple “touch brick” made by Chinese manufacturers.  However, given the low price of the model, we can say that it looks more expensive.  Perhaps the reason for this is the gloss that covers the entire body.  As indicated in the technical specifications, the front panel is hidden by an oleophobic coating that <span>protects the phone</span> from scratches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the luminous circles, in the dark the model looks even more impressive.  As testimonials about the <span>ZTE</span> Blade G Lux <span>phone</span> reviews, here this "trick" is implemented more successfully than on Meizu.  The meaning of the keys is the same as in all Android devices: the right one means “Exit” or “Back”, and the left one means entering the options menu.  Accordingly, the central icon is “Home”. </p>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  The ZTE Blade G Lux smartphone, reviews of which we are interested, is assembled from a sufficiently high-quality plastic that looks at its price.  Holding it in your hands, at least it cannot be said that this is an extra-budgetary device.  The back cover of the phone adjoins it quite tightly, due to which there are no backlashes or creaks. </p><p>  The dimensions of the phone are quite large - the thickness of the case, for example, reaches 9 millimeters.  True, due to the smoothed corners, the effect is created that the device seems thinner than it actually is. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen size of the device reaches 4.5 inches.  The display resolution is only 450 by 854 pixels (data taken from the official ZTE Blade G Lux specifications).  Customer reviews of the device indicate that the screen is clearly not its strongest side.  If you tilt the phone and look at it at an angle, you notice a serious distortion of the color gamut of the image.  For example, a picture becomes either too light or, on the contrary, too dark to distinguish anything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the display of the image on the screen, TFT technology is used, which was also used in keyboard phones.  Therefore, it makes no sense to talk about some kind of high-quality color reproduction on the ZTE Blade G Lux v830.  Customer reviews, however, are the last to complain.  There are more serious disadvantages of the device. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  One of them is a weak processor and a small amount of RAM.  Given the price of the phone, it would be foolish to expect high power and perfect operation of the most “demanding” applications from it.  However, the amount of RAM equal to 512 megabytes is clearly not enough.  Perhaps even for a phone of this class.  According to technical parameters, the device uses Mediatek MT6572, which consists of two cores.  Their alternating balanced operation provides a maximum clock frequency of 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  About the work of the ZTE Blade G Lux processor, reviews note the following: until a certain application is launched, the device works normally and without any special delays.  If you run any program (even if not the most resource-intensive), the phone starts to “fail”, and it becomes impossible to work with it.  Those who are attracted by such low-cost devices to perform the simplest tasks should take this into account.  In another situation, it does not even make sense to take the ZTE Blade G Lux Black.  The reviews show, again, that you should not expect the functionality of an average smartphone from it.  It is simply a mobile phone that can do a little more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional features </h2>

    <p>  The so-called "additional" include features such as determining the location of the device using GPS, as well as support for two SIM cards, a memory card up to 32 GB and a camera with autofocus.  From all this remarks, it is possible to make precisely cameras: objects that are photographed at a distance of more than 30 centimeters are poorly detailed in the images.  For example, it is impossible to shoot text with such a camera.  Even autofocus does not save the situation with such a weak matrix, so buying this model to create a "selfie" or photographing text documents for further familiarization with them is not worth it. </p><h2>  operating system </h2>

    <p>  Like all similar phones, the ZTE Blade G Lux V830 smartphone, of which we are interested in reviews, is running Android.  More precisely, this is version 4.2.2.  True, manufacturers went a little further in trying to uniquely design their product and redraw the icons of standard applications.  In all other respects, as noted by the reviews, the platform under which the device is running has not changed. </p><p>  Android OS supports a lot of functions, including downloading new applications from a specialized catalog of Google Play programs.  True, as the user reviews describe the ZTE Blade G Lux Black smartphone, when it starts downloading a new application, it begins to seriously “freeze”.  And then, you need to carefully monitor the programs that are downloaded - not all of them can be run on a device with such a small amount of RAM. </p><h2>  Cost and features </h2><p>  We have repeatedly emphasized that the smartphone (or simply - the phone), which was described in this article, belongs to the class of super-budget.  It's time to clarify that its value reaches 3800 rubles.  Perhaps the price is decent, given that the buyer receives a phone on a modern operating system with GPS support, two SIM cards, cameras, at least basic programs from Google Play, and much more.  In addition, it is made in a nice design. </p>

    <p>  This gives reason to note that the device will pay for its price.  Perhaps you should even praise ZTE for developing a device with such a cost and give credit to the opportunity for even low-income people to use this model. </p><p>  In addition, the phone can be a great solution for a child, student or just a person who does not want to spend money on additional "bells and whistles".  Perhaps someone will just like this design, because of which he decides to purchase this affordable device. </p><h2>  General impression of the model </h2><p>  Of course, it’s not difficult to call the phone weak in all respects, note all the “hangs” and emphasize the shortcomings that the ZTE Blade G Lux V830 Black has.  The reviews show that the model is decent (at least because of the low price).  Many devices of the same price class do not have the capabilities that this phone has. </p><p>  The device can be used by those who need mainly a “dialer” and only occasionally - a smartphone.  And downloading a web page, social network application or even a video for viewing on the V830 is not difficult.  At the same time, you do not pay for a famous brand, metal case or high-precision display of the device, which is unlikely to ever be appreciated sufficiently. </p><p>  Moreover, the presence of two SIM cards makes the Blade G Lux a reliable assistant in all matters!  Having saved on the device, you can also continue to spend less on mobile communications, communicating in different mobile networks on the same device.  Again, with a phone of this class, you can listen to your favorite music on the way home, without worrying about whether there is enough charge.  A sufficiently powerful battery with a capacity of 1830 mAh is installed here, which, given the low resolution of the screen, will last for a long time. </p>
