Draw green lawns on the sides.  Use a sponge to create volume, apply a little light green paint on the lawn.  If there is no sponge on hand, use a stiff glue brush. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="road through the eyes of children crafts photo" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1398586.jpg" width="389"></div>  So crafts on the theme "Road through the eyes of children" will be more realistic.

Paste the box over black paper and make an application on it in the form of round traffic signals.  From a curled cardboard sheet and a black circle, make a stable stand.  Show your imagination and weave a traffic light from beads, blind from plasticine, salt dough, crochet or knitting.

    <h2>  Learning road signs with crafts </h2><p>  Important when studying traffic rules and traffic signs.  Their meaning is also easiest to learn in the game.  With children from five years old, you can make a small book where they will methodically paste in new learned signs.  Always pay attention to the signs and their meaning when walking.  You can build a soft crafts for children, then the signs will be even more fun to learn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Take a piece of carpet (it is better to take a looped one, since "Velcro" sits on it well).  Take a piece of size 60 by 60 cm. Sew on the carpet a fabric road with Velcro on the wrong side.  Make markings from white shoelaces.  Build traffic lights, traffic signs, pedestrians and cars.  All details should be on flypapers for free movement on the platform.  Such a game will help to consolidate knowledge of traffic rules and will be very interesting for children. </p><h2>  Crafts on the theme "Road through the eyes of children": how to make a traffic controller? </h2><p>  Children of the preparatory group should already be familiar with the basic rules of the road, know the concepts, signs, and terms.  With children 6-7 years old, you can build a cardboard traffic controller.  For work you need to take cardboard boxes, colored paper, cardboard, scissors, glue, compasses, felt-tip pens.  Two oblong boxes need to be pasted over with blue or blue paper.  Then paste a larger box the same way.  The body and legs of the traffic controller are ready.  Glue the legs to the body.  On beige cardboard we draw the head of the traffic controller with two longitudinal stripes.  We cut out the details and glue the stripes into a circle.  Now the head can be conveniently put on the box.  So that it can be glued to the box, make valves and bend them.  Make your hands out of blue paper (draw two white stripes below).  We cut out the adjuster’s vest from light green paper.  Now we take the compass, draw three identical circles (two blue, one white). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="road through the eyes of children drawings crafts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1396253.jpg" width="375"></div>  Cut out.  From a cardboard we cut out a strip, cut valves on it, glue a circle.  We collect the cap from the parts and paste over with a ribbon of red paper.  Glue black cardboard boots to our feet, draw a face - the craft is ready!
