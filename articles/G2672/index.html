Insurance Company Rating</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Renaissance is a large universal Russian company that belongs to the category of backbone <span>insurance organizations.</span>  Its full name is Renaissance Insurance Group LLC.  The headquarters of the institution is located in Moscow.  The company's assets amount to more than fourteen billion rubles. </p><p>  We will review the reviews on comprehensive insurance in Renaissance Insurance in this article. </p><h2>  About company rating </h2><p>  In our country, the financial reliability of insurance companies is checked every year by the RAEX rating agency.  This agency has been confirming the high degree of reliability of the Renaissance Insurance organization for more than ten years.  This year, the company's rating corresponds to the ruBBB indicator, which, according to the previously used scale, was equal to category A + (III). </p><p>  The Renaissance Insurance organization is proud that for many years the growth rate has enabled it to maintain its position among the leaders of the Russian market.  In addition, for the past nine years, this insurance company has been included in the six hundred largest Russian institutions, according to the version of the RAEX rating agency. </p><p>  As practice shows, only a large insurance organization can be considered truly reliable and stable.  Various shocks in the economic sphere, along with trends towards consolidation and concentration of the insurance industry, create unfavorable conditions for hundreds of companies that have to leave the market and at the same time abandon the fate of their customers.  Reviews about casco in the Renaissance Insurance are of interest to many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="casco renaissance insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094567.jpg"></div>

At the same time, among the largest insurance groups, Renaissance is in ninth place in terms of sales and payment indicators, confidently competing with market leaders in the field of voluntary types of insurance.  Thus, with regard to voluntary car insurance, Renaissance is in seventh place, and in terms of compulsory services - tenth.  Thanks to advances in health insurance, the company holds eighth place.  In addition, it is one of the five leaders of direct insurance, which implies the sale of policies by phone and via the Internet.  There are a lot of reviews about casco in Renaissance Insurance. </p><h2>  Casco </h2><p>  The main difference between Casco insurance and compulsory motor liability insurance is that the first option makes it possible to repair a car, regardless of who is responsible for the accident.  Casco guarantees its owner vehicle repair in almost any situation. </p><p>  In the Renaissance Insurance company, hull insurance can be assembled from separate modules, like a designer, including only the necessary options, as some may simply not be needed or significantly increase the cost of the product.  Renaissance Insurance provides its customers with the following comprehensive insurance services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance customer reviews for Casco" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094568.jpg"></div>

In the event that the repair cost is more than seventy-five percent of the amount for which the vehicle was insured, the owner will receive a lump-sum compensation in cash.  Payment will be limited to the amount of car insurance.  This module is the most common and most expensive part of Casco.  This is confirmed by the customer reviews of Renaissance Insurance. </p><h2>  Damage insurance for ‚Äútotal loss‚Äù </h2><p>  This type is valid if the car cannot be restored due to an accident, as well as when the repair cost is more than seventy-five percent of the insurance amount.  In this situation, the client receives a refund in the amount of money for which his vehicle was insured.  By choosing this option, you can get insurance in case of emergency.  Casco insurance rules in Renaissance Insurance can be clarified at the company's office or on the official website. </p><h2>  Car insurance against theft and theft </h2><p>  Immediately after the investigation, the client receives a lump sum payment according to the amount of insurance.  This option is usually included in almost every insurance, but is not considered mandatory.  The owner may not insure the car against theft, which will save on the cost of insurance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance hull insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094569.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional equipment insurance </h2><p>  The issuance of additional equipment insurance is valid for parts installed outside the manufacturer.  Payment is issued only in case of theft or damage to this equipment, or its individual parts.  A comprehensive insurance policy in Renaissance Insurance is now available to many. </p><h2>  Liability insurance </h2><p>  This module makes it possible to expand the limit of customer liability under the insurance policy in the event of a serious accident, as well as damage to several cars at once.  The maximum allowed amount in this situation is two and a half million rubles.  This option can be used only when buying a hull in the offices of Renaissance Insurance. </p><h2>  Total Cost Insurance </h2><p>  In the event of theft, in situations where the vehicle cannot be repaired, the customer is paid the full <span>insurance cost of the</span> car.  The Renaissance organization offers this insurance module exclusively for cars of 2016 and 2017 of release. </p><h2>  Accident insurance </h2><p>  This module involves a cash payment in situations where passengers, the driver of the car received various injuries, became disabled or died as a result of a traffic accident.  The payment in this case is calculated as a percentage of the amount for which the injured driver with passengers was insured. </p><h2>  Additional casco services from Renaissance Insurance </h2><p>  The company seeks to provide its customers with various additional features associated with the Casco service for their convenience, which in certain unforeseen situations can save time, energy, and nerves. </p><p>  One such opportunity is to carry out repairs without providing information.  In some cases, it may not be possible to <span>file an incident</span> with the police.  Understanding this, the company offers customers to repair the machine, without providing certificates from the relevant authorities upon the occurrence of <span>an insured accident.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance policy renaissance insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094570.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Emergency Commissioner Services </h2><p>  Renaissance Insurance provides the services of an emergency commissioner, within the framework of which a specialist at the scene of an accident helps to inspect damage sustained by a car, and draw up documents.  After that, the <span>emergency commissioner</span> collects all the necessary certificates from the traffic police.  The driver can choose one of the services of the emergency commissioner: departure for an accident with two or more participants, responding to any accident related to the car.  This option will not be available if hull insurance is purchased online or over the phone. </p><p>  Another additional service is technical assistance on the road, which is provided in the most ordinary situations: adding gasoline, replacing wheels, starting the engine in the cold season and evacuation, if this is not related to insured events.  The company provides each such option within three thousand rubles.  Making a comprehensive insurance contract with Renaissance Insurance can be very beneficial. </p><h2>  Rent payment </h2><p>  During car repair due to the occurrence of an insured event, the driver has the opportunity to rent another car.  "Renaissance" pays the costs associated with the lease, in the range of ten thousand rubles.  And in the event that the car is evacuated from the accident site, the company pays for taxi services within two thousand rubles so that the client has the opportunity to get to the required place.  As a rule, this amount is enough for any trip within a particular Russian city.  There is a hull for legal entities in Renaissance Insurance. </p><p>  Thus, the company tries to provide a wide range of services for the convenience of its customers.  What do ordinary people think about the service of this organization, who happened to arrange a hull there? <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance contract hull insurance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094571.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Casco reviews at Renaissance Insurance </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are a lot of dissatisfied reviews on the Internet about the activities of this insurance company from customers who have drawn up comprehensive insurance.  So, people call the Renaissance a company of scammers and liars.  Clients are confident that, thanks to good legal support, along with the purchased judging, all indecent insurance activities are carefully hidden.  For example, it is said that if the insured was guilty of an accident, the company sued his client, demanding money from him. </p><p>  People report that upon the occurrence of an insured event, its employees take time to process the due payment, against which clients have the impression that the Renaissance is simply trying to get the deadline for providing the service.  In addition, company employees often do not fully perform the amount of work necessary on their part. </p><p>  However, the situations are different.  In addition to dissatisfied customer comments, there are also positive ones.  For example, people say that they like the speed of the Renaissance company in considering insurance cases, but they are not happy with the customers that they have to wait about a month for repairs.  Thus, according to customer stories, the company takes up to twenty days to consider insurance, and repairs can be delayed for a whole month. </p><p>  In contrast to the failed relationship with Renaissance, many people were satisfied with the service of this insurance company.  Such comments indicate the responsiveness of employees who eagerly advise their clients on any issues related to insurance, as well as provide necessary advice.  Many examples are also given when car repairs were completed in just a week and a half, which is really not so much. </p><p>  People also write that it can be difficult to get through to Renaissance Insurance.  It is reported that when trying to contact the insurance, it takes up to half an hour, even at the height of the working day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="renaissance insurance hull address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/2094573.jpg"></div>

    <p>  People warn other potential customers that if they decide to apply for a policy at the company, they need to be prepared for the fact that they will not be able to receive a hull payment at Renaissance Insurance in the event of an insured event in a short time.  It is noted that when it comes to small amounts, customers receive cash compensation almost on time, but when the question of serious payments comes up, as insurers write, you have to wait at least one quarter. </p><p>  In addition, there are situations in which the process of car restoration is delayed due to undelivered directions for repair.  So, people write that after they collected all the documents, and the company confirmed the occurrence of the insured event, for some reason it gets stuck, the signed direction for repairing the damaged car, which simply does not reach the car service, is lost.  Against the background of such situations, the insurance company does not provide any reasonable explanations.  In addition, many do not like that in the event of these circumstances, Renaissance employees behave incorrectly, hinting to the client that he distracts them from important and urgent matters, and often simply ignore them. </p><p>  Often there are reviews in which customers complain that they can‚Äôt get a payment for car theft.  For example, many people say that when all the necessary papers for an insured event are collected, delivered to the Renaissance company on time, payment to the client is still not made.  Many complain that in this organization, when insured events occur, clients are met by an absolutely impenetrable wall of trained operators who skillfully dodge the fulfillment of the company's obligations.  This is confusing and annoying. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize, it should be noted that many clients who have drawn up a hull in Renaissance Insurance (the address of one of the offices in Moscow: Pyatnitskaya St., 74), caution in their reviews of other potential insurers to include the money earned in this organization, which sometimes does not want to Fulfill your direct obligations to customers. </p>
