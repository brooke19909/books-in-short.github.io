    <p>  <span>A heating element</span> with a temperature controller has found its wide application today.  It becomes part of the heating systems for aquariums, as well as the design of household appliances.  If we are talking about the first variety, then it can be classified into: </p><ul><li>  submersible; </li><li>  flowing; </li><li>  heating cables; </li><li>  heating mats. </li></ul><p>  The former are in the form of an elongated cylinder or flask and are used for lowering into an aqueous medium.  As for the flow-through heating elements, with their help it is possible to save the internal space and achieve the creation of a stream of aerated warm water. </p><p>  Heating cables are designed for installation in the soil of the aquarium and allow you to warm the water evenly.  For installation under the aquarium, <span>heating mats are used.</span>  One of the most common is the heater, which becomes part of household electrical appliances.  For example, storage boilers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the plastic box is a switch that is triggered by a temperature sensor.  The shape of the heating element can be different, it all depends on the design and power of the device.  The heating element with a temperature controller in this case can provide a different degree of heating, which is controlled by the position of the mechanical contact.  It is controlled by a handle located at the bottom of the box.  Here are the terminals for supplying electric current.  The thread serves as fastener for the heater. </p><h2>  Description of different types of aquarium heaters with a temperature controller </h2>

    <p>  Today, there are several varieties of aquarium heaters, but the principle of their operation remains the same.  It consists in electric heating in a sealed environment.  The immersion heating element with a temperature regulator can be titanium, glass or plastic. </p><p>  It has a body, a heater, and the whole structure has the shape of a cylinder, so it is convenient to lower it into the aquatic environment.  The flow heater has a plastic housing and is located in an upright position.  Heating cables additionally create water circulation, but heating mats are ready to further ensure the stability of the aquarium.  When choosing such equipment, it must be borne in mind that 1 liter of water will need 1 W of power.  Sometimes this value decreases to 0.75 per 1 liter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The need to use an aquarium heater with a temperature controller </h2>

    <p>  An aquarium heating element with a temperature controller during operation almost eliminates human activity.  If you use a heater without a thermostat, this entails the need for control of work.  As soon as the water temperature reaches the desired value, the device will have to be turned off manually.  If you use an element with a temperature regulator, it will be possible to create a suitable microclimate inside the aquarium, which will not differ in temperature differences. </p><p>  Modern devices are quite compact and easy to handle.  They can be electronic or mechanical.  The former provide higher accuracy, and most of them have bulletin boards.  Among the shortcomings, low reliability and high cost should be highlighted. </p><p>  A mechanical <span>heater for an aquarium</span> with a thermostat is more common.  It is reliable and stable during operation, and also has a low cost.  True indicators, however, will be distorted by several degrees.  Therefore, for a more precise adjustment, a separate thermometer should be used. </p><h2>  Safety classification of aquarium heating elements </h2>

    <p>  The heating element with a temperature regulator for water is also subdivided according to the durability of work, as well as the level of safety.  Thus, on sale you can find built-in and remote devices.  The latter will be located outside the aquarium and will not be affected by the aquatic environment. </p><p>  For the reason that vital products do not affect the element, the service life of the device will be increased.  To adjust the operating mode, a temperature sensor is used, located in the aquarium and connected to the thermostat.  As for the built-in heaters, they are located in a sealed enclosure together with the heating element.  This configuration allows for ease of use and compactness. </p><p>  Such devices are popular among aquarists and are made in the form of an elongated bulb, inside of which there is a thermostat and heater.  For greater thermal conductivity, the flask is filled with ceramic filler.  Such a heater for an aquarium with a temperature regulator is tight due to the plastic or rubberized cap through which the wire passes. </p><h2>  Description of dry and wet household heaters </h2>

    <p>  The household heater may be dry or wet.  In the latter case, the service life of the device varies from 2 to 5 years.  After this time, the device has to be changed.  To increase the service life, dry heaters were invented.  They hide in a protective metal flask, which eliminates contact with water. </p><p>  The element is heated inside the flask, and after that heat is transferred to the liquid.  In this case, the temperature of the flask will be lower compared to the heater itself, so the formation of scale does not occur so intensively.  The service life of such devices reaches 15 years. </p><h2>  Why choose a dry heater </h2>

    <p>  The electric heater will last longer if certain operating conditions are met, among which, for example, the stability of the supply voltage.  But even under such conditions, dry heaters will sooner or later exhaust their life, which requires replacement.  Here, an additional advantage is revealed, expressed in the absence of the need to empty the boiler before replacement.  For carrying out manipulations, the device will only need to be disconnected from the pipeline.  After that, the electric heater is simply removed, and a new one is installed in its place. </p><h2>  The cost of heaters with a temperature controller </h2><p>  If you are interested in heaters, the price should be known to you.  When it comes to devices for aquariums, then for the model AQUAEL GOLD AQN-25W will have to pay 700 rubles.  The length of the device will be 24 cm, and the volume of water should not exceed 25 liters.  The power of this device is 25 watts. </p><p>  The TETRATEC HT 25 brand heater will cost the consumer 1,000 rubles.  Its size remains the same, but the volume of water can vary from 10 to 25 liters.  The power of this device is 25 watts. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Some craftsmen try to make a heater with a thermostat on their own.  However, experts argue that such devices can lead to the creation of fire-hazardous environments and electric shock.  However, if you all have already decided to carry out such work, then you will need a glass tube with fairly thick walls, an external temperature regulator and a dry filler. </p>
