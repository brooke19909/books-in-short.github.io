    <h2>  How to get and when to go </h2><p>  To get to Verkhnyaya Dzhemete, you need to come to the railway station of Anapa.  It starts right behind the station.  The village is located on the long Pionersky Prospekt, on which buses and minibuses often go.  Administratively, it is part of Anapa.  It takes ten minutes to get to the city center by buses numbered 114 and 128. On the other side, seven kilometers away, there is another famous resort - Vityazevo.  The climate in the village is almost the same as in neighboring Anapa.  Upper Dzhemete.  The temperature of air and water is almost the same - +25 and, accordingly, + 23-24 degrees Celsius, so we can assume that the velvet season reigns here constantly.  But it's better to come here in June and September.  Fewer people and cheaper.  In July and August, prices become even higher than in Anapa, and the sea is covered with algae. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Upper Jamete" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2155032.jpg"></div>

These are the main types of housing that are rented to tourists.  Prices in the village are cheaper than in Anapa, and with early booking you can count on significant discounts.  The first recreation centers appeared here in the middle of the last century.  And since then, the popularity of the resort is only growing.  Almost all housing here is a five-minute walk from the sea, no more.  The private sector is mainly economy rooms and rooms.  And guest houses and mini-hotels are increasingly providing standard conditions.  One can also find deluxe rooms here.  Housing in Upper Jamet is divided into first and second lines.  It all depends on which side of Pioneer Avenue is the hotel or guest house.  If between the sea and the main street of the village - this is the first line.  If behind the Prospectus - the second. </p><h2>  Where to eat and how to have fun </h2><p>  Along the Pioneer Avenue in Upper Dzhemet, a number of dining rooms and cafes lined parallel to the sea.  Some of them have discos in the evenings.  You can eat in the dining rooms of various boarding houses and recreation centers.  And also a tourist train runs around the village, with which you can go around all the most picturesque surroundings.  Anapa with its boisterous entertainment is reached not only by bus.  This trip itself can be turned into a pleasant walk if you go there by boat on the sea.  For almost ten years now, a family-type water park "Tiki-Tak" has been opened in the village.  There is a special complex of slides designed for children.  And not far from it is an amusement park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Upper Jamete Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2155012.jpg"></div>

The sand on the local beaches has a different color, as well as the composition.  In some places it is yellow, and in some places quartz, snow-white, as in the pictures.  The only problem is that when the sea heats up very strongly, then, as they say here, it begins to ‚Äúbloom‚Äù.  The wild beaches here are interesting because on the shore high sand dunes are scattered everywhere, so that vacationers feel like in a real desert.  The height of such dunes sometimes reaches 15 meters!  The public beach is also well maintained and fairly clean.  Despite the fact that in season it slightly resembles an anthill, garbage containers are everywhere here, and algae and traces of vacationers are cleaned by tractors every night.  The bottom is very shallow, so while you get to the depth, you have to go 50 meters.  There is entertainment on the beach: trampolines, inflatable slides, water scooters.  There are several passages to the sea, and almost all of them are occupied by shops and souvenir shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Top jamete reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2155040.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Verkhniye Dzhemete: vacationers reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have been to this village do not advise settling close to its center, because you will not fall asleep due to the constant music and noise that can last all night.  From inexpensive and high-quality cafes, vacationers recommend ‚ÄúSurf‚Äù.  At the peak of the season it can be very problematic to get to Anapa and Vityazevo - minibuses and buses go packed and do not stop.  The street vendors for vegetables and fruits are quite reasonable prices.  But in stores can be even higher than in Moscow.  From housing, most vacationers prefer guest houses and the private sector.  When you book a hotel room, you have to have lunch and dinner in a cafe, and this can be quite expensive. </p><p>  In the private sector, as a rule, there is a common kitchen, a lot of various dishes, cozy rooms or houses, a large courtyard with a playground, their own tables where you can eat and drink tea in the air among the flowers.  On the other hand, mini-hotels often offer clean and spacious pools, games areas and satellite TV.  They have rooms with private facilities, and lunch and dinner are sometimes included in the price. </p>
