    <ul><li>  savings on cosmetic kits; </li><li>  Considering that the hotel is designed for German tourists, hotel staff do not speak Russian; </li><li>  prices in stores on the hotel are simply fabulous; </li><li>  confusion with the entry to restaurants (at the very last moment, it may turn out that someone else is sitting at your table); </li><li>  construction is underway near the hotel, which creates a lot of noise and spoils the view; </li><li>  too shallow indoor pool; </li><li>  old furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  the hotel has little entertainment for young people; </li><li>  no water slides for adults. </li></ul><p>  Xanthe Resort Hotel is a good hotel with its drawbacks.  This is a great place for those who want to relax in a quiet and relaxing environment.  Delicious dishes, a clean beach and a beautiful area will create a good mood. </p>
