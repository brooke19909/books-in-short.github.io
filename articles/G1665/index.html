    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  In the place where the current capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, is located, in ancient times lay a trade route from the Volga regions to Persia.  In the 7th century, the magnificent city of Semender stood there, which was the capital of the Khazars.  Prophetic Oleg was going to "take revenge" by him, but this was accomplished by his distant relative, Prince Svyatoslav.  In 966, he completely destroyed the city.  In 1722, during his campaign in Persia, at about this place, near the town of Tarki, but closer to the sea, Peter I set up his camp.  In 1844, a military fortification was erected here.  They called it Petrovsky in memory of the great sovereign.  Convenient location favored the fact that the fortification quickly developed and was upset.  Already in 1857 it became known as the city of Petrovsky.  Its production expanded, the population grew rapidly.  A port was built here in 1870, a brewery in 1876, a printing house in 1878, and railway lines to Vladikavkaz and Baku began to be laid in 1894.  In 1918, Petrovsk was renamed Shamil-Kala, wishing to perpetuate the memory of the national hero Imam Shamil.  Since 1921, the city bears the name of the Bolshevik Magomed-Ali Dakhadaev, whose people were called Makhach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is Makhachkala on the map of Russia </h2>

    <p>  Makhachkala is located in the territory called Anji-Kala, which from Kumyk translates as "diamond city".  This is a small strip of lowland between the <span>Caspian Sea</span> and Mount Tarki-Tau.  Five kilometers away is Tarki town, which also has its own wonderful history and its sights.  Tarki is mentioned in chronicles of the 7th century.  Then it was a small village.  By the beginning of the 17th century, it became the capital of Tarkovsky‚Äôs shamhalism.  During the Persian campaign of Peter the Great, Tarki was considered the largest city in Dagestan.  The geographical location of Makhachkala is amazing.  It stands right on the coast of the Caspian ice-freezing winter, not far from the mountains of the Greater Caucasus.  A little further along the coast is the city of Kaspiysk, and inland from the sea - Leninkent. </p><h2>  Administrative division of Makhachkala </h2>

    <p>  The capital of Dagestan is famous for its rich natural resources.  On the territory of the city there are three unusually beautiful lakes.  In the Kirov region, the Vuzovskoye lake, slightly elongated in shape, splashes.  A microdistrict of the same name with modern infrastructure is being built on its shores.  In the Leninsky district, not far from the sea, there is a rather large lake Ak-Gol.  It is known for its rounded outlines and an amusement park located right on the shore.  A little to the north there is a small mud lake with healing mud.  A 20-minute drive from Makhachkala lies the seaside town of Kaspiysk, on the border of which there are two more wonderful lakes - Big and Small Turali.  The territory of Makhachkala is crossed by two rivers - Tarnair and Talginka (the second name is Cherkes-Ozen).  Beautiful embankments were built on their shores.  Also in the city there is a man-made river - the channel named after the October Revolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2>

Summer is hot, with an average air temperature of +24 degrees, and water - +22 degrees.  In some years, the air temperature from May to October can be kept within +30 ... + 38 degrees.  There were also particularly cold periods in the history of the city, when the summer temperature did not rise above +10 degrees.  Winters in Makhachkala are moderately cool, with a minimum air temperature of -2 degrees.  Extremely cold winters happen very rarely in the region.  So, the lowest temperature of the winter months is fixed at around -26 degrees Celsius.  Precipitation in Makhachkala usually falls evenly throughout the year.  Only in July and August their number is slightly less than in the rest of the time.  Winds in this area are also moderate.  Their average speed is only about 4 meters per second.  The proximity of the mountains creates in Makhachkala a not entirely favorable seismic situation.  The largest earthquake here was in 1970. </p><h2>  Transport </h2>
