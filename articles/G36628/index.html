There are three phones in the line, and the U model, that is, the ST25I, is the youngest among them.  But this does not mean at all that the device is initially focused on the lower segment - perhaps only among premium devices.  The phone received a completely modern filling with a dual-core processor, as well as a high-resolution display.  Nevertheless, not everyone likes the Sony Xperia U (ST25I).  The reviews of the owners themselves note that the smartphone loses to the flagship participants of the NXT series in the performance and quality of materials for the case.  Many also emphasize that the phone is equipped with a smaller screen, although the matrix provides an image of similar quality. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and ergonomics of the model </h2><p>  The model received balanced characteristics of the case - it is thin and light, but it is very comfortable in the hand.  The main manufacturing material is represented by plastic.  It is especially worth highlighting the solid cover that covers both the back of the device and the side parts.  The configuration of the location of the battery and SIM card is traditional and does not carry any surprises.  Perhaps this solution made it possible to realize the almost perfect design of the Sony Xperia U without gaps and creaking.  The first impression of the case is quite able to inspire associations with a monolithic plastic block.  And even more surprising can cause the ability of the lid to separate along with the buttons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In terms of ease of use, the phone is commendable.  This is largely facilitated by the fact that the lid itself is made using unusual plastic.  This is a rubberized material with a soft touch effect.  That is, in the process of using the Sony Xperia U, the owner can count on the coverage grip and the absence of fingerprints. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  If in terms of appearance this model is not much different from its older counterparts, then the hardware stuffing has some features - of course, in the direction of lowering the level, but this does not prevent us from considering the phone as a full-fledged modern smartphone.  Still, the flagship representatives of the NXT series are much more expensive than the Sony Xperia U, the technical characteristics of which are presented below </p><ul><li>  Dimensions - 112 mm in height, 54 mm in width and 12 mm in thickness. </li><li>  The mass of the device is 113 g. </li><li>  The processor is the U8500 series from ST-Ericsson with two cores at 1000 MHz. </li><li>  Battery capacity - 1290 mAh. </li><li>  OS - Android with upgrade to version 4. </li><li>  The display is a 3.5-inch with a resolution of 854 √ó 480. </li><li>  The amount of RAM gadget - 512 MB. </li><li>  Communication capabilities - implemented through 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. </li><li>  Camera - uses a 5 megapixel matrix. </li><li>  The device‚Äôs internal memory is 8 GB. </li><li>  Presence of sensors - sensors for lighting and proximity are provided. </li><li>  Additional functionality - FM-radio, electronic compass and G-sensor. </li></ul><h2>  Performance </h2>

In addition, the Mali-400MP system is also provided as a graphics accelerator.  In these parameters, the model corresponds to the senior representative of the line - Xperia P. The differences begin with RAM, which is 512 MB for Sony Xperia U. Android in the initial version of Gingerbread provided the phone with a good interface, which allows optimal use of the capabilities of software.  In aggregate, the performance indicators of this model can be safely estimated as average against the general background in the segment.  Of course, when compared with devices from manufacturers of the appropriate level.  The same applies to graphics processing capabilities - you should not expect an outstanding result, but the model fulfills the declared characteristics with dignity.  And this is especially noticeable against the background of direct competitors in the class. </p><h2>  Expert opinions on smartphone </h2>

    <p>  The general impressions of specialists about the Sony Xperia U model come down to such characteristics as rational, balanced and economical.  It can be seen that the developers carefully and responsibly approached the creation of a junior representative of NXT.  As for the shortcomings, experts note the lack of ability to expand memory.  By today's standards, this decision looks strange, but there are a considerable part of consumers who are ready to put up with this shortcoming. </p><p>  Also during operation, you will notice that sometimes the Sony Xperia U does not turn on the first time.  Problems of this kind may be related to problems with the battery or improperly executed firmware.  Like other smartphones, this model is quite sensitive to any adjustments to the hardware and software part, so it is better not to touch it without the help of specialists. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Almost all phone owners praise it for its stylish design, ease of use, speed and responsiveness of the menu, as well as good quality photos.  By the way, the camera is additionally provided with the possibility of LED flash and autofocus.  There are many high ratings for the Sony Xperia U screen. Customer reviews, for example, note good color rendering and good display performance in the sun.  True, there are complaints about its small size.  But the lack of the ability to use memory cards does not really bother users.  In everyday use, many have enough internal memory, but on long journeys, of course, problems can arise.  This shortcoming is compensated by the wide possibilities of Google services provided by the Android shell. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The model is a rare example when a small smartphone uses a rather productive filling.  Together with the original design, the high speed of the phone makes it attractive for a variety of consumers.  Of course, the Sony Xperia U is primarily aimed at young people, but it also has a lot of conservative solutions.  This applies to the same design, and to the decision to abandon the memory card, and in general to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe NXT line.  The manufacturer has set the task to embody in this series all the advantages of the corporate identity of Sony Mobile.  And it should be noted that the news was very readily accepted by fans of the brand.  In any case, there are much fewer disappointed reviews with criticism than positive reviews. </p>
