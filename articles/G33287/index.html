Interestingly, the legendary "living water", according to the description, is very similar to the one that contains sulfur ions. </p><p>  The geyser is of artificial origin, unlike the like in Sochi, Krasnodar Territory, Turkey and others.  That is, he appeared as a result of human activity.  The waters in such places as in the Saratov pond are famous for their healing properties and an unpleasant odor similar to that exuded by rotten eggs.  However, after a short period of time you get used to the unpleasant odor and stop noticing. </p><p>  The first sensations that appear when immersed are heat and slight redness of the skin.  This suggests that blood flow has been activated and histamine is released. </p><p>  If dizziness, weakness, a metallic taste in the mouth or a violation of the heart rhythm appear, then it is better to leave the territory, possibly this is poisoning.  Some people have individual intolerance, in which case it is better to refuse bathing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": BARMALEJKA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter area" class="if uuid-2239596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2239596.jpg"></div><h2>  The story of the appearance in Engels </h2><p>  In Engels, a hydrogen sulfide source was discovered by accident.  In the 60s of the last century, oil was sought in these places.  Exploration drilling began at the site of the modern well, but no oil was discovered.  The workers simply abandoned everything and began to search further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little later, the authorities came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlandscaping a place for tourists to visit.  They laid everything out with concrete, and the jet itself, under great pressure, was framed in an iron pipe, directed to the side, made handrails for descent.  Over time, sulfur corroded the pipe and eroded concrete, as a result, the entire structure was demolished by the tractor to the side, there was a deep funnel and a lake with a diameter of about 10 meters. </p><p>  The plans were to build at least two sanatoriums here.  But times have changed, perestroika has come, and the project has been forgotten.  Only on the basis of the Udarnik rehabilitation center was a department created where dirt was used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": irinaart1508, "><img itemprop="image" alt="mud baths" class="if uuid-2239599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2239599.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Engels and a hydrogen sulfide spring today attract many people who are ready to rest as a "savage."  Entrance to the territory is paid, but a shower is installed.  The temperature of the reservoir here is always at + 18-20 degrees.  The color of the water is grayish-bluish. </p><p>  This is a renewable lake, water flows into a dam that can be seen behind the reeds.  It is in this place that valuable dirt accumulates, with which you can rub the whole body.  It has a light pleasant smell and nips the skin a little.  The muds of Kazakhstan, Siberia, Mordovia and the Urals have similar healing properties, but now you don‚Äôt have to go that far. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now on the territory you can rent a gazebo, change clothes in the locker room and wash yourself in the shower.  In the summer season, there is even a playground with trampolines and a bath complex. </p><p>  The surrounding landscape is unremarkable, characteristic of the Saratov region.  The climate here is temperate continental with a fairly hot summer, the temperature can reach +40 degrees, although very rarely.  But winter is rarely with severe frosts.  In recent years, heavy snowfalls have been observed. </p><p>  You can come here in winter, as the water temperature is always stable, regardless of the season.  But the water composition is compared with Lake Heviz (Hungary).  This is evidenced by the reviews of vacationers, and a photo of a hydrogen sulfide source in Engels in the winter season. </p><p>  By the way, there are several similar geysers in the area, but this is the most popular, as there is at least some improvement, but a paid entrance.  I would like to believe that in the foreseeable future a sanatorium complex will appear here. </p><p>  If you have plans to ‚Äúheal‚Äù yourself and your family for several days, then you can settle in the village, which is located about 11 kilometers.  Locals offer rooms for temporary settlement, and throughout the year. </p><p>  You can also settle in the village of Vzletnoye, near which there are even several recreation centers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sport-culture-engels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="general view in the summer" class="if uuid-2239600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2239600.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it better to refuse procedures </h2><p>  With an exacerbation of any chronic disease, you should refuse to travel to a reservoir.  Also, do not swim in the presence of the following pathologies: </p><ul><li>  kidney and liver; </li><li>  Gastrointestinal tract and biliary tract; </li><li>  with tuberculosis; </li><li>  genitourinary system; </li><li>  ischemia and angina pectoris; </li><li>  with epilepsy; </li><li>  with heart failure. </li></ul><h2>  Benefits and few rules of conduct </h2><p>  High concentrations of hydrogen are poisonous.  In no case should you drink from a geyser and a pond.  The effect of the baths is also called the Macetin reaction.  The benefit is that after the gas ions enter the bloodstream, they are oxidized and have a healing effect.  They penetrate through the respiratory system, skin and mucous membranes, and are excreted by the kidneys and partially by the pulmonary system. </p><p>  The hydrogen sulfide source located in the Engels fields can help in the presence of the following pathologies and problems: </p><ul><li>  accelerate blood circulation, therefore, blood supply to organs; </li><li>  slow down the process of blood coagulation; </li><li>  normalize blood sugar; </li><li>  activate metabolic processes; </li><li>  improve metabolism in the heart muscle; </li><li>  normalizes blood pressure; </li><li>  stable hypotension; </li><li>  activate metabolic processes in joints and muscles; </li><li>  normalize heart rate and heart rate. </li></ul><p>  This water slows down the aging process of the whole body.  But most often they go to such places to cure rheumatism and arthritis.  A good effect is achieved in the treatment of skin diseases. </p><p>  Naturally, it is best to consult a doctor before the trip and not go swimming for a long time.  When you first visit the source of hydrogen sulfide in Engels, you may experience dizziness. </p><p>  Do not forget that before bathing it is better to remove all jewelry, as they can be oxidized.  You should not be in the pond for more than 10 minutes, then you should rest for 30 minutes. The minimum course of treatment should last 11 days, better than 15, if you are sure that there are no contraindications to the procedures.  It is not recommended to take ‚Äúbaths‚Äù on an empty stomach and immediately after a meal (best of all - after 2 hours).  The ideal option is to combine treatment with massage or manual procedures. </p><p>  You should not combine bathing and smoking, drinking alcohol.  This is an extra load on the whole body and heart muscle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": BARMALEJKA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="spring landscape" class="if uuid-2239601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2239601.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Engels sulphide source in the fields is not so difficult to find. </p><p>  The easiest way to get to the residents of the Saratov region and Saratov itself, from which to the satellite city of Engels is about 11 kilometers.  There is a bus service to the city, but getting to the fountain itself will be far away on foot.  Also, trains run between settlements regularly. </p><p>  Located on the way to the village of Vzletny (horticultural society).  Schedule from 9:00 to 20:00. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.42440759648901" data-lng="46.30181816914069" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/5/485.png"></div><p>  If you go by car, then at the exit from the satellite city, moving along the Rivne highway, you need to drive 5.5 kilometers and, most importantly, do not miss the left turn.  Next, follow the road between the fields, also approximately 5.5 kilometers.  Coordinates for the navigator N 51 ¬∞ 24.936 'E 46 ¬∞ 18.602'. </p>
