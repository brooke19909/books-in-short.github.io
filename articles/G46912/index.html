    <p>  Some tourists, especially those who were relaxing with their children, did not like loudly playing music, as well as poor soundproofing.  In addition, the low cost of the hotel leads to the fact that cultural and intelligent people do not always come here.  And the concept of "all inclusive" with an unlimited amount of alcohol issued to such vacationers led to constant drinking.  However, this is not a matter of the hotel, but of the residents themselves. </p><p>  Food, judging by the reviews, was average.  At least no one left the restaurant hungry. </p>
