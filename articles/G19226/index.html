    <h2>  World War II: when did it start and why </h2><p>  Two concepts should not be confused: <span>"The Great Patriotic War",</span> which designates this phenomenon in the USSR, and "World <span>War</span> II", which designates the whole theater of military operations as a whole.  The first of them began on a famous day - 22. VI.  1941, when German troops without any warning or announcement of their invasions dealt a crushing blow to the most important strategic sites of the Soviet Union.  It is worth noting that at that moment the non-aggression pact between the two states was valid for only two years, and most residents of both countries were confident in its effectiveness.  However, the leader of the USSR, Stalin, suspected that the war was not far off, but entertained himself with the thought of the strength of a two-year treaty.  Why did the Second World War begin?  On that fateful day - 1. IX.  1939 - fascist troops also invaded Poland without any warning, which led to the start of terrible events that lasted for 6 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why did the second world war" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/322538.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reasons and background </h2><p>  After the defeat in the First World War, Germany temporarily lost its power, but a few years later it regained its former strength.  What became the main reasons for the conflict?  Firstly, this is Hitler‚Äôs desire to subjugate the whole world, eradicate certain nationalities and make the <span>Third Reich the</span> strongest state on the planet.  Secondly, the restoration of the former authority of Germany.  Thirdly, the elimination of any manifestations of the Versailles system.  Fourth, the establishment of new spheres of influence and the division of the world.  All this led to the height of hostilities in different parts of the planet.  What goals did the USSR and its allies pursue?  First of all, this is the fight against fascism and German aggression.  Also to this point can be added the fact that the <span>Soviet Union was</span> struggling with a violent change in the delineation of spheres of influence.  That is why we can conclude: when the war (World War II) began, it became a war of social systems and their manifestations.  Fascism, communism and democracy fought among themselves. </p><h2>  Consequences for the whole world </h2><p>  What did the bloody clashes lead to?  When the war (World War II) began, no one could imagine that everything would drag on for such a period of time: Germany was confident in its lightning-fast plan, the USSR and its allies in their strength.  But how did it all end?  The war claimed a huge number of people: losses were in almost every family.  Huge damage was caused to the economy of all countries, as well as to the demographic situation.  But there are also positive aspects: nevertheless, the fascist system was destroyed. </p>

    <p>  Thus, when the war (World War II) began for the whole world, few could immediately appreciate its strength.  These bloody events will forever remain in the memory of every person and in the history of many states whose citizens fought against the terror and aggression of the Nazis. </p>
