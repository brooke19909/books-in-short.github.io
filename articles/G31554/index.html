They are very different from the usual long beeps, which indicate that the user has not yet picked up the phone.  It can be a variety of musical reproduction: from "classics" during a call to the call center of a company to modern songs. </p><p>  In fact, such a service is available to every mobile subscriber.  Operators can connect a wide range of tunes to your number for an additional fee.  Moreover, this service, which is the most interesting, is called differently by one or another telecom operator.  At MTS, for example, it is ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù - a service that, by its name, makes it clear its essence.  In this article we will look at how it is connected and, accordingly, disconnected. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù at MTS: what is it? </h2>

    <p>  So, let's start, in fact, with a brief description of this function.  As you already understood from the introduction, we are talking about the possibility of replacing the familiar and pretty boring long beeps that came from the handset while waiting for something more fun, relevant or modern.  The ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù service on MTS allows you to individualize the process of communication with a person.  With it, you can emphasize the style, display musical tastes and even wait a little to entertain your interlocutor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The service can be called affordable because of its low cost (from 50 rubles per month).  In this case, of course, the user can easily order its connection and disconnection. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù on MTS: service limitations </h2><p>  On the MTS official website, as in other sources of information about the service, there are a number of restrictions that are imposed on users of the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù.  In particular, the operator does not guarantee that the melody will sound if the device is in roaming.  MTS does not give guarantees regarding the sound quality of music (since much depends on the load on the network during a call).  The supplier company may (at its discretion) extend the validity period of the package, therefore, disabling the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù service on MTS must be done independently. </p>

The provider also reserves the right to change musical compositions if the license to play musical content has expired.

    <h2>  How to activate the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù service? </h2><p>  Well, do you want to be different from others and show your personality?  Want to replace the beeps with a song?  Then we explain to you how to install ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù (on MTS) on your phone.  You can do this in five ways. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, the first one is a phone call to 0550 (you can still call 07701), where you will be prompted to select the music of interest right in the voice menu. </p><p>  The second is sending a combination of numbers.  To do this, dial * 111 * 221 # on the phone and press the call start button.  If you use this method, you will soon be offered a genre and a song that you need to select for installation. </p><p>  The third method is MTS.Gudok mobile applications on all three platforms: Android, iOS, and WP. </p><p>  The fourth is the selection of a song on the site goodok.mts.ru. </p><p>  The last (fifth) is the ability to copy music playing instead of beeps from another subscriber.  To do this, simply press "*" while calling someone with a melody. </p><h2>  Service cost </h2>

    <p>  Of course, if someone is looking for information on how to put the Beep on MTS, he is also interested in the price, as well as how it is calculated.  So, the lowest cost of the melody is 49 rubles per month of use (whereas on the official selection portal you can find songs mainly for 98 rubles).  The most expensive package of tunes will cost 120 rubles per month.  At the same time, the operator gives you the right to choose: install only one specific record or connect a service with a package of tunes related to one genre.  The latter option is very convenient, though it costs more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As already noted, the fee is charged monthly until the user independently unsubscribes from the service. </p><h2>  How to choose ringtones on the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù? </h2>

To do this, just look at the catalog of songs.  If you connect the service through the site or with the help of the * 111 * command, you will be given the right to familiarize yourself with the entire list of content that can be set instead of beeps.

    <p>  As for the selection criteria and fashion for music, here is your only adviser is taste.  Focusing on what you would like to hear by calling, for example, your friend, choose the same musical compositions.  Judging by what tracks are on the first page of the ‚ÄúHooter‚Äù catalog, contemporary pop music is most popular here.  Apparently, with the help of musical beeps, people remain "in trend." </p><h2>  MTS music catalog </h2><p>  Speaking about the music catalog of the mobile operator, it should be noted that here is primarily a breakdown by <span>genre of songs.</span>  For example, there are sections "Hits", "New", "Chanson", "Soundtracks", "Songs of Victory", "Golden Hits".  There is also a list of musical compositions with which you can play the person calling you.  It is called "Jokes and jokes." </p>

    <p>  Thus, the subscriber is provided with a wide choice, with the help of which he will surely find his favorite song and set it to his beeps.  In the future, of course, he can easily remove it, replacing it with standard beeps.  However, we will talk about this in that section of the article, where we describe how to remove the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù on the MTS. </p><h2>  Copy someone else's tune? </h2><p>  For subscribers, the company also provides the opportunity to ring the tone that they heard from another person.  In essence, this is called copying beeps. </p>

    <p>  To do this, there is a special service "Catch the Hooter."  With her, it‚Äôs enough just to hear the song from your friend (or even just a random person), then to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù it and install it on your number. </p><p>  One way to do this is to press the ‚Äú*‚Äù symbol at the time of connecting with another user;  the second is simply to use the form on the MTS website, where it is enough to enter the number of the person with the service already connected. </p><h2>  How to disable the "Hooter"? </h2><p>  Of course, replacing the original beeps with some song is good, but very soon even it can get bored.  In this case, the question will arise about how to remove the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù.  On MTS (in the terms of use) it is indicated that if the subscriber does not express a voluntary desire to refuse the supplement, then the service is provided as a subscription.  Naturally, you will have to pay for it every month in the future.  If you do not want this, simply disable the service. </p>

    <p>  Deactivation of the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù service on MTS can also be carried out in three ways.  The first is a combination of numbers * 111 * 29 #.  The special menu that appears will inform you that you are going to deactivate the beep replacement service and ask for confirmation. </p><p>  Two other options are a visit to the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù on the MTS website, as well as working with a mobile application on one of the platforms.  How to remove the ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù on the MTS, using each of these methods, it will be clear in the course of work with the application or site.  It is quite simple and intuitive. </p><h2>  Service deactivation conditions </h2><p>  We explain to users who doubt whether the charge-off for the connected ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù service will really be stopped, as well as those who are worried about how much it will cost to stop this package of services, we explain: it's all completely free!  Thus, having performed once the operations described in the section ‚ÄúHow to remove the‚Äú Beep ‚Äùon the MTS?‚Äù, You can forget about the music once and for all instead of the beeps in your number. </p><h2>  Can I reconnect the service? </h2><p>  At the same time, don‚Äôt worry if you want to connect again!  To do this, it is enough to go through the usual order of service, which is described above.  This can be done at any time after a failure. </p><p>  As soon as you hear a cool musical composition and want to share it with those who will call you, connect without problems! </p><p>  In general, I would like to emphasize that such an opportunity as setting music to the sound of waiting for a connection is an individual and temporarily popular service.  As soon as the song goes out of fashion or you like a new piece, of course, you will want to change it.  Thus, for a long time the same sound instead of beeps, as a rule, does not remain. </p><p>  Experiment with different beeps, act out your interlocutors and make the very expectation of a conversation interesting and intriguing! </p>
