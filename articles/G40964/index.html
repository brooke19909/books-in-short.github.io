First, a Greek settlement grew up here, which was called Tragurion.  Now it has become known as Trogir.  Croatia, in which this city is located, is a small Catholic country with a population of just over 4 million people. </p><p>  The small town of Trogir, popular among tourists from all over the world, is under the auspices of UNESCO.  In it, despite all the turbulent events sweeping over it, many buildings of the XIII-XV centuries were preserved.  Brought photos from Trogir, Croatia, will warm the soul with warm memories for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The Greeks are tireless travelers and merchants who were the first to settle on the islet where the historical part of the city is now located, and the coast opposite it.  This is mentioned by Strabo and Ptolemy.  The town was small, but successfully developed.  When these places began to belong to the Roman Empire, then life in it began to calm down.  Roman veterans began to inhabit it.  They built baths and baths, the remains of which have survived to this day. </p><p>  When the barbarians destroyed the empire, then Trogir annexed Byzantium.  The small town remained to live, because it was on the island.  In the 7th century, the Byzantine empire was so weakened that the Croats actively began to arrive in these places, and the town fell under the sway of the Croatian kings.  This place was too attractive.  Trogir was ruled by Hungarian kings and flourished at that time, and in the XV century it was captured by Venice and began to impose its customs and language.  There were wars with her, and the inhabitants of Trogir turned to the Pope for help, demanding that his bishops speak the Croatian language. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the XVIII century, when Venice lost its position, Trogir annexed Austria.  Only in 1990, after the breakup of Yugoslavia, did independent Croatia appear.  Trogir is one of its cities.  Four kilometers from it is Split with an airport, from where it is easy to get to the tourist town, where pleasant warm weather reigns from August to October. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Tourism here began to develop from the 30s of the last century.

    <p>  Having passed the short bridge that separates the island from the mainland, tourists enter the city through the North Gate, on which, from the time of Venetian rule, a sculpture of the patron of Trogir - blessed John.  In the same period, city walls were built.  Entering Trogir, the traveler immediately finds himself in the central square, in the historical heart of the city, which was originally a Roman forum.  Further, in all directions lead confused, winding narrow streets paved with stones.  Tourist immediately plunges into the atmosphere of the Middle Ages.  He will meet on his way more than ten churches and numerous buildings of the 13th century. </p><h2>  St.  Lawrence </h2><p>  This is the highest and most visited attraction of Trogir in Croatia.  It is by climbing the bell tower of the cathedral, whose height is forty-seven meters, you can enjoy the views of the whole city.  It was built and rebuilt for four centuries.  This exquisite work of art is the work of various artists and architects.  It mixes Romanesque, Gothic style, as well as Baroque. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trogir croatia photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1908411.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <p>  Historically important for the defense of Trogir and Croatia, Fort Saint Mark is now the home of Dalmatian music.  Today the fortress is also used as a museum. </p><h2>  Trogir in Croatia: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Everyone believes that this is a great place to relax due to the temperate climate, as well as its location on Ciovo - an island with many picturesque bays and beaches.  But it is the city of Trogir in Croatia that impresses with the monuments that architects left. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trogir city in croatia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1908420.jpg" width="343"></div>  Walking along the narrow stone streets, everyone feels the antiquity of his story.  These walls, sometimes covered with ivy, with arched entrances and exits, ancient windows immerse into the world of the past.  In the center you can find many cafes and restaurants, and in the evening it is nice to walk along the promenade, where ships and yachts are moored, or again walk through the streets, flooded with golden light of lanterns.
