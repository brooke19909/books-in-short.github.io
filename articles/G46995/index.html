    <h2>  History of education </h2><p>  The whole life of the city of Tikhoretsk in the Krasnodar Territory is connected with the railway, which was important for the development of the North Caucasus by Russia. </p><p>  In 1860, the Russian Emperor Alexander II issued a decree establishing the Kuban region.  And the end of the Russian-Turkish war in 1878 gave a powerful impetus to the development of the Kuban.  Industry is actively developing here, and the region is gradually integrating into the economic life of Russia. </p><p>  In the 50th year of the XIX century.  the chieftain of the Kuban army appealed to the emperor with a request to conduct a railroad into the region, which would have important strategic and economic significance.  Ten years later, permission was given to begin construction.  It was the railway that played an important role in the formation and development of the entire economy of the Kuban. </p><p>  During its construction, small settlements were formed along the railroad track, where workers and engineering staff lived.  In 1862, a decree was signed, according to which the resettlement to the Kuban began.  People from all over Russia moved here, and the social composition of the region changed significantly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the Cossacks were engaged in the protection of the region, new Cossack villages were created, in the subordination of which there were farms.  Fertile chernozems forced to go here to the settlement of peasants of the provinces of Central Russia: Voronezh, Kursk, Chernihiv, Oryol. </p>

    <h2>  Farm Tikhoretsky </h2><p>  For the normal functioning of the new railway, specialists were required who came to service the Tikhoretsk station.  A small village Tikhoretsky was built near the station for their residence, from which the modern Tikhoretsk of the Krasnodar Territory subsequently grew.  At 7 kilometers was the village of Tikhoretskaya.  This name came from the river Tikhonkaya, on which it was located. </p><p>  In the spring of 1874, the first train proceeded through the station, which served as the beginning of a new life.  Then, about 50 workers lived in the village with her.  After laying railway lines in directions to Tsaritsyn, Novorossiysk, Yekaterinodar, the station received a new meaning - it became a hub. </p><p>  The village grew in size, and therefore he was given the status of a farm, and he attached himself to the village of Tikhoretskaya.  The Cossacks practically did not live on the farm, they lived in the village, leaving nonresidents living here and working on the railway.  In 1895, at x.  Tikhoretsky lived about two thousand people, and by 1917 the number of inhabitants was more than 14 thousand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  City Tikhoretsk </h2><p>  The farm - the future city of Tikhoretsk of the Krasnodar Territory <strong>-</strong> developed rapidly.  In 1890, locomotive workshops began to work here, a little later - a <span>locomotive depot.</span>  A new brick building was built for the station, barns for grain, large warehouses, a club of railway workers, a female gymnasium, a two-class railway school, which trained its own personnel for servicing steam locomotives. </p><p>  In parallel with the railway, the private sector developed.  Trade and industrial enterprises opened.  The farm became larger than the village to which it was assigned, and took the form of a small town. </p><p>  The events of 1917 were not left aside Tikhoretsk (Krasnodar Territory).  Most of its inhabitants were railway workers who took an active part in the revolutionary movement, as opposed to the Cossack population, who in the majority supported the rule of the autocracy.  Soviet power was established on the farm. </p><p>  Until the middle of 1918, he, like the station, was the base of the Kuban-Black Sea Red Army.  In June 1918, he was occupied by the Volunteer Army, and ataman rule was established here until 1920.  Then the Soviet power was again established.  In 1922 he was given the status of a city. </p>

    <h2>  Years of war </h2><p>  After spending five months under fascist occupation, the city has changed a lot.  It was practically destroyed, lost 3,5 thousand of its inhabitants by executed and tortured.  Almost every house has suffered.  There was a lot of work to restore and further build the city. </p>

    <h2>  Present </h2><p>  After the war, the time came for enhanced restoration and development of the city.  Looking at the old photos of the city of Tikhoretsk in the Krasnodar Territory, it is hard to imagine how much work it took to make it like it is today.  New houses, enterprises were built and destroyed ones were restored.  The construction of new industrial enterprises received rapid development.  Up to the 90s, plants were built: sleeper, brick, for processing corn seeds, mechanical, for the production of chemical equipment and much more. </p><p>  Much attention was paid to the social sphere, education, public transport.  For city guests and business travelers hotels were built. </p><p>  In Tikhoretsk of the Krasnodar Territory, by the end of the 90s of the XX century, more than 68 thousand people lived.  Today, this number has decreased to 58 thousand.  Although since 2017, this situation has begun to change in a positive direction.  The city is homogeneous in terms of ethnic composition, the majority of residents are Russians (94%), Armenians and Ukrainians each make up 1.5%. </p>
