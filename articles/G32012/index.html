For women, hats are not only a hat, but also an item that creates a common image. </p><p>  Caps knitted manually on knitting needles have long been included in our everyday life.  In ancient times, it was an element of purely masculine fashion, and, as a rule, of the poor class.  These caps were worn by artisans or peasants.  Of course, knitted items of clothing were especially popular among the northern peoples - in Scandinavia, Great Britain, in the northern parts of France and Germany.  Here, due to the cold climate, women have long mastered <span>knitting.</span>  <span>For men,</span> hats, sweaters, scarves, socks, mittens - all this was knitted from warm sheep‚Äôs wool. </p><p>  Gradually, as fashion became more and more pragmatic, <span>knitted hats</span> began to be applied more widely.  Respectable and wealthy men also began to wear them on vacation, during sports, on a walk, etc.  The female gender, which in everything strove for equality with the male, including in fashion, of course, could not stay away.  There was a new knitting for women - hats.  The variety of patterns and colors of these hats knows no bounds.  What ideas the fashion dictates: a hat with a lapel, a <span>knitted turban, a</span> bonnet, a beret, an elegant knitted hat, a cat hat, etc.  Knitting for women is a whole art.  Caps in this matter are no exception.  This accessory is designed not only to protect your head in cold weather, but also to create a harmonious ensemble with a coat, fur coat or jacket.  Therefore, as a rule, knitting for women hats is accompanied by the creation of a scarf from the same yarn.  The kit may also include gloves, mittens or mitts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nowadays, the abundance of various types of yarn allows you to create hats for both the spring and autumn season, for example, from fine wool or mohair, and for cold winter days - their thick natural wool.  Original and bright models are obtained from fantasy yarn, for example, with a change in the color or thickness of the thread. </p><p>  Knitting hats for women, as a rule, is not difficult.  In order for the hat to fit well on the head, when calculating the loops, the girth of the head must be reduced by 1-1.5 cm. This is necessary, since the knitted fabric has the property of stretching.  For the same reason, that part of the cap that is located directly above the forehead, as a rule, is knitted with an elastic band 3-5 cm high - for a tighter fit. </p><p>  Any knitted hat, no matter what style it is, always ends with a uniform reduction of loops in the fabric, divided into several sectors.  This allows you to complete your headpiece neatly and beautifully. </p><p>  If the hat is knitted for the winter period, this is done from a thicker yarn or double viscous, which forms a second (lining) layer.  This hat is much warmer and less blown.  Knitted hats are often additionally decorated using beads, rhinestones, applique, knitted or fabric flowers, cords, pompons and much more that imagination can suggest. </p><p>  Many believe that knitting is a real therapy for women.  Hats, scarves, sweaters, dresses - the creation of any thing brings great satisfaction.  Many future mothers are happy to knit a dowry for the baby: blouses, hats, booties.  But is knitting bad for pregnant women?  From an emotional point of view - no, on the contrary, it brings a positive charge.  But physically long sitting in the same position with tension on the shoulders, arms, back can cause circulatory disorders and adversely affect one's well-being.  Therefore, many doctors advise taking frequent breaks in knitting, sitting in a chair or on the couch, substitute an ottoman under your feet.  This will improve blood circulation and reduce leg swelling. </p>
