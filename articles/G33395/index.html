From year to year, engineers are clever, turning the industry and each device into a small work of art that not everyone can repeat.  There are new types of speakers, new ways of outputting sound, changing power and amplitude, and so on and so forth.  Over time, a whole multicomponent structure appeared that describes different types of speaker systems.  Actually, this will be discussed in the material below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872346.jpg?1536220053"></div><h2>  Speaker categorization </h2><p>  So, to begin with, we will understand the basic aspects of what kind of <span>speaker systems are,</span> and only then we will find out what they are and how they differ from each other. </p><p>  The following types of speakers are available: </p><ul><li>  <em>Shelf and floor systems.</em>  From the name it is clear that they differ in the principle of installation in the room and in size. </li><li>  Also, speaker systems differ <em>in the number of bands (in fact, the number of speakers) - from one to seven.</em> </li><li>  There are <em>dynamic, electrostatic, planar and other acoustic systems, depending on the design of the speakers,</em> which may not fall into any category at all (it all depends on the imagination of the engineers). </li><li>  Depending on the acoustic design of the enclosures, the speakers are divided into <em>systems with an open enclosure, a closed enclosure, phase-inverted design, an acoustic labyrinth,</em> and so on. </li><li>  Also, the speakers are divided into <em>passive and active</em> , depending on the presence in them of a built-in sound amplifier. </li></ul><h2>  Single-band and multi-band speakers </h2><p>  Single-band <span>speakers</span> are equipped with one single emitter, and since it is impossible to set up one emitter for good reproduction of all frequencies at once, manufacturers have to use several differently tuned emitters at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872347.jpg?1536220053"></div><p>  There are also 2-way speakers (also 3, 4).  In such systems, two emitters are installed.  One takes on the reproduction of low and medium frequencies, and the second reproduces only high frequencies.  Due to this approach, in 2-way speakers, an ideal sound balance is achieved, impossible when using a single speaker (even if it is very good).  The sound of such speakers is usually enough for inexperienced people who do not own more advanced systems, but there are more acceptable options, for example, 3-way systems.  3-way speakers share all three types of frequencies at once.  One emitter reproduces low frequencies, the second - high, the third - medium.  3-way speakers are more common than others, since it is thanks to this design that the highest quality reproduction of frequencies heard by the human ear is achieved. </p><h2>  Passive and active speakers </h2><p>  Active and passive systems are distinguished by the presence of an integrated power amplifier in the design of the speakers themselves. </p><p>  Active speakers have such an amplifier, so they can be directly connected to the pre-amplifier using an interconnect cable, and each individual speaker is powered from the mains without connecting additional power sources. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872348.jpg?1536220053"></div><p>  Passive speakers, although more complicated in the device, are still much more common and are a priority for users who value high-quality sound.  Such speakers are connected to the power amplifier through a dedicated separation filter.  Connection is made using acoustic wires.  Many manufacturers (firms) of acoustic systems prefer the production of just such speakers, as they bring big profits and allow engineers to realize their sound ideals.  In addition to certain installation difficulties, there is also a financial problem, because a good amplifier and speaker cables cost a lot of money, and without them you won‚Äôt get such a system. </p><h2>  Horn speakers </h2><p>  This is a special type of speaker system.  Their feature is the horn installation above the emitter.  The advantage of such speakers is the high sensitivity of the speakers.  This makes them an ideal complement for low-cost and low-power tube amplifiers, unable to give their owner sufficient volume.  Such speakers require proper placement in the room where they are planned to be used, but if you spend some time on it, you can achieve the most realistic and rich stereo picture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Electrostatic speakers </h2><p>  Such systems are distinguished by their unusual design.  Instead of classic speakers, a film of conductive material is used, which is stretched vertically along the column.  The principle of operation is as follows: a sound signal is applied to the film at a certain frequency, and a constant voltage is applied to the conductors located on the sides (in some cases, the reverse order is observed when a constant voltage is applied to the conductive film).  An electrostatic field is created between the film and the conductors, on which an alternating field is superimposed.  Because of this, vibrations of the film arise, which reproduces sound radiation.  The sound of such speakers is highly detailed, clear transmission of each individual frequency.  Music seems more free and open.  Among the minuses, it is worth highlighting the insufficient number of basses that cannot convey the full depth, especially when it comes to genres such as hip-hop or trap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872349.jpg?1536220053"></div><h2>  Center channel system </h2><p>  As <span>speaker systems for cinemas (home of</span> course), sets of 5 speakers and one subwoofer are used.  This is a classic system that has proven itself and is used by most fans of good sound.  A key element of this system is the central column, which reproduces the dialogue in the movie and the main musical fragments.  Such a column is installed right in the center.  Some users use it in speakers for a computer, since watching a movie on it. </p><h2>  Front and rear speakers </h2><p>  The front system is a classic pair of speakers that create a stereo effect.  Such speakers often form a complete <span>speaker system for computers</span> (since usually nothing more is needed).  If we are talking about a home theater, then between the two front speakers (or under the TV) the center channel speaker is huddled.  Based on the front pair of speakers, you need to collect the remnants of the 5.1 speaker system, since it is they that reproduce the main array of sounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872350.jpg?1536220053"></div><p>  The rear of the system is two small speakers located behind the audience.  Their use is optional, but they always come with 5.1 speakers to achieve maximum immersion in the atmosphere of reproduced films.  If the soundtrack of the film supports the sound environment technology, then some events and scenes in the film will play sound only on the rear speakers (this occurs when someone sneaks behind the hero of the film).  When using acoustic stands, you can integrate this system into computer acoustics. </p><h2>  Subwoofer </h2><p>  This is a separate speaker that can only reproduce low frequencies and bass.  Often used together with paired speakers and complements the speaker system for the computer, as the front speakers can not cope with the entire sound range.  A subwoofer brings balance to the speaker system.  Visually, the subwoofer looks the same as a regular speaker, but it has one massive radiator in open form.  The subwoofer is installed in the corner of the room or under the computer desk.  Because of this, by the way, neighbors often suffer. </p><h2>  Shelf and floor speakers </h2><p>  Such speakers can still be called desktop and floor (or computer and home cinema).  Shelf speakers take up much less space and weigh much less, which means they can be installed taller.  For example, if you are assembling a home audio system that will be connected to a TV (to create a sound depth), you can put shelf speakers even on a cabinet (this ensures maximum coverage of the area).  To derive maximum potential from such compact speakers, they are usually mounted on special acoustic stands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872352.jpg?1536220053"></div><p>  Floor systems are much better suited for large rooms (they are often called cinema speaker systems).  Larger speakers are installed in them, and their number varies from one to seven.  Installing such speakers in a small room can provoke excessive bass amplification and a very noticeable hum.  Floor systems are much more expensive than shelf systems and require designers much more attention in the calculations when creating them. </p><h2>  Phase-Inverted Speakers </h2><p>  The phase inverter is a hole in the housing from which the pipe goes into the inside of the column.  Thanks to this design, acoustics can reproduce low frequencies that are not available for standard speakers without a bass reflex.  When designing the column, the engineer needs to choose the diameter and length of the pipe in accordance with the frequency that the future <span>sound source</span> should reproduce <span>.</span>  At the moment when music is playing, the volume of air in the phase inverter pipe resonates and enhances the reproduction of the frequency to which the pipe diameter was originally set.  The size of the speaker itself does not matter, the bass reflex is built into both huge home audio systems and compact headphones.  The pipe for air outlet can exit to any part of the speaker or earphone, but the position of the speaker in the room will depend on this (the pipe should not be blocked by anything). </p><h2>  Acoustic systems with an acoustic labyrinth </h2><p>  At its core, an acoustic labyrinth is the same phase inverter.  The difference is that the pipe going into the body has many bends, and its length is much longer.  The task of the pipe is the same - to increase the volume and saturation of the sound of low frequencies.  Unfortunately, such speakers are much more expensive than options with a conventional bass reflex, since their production takes much more time and at the same time requires special accuracy from the engineers, and the materials are more expensive.  As in the case of bass reflex speakers, the size of the sound-output device can be any, but you will not find such a system in headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1872351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44716/1872351.jpg?1536220053"></div><h2>  Closed and open speakers </h2><p>  Some speaker companies produce open speakers.  The acoustic design of such speakers is characterized by the absence of a back wall.  Due to this, diffusers have some freedom.  This approach provides sound close to electrostatic audio-acoustic systems. </p><p>  There are also closed speakers.  Actually, they differ precisely in the fact that there are no holes in their bodies.  This approach makes the sound more resilient.  This is due to the fact that the air has nowhere to go, the movement of the diffuser becomes constrained.  To avoid the negative effect of such a design, speakers of this type are made very large so that the diffuser has more freedom for movement.  A big plus of such systems is the absence of any unnecessary noise, cod and others like them. </p><h2>  Passive-Speakers </h2><p>  A passive emitter performs the same task as a bass reflex, for example.  It is necessary in order to ensure the normal sound of low frequencies.  There are no pipes in such columns.  A hole is simply made in the column, and a passive speaker is installed inside (a speaker without a magnetic system, built on the basis of one diffuser, suspension and frame).  The advantage of a passive radiator is the ability to reproduce bass and any, even the lowest frequencies.  These types of speakers are very valuable and require remarkable engineering skills. </p>
