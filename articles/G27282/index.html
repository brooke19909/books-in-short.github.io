  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pocket projectors: review, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Gone are the days when projectors were produced only stationary.  They could not be taken on the road, because few people would want to carry a few extra pounds with them.  In addition, stationary devices required power from the network and they could not work autonomously.  Everything has changed.  Pocket projectors have appeared that weigh less than a smartphone, fit in a shirt pocket and run on battery power.  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at them. </p><h2>  CINEMOOD Storyteller </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket projector CINEMOOD Storyteller" class="if uuid-2293863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293863.jpg"></div><p>  To start a review of pocket projectors is worth one of the most popular models on the market - CINEMOOD Storyteller.  From the very moment the device appeared on the market, it was immediately called a pocket cinema for children, and not at all because of its small size.  The fact is that more than 130 cartoons, 30 audio fairy tales, 20 filmstrips and much more are loaded into the device‚Äôs memory. </p><h2>  Options and specifications </h2><p>  A pocket mini-projector is supplied in a small box.  Inside, in addition to the device itself, you can find a user manual, a USB cable, a charger plug and a small stand.  Components, although minimal, but it has everything you need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now for the main <span>features of the mini projector.</span>  The amount of internal memory is 32 GB, of which a little more than half are available to the user.  The rest is occupied by firmware and existing cartoons, fairy tales, filmstrips, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="CINEMOOD Storyteller Projector" class="if uuid-2293861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293861.jpg"></div><p>  The projector is capable of projecting an image at a distance of 1 to 6 meters.  The maximum resolution of the picture is 640 x 360 pixels.  There is support for 3D.  The lamp, which is installed in the Storyteller, has a capacity of 30 lumens and is designed for 20 thousand hours of operation. </p><p>  The mini-projector has very modest dimensions - 80 mm from all sides.  The weight of the device is 260 g. Thus, CINEMOOD can be taken with you wherever you go.  Well, the last thing worth mentioning is the battery life.  From a full charge of the battery, the projector is able to work about 3 hours, which is very decent for such a small device. </p><h2>  Cost models and reviews </h2><p>  Reviews on the CINEMOOD Storyteller Pocket Projector show that the device is not without flaws.  Users note an insufficient level of brightness, low resolution images and the amount of internal memory - after all, 32 GB is not enough.  The rest is no complaints.  The cost of Storyteller at the moment is 29-30 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Acer c120 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ldlc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pocket projector acer c120" class="if uuid-2293852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293852.jpg"></div><p>  Next in the list is a pocket projector - Acer C120.  Unlike the previous version, the Acer C120 has slightly better characteristics, and it costs a little cheaper. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery and features </h2><p>  A <span>pocket portable</span> projector comes in a small cardboard box.  Inside, in addition to the device itself, you can find: a network cable, a USB cable, a case, a warranty card, disks with drivers and additional software, as well as a user manual. </p><p>  The first thing that catches your eye when looking at the Acer C120 is its compactness.  The length of the projector is 12 cm, the width is 8 cm, and the thickness is 2 cm. The weight of the device is 180 grams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ldlc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portable projector acer c120" class="if uuid-2293854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293854.jpg"></div><p>  The LED lamp with a power of 100 lumens (75 in economy mode) is responsible for projection.  The minimum distance required for the projection is 40 cm, and the maximum should not exceed 3.7 m. The native resolution of the projector is 854 x 480 pixels, and the maximum is 1280 x 800. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfortunately, the C120 does not have a built-in battery, so you will only have to use it from the network. </p><h2>  Cost and user reviews </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Acer C120 pocket projector is a very good device that has good functionality, but lacks many features.  In particular, there is no support for wireless interfaces, there is no built-in memory, some videos simply cannot be played through the projector due to technical limitations.  As for the cost, then you can buy Acer C120 at the moment for 14500-18000 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Philips PPX4010 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips PPX4010 Mini Projector" class="if uuid-2293862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293862.jpg"></div><p>  Another good and quite popular pocket projector is the Philips PPX4010.  The model, although not new, but has already managed to establish itself well.  The PPX4010 is also called one of the smallest pocket projectors in the world because it fits easily in your jacket pocket. </p><h2>  Options and characteristics of the model </h2><p>  A pocket projector is sold in a small square cardboard box.  In addition to the device, inside the package is <span>an HDMI-mini HDMI cable, a USB cable, a</span> warranty card and instructions.  A fairly modest kit, but there is everything you need to work. </p><p>  Now some technical information.  Philips PPX4010 has a very modest size - 68 mm / 22 mm / 66 mm.  The weight of the device is only 83 grams.  An LED with a capacity of 100 lumens is declared as a lamp, but in reality it turns out to be only 76. The lamp life, according to the manufacturer, is 30 thousand hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips portable projector PPX4010" class="if uuid-2293864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293864.jpg"></div><p>  Philips PPX4010 can project images from 50 cm. The maximum working distance is 5 meters.  The projector outputs video in a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels.  This is not the best solution, as many users have complained about blurry images and distortion.  In order to correct the situation for the better, you have to lower the resolution to 640 x 480. </p><p>  PPX4010 does not have a built-in battery, so you can use it only when connected via a USB cable. </p><h2>  Reviews and price </h2><p>  According to reviews, the Philips PPX4010 projector has several significant drawbacks.  The first is the lack of a built-in battery for battery life.  Secondly, the projector is devoid of sound speakers, which makes it difficult to use without external sound sources.  Third, there are no wireless interfaces.  And the fourth is overpriced.  You can buy a pocket projector at the moment for almost 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Aiptek PocketCinema V60 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Projector Aiptek PocketCinema V60" class="if uuid-2293866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2293866.jpg"></div><p>  The last device on this list is the Aiptek PocketCinema V60 Pocket Projector.  Aiptek is well known to many for its developments in the field of mobile projectors.  On the account of the manufacturer is not one successful device, and PocketCinema V60 promises to be no exception. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery and features </h2><p>  The projector is sold in a cardboard box of small sizes.  The configuration of this model is one of the richest in comparison with the previous models described.  Inside there is a control panel, a USB-microUSB cable, an HDMI cable, an OTG cable, for connecting external flash drives, a warranty, instructions, a charger and a nice carrying case. </p><p>  The Aiptek PocketCinema V60 Pocket Projector is equipped with an LED lamp with a power of 50 lumens.  This is not very much, but for a portable device it‚Äôll work.  The service life is designed for 20 thousand hours.  The maximum output resolution is 640 x 480. The picture quality is quite decent. </p><p>  As for the size of the device, it is 65 mm / 22 mm / 135 mm, and the weight is 190 grams.  Of the interesting features of the projector, it is worth noting the presence of many interfaces for connecting, support for remote control, the presence of a slot for a memory card (maximum 32 GB) and a special hole for mounting on a tripod.  Also, do not forget about the presence of a built-in battery.  From full charge, the projector can work up to 2 hours. </p><h2>  Price and customer reviews </h2><p>  According to numerous user reviews, only 2 main disadvantages of the projector can be noted - the device cannot play MKV files and is not able to work with external hard drives.  Otherwise, the Aiptek PocketCinema V60 is a great option for the money.  You can buy a pocket projector for about 20 thousand rubles, but there is one problem - officially the model is not for sale in Russia, only in foreign online stores. </p>
