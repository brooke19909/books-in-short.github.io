    <h2>  What is located next door </h2><p>  The neighbors of the Goryacheklyuchevsky district are Seversky, Tuapse, Absheron, Belorechensky districts and the Republic of Adygea. </p><p>  Upon closer acquaintance with the sights, it seems that you are in the foothills of the Himalayan mountains - in the distance you can see mountains drowning in green trees (occupy 70 percent of the territory), and small cozy houses decorated with carvings.  It is not surprising that the mountainous terrain and the forest have preserved the pristine purity of the air; it is truly healing here.  Plus, to the Black Sea, as they say, is just a stone's throw - just some 60 kilometers.  This explains the saturation of air in the resort area with useful ions.  That is why recreation centers in the Hot Key are everywhere. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hot Key Features </h2><p>  At one time, found many sources of mineral alkaline, sodium, hydrogen sulfide waters.  Probably, the presence of thermal chloride-bicarbonate waters, the temperature of which ranges from + 36 to +60 degrees Celsius, contributed to the emergence of the name - Goryachiy Klyuch.  At the moment, six types of mineral waters with different composition and healing properties are already known.  They are extracted from 17 wells.  If we take in relation to the total volume of mineral water in the Krasnodar Territory, this is almost 80 percent.  This is a clear reason to spend a vacation in the Hot Key for the May holidays. </p>

    <p>  In sanatoria, depending on the type of disease, various methods of treatment with mineral water are practiced.  They can be divided into two main groups: </p><ul><li>  drinking mineral water; </li><li>  various kinds of balneological procedures (bathing or showering, bathing in pools, inhalations, irrigation, washing, etc.). </li></ul><h2>  Famous sanatoriums </h2><p>  In the 70s of the century before last, mineral water healed wounds and restored the health of officers of the Russian army.  Currently, rest in the Hot Key of the Krasnodar Territory attracts all the inhabitants of our country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to dry statistics, each year the Hot Key receives about 80 thousand guests, which can be divided into two categories.  Some travel with the goal of improving their health or getting rid of various chronic ailments in the sanatoriums "Mountain", "Rus", "Emerald", "Foothills of the Caucasus", "Hot Key".  Using a complex of medical procedures, the digestive organs, nervous and cardiovascular systems, musculoskeletal system and gynecological diseases are successfully treated.  All actively used treatment programs developed by medical workers of local health resorts are considered the most effective not only in Russia, but also at the international level.  Another group of visitors chose this place to restore strength and admire nature of the picturesque corner of the Kuban.  It is always a pleasure to spend your holidays in the Hot Key in the forest. </p><p>  It offers comfortable rooms in hotels and mini-hotels.  In the sanatoriums after medical procedures, vacationers have the opportunity to take their leisure time, taking part in various game, entertainment, educational or dance programs.  For children there is a children's playroom and educational activities under the guidance of an experienced teacher. </p><h2>  Climate, weather </h2><p>  Goryachy Klyuch is located in the temperate continental climate zone.  Warm summer days here usually come in May, and cold days in October.  Slightly moist, with the smell of ozone, the air warms up to +28 degrees during this period.  The temperature does not fall below +18 degrees.  The microclimate of the Hot Key resembles Anapa - as many sunny clear days throughout the year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In winter, which is short in this area, the average air temperature ranges from -2 degrees to +4 degrees.  Moreover, the amount of precipitation in the warm period is moderate, and in winter they are even less.  Snow in the Hot Key is generally rare - over the whole winter it can fall 3 or 4 times, and even then it does not stay for long. </p><p>  The summer heat and piercing wind do not penetrate the Goryachiy Klyuch due to the fact that the <span>Caucasus Mountains</span> cover it with a reliable high wall <span>.</span>  Be sure to spend your vacation in the Hot Key, having gone there for the weekend. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  If anyone thinks that springs with mineral water are the only thing worth going to the Goryachiy Klyuch resort, then he is deeply mistaken.  Local delightful sights are presented with such a huge variety that all leisure will be filled with their visit.  They will not leave anyone indifferent.  Locals love to spend their holidays in the Hot Key in the forest, in the mountains, on the beach, etc. </p><p>  The rating of attractions is headed by the Alexander source, which can be found at the foot of the Abadzekh Mountain.  It is considered to be the very first explored source, and the arrangement with subsequent consecration on June 15, 1864 is considered the birthday of the resort town of Goryachiy Klyuch. </p><p>  In the city's Healing Park, the Dantovo Gorge is located - the result of the joint creative work of mother nature and human hands.  In order for the place to gain a civilized appearance, it was necessary to carefully clean the springs supplying water and to ennoble the meadow surrounding the gorge. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to "living water" </h2><p>  In the Healing Park between Kurortnaya and Abadzekhskaya mountains there is a kind of platform called Mineral Glade.  Once upon a time, Psekupsky waters with the smell of hydrogen sulfide came to the surface in abundance.  Learning about their healing properties, local residents and pilgrims created indentations in the soil and filled them with hot mineral water.  In the century before last, city residents and vacationers got the opportunity to use mineral water - it came through laid pipes.  In honor of this event, a monument to ‚Äúliving water‚Äù was erected in the meadow in 1914 (in honor of the 50th anniversary of water development).  At the foot of the mountain you can see the Iveron Chapel cut down by the Cossacks. </p><p>  You can always spend your holidays in the mountains.  Goryachy Klyuch is rich in tourist bases.  You can rent a house of different levels, depending on your finances. </p><h2>  Mountain valleys and the Bridge of Hope </h2><p>  On the southwestern outskirts of the city, on the top of the Abadzekh Mountain, is the Psyfabe fortress.  The name is translated from the local dialect as ‚Äúwarm water‚Äù.  Presumably, the construction of the <span>defensive structure</span> falls on the 9-13th century.  At one time, the fortress was considered an important strategic object, since its mission was to control the narrow passage of the mountain valley - the road along which caravans moved. </p><p>  Rest in the Hot Key can be active and relaxing.  Visit interesting places in the mountains.  For example, the bridge of Hope.  Its name is associated with a story that happened today.  She tells the story of one of the many tourists named Hope.  The girl liked the city and its surroundings so much - healing mineral water, a beautiful forest with clean air - that she changed her initial decision to go to the sea and remained to rest in the Hot Key.  The bridge is a huge suspension structure with a length of 70 meters, which connects the banks of the Psekus River.  The footbridge is held by thick <span>steel ropes.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Chapel and Healing Park </h2><p>  Alley of a thousand pines attracts attention.  It is completely flat, exactly elongated along a straight line, the length of which is 2 km.  Along the entire avenue, thousands of trees are represented by two species: Kokha pine and <span>Pitsunda pine.</span>  In fact, the Healing Park and the resort area begins with the alley, and it ends with the famous Drinking Gallery.  If you live in the Krasnodar Territory, then be sure to spend a vacation in the Hot Key for the May holidays. </p><p>  The staircase of life is a historical monument located between the rock of Salvation and the Zvonka cave, on the slope of the Abadzekh mountain.  A staircase hides behind thick trees.  According to legend, thanks to a stone staircase, criminals managed to escape the death penalty to which the ancient Circassians were sentenced. </p>

    <p>  The Iversky chapel was cut down in a rock by the Cossacks near the Iversky spring of mineral water.  Due to the movement of mountain layers in the 20s of the last century, the source ceased to exist.  As a reminder of him, the Iberian chapel remained.  A bowl shaped like a sea shell confirms the fact that there used to be water.  The icon, like the source, has wonderful healing properties. </p><p>  Everyone will remember a vacation in the Hot Key.  The houses can be rented in the forest zone or in the mountains. </p><h2>  Museum of Local History </h2><p>  This architectural monument appeared in 1864 thanks to the assistance of military official Ivan Deomidovich Popko, who commanded the Psekupsky regiment.  And this is no accident, because he was seriously interested in historical sciences, knew nine foreign languages.  The Hot Spring Museum is the first institution of its kind ever built in the entire Caucasus. </p><p>  Krasnodar Territory was created in order to receive a wellness vacation there.  Goryachiy Klyuch (houses in the forest or in the mountains can always be rented) will please with its picturesque nature. </p>

    <h2>  Adov waterfall </h2><p>  The name sounds icy and mysterious at the same time.  Obviously, local residents have successfully noticed similar features of a work of nature with a terrible dungeon, the Kingdom of the Dead.  A rapid stream falls from a height of 12 meters into a deep bowl, the depth of which is several meters.  The pointed stones scattered along the top of the waterfall give it a frightening and at the same time majestic appearance.  Of course, Adov Falls cannot be compared with Niagara's ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù.  But, nevertheless, the first is an object worthy of attention from many tourists and travelers.  Due to the large number of vacationers, recreation centers in the Hot Key are best booked in advance. </p><h2>  Psekup dolmens </h2><p>  These are 20 stone slab structures.  Therefore, the term "dolmen" is translated from the Celtic language as a "stone table".  It is assumed that they appeared in the Psekups valley around the period of 3-2 centuries <span>BC.</span>  Scientists who have explored some of these ancient man-made piles are wondering how blocks from 3 to 40 tons each could be delivered and built.  After all, they can be reached exclusively by animal tracks.  Holidays in the Hot Key can be with friends or parents, because everyone will like it there. </p><p>  Completes the list of attractions adjacent to the resort town, an area with many cliffs and caves.  If you decide to spend your holidays in the Hot Key for the weekend, be sure to take the children.  Clean air will do them good. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the Hot Key </h2><p>  You can get to the city of Goryachiy Klyuch by means of land and <span>air transport.</span>  There is a road and rail (train) connection to the resort.  Goryachy Klyuch from the capital of the Russian Federation is 1,400 km away.  Since there is no airport in the resort town, you can fly to one of the largest settlements - Gelendzhik or Krasnodar by plane. </p><p>  Goryacheklyuchevskaya railway station is a kind of connecting link between Krasnodar and the Black Sea coast, in particular Tuapse. </p><p>  For those who prefer personal transport, you should choose a route that is connected to the M4-Don highway. </p><p>  Be sure to spend your holidays in the Hot Key, this time you will remember for a long time. </p>
