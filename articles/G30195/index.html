Now everyone can do this as soon as possible without much effort. </p><h2>  What is ILS? </h2><p>  First of all, let's try to find out what constitutes a personal account in the Pension Fund.  So, this is an account that is assigned to all, without exception, Russian citizens who have registered with the Pension Fund.  As soon as they have done this, they are immediately assigned a certain account number for the rest of their lives and issued an insurance certificate of compulsory pension insurance, which a person should carefully preserve. </p><p>  Unlike a bank account, you do not store your money in an individual personal account in the Pension Fund.  It is necessary only to save certain information, on the basis of which you can calculate your future pension or find out how much pension contributions you are currently receiving.  Therefore, when a working pensioner looks at a printout of an extract from your personal account, he can only see there: </p><ul><li>  the amount of payments and accrued insurance premiums; </li><li>  amount of own pension coefficient; </li><li>  places of work; </li><li>  length of service; </li><li>  the name of the insurer of his personal pension contributions. </li></ul><p>  And of course, if a person works informally, his employer does not make any insurance contributions to the Pension Fund, then there will be no information in the statement, there will also be no insurance experience, which means that the citizen will not receive a pension.  Therefore, in order to avoid such troubles, it is better to work officially and pre-monitor the status of an individual personal account in the Pension Fund. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wsj.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal account pension fund" class="if uuid-2977649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977649.jpg"></div><p>  If a person has already retired, then in the printout from the account he will see only the date of assignment of pension contributions, the size of the insurance pension and the size of the mandatory fixed payment to the insurance pension. </p><h2>  Statement request through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  There are a huge number of ways to find out the status of a personal account in the Pension Fund, but one of the most popular among them is filing a request for an extract from it using Sberbank via the Internet.  To do this, visit Sberbank Online, where you can go from the bank‚Äôs official website using the link on the side or top menu.  Then you should go to the page titled "Statement on the status of the ILS".  Next, click on the link ‚ÄúGet statement‚Äù or ‚ÄúTransaction with PF‚Äù and then we get to the page called ‚ÄúApplication for extract from the PF of the Russian Federation‚Äù, where you will see a confirmation button.  If by this time you no longer want to find out information about the account, it will be enough to click the "Cancel" button, and if you want to continue, you will need to click the "Confirm" button. </p><p>  As soon as you follow this link, you will be on the page where you will see the completed form of your request for the status of the personal account in the Pension Fund.  Next, you will need to check whether everything is filled out correctly there, and click the "Confirm Operation" button.  Further, your request will be processed by the operator, and when the message ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù appears next to your application, you can finally see your account information by clicking on the ‚ÄúView statement‚Äù link on the page titled ‚ÄúStatement on the status of the HUD‚Äù.  If you want to not only view it, but also print it in order to have the necessary information on hand, it will be enough to click the print button, and then the site will display a form on the device‚Äôs screen that can be printed on the printer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Request an extract through a branch of Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="doranlaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal account status in pf" class="if uuid-2977655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977655.jpg"></div><p>  To the question of how to find out about the personal account in the Pension Fund with the help of Sberbank, there is another answer.  It turns out that this can be done by submitting an application to an authorized branch of this bank.  It is worth remembering that far from all branches of Sberbank of Russia you can find out about your account, so the first thing you will need to find out about the location of the point of receipt of applications from insured persons.  To do this, you will need to go to the website of the PF of the Russian Federation, click on the links "About the Pension Fund" and "Pension Fund Branches", and then click on the link whose name matches the name of your district and region.  After that, click on the "About the branch" link, and in the opened submenu, click on the "Application acceptance points" link, after which you can find the addresses of Sberbank branches and select the one that is closest to you at your place of residence. </p><p>  Having found the necessary address to obtain information about the state of an individual personal account in the Pension Fund, we take along a passport and an insurance certificate card and go to the bank office.  There you just have to go to the operator and request the necessary data for any period.  However, it is worth remembering that free information is only provided on data for the last year.  In other cases, you will have to pay the cost of the service to the cashier.  As soon as you do this, they will immediately provide you with a form with all the necessary information, which you can immediately read and which you can dispute if it does not correspond to reality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Request an extract through the Gosuslug website </h2><p>  Another way to obtain an extract on an individual personal account of the Pension Fund is to submit an application on the Unified Portal of State and Municipal Services.  To <span>get an extract</span> using this site, you will first have to register there.  This procedure, however, will take quite a long time, but it is worth it, because on the portal you can find out information not only about your future or current pension, but also order a number of services.  Therefore, it is enough to work once, and then calmly use the site for as long as you like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsshopper.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pensioner's personal account in a pension fund" class="if uuid-2977677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977677.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, to get information about the personal account in the Pension Fund, you should go to the EPMMU website and click the "Register" button there.  Then you will see a field in front of you where you will need to enter your mobile phone number or email address.  At the second stage of registration, you will have to enter your passport data, index, password and insurance account number.  After that, an activation code will be sent to you by mail, which should come within a month, and you can finally enter your personal account on the Gosuslug website, where you can order an extract on the status of your account. </p><h2>  Request for an extract from the Pension Fund </h2><p>  You can check the pensioner's personal account with the <span>Pension Fund</span> by submitting an application to the PF of Russia itself.  This can be done both personally, for this you should come to the Pension Fund department, or by submitting an application by mail, in order to then receive the answer in the same way.  Regardless of how you apply, the first step is to find out the address of your PF Office, for which you will need to go to the fund's official website and determine the exact location there. </p><p>  Next, you should decide whether you have time to go to management or not.  If you have free time, then you will need to take out an insurance certificate and passport, and then go to the PF, where you will apply for a statement of the state of your personal account with the Pension Fund.  After that, the specialist will verify all the data, approve your request, and after 10 days you can safely pick up the document you need in this very office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ntv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal account statement" class="if uuid-2978011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/2978011.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not have time to visit the department, you can find out the status of the personal account in the Pension Fund by sending an application by mail.  To do this, you will first need to make photocopies of your passport and insurance certificate, which are notarized.  Next, you will need to write a statement on the provision of an extract from your personal account, indicate in it the method of receiving the answer (by registered mail or in person in the Pension Fund), put all the documents in an envelope and send it to the Pension Fund.  And then, as in the case of a personal appeal, you will have to wait 10 days, and the statement of the status of your account will be in your hands. </p><h2>  Request a statement from the Pension Fund online </h2><p>  When thinking about how to check your personal account with the Pension Fund, do not forget about the official website of the department, where you can also submit a request for the information you need.  True, in order to use this site, you will need to pre-register on the portal of public services and receive confirmation of registration.  This is not at all difficult, but as a result you can get access to many services and greatly simplify your life. </p><p>  After you register on the Unified portal of state and municipal services, you will get access to your personal account with the personal account of the Pension Fund.  There you will immediately, without submitting an application, clearly see all the necessary information about the insurance experience, places of work, wages and insurance deductions.  You will also find out about what pension savings you have and what contributions you or your employers made as part of the state pension co-financing program.  And most importantly, in your personal account there is a personalized pension calculator with which you can easily find out about the size of your insurance pension. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prioritylifegroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="individual account in a pension fund" class="if uuid-2977642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977642.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional ways to find out the status of your HUD </h2><p>  In addition, you can check your individual personal account in the Pension Fund in several simple ways: </p><ol><li>  You can get all the necessary information once a year from your employer, who will order the accountant to print out a form for you where all your insurance premiums will be indicated. </li><li>  Taking along a passport and an insurance certificate, you can apply for the information you need in the Multifunctional Service Center, where the operator will provide you with all the necessary data. </li><li>  You can find out about your personal account through a credit institution for which the PF of the Russian Federation has insured your pension savings.  This can be done using Internet banks or a terminal, as well as through personal visits to organizations. </li><li>  Moreover, the necessary information can be obtained from the bank, </li></ol><h2>  Information in the ILS </h2><p>  Now that we have figured out how to get a certificate from the personal account of the Pension Fund, let's take a closer look at its contents: </p><ol><li>  Above on the first page your initials and date of birth will be indicated. </li><li>  Your insurance number will be displayed immediately below them. </li><li>  Following you will be able to see the pension option you have chosen and see the number of pension points you have earned, which is your individual pension coefficient. </li><li>  Next will be one section with your insurance premiums paid since 2015, and another section with your premiums paid until 2015. </li><li>  Here you will see information about the place of your work and the name of your employer. </li><li>  The third section will contain all the data about your formed pension savings, which are displayed if you transfer additional funds to a funded pension. </li></ol><h2>  Pension amount </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the section of the individual personal account in the Pension Fund, where the amount of the pension received by the pensioner will be indicated.  This section appears on the account statement only after the person retires.  At this moment, a line appears at number 5, where it says what date the pension was established for you.  Next, under it there will be a line where the type of insurance pension is indicated - for old age, disability or loss of a breadwinner.  Here you can also see information about the pension accruals themselves, since the total amount of the pension, the amount of its fixed payment, and the amount of the insurance pension are indicated there.  This information will allow you to find out how much you receive and make sure that all charges are made to you correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesstoday.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="state of an individual personal account in a pension fund" class="if uuid-2977689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977689.jpg"></div><p>  We should also mention the size of the pension of a working pensioner.  For those people who have already retired by age, but continue to work, the statement from the personal account will indicate what pension a person would receive if he had not worked.  Thus, a pensioner will immediately understand whether it is profitable for him to continue to work or is it better to quit and live on pension savings. </p><h2>  Add missing information to the HUD </h2><p>  If, after checking the status of an individual personal account in the Pension Fund, you find that some of the data there is not true or there is no information about your insurance premiums, then this should be immediately corrected.  To do this, you need to collect all the documents that confirm the information that you want to add to your account, and take it to the Pension Fund located at your place of residence.  If you can‚Äôt take them personally, you can send them to the address of the office, having previously certified the supporting documents with a notary. </p><p>  Where can I get documents that could supplement the missing information that you did not see when you looked at the personal account information of the Pension Fund?  The answer is very simple.  To obtain information about your place of work before 2002, you should contact the former employer, who will have to provide you with all copies of documents related to your activity, that is, a copy of the entry in the work book, an order to transfer to another job, or an order to dismissal, as well as a certificate of salary and all insurance charges.  If the company you worked for was liquidated and you cannot contact the former employer in any way, then the necessary documents can be obtained from the archival organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiplinger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="certificate from an individual personal account" class="if uuid-2977646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46461/2977646.jpg"></div><p>  It should also be remembered that if you saw incomplete data on the length of service, places of work and insurance premiums in your personal account, they can be supplemented by handing to the operator an employee from the Pension Fund documents such as: </p><ul><li>  a work book of a standard form; </li><li>  a written employment contract that you entered into with your employer; </li><li>  extract from various orders concerning your employment, dismissals, transfers to another position or other place of service; </li><li>  payroll statement. </li></ul>
