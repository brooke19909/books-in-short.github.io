Under the new rules, enterprises began reporting in 2016.  The government not only introduced a new report, but also found a way to stimulate violators.

    <p>  Reporting was developed in order to strengthen control over the correctness and completeness of tax payments by enterprises.  The document contains information on accruals and payments for all employees of the organization.  Tax agents are enterprises that pay salaries to employees.  They provide reporting to the Federal Tax Service at the location. </p><p>  The document can be submitted in print and in electronic form.  But only companies with up to 25 employees have this right to choose.  All other organizations have to report electronically.  The date of submission of the report is: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the day the printed report was submitted to the Federal Tax Service Inspectorate or the day the letter was sent by mail; </li><li>  the day of receipt of the confirmation of sending the electronic document. </li></ul><h2>  Features 6-PIT </h2><p>  The report is filled in every quarter.  Part of the information is entered in an incremental way.  The branches of the company generate the report separately, but the control ratio of 6-personal income tax is verified for all employees of the organization. </p><p>  It is in this report that most often carry-over balances of salaries.  There is a difference between the dates of payment of income and <span>tax deduction.</span>  Especially if the first days of the new month fall on weekends. </p><p>  The 6-personal income tax report also differs from others in that the information entered into it can subsequently be compared with other reports.  The tax information specified in the first three paragraphs of the document is checked during a field audit.  This does not mean that you can not follow the correctness of filling in the data.  On the contrary, you should first develop and create a control system for automatically filling out documents.  Organizations face fines and penalties for under-taxing organizations.  Therefore, it is so important to find control ratios for checking the form of 6-NDFL.  Let us consider in more detail how to do this. </p>

    <h2>  How to check the control ratio of 6-personal income tax? </h2><p>  First of all, the reporting date is checked.

    <h2>  Features of filling out the report </h2><p>  In 6-personal income tax reflects information on the accrued and withheld tax amount.  Deductions should be filled in on an accrual basis, like all values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom Section 1 of the report.  That is, in the calculation for 9 months, the tax amount from January to September is indicated.  If the tax is calculated at differentiated rates, then for each row 010-050 is filled out on separate sheets, and on page 060-090 the total amount is indicated on the first page of the report.  Unlike receipts and deductions, the deduction amount is indicated without cents.  The report simply does not have the required number of cells. </p><p>  When filling out a report, agents often make a serious mistake - indicate the same amount of tax charged (p. 040) and withheld (p. 070).  This situation is possible if both operations are performed in the same reporting period.  The difference arises when salaries for the current quarter are issued to employees in the next quarter.  On page 040 the amount of the accrued salary will be indicated, taking into account tax, and on page 070 - ‚Äú0‚Äù will be indicated, since it is necessary to withhold personal income tax when paying income. </p><h2>  Example 1 </h2><p>  With September payroll tax is withheld on September 30.  Employees receive income 10.10.  How then to issue a report for 9 months? </p><p>  Page  020 - accrued salary for September. </p><p>  Page  040 - accrued personal income tax. </p><p>  On page 070 the amount from page 040 does not fall because income has not yet been paid.  For the same reason, Section 2 is not completed. </p><p>  When filling out the annual calculation, the amount of September deductions should be reflected both on page 070 and in Section 2: </p><ul><li>  Page  100 - date of issue of salary - 30.09. </li><li>  Page  110 - deductions - 10.10. </li><li>  Page  120 - the last day for the transfer of personal income tax - 06.10. </li><li>  Page  130 - the amount of salary accrued for September. </li><li>  Page  140 - withholding tax on income. </li></ul><p>  Another important nuance.  The carrying tax amount cannot be shown on line 080. The amount of the fee that the agent could not withhold is entered here.  This situation occurs if the income is issued in kind.  How are 6-personal income tax control ratios applied?  Line 070 and line 090 should not exceed the total amount of transfers to the budget for the year.  In case of violation of this coefficient, the tax authorities will conclude that not the entire amount of the fee was transferred to the budget. </p>

    <h2>  Example 3 </h2><p>  We supplement the conditions of the previous example.  In addition to the salary and sick leave, the employee received <span>on September 15</span> vacation pay in the amount of 15 thousand rubles, from which a fee of 1.95 thousand rubles was deducted. </p><p>  Section 1 is also filled by summing up all the amounts: </p><p>  Page  020 - 1000 + 10 + 15 = 1025 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Page  040 - 130 + 1.3 + 1.95 = 133.25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Page  070 - 130 + 1.3 + 1.95 = 133.25 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The term for paying tax on vacation pay and sick leave is the last day of the month.  However, the moment of receipt of income is different.  Therefore, Section 2 is populated with two blocks.  The first was introduced earlier.  Now we‚Äôll enter the vacation information in the report: </p><p>  Page  100 - payout September 15th. </p><p>  Page  110 - September 15 retention. </p><p>  Page  120 - September 30 tax payment. </p><p>  Page  130 - the amount of accruals 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Page  140 - Personal income tax 1.95 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Example 4 </h2><p>  Now, consider the situation when an employee passed a disability certificate on September 29, and the payment was made on October 5.  How to fill out a declaration?  There will be no changes in Section 1 of the report for the third quarter.  Section 2 will indicate the date of accrual (05.10) and the due date for personal income tax payment (30.10). </p>

    <h2>  How to account for surcharges? </h2><p>  The organization may provide employees with a one-time vacation supplement.  These accruals should be reflected in the report.  The date of transfer of funds is the date the income is paid (p. 100).  Deductions are made at the time of payment of income, and transfers - the maximum on the next day. </p><p>  Example.  The organization paid 22 thousand rubles.  employee 23.08.  On the same day, a tax of 2.8 thousand rubles was withheld.  We reflect this in the report: </p><ul><li>  Page  August 100 - 23. </li><li>  Page  110 - August 23. </li><li>  Page  August 120 - 23. </li><li>  Page  130 - 22 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Page  140 - 2.8 thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  How to fill out a zero declaration </h2><p>  If the organization or individual entrepreneur does not have employees, then the company does not report.  This is also the case if the organization sent employees on vacation or stopped activities.  Another thing if there are gaps in the calculation of income.  For example, in the first half of the year the enterprise did not accrue income, and in the second half it accrued.  In this case, reporting for 3 and 6 months is not necessary, but for 9 and 12 months it is mandatory.  To avoid problems with regulatory authorities, even in this situation, some enterprises prefer to write letters and provide zero reporting for the first half of the year. </p><p>  The reporting deadlines are standard - the last day of the month following the reporting one.  In 2017, these are: </p><ul><li>  May 2 - to submit a report for the first quarter; </li><li>  June 31 - to submit a half-year report; </li><li>  October 30 - to submit a report for the third quarter. </li></ul><p>  How to fill out a report?
