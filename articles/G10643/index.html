Once, in ancient times, it was the main port of the state in the Mediterranean.  The history of the city begins during the reign of Egyptian kings and Roman power.  Today, in Jaffa, mainly an Arabic-speaking population lives.  In addition, the city itself is currently already included in Tel Aviv.  Jaffa (Israel) allows you to relax from the hectic modern life, as well as get acquainted with local attractions.  It offers a wonderful view of the sea.  In the suburbs you can find many cozy restaurants and cafes, atmospheric narrow streets and architectural monuments.  All this creates a unique flavor of the seaside Jaffa.  What else is this town famous in Israel for?  We will tell about his legends and sights in this publication. </p>

    <h2>  Legends of the city </h2><p>  Several legends are associated with Jaffa (Israel), a photo of which you can see below.  Some explain the name of the city, while others are talking about the history of local attractions.  So, there are several options for the origin of the word "Jaffa."  According to one version of the legend, the name comes from the name of Yaphet, who was the son of the biblical Noah.  According to ancient Greek myths, some associate the history of the word with Andromeda's mother, called Cassiopeia.  However, in our time, the most reliable option seems to be that the name was borrowed from the old Hebrew language.  And the word is translated as "beautiful." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a belief that if a person touches his zodiac symbol on the local bridge of desires, and then looks into the distance, his dream will come true. </p><h2>  How to get to Jaffa from Tel Aviv? </h2><p>  From the central part of Tel Aviv, you can take a taxi here.  Before Jaffa, it will cost from 30 to 40 ILS.  Alternatively, you can reach by public transport.  For example, from bus station Hahagan or central station Merkazit bus number 46. The fare will cost 13 ILS.  Minibus taxi number 16 will take you to the promenade, from where you will need to take a little more walk to the old suburb.  It‚Äôs best to go to the station called Arlozorov. </p><p>  There is also another option: to walk along the coast from the central part of Tel Aviv to Jaffa.  But this is relevant only for those who do not seem burdensome to walk as much as 2.5 km. </p>

    <h2>  Old and New Town </h2><p>  Jaffa is divided into two parts.  This is the Old and New City.  Most of all, tourists like the very first part, where you can admire famous architectural monuments, visit galleries and interesting shops.  Mostly, this is the west of Jephet Street, which is located on a hill.  From here you can see the sea coast.  The new part of the city is located in the east of the same street.  You can ride a bus here, but most often travelers prefer to walk on foot to see the sights, and go only to the suburbs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  For the first time the city is mentioned in sources that existed before BC.  e.  For example, Jaffa is found in chronicles from the time of the pharaoh of Egypt named Thutmose III. </p><p>  There are legends that it was in these parts of Noah that the legendary ark was built, and that King Solomon arranged the supply of wood in order to build the famous First Temple in the future.  It was he who was the only place permitted at that time in which the faithful Jews could pray.  The present <span>Wailing Wall</span> is the remnants of the Second Temple, which has survived in this form to the present.  For a long period of time, Jaffa obeyed Rome, then Egypt (including during the time of Cleopatra), the Arabs, and Napoleon also visited this city. </p><p>  Obviously, it is precisely because of the ongoing wars and conquests that the historical appearance of these places has been lost.  However, what has come down to us is culturally valuable.  At first, Tel Aviv was considered a suburb, but later it was it that became the center, and the old city entered in 1949 into a single settlement. </p>

    <h2>  Jaffa, <span>Israel: sights</span> that deserve the attention of everyone </h2><p>  In the 90s, a large-scale restoration was carried out here, galleries and theaters, shops and cafes were opened, several streets were made for pedestrians.  Old Jaffa (Israel) has become an atmospheric romantic suburb on the coast.  The city has a lot of historical and cultural attractions that attract the attention of many tourists and even pilgrims. </p><p>  For example, the Al-Bahr mosque, which appeared in the artist‚Äôs painting by the name Lebrun in the last third of the 17th century.  She is the oldest operating in this village.  The clock square is famous for the picturesque clock tower, which was built in 1906, and this was done in honor of Abdul-Hamid the Second.  He was later overthrown during the events of the Young Turk revolution. </p><p>  Most of the archaeologists found in the area lay in the land of Jaffa Hill.  Here the Egyptian gate was restored, whose age is estimated at 3,500 years.  The house of the XVIII period, which was built on the remains of the fortress structure of the Crusaders, today houses a local museum. </p>

    <h2>  Orthodox Church of St. Peter </h2><p>  In Jaffa, there is a Russian church, which is subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate.  The temple was built on the land, which was bought with the assistance of A. Kapustin (archimandrite) in the second half of the 19th century. </p><p>  But even before the construction of the church on this site there was a house for wanderers, in which pilgrims professing Orthodoxy were received. </p><p>  The walls of the temple are painted with scenes from the life of saints.  For example, the level of the choirs and the top of the altar pillars are decorated with images of ten of the twelve apostles, and the rest of the church with paintings of Paul and Peter. </p><p>  Excavations in the garden zone, led by the archimandrite and architect from Jerusalem K. Shik, helped to find the burial place of the righteous Tabitha, which preserved mosaics from the Byzantine period of 5-6 centuries.  Subsequently, a chapel was built over this place. </p>

    <h2>  Catholic Church </h2><p>  In Jaffa (Israel) St. Peter's Church was built not only by Orthodox.  There is also the Catholic Church of the <span>Order of the Franciscans.</span>  It was built in the 17th century.  Then, over a hundred years later, the temple was destroyed, and subsequently two more times restored. </p><p>  The church was given a modern look in the period 1888-1894, and the last repair dates back to 1903. </p><p>  Today the temple is open every day.  Services are held in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Spanish, Latin, and many others.  The church is visited by a large number of workers from Poland who come here on Saturday (that is, on weekends). </p><p>  The facade of the temple has a bright orange color, and the bell tower is distinguished by a high height.  That is why St. Peter's churches are, in a way, landmarks in the ancient suburbs. </p><p>  Apart from murals with the righteous Tabitha and Francis of Assisi, many stained glass windows of the temple depict scenes from the life of saints from Spain.  This is due to the fact that the current building was built with the money of this particular country.  The Church of St. Peter the Apostle includes territory with the ruins of a 13th-century St. Louis fortress. </p><p>  There is evidence that it was here that Napoleon himself made a stop during the Egyptian campaigns. </p><p>  The temple was built on this site because Old Jaffa means a lot to Christians around the world.  Here, according to legend, the righteous Tabitha (or Tabitha, as they call it), who was a disciple of Jesus Christ, was resurrected by Saint Peter. </p>
