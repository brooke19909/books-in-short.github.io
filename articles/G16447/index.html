  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Such an unforgettable and impressive vacation in Egypt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Egypt is one of the most popular resort countries where thousands of tourists come to rest every year.  What is most attractive in this country is hard to say, because all tourists are different, as well as their tastes.  One thing is for sure: everyone in Egypt, even the most sophisticated traveler, will be able to spend a good vacation. </p><p>  Sometimes you can hear that Egypt is interesting only when you visit it for the first time.  Subsequent trips around this country are completely devoid of pleasant moments and interesting discoveries.  Probably, this is the opinion of one who could not feel the life of this country, or absolutely did not want to do it.  In fact, it may take years to learn all of Egypt to unravel all its secrets.  Therefore, do not think that the <span>next vacation</span> spent in this country will be completely spoiled. If you decide to spend your vacation in Egypt, then be prepared to perceive a lot of information, a review of the most amazing places, sleepless nights, etc.  In this country, you are unlikely to be bored, because what others were able to get to know you have yet to discover. </p><p>  Many tourists are waiting for the time when it will be possible to book last-minute trips to Egypt.  Nevertheless, I want to save money and, nevertheless, vacationers in this country are full all year round.  And a fabulously warm climate contributes to this.  When winter conjures in other countries, the sun shines in Egypt and a light breeze blows. </p><p>  Holidays in Egypt are suitable for people of any social status and age.  Here, all conditions have been created so that vacationers remember every day of their stay in the country.  Of course, I want to understand why rest in Egypt is so attractive?  First of all, the opportunity to swim enough in the Red Sea and sunbathe on one of the many beaches.  But, you must admit that this is not enough to have a great time.  In addition, each tourist can go on an unforgettable trip to local attractions.  You, of course, have heard of the Egyptian <span>Pyramids at Giza</span> and the Great Sphinx.  Then be sure to visit them, because they are real treasures of ancient civilization.  Also among the country's most visited attractions include the Luxor Museum, Mount Moses, <span>Faros Lighthouse,</span> Aswan Dam, Valley of the Kings, Tomb of Tutankhamun, <span>Karnak Temple,</span> Monastery of St.  Catherine and much more.  Interesting places, buildings and historical sites can be found in almost any corner of the country. </p><p>  When there is a slight overwork from excursions, you can go to conquer the local nature.  Recently, cruises along the Nile River, which has been the main breadwinner of the Egyptians for several centuries, have been very popular.  Also, everyone can go diving, prove themselves in windsurfing or feel real adrenaline while riding jeeps on Safari.  Or maybe you like hiking, then go on an expedition to interesting sites in Egypt.  At night, life also does not stop boiling, especially in large cities.  Nightclubs, discos and bars will come in handy for young people, and restaurants, quiet cafes and cinema halls will give a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions and impressions to young couples, newlyweds and couples. </p><p>  Unforgettable holidays will be given by local hotels.  It is with them that the journey around the country begins.  The rooms have a high level of comfort and are equipped with everything that can be useful to vacationers.  Most hotels have their own beaches and even spa salons.  By the way, very special special last-minute tours to Egypt are organized specifically for those who want to treat themselves to modern spa treatments. </p><p>  Rest in Egypt is difficult to forget.  Anyone who has visited this country at least once wants to return here again.  Nevertheless, there is so little vacation in order to discover all the secrets and secrets of this country. </p>
