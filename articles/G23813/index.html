One of them is high technology.  This is a parameter that is used in production in the development of products and equipment.  Read more about this in this article. </p><h2>  High technology is an important component of modern production </h2><p>  This indicator is used to reflect the proportion that exists between production and scientific and technical activity in the form of the amount of expenses that are spent on scientific development in terms of a unit of goods or services.  This parameter is quantified.  Also, high technology can be represented as the ratio of the number of employees engaged in research activities to the total number of production personnel in the enterprise or even in the whole industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="high technology is" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/1204686.jpg" width="575"></div>  So, high technology can be determined by the number of costs that are allocated to research, by their ratio to the volume of sales of goods.  There is a tendency towards an increase in the proportion of <span>intellectual labor</span> to the cost of production.  Therefore, we can say that high technology is one of the important indicators of the competitiveness of manufactured goods or provided services.

    <h2>  The Importance of High Technology </h2><p>  As you may have noticed, the areas presented above can greatly simplify life.  All of them are the results of scientific research.  It should be noted that their use is not mandatory, but think about how difficult it will be to go for water to the nearest well?  Or what will be the efficiency of agriculture if you have to dig everything up with shovels, not tractors?  High technology is an important parameter that allows an increasing number of people to simplify physical labor with the help of progressive developments.  Theoretically, in the future it will be possible to achieve that most human resources will be directed to scientific or cultural delights.  Accordingly, science and technology will significantly improve the lives of the inhabitants of the planet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to calculate high technology? </h2><p>  This question was casually covered a little earlier.  But let's dwell in more detail on the definition of high technology industries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knowledge factor" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/1204688.jpg" width="600"></div>  So, for this, a set of parameters such as: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  The cost of research and development in relation to the volume of <span>production of commodity</span> or <span>gross output.</span>  Also, the produced <span>national income</span> and the volume of goods shipped can be used as a comparative parameter. </li><li>  The number of specialists who are engaged in research and those who help them in relation to the total number of people involved in this industry. </li><li>  The cost of research to the amount used for production and industrial personnel and the volume of fixed assets of the industry that are involved in the manufacture of products. </li></ol><p>  According to the results of research in our country, methods are most often used, where the sums that are sent for searches are put at the forefront.  This indicator is paired either with a price basis, or with the number and qualifications of personnel.  In the final analysis, combination methods are often used to get the best possible result. </p><h2>  Nuances of high technology </h2><p>  Quantity does not always lead to quality.  The knowledge-intensive factor, of course, is important in order to assess the state of affairs in production, but it is not decisive.  It must be remembered that people differ in their character, pace of work, knowledge, talents and other parameters, and characteristics.  Also, luck can play a certain effect: it is worth recalling the detection of x-ray radiation.  Therefore, one does not have to be sure of obtaining the same result with identical characteristics. </p><h2>  In more detail about the knowledge-intensive factor </h2><p>  They recall him, as a rule, speaking of the latest industries.  They, in turn, gravitate towards large scientific centers, which are large cities.  As a result, something new arose.  These are specialized <span>cities of science:</span> technoparks and technopolises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="research results" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/1204689.jpg" width="600"></div>  They completely carry out the technological chain, starting from <span>basic research,</span> ending with the sale of invented products.  Let's take a closer look at the main subjects: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  Technopark.  This is the name for the agglomeration of high-tech firms that group around a university, institute, or laboratory.  The main objective of these forms of organization is to reduce the time for which scientific ideas are put into practice. </li><li>  Technopolis.  In this way, they call an integrated research and production town, which was specially built to engage in advanced technologies, training of specialized personnel and high-tech industries. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, high technology is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of the economy.  Of course, this option does not solve all problems on its own.  It should be noted that research in some areas of science is not carried out due to the fact that they are too costly and do not entail quick profits.  Therefore, developments in such areas lie mainly on the shoulders of the state. </p>
