The amount of RAM is increasing, the capabilities of the processor and display are growing, and the physical amount of data on the disk is expanding.  All these changes occur evenly, so we do not notice them.  However, it is enough to conduct an elementary comparison to understand: over the past few years, smartphones have become "smarter" by dozens of times.  And what used to seem like science fiction turned out to be a reality today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap mobile phones" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063668.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Along with the growth of opportunities, the availability of smartphones also increases, and their price decreases.  Today, if you get cheap mobile phones, you will notice that they can solve much more problems than they did in previous years.  And, accordingly, the capabilities of the user with such gadgets also increase significantly. </p><p>  Since the Chinese industry is currently the undisputed leader among low-cost mobile devices, we will devote this article to describing Chinese cheap mobile phones, as well as some models of manufacturers from other countries. </p><h2>  Price quality </h2><p>  First of all, it should be said that inexpensive devices can be such for two reasons.  The first is the low build quality, as well as materials and modules used in the construction of the smartphone.  The second is the cropped functionality of the model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want your phone to be capable of a lot, but do not want to overpay, you should pay attention to cheap mobile phones from Chinese developers. </p><p>  This, for example, brand Lenovo, Zopo, Elephone, ZTE, as well as many less popular (or nameless) companies.  They differ in that they have quite serious technical specifications: a powerful 8-core processor, a 16 megapixel camera, and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap mobile phones in moscow" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063669.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  Most of these devices, of course, have "fake" data for the reason that even the flagships do not equip such a "stuffing".  This is difficult because of the difficult layout of such devices, and because of the inability to optimize the smartphone properly. </p><p>  Chinese cheap mobile phones are of poor quality, which is why it would be foolish to expect stability from them.  Some models released by the manufacturers listed above are unstable, so we would not recommend buying such a device. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  The second indicator that could be sacrificed if you are interested in cheap mobile phones is a set of functions.  A smartphone, simply put, will be "dumber", will not be able to perform a number of additional functions, but at the same time its work will be more stable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These include keyboard devices that are not equipped with a touch screen.  An example is Fly phones.  They have a low cost, somewhat truncated functionality, but show excellent performance in terms of reliability.  Old but cheap Nokia mobile phones demonstrate the same thing. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In fact, customer recommendations can‚Äôt be a great advisor on which cheap mobile phones to buy.  In Moscow and in some city remote from the center, the concept of ‚Äúcheap‚Äù will differ.  And already because of this, you will not be able to properly find for yourself a really budget gadget.  Indeed, property inequality continues to exist today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spb cheap mobile phones" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We can only say in general that there are reviews about ‚Äútricked out‚Äù but affordable devices (like Chinese devices) in which buyers complain about the lack of the ability to adequately interact with the smartphone.  The latter can, for example, suddenly lose a signal, show a software failure, "go crazy."  This is a fee for the desire to use a host of functions on a device that is positioned in the lower price segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another thing is the reviews of the "wooden" (in terms of functions), but reliable devices.  Such gadgets are really praised for their accessibility and stability at work, which their owners are chasing. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  It is impossible to say that there are a number of companies that produce extremely cheap products.  Most developers produce a line of devices that occupies its niches in different classes.  Take at least cheap Samsung mobile phones.  There is a whole set of models with different screens, technical specifications and, of course, cost, which simply attract buyers from different groups.  And so the concern makes sales. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap samsung mobile phones" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the context of this issue, one might recall companies such as teXet or Wexler.  These are domestic technological brands that are trying to position themselves as "our product", although in fact they are assembled spare parts from China.  So, speaking of these brands, we can call them exclusively budget. </p><p>  In general, most developers are trying to take as much space as possible in the electronics market. </p><h2>  Elephone g4 </h2><p>  One of the most popular are smartphones under the specified brand.  According to official figures, they are among the ten leaders in sales in the US market.  And the G4 smartphone contributed to this, not least. </p><p>  The gadget has a 4-core processor (clocked at up to 1.3 GHz), a colorful display (1280 by 790 pixels) with a diagonal of 5 inches, and an 8-megapixel camera.  These parameters can be considered quite high, given the cost of the model at $ 80.  Reviews say that for such a price the phone is fully justified. </p><h2>  iNew V1 </h2><p>  Another interesting ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù, possessing an extravagant design in the Lumia style, also boasts a similar processor, 1 GB of RAM and a display with a resolution of 854 by 400 pixels.  The cost of a smartphone is only $ 100, due to which it is incredibly high in demand.  According to reviews, the device can not be called stable, since during its operation there are some problems with the screen and camera.  Often you can notice the so-called "friezes" (freezes). </p><h2>  THL T6S </h2><p>  The model from THL can be called more modest.  Based on the stated technical parameters, it can be noted that the device has only a 5-megapixel camera and a simple processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  Of course, this gadget will not be able to work with serious, demanding (in terms of graphics) games, but at least it is capable of performing basic daily tasks.  Reviews call it an everyday smartphone that costs just $ 90. </p><h2>  Cheap nokia </h2><p>  Of course, each (with the exception of some) brands have their own cheap and expensive models.  The Finnish Nokia has, for example, keyboard models 105 and 130, 108 and 215. These devices are designed to make calls and listen to music, so their characteristics are unlikely to be interesting to anyone (imagine a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cheap nokia mobile phones" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063672.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about touch-sensitive phones, we can recall the Lumia 515 model with 512 MB of RAM, a 1.2 GHz processor, a 854 by 480 screen and a 5-megapixel camera. </p><h2>  Cheap samsung </h2><p>  If we talk about affordable Samsung, first of all we should mention the keyboards E1200 and E1202, followed by the Galaxy Star G350.  The smartphone has the same 512 MB of RAM, a 480 by 800 screen, and a processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  In fact, this is a similar set of characteristics, but a little more expensive device (compared to Nokia). </p><p>  Following the described can be called, for example, Galaxy J1 (the same parameters, but there is a front camera), Galaxy J1 Ace (a slightly more powerful processor), Galaxy Core Prime.  Buying these smartphones can only be advised for calls and a minimum set of tasks.  They will fail if you try to install more serious software. </p><h2>  Other models </h2><p>  In addition to the above, there are many other budget models.  For example: Fly IQ239, Bravis Jazz, <span>Alcatel One Touch</span> 4009, Keneksi Apollo and many others.  In fact, their parameters differ among themselves not so widely.  The big difference is cost and design.  Reviews confirm this - people speak negatively about these gadgets if they are overloaded. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Should I buy cheap devices?  Of course, given that you can easily save where possible.  How to make the right choice and buy a really worthwhile device?  Refer to the various search tools available on the network (in St. Petersburg cheap mobile phones can be found, for example, even at local bulletin boards) </p><p>  For example, we can talk about reviews and comments that <span>accompany the product.</span>  Also do not forget about the reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese cheap mobile phones" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/1063673.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you buy a cheap but keyboard device, you are likely to be satisfied working with such an affordable gadget.  He will be your reliable assistant.  It needs to be charged once a week, because it does not attract him to contact every minute.  Such a phone is ideal for children, for example, who can always lose their gadget.  In this case, it will not be so pathetic as an expensive smartphone. </p><p>  The second option is to buy a touch but inexpensive gadget.  You can read mail with it, sometimes upload some primitive pages on the Internet, check social networks.  But at the same time, the main features of the phone - calls, SMS and instant messages (WhatsApp, Viber) can seriously ‚Äúslow down‚Äù. </p><p>  If you are ready - make your choice and determine how inexpensive you would like a phone.  After that, boldly go to the store and make a purchase. </p>
