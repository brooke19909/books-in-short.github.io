Features of this procedure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the onset of warm days, a huge number of people go out of town to do summer cottages and relax in the lap of nature.  Moreover, not everyone remembers that in the spring there is a very high probability of being bitten by a tick - this sometimes leads to very disastrous consequences in the form of various health disorders.  The safety in the forest should be remembered by tourists, mushroom pickers and just vacationers who wanted to fry barbecue in the fresh air.  Unfortunately, these categories more often than others fall prey to a dangerous insect. </p><h2>  Use caution </h2><p>  It is at the end of spring that maximum caution should be exercised, since ticks multiply actively during this period.  However, this does not mean that vigilance should be less in other months: an insect can infect you, starting in April and ending in October. </p>

    <p>  It is important to remember that the tick acts very carefully: you do not even feel that it is on the skin.  At the same time, you will not experience any pain symptoms either, as there are anesthetic components in the insect's saliva that dull the sensitivity.  As a result, a person becomes infected with <span>tick-borne encephalitis,</span> and in most cases it is extremely difficult to cure this ailment.  It must be emphasized that the treatment process itself is quite expensive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  Of course, everyone wants to reduce to zero the risks of meeting a tick and avoid the cost of <span>treating encephalitis.</span>  To minimize the likelihood of being infected with a dangerous insect, today many resort to a procedure such as tick insurance. </p>

    <p>  What is its meaning?  Everything is very simple.  You go to the insurance company and buy from her a special policy that is valid for a certain period of time.  If during this period you suffer from <span>a tick bite,</span> then you will be provided with free medical care in one of the clinics.  In this case, the contract separately prescribes which particular institution should serve the client.  Thus, a program such as tick insurance implies that the victim will receive <span>medical care</span> in an institution that is professionally involved in seroprophylaxis.  There, the patient will be helped to extract the tick, and then he will be prescribed a course of treatment. </p><h2>  The specifics of the insurance program </h2><p>  It should be noted that today tick insurance is a fairly relevant and popular program, which is offered by many insurers.  Moreover, it is also available for citizens with a low income level.  Today, a program such as tick insurance, which costs an average of 200 rubles, is necessary for almost everyone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, one must remember that depending on the amount of the contract, the set of services rendered will also be different. </p>

    <p>  For example, the cheapest tick insurance will include a one-time immunization.  If the client chooses a more expensive program, then after the insured event he can count not only on the full course of immunization, but also on therapeutic procedures, and if the disease progresses, then on all the medications necessary for treatment. </p><p>  Currently, you can insure yourself or apply for one policy at once for all family members. </p><h2>  What should I look for when applying for an insurance policy? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that tick bite insurance is a necessary and relevant procedure, you should not rush into the choice of a particular program.  First of all, you need to discuss all the nuances and subtleties with an insurance agent. </p><p>  Today, many companies offer tick insurance for children.  Choosing such programs, one should not choose the cheapest ones, since it is impossible to save on children's health. </p>

    <p>  Carefully analyze all clauses of the contract, as some employees of insurance companies deliberately embellish one or another program called "Tick Bite Insurance".  Particular attention should be paid to the clauses of the contract, which will be discussed below. </p><h2>  Insurance Amount </h2><p>  This paragraph indicates how much money the insurer will spend on treatment.  In some cases, company employees guarantee the maximum amount of medical care and rehabilitation, however, a fairly small amount of money is fixed in the contract.  Naturally, it is hardly possible to receive the promise for such money.  In order to avoid possible disputes and conflict situations in this regard, it is better to analyze the cost of the immunization procedure and all necessary medications in advance. </p><h2>  Service list </h2><p>  From the contract you must clearly understand what kind of help you are entitled to rely on in the event of an insured event.  Moreover, if the contract states that you are entitled to only one-time immunization, then you can‚Äôt count on anything more, even if the amount of insurance is astronomically large for you. </p><h2>  Appendix - an integral part of the contract </h2><p>  Remember that tick bite insurance must be issued with all the necessary applications. </p>

    <p>  They should clearly state in which medical institutions in case of infection with the virus you will be assisted.  Of course, it will be good if they are located not far from your home, and you should pay attention to this fact first of all when choosing one or another program.  It will be useful to make sure that the insurance company has entered into a contract with a medical institution in which the patient will undergo treatment. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Pay attention to what territory the policy covers.  Do not forget that while providing a service such as tick bite insurance, some companies cover the whole country, while others only cover certain regions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Take care of buying <span>tick insurance</span> in advance so that trouble does not take you by surprise.  Do not forget about vaccination. </p>
