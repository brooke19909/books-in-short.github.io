Russian tourists are not very familiar with a country whose people created the greatest empire, although recently it has become increasingly attractive to foreigners. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the southern part of the state, lying on both sides of the equator, is the exotic town of Cuenca (Ecuador), based on the site of the ancient settlement of Tumebamba - the main center of Inca civilization.  Cuenca, located at an altitude of 2500 meters above sea level, is very close to the clouds.  No one knows what it looked like until the Incas settled on the land on which the Indians lived since the X century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuenca Ecuador life reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946351.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that they completely rebuilt the village in the 16th century, and from 1557 its history begins.  A few decades later, Spanish invaders arrived here, remaking the city in their own way and giving it a modern name, which translates as "river basin". </p><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Despite being close to the equator, the pearl of Ecuador, surrounded by mountains, cannot boast of hot weather.  The mild Mediterranean climate prevails here, which will not present tourists with unpleasant surprises.  The city is pretty cool: during the day the air warms up to 22 ¬∞ C, and at night the temperature drops to 11 ¬∞ C. The comfortable climate of Cuenca (Ecuador) without the sweltering heat will appeal to tourists who want to travel a lot on foot, exploring the surroundings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often people come here from July to December, when there is no rainfall, and the wet season in the "city of eternal spring" begins in January and lasts until June. </p><h2>  Cuenca, Ecuador: detailed information </h2><p>  One of the most colorful cities in the country, whose population is 400 thousand people, will plunge into the colonial era and get to know the medieval buildings better.  Ancient Cuenca (Ecuador) is a place where modernity is surprisingly combined with the original buildings of past eras. </p><p>  The city, declared a cultural heritage by UNESCO in 1999, delights with its picturesque landscapes, and seven years ago it was recognized as an ideal corner for relaxation and life.  It is no coincidence that a large number of emigrants seek to get here.  In addition, it is officially recommended for Americans to stay after retirement, and more than four thousand people have already followed this advice, having bought housing here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof cuenca" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946330.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Acquaintance with the historical part </h2><p>  To better know what Cuenca is, you need to take a walk through the historical part of the city, protected by UNESCO.  The island of ancient culture is small, and tourists can explore it in a few hours.  This is a real journey into the past, where each building tells about the affairs of bygone days. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The capital of the province of Aswai often becomes the leader among the best-preserved historical cities.  The authorities take care of the unique appearance of the city of Cuenca, and tourists see the pristine beauty that people have not destroyed for several centuries.  Its architecture, famous for the harmonious combination of several cultures at once, embodied the colonial era, mixed with Baroque and Gothic. </p><p>  In the historical center, not a single building resembles another, and the narrow streets delight with its special elegance.  All the sharp contrasts and a delightful riot of style give the city, which received the honorary title of "Athens of Latin America", a unique flavor. </p><h2>  Religious city symbol </h2><p>  The many-faced Cuenca, the sights of which reflect all the milestones of its history, is famous for the huge number of Catholic churches located not far from each other.  The main building is the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.  The visiting card of the city with bright blue domes is striking in its monumentality.  The temple, the construction of which dragged on for 100 years, is a brilliant work of architectural art, combining several styles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuenca Ecuador details" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946329.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see more? </h2><p>  In the center of the most beautiful city of the state is a park named after Abdon Calderon - a national hero who fought with the Spaniards for the independence of the country.  Here is his sculpture, near which Chilean pines are planted. </p><p>  The fabulously beautiful Cuenca (Ecuador), whose sights combine ancient history and modern buildings, amazes guests who dream to see something new.  So, on Kuznetsov Square, an interesting monument dedicated to the Volcano is installed.  This is a tribute of gratitude to the local god of fire for the opportunity to create metal products that glorified talented craftsmen throughout the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuenca Ecuador Attractions" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946348.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A favorite place for tourists is considered to be a street paved with cobble stones called "Long".  The focus of Cuenca's public life in Ecuador attracts foreign guests who are already familiar with ancient legends.  It is believed that ghosts live here, scaring people at night.  However, no one is afraid of mysterious ghosts, but, on the contrary, everyone is eager to meet them, walking until morning. </p><h2>  Responses of people who moved to permanent residence </h2><p>  Emigration and the development of tourism infrastructure made cozy Cuenca (Ecuador) one of the most expensive settlements in the country. </p><p>  Reviews about the lives of those who moved here from Russia are full of conflicting information.  Some notes that, in comparison with our state, there are very cheap products here, so you can exist perfectly without denying yourself anything.  Someone immediately acquires a good home in installments up to 15 years, because a Russian passport is enough to make a purchase.  The farther from the center, the more affordable the villa.  Others rent a small apartment for 1500-1800 dollars a month, complaining about the high cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuenca Attractions" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946338.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, everyone agrees that life in a colorful city is calm, and the climate is ideal for those who can not stand the heat. </p><p>  Young entrepreneurs who have established business even in other countries are in a hurry here because there are excellent conditions for developing their own business, and the absence of corruption is considered a huge plus. </p><p>  Russians, who value excellent service, complain with displeasure that residents do not like to work.  The local proverb says about cunning scoundrels living at the expense of hardworking fools, therefore all developing companies belong to Europeans.  Selling substandard goods, townspeople lose customers without worrying about it at all, and gringo cheating is very common among Ecuadorians. </p><p>  It is worth noting that everyone who came on a tourist visa does not have the right to do business, otherwise the violators face a prison. </p><h2>  The perfect place to relax </h2><p>  Colorful Cuenca (Ecuador), the description of which is presented above, attracts foreigners who dream of a memorable vacation.  Colored ancient buildings, bright greenery, smiling citizens leave a pleasant impression. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cuenca Ecuador" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1946356.jpg" width="600"></div>
