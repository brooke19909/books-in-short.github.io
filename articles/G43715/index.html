What to do?  Ways to replenish the account today a lot.  Walk to the nearest terminal, transfer money from the card or connect auto payment and forget about communication problems.  But if finances temporarily sing romances, then a deferred payment will help out.  Tele2 offers the most loyal connection conditions, so it‚Äôs worth a closer look at this opportunity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deferred payment tele2" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1776073.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <h2>  What is the essence of the proposal </h2><p>  Deferred payment "Tele2" provides only to its subscribers.  This is logical, but still regularly there are people who are stubbornly trying to use the service as subscribers of another network.  Previously, the whole process was simpler and more profitable, since there was no commission for the provision.  Now you have to pay for the opportunity to stay in touch.  Since April 2015, the amount of payment has changed.  Now 50 rubles to the account can be received for three days with a commission of five rubles.  You can double the deferred payment of Tele2 by seven days, but the commission will also double.  Next is a proportional increase in prices, commission and time provided: 150 rubles are given for 10 days with a commission of 15 rubles, and 200 rubles are given for the same 10 days, but with a 10% commission.  The fee for using the service from the client is charged after the expiration of the service on the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are nuances!  If you manage with the most modest tariff and are not particularly active in terms of communication, then the maximum payment sizes may simply not be available to you.  In other words, the more money you spend on network services, the more deferred payment "Tele2" you can receive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a trust payment" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1776074.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  Have you thought about how to get a deferred payment on Tele2?  Wait!  First make sure you meet all the network requirements.  First, you must use the number for at least 120 days.  The logic of this condition is understandable: in 4 months you can get used to the number, ‚Äúgrow‚Äù connections and just throw out a SIM card after the end of the service it will be a pity.  Secondly, every month your activity on the number is automatically recounted.  And after 120 days, the system has enough statistics for you.  Thirdly, remember that the commission will be deducted from you in any case, even if you do not spend the promised payment, but will only receive calls and SMS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to take deferred payment on tel2" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1776075.jpg" width="240"></div>

From your phone, dial the command * 122 * 1 # and the call button.  A virtual assistant will appear on the screen, which will offer the available amounts to choose from.  By the way, you can check the maximum possible amount using the command * 122 #.  The desired information will come in a reply message.  Funds are credited to the account immediately after the request is sent, and you can make calls and write messages.  After the deadline is over, the SIM card will be blocked, and to activate it you will have to replenish the account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a deferred payment on tel2" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1776076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional terms </h2><p>  Information on how to make a deferred payment on "Tele2" is useful and relevant.  But remember that the subscriber will not be able to use it if it goes "minus".  If your balance is from -10 and below, you will have to quickly replenish it.  You should also take into account the fact that the commission may vary depending on the region of your residence.  It is better to find out detailed information on the company portal.  The service is available exclusively to subscribers with a prepaid payment system, and you can not replenish your balance indefinitely in this way.  The option is connected once, and after the expiration of the term, it is necessary to replenish the account.  If you want to know how to take a trust payment again, then either pay off the previous one or wait for the expiration of a week.  By the way, the operator can clarify all questions about the service. </p><p>  In general, it is worth having such a service in service.  It is convenient, efficient and affordable.  But it is suitable mainly for people who cannot without communication and at the same time remain ardent adherents of conservatism.  Nevertheless, a hundred different services have appeared long ago, with the help of which operators increase their sphere of influence.  In particular, there is a Call Me service, through which you can send a beacon to the called party.  You can also be addicted and send a request to "fund my account."  On the same "Tele2" there is an opportunity to share your balance with a friend.  All of these options are still free, so there is always a choice.  The main thing is to stay up to date with the latest innovations of your operator. </p>
