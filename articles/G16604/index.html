In order to free up memory, it is very important to know how to clear the cache on the iPad.  Sooner or later, this problem arises for each user, so in this article we will consider how to speed up the device by removing all unnecessary, and at the same time not to lose important files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cumgeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="there are many cache removal tools" class="if uuid-3054868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054868.jpg"></div><h2>  Do I need to clear the cache? </h2><p>  To clean the temporary space should be if the programs are unstable, freeze or crash, as well as when free memory is vital for normal operation.  It is better not to bring the matter to the second option, otherwise you cannot do without the use of special utilities. </p><p>  Every day we visit dozens of sites.  Information from them is stored in temporary tablet files.  This applies not even to the end of the loaded pages and cookies.  Storage of a large amount of garbage negatively affects not only the speed of the device, but also the health of the system as a whole.  Therefore, you should regularly clean the space and get rid of useless content. </p><h2>  How to clear the browser cache on the iPad? </h2><p>  The cache is designed to store temporary files.  It stores all frequently visited pages, used programs, copies of viewed photographs and much more.  Consider the map example.  Surely you paid attention to the fact that when downloading Yandex.Maps for the first time, does the program start downloading maps directly from the Global Network?  But if you restart the application, for example, the next day or every other day, the map will be displayed instantly.  The fact is that part of the map already exists in the memory of your gadget, therefore the application with the maps gets the necessary information from the temporary space, and does not download it again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Caching speeds up the loading of sites and pages in the browser, while the consumption of traffic is significantly reduced.  The gadget itself will not be able to automatically delete the cache, so you have to operate manually. </p><ol><li>  To get started, enter the iPad settings. </li><li>  Find the Safari browser. </li><li>  In the browser settings, select "Clear site history and data." </li></ol><p>  After that, all visited pages will disappear from the browser, and the ipad memory will be freed.  All browser tabs will be blank.  Using the built-in iOS tool, you can clear the cache on the iPad tablet, as you can see, in a few seconds.  This is nothing complicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cumgeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clearing the cache in the Safari browser" class="if uuid-3054867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054867.jpg"></div><h2>  If you need to reset all settings </h2><p>  Now consider how to clean the iPad. </p><p>  To do this, you need to enter the basic settings of the gadget, then in the "Reset" option, select the cleaning method you need.  You can delete the network settings, the settings for the Home key, reset the geolocation, as well as the keyboard dictionary.  To clear the cache, select the "Reset content and settings" option.  After confirmation, the iPad will return to the factory settings, therefore, if you decide on this step, before the deletion procedure, you need to copy the necessary information to the "Cloud" or to a USB flash drive or some other medium.  If you just needed to reset the network settings, then the files will not go anywhere, but you will have to reconfigure WI-FI. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many people have a question: "How to clear the cache on the iPad mini? If you compare the settings of the" apple "gadgets, we can say that they are practically no different from each other. Therefore, Ipad mini can be cleaned using any of the above methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appls.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clear cache in settings" class="if uuid-3054869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054869.jpg"></div><h2>  Clean temporary files in applications </h2><p>  Smartphones and tablets running on the iOS platform do not have the option to delete the application cache.  Fortunately, you can perform this operation using third-party programs or directly in the application itself, which will be cleaned.  Not all messengers and applications have this option, so it is recommended to download Battery Doctor software, which in a couple of touches will save you from unnecessary junk. </p><p>  How to clear the cache on the iPad using this program? </p><ol><li>  Download Battery Doctor in the app store. </li><li>  Enter the Junk ("trash"). </li><li>  Select the Clean Up Cache option. </li><li>  Confirm your actions by clicking on Clean. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ipadstory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery Doctor app" class="if uuid-3054884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054884.jpg"></div><p>  The authors of the program themselves recommend resorting to its help only as a last resort, when the iPad is very slow.  Before you clear the cache, you should copy the files important to you to a computer or somewhere else.  If jailbreak is installed on your iPad, you can use the CacheClearer program.  Instruction: </p><p>  Download and install CacheClearer. </p><ol><li>  Select any application.  It can be Facebook, Vkontakte, or Instagram. </li><li>  Enter the settings of the selected application. </li><li>  Click on Clear App's Cache. </li><li>  After completing the procedure, you will see that the program began to "weigh" significantly less. </li></ol><h2>  Automatic cleaning </h2><p>  In the Appstore application store, you can download other specialized programs that will support the stable operation of the gadget, periodically clearing it of unnecessary temporary files.  PhoneClean and iCleaner Pro do their job well.  If you activate the reminder option, then from time to time the program will offer to clean the garbage.  This will help prevent clogging of your iPad and free up to 40% of RAM. </p><h2>  Clearing the cache by uninstalling applications </h2><p>  The methods described above are effective, but not always.  There are programs that take up a fairly large amount, and software like iCleaner Pro is not able to access the cache.  In this case, you can remove it and then reinstall it.  In order to determine which application is the most cumbersome, you must enter the basic settings, and then in the ‚ÄúStorage‚Äù.  There you will find the ‚ÄúStatistics‚Äù subsection.  Review the parameters of each of the programs, and you will see which one takes up the most disk space.  Delete it, and then download it again in the application store.  That's how we figured out how to clear the cache on the iPad by reinstalling bulk programs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newmobilelife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iCleaner Pro Utility" class="if uuid-3054870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054870.jpg"></div><h2>  Clear the cache from the computer </h2><p>  There are several utilities for MacOS and Windows that clean the temporary iPad memory well.  One of them is PhoneClean.  To clear the cache, you need to pair the tablet and computer.  Launch the PhoneClean app.  Click on the Start Scan button.  At the end of the scan, the scan results will be displayed on the monitor. </p><h2>  Get rid of unnecessary messages and multimedia files </h2><p>  Every music lover has the habit of downloading large volumes of music and clips, thereby unintentionally slowing down the work of his gadget.  Do not be lazy to audit your multimedia content, delete audio and video files that you have not been listening to or watching for a long time.  The same applies to photographs: they can be copied to the ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù, and then deleted from the iPad‚Äôs memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yablyk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reinstalling applications" class="if uuid-3054872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054872.jpg"></div><h2>  Private mode </h2><p>  You can make sure that temporary files are not saved at all.  To do this, go to the Safari browser.  Click on "Bookmarks" in the lower right corner: a pop-up window will appear in front of you.  Select the option "Private access", from this moment you can browse any sites, and their data will not be stored and litter the memory of your tablet.  In addition, none of the Internet users will be able to see if you have visited a particular site.  The attendance history will always be empty.  Just remember to close the pages after viewing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lapplebi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Private mode" class="if uuid-3054880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3054880.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know how to clear the cache on the iPad easily and quickly, thereby freeing up a large amount of the necessary space.  But it should be remembered that if you decide to fully format your gadget, transfer all the valuable information to a reliable medium in order to avoid loss. </p>
