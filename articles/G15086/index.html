    <h2>  The story of Bingo: how it all began </h2><p>  The question of ‚ÄúBingo‚Äù - what is it and when it appeared, cannot be answered unequivocally.  Gambling spans more than one thousand years, over time, many of them mutated, disappeared, new ones appeared.  The Bingo game is one of the lottery games that spread throughout Europe in the 16th century.  The gain depended on the coincidence of random numbers.  The gradual process of transforming the game into its modern form took place over several centuries. </p><p>  English archaeologist John Stevens traveled to Mexico in 1838, he described in detail the ancient game of "La Lottery".  The presenter took the numbered balls from the bag in turn and called the number.  The players carried sheets of paper with them, arranged in rows of five digits in each digits from 1 to 90. When naming the numbers, they placed the grain on the corresponding cell.  The one who first covered the entire line won. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bingo game" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1238148.jpg" width="587"></div></h2><h2>  Why is the game so called? </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that the name of the game was invented by an American toy seller named Edwin Lowe.  He used this term during the implementation of mass-produced tickets.  But why did he use that particular word?  Once an enterprising Low watched the game during a fair in Georgia in 1929.  A noteworthy point was that beans were used to close the numbers on paper.  Because of the excitement, one playing lady accidentally cried out: "Bingo!"  (translation of "bino" - beans).  Low liked the word so much that he used it for his product.  There are other assumptions regarding the emergence of this concept, but the bean story remains by far the most plausible. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cards for bingo games" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1238147.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Gambling for everyone </h2><p>  The game "Bingo" is a type of gambling entertainment, the main goals of which are fun pastime, checking intuition, testing luck and, of course, the probability of winning.  It is fair to say that this game took the world by storm and is incredibly popular in recent years.  Gone are the days when this entertainment was considered the inheritance of grandmothers and housewives.  Currently, especially in Western countries, there are a considerable number of special institutions for playing "Bingo", thousands of kinds of various lotteries exist all over the world, including online.  Men and women, young and old, all walks of life now know how to play Bingo, and do it regularly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bingo translation" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1238146.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><h2>  Electronic version of the game </h2><p>  The electronic version of Bingo is the same traditional, but without the usual paper tickets.  Instead of sheets of paper, a special electronic device is used to record numbers by the player, these are the so-called bingo cards for semi-automated games.  Fully in automatic mode, you can play on slot machines, where the machine itself selects the numbers and calculates the winnings. </p><p>  What are the advantages and disadvantages of electronic bingo?  Firstly, electronic games provide an opportunity for people who may have previously not been able to do (for example, people with disabilities and various forms of disabilities) to participate.  Secondly, this option is intended for the prospective expansion of the audience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bingo" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35703/1238143.jpg" width="424"></div>  Over the past decade, the number of people with their own electronic gadgets has increased significantly.  With the advent of the online version of Bingo, the game has now become socially acceptable for absolutely everyone.  As for the shortcomings, there are not so many to talk about them.
