When he was only two months old, the family moved to China, where the boy‚Äôs dad, <span>Evgeny Kolesov,</span> had a business.  Mom Irina, a teacher by training, instilled a love of learning for her son.  It was she who studied with Gordey in China under the school curriculum.  But the father played a key role in the development of the boy; he developed his teaching methodology in a playful way, including the study of languages. </p><p>  By the way, Gordey Kolesov has three younger sisters: Agatha, Yesenia and Milan.  All of them, like his brother, speak five languages: Russian, Chinese, Spanish, English and French.  Girls do tennis and judo.  Gordey loves the sisters, helps them learn languages, and engages in calligraphy with them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gordey.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gordey family" class="if uuid-2956793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10809/2956793.jpg"></div><h2>  TV appearances </h2><p>  For the first time on the screen, Gordey Kolesov appeared in April 2014, in the program "Director for himself."
