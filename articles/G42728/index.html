    <p>  Bronze belongs to TM Tefal.  The company specializes in the manufacture of household appliances, the main characteristic of which is durability.  Among the model range of Tefal teapots, one can find a wide variety of models both in terms of design and functionality, and, accordingly, price.  So, the device can be made of metal, plastic, glass or ceramic.  Cheaper representatives of this brand are equipped with an open heating element.  This is not entirely good, since such a kettle is not suitable for frequent use.  This can not be said about more expensive models that are equipped with a closed ten. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tefal VITESSE BI7625 </h2><p>  Separately, I want to note the electric kettle Tefal VITESSE BI7625.  It is associated with convenience, practicality, reliability, safety during operation.  The device attracts attention at first glance, because it is simply impossible not to notice this ‚Äústylish little thing‚Äù.  The case is made of high-strength metal material and with a bang will withstand accidental drops that will not damage the kettle.  The heating element is closed.  It is equipped with a filter unit, indicators of inclusion and liquid level.  Supported lid lock function.  An active protection system will not allow the kettle to turn on in the absence of water (automatic shutdown function).  Main technical specifications: </p><p>  Power: 2200 watts. </p><p>  Volume: 1.7 L </p><p>  The price of such an assistant in the kitchen is within 3000 rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the promotion and credibility of the brand, reviews about this model of the teapot can be found both positive and negative.  Among the advantages, users note the original and stylish appearance, and among the disadvantages - noise during operation.  In addition, there were cases when the body began to leak, having served a relatively short period of time.  In this case, repair of electric kettles became inevitable, and in most cases impossible. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Analyzing the rating list, we can conclude that it is realistic to choose a good electric kettle of absolutely any type of accessories.  However, the most preference is still given to models of devices with a metal case and a thermal regulator.  These electric kettles show the perfect combination of value and functionality.  If the main task when choosing a teapot is to save money, then you should consider the lineup of electric kettles of the Scarlet trademark, whose case is made of inexpensive metal or plastic.  If environmental friendliness is a priority, <span>glass</span> or ceramic <span>teapots of</span> already more expensive brands (Bosch, Tefal) will do. </p><p>  The choice of a device for heating water should be taken as seriously as possible.  Do not spare money for the purchase of a ‚Äústanding‚Äù unit with a worldwide reputation, because in most cases repair of electric kettles is impossible, which means that a popular proverb says that the avaricious pays twice. ‚Äù </p><p>  You made repairs and now need styling of household appliances or decided to buy a new electric kettle due to the fact that the old one has already become obsolete?  Rating to help you.  Do not waste your precious time and money on low-quality goods, purchase only proven household appliances. </p>
