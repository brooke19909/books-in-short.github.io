Description of the methods and their features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At present, when mobile operators are actively getting rid of unlimited tariff plans, the issue of monitoring the Internet traffic available at the current tariff is especially acute.  Most Internet resources are saturated with a variety of multimedia content, while not all of them are optimized for mobile devices.  This forces users to resort to various tricks in trying to save precious megabytes, but the expense still remains high.  And super-limit packages are comparable in cost to the subscription fee for the tariff plan itself with much less traffic. </p><p>  MTS subscribers who want to avoid going beyond the limit and need to connect additional packages have several ways to control the consumed traffic.  All of them are quite simple, so it‚Äôs usually easy to find out the rest of the traffic on the MTS. </p><h2>  USSD commands </h2><p>  Checking the rest of the traffic from MTS is carried out by four commands: </p><ol><li>  * 107 #, which launches a primitive USSD-menu, in which the required item "Internet" is indicated by the number 1. Having typed it and pressing the call key, you need to wait for a reply SMS message with information about available traffic. </li><li>  * 217 #, which assumes receiving a similar message without additional actions on the part of the subscriber, however, this service is currently unstable: in most cases, after sending this command to the subscriber, the message "Find out the rest of the traffic in the convenient My MTS application or on the official website" . </li><li>  * 100 * 1 # - a command that subscribers who use tariffs without a monthly fee can use. </li><li>  * 100 * 2 # - suitable for those who still exceeded the limit and connected one of the traffic packets.  The balance of such a package will be displayed in the message received. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Checking MTS traffic using the USSD command" class="if uuid-2668376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90021/2668376.jpg"></div><h2>  SMS messages </h2><p>  In order to find out the traffic balance in this way, you need to send an SMS with the text "?"  (without quotation marks, of course) to the short number 5340. After that, a message like ‚Äú1.2 GB of traffic is available to you will be sent to the subscriber‚Äôs phone. Valid until 01/01/2018 00:00. Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis maximum." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  This service will allow you to find out the rest of the traffic on the MTS number, and to perform all operations with the tariff plan and the services provided by the operator.  To access LK, you need to go to the MTS official website, enter the phone number and password in the special fields, then undergo an anti-spam check and enter the confirmation code sent to the device.  After authorization, the rest of the traffic will be displayed immediately when the page loads.  Those who are interested in the amount of Internet available from additional packages need to click on the "Packages" link in the "Rates and Services" link, then select "View Current Balance". </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS personal account. Available Traffic Balance" class="if uuid-2668411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90021/2668411.jpg"></div><h2>  The application "My MTS" </h2><p>  This method is available to owners of devices based on Android and IOS operating systems.  You can download the My MTS application from the official application stores of both platforms for free.  After installing the program, you can <span>find out the rest of the traffic on MTS, the balance, the rest of the</span> minutes, as well as SMS on its main page.  As for the rest, the application‚Äôs functionality is almost identical to the personal account on the MTS website, unless it‚Äôs much more convenient to use it from a mobile device: the interface adapted for tablets and smartphones is extremely concise, while not at the expense of functionality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="forplaymarket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The application &quot;My MTS&quot;" class="if uuid-2668380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90021/2668380.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking traffic from the tablet </h2><p>  For many tablets, the above instructions are quite relevant, but a significant number of these devices do not have voice communication modules and, as a result, they do not have a telephone keypad support: you simply cannot dial the USSD command.  In addition, in some tariff plans specifically targeted for tablets, the ability to receive and send SMS is disabled.  In this case, the USSD commands will not work, because they are based on the short message service. </p><p>  Accordingly, you can find out the rest of MTS traffic on tablets without a phone module in the following ways: </p><ol><li>  The application "My MTS". </li><li>  "Personal account on the site. </li><li>  Using a utility capable of working with USSD commands.  It should be borne in mind that this method will not work on every device. </li></ol><h2>  Checking traffic on a mobile modem </h2><p>  Standing apart is a group of devices for laptops and personal computers - mobile modems.  Despite the rather large volumes of traffic provided at the tariffs for modems (for example, MTS Connect), finding out the rest of the traffic will still be out of place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="habr.com" data-author=": Mypuk, "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS modem" class="if uuid-2668399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90021/2668399.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, no one bothers to remove the SIM card from the modem, insert it into the phone and send the same SMS, but to do this, to put it mildly, is inconvenient.  Therefore, the ability to check traffic was built into the interface of the program controlling the modem.  Depending on the device model and software version, the methods may vary: some utilities allow you to find out the rest of the MTS modem‚Äôs traffic using the button with the same name, while others support virtual keyboards with which you can send the desired USSD command or message without problems.  In addition, the personal account on the site will also give an answer to the question of interest to the subscriber. </p><h2>  Communication with the operator </h2><p>  You can also find out about the amount of available traffic by calling the operator at 0890. But this method usually involves a rather long wait for an answer. </p>
