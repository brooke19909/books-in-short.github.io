The "stardom" of the hotel, in their opinion, is fully consistent with the level of service provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.foursquare.com" data-author=": Vladimir C., "><img itemprop="image" alt="In a hotel" class="if uuid-2786356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/2786356.jpg"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Many people like the hotel’s convenient location (in the very center and close to attractions, the Palace of Culture, shops, a medical center and transport interchange), excellent views from the rooms on the upper floors, and well-groomed facilities. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews note that the hotel has a wide range of quality amenities, first of all, they indicate the provision of delicious, satisfying, varied and inexpensive breakfasts in the restaurant ("buffet"), the availability of Internet (works in the lobby), parking lots, saunas. </p><p>  Separately, guests note as a plus the good work of the restaurant (the menu includes dishes of European and Russian cuisines), a bar, a coffee shop, the presence in the hotel building of cookery with a rich assortment of pastries, pastries, salads, fish and meat dishes. </p><p>  According to reviews, the hotel accommodation is quick, the staff is friendly, responsible and professional.  The guests call the rooms cozy, very clean, with an updated interior.  Guests note the presence in the rooms of somewhat old-fashioned but well-groomed furniture, outdated (pot-bellied), but working televisions, comfortable bathrooms with everything you need (including bathrobes).  Room sizes are not very large, guests say.  They can use: bed, desk, wardrobe, bathroom, TV, minibar, kettle.  Separate air conditioning in the room is not provided, the heating / air conditioning system in the hotel is centralized.  Somewhat strange, guests find that most of the outlets in the rooms are turned off by a special switch at the entrance. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  According to the guests, “Youth” has very poor sound insulation.  Most likely, having settled here, you will have to wake up with the neighbors who first woke up and walked along the corridor, and you will be able to fall asleep with the last one who fell asleep.  Residents recommend choosing rooms in the corner of the corridor when placing, it is more quiet here.  But lovers of silence, according to many, it makes sense to settle in another hotel. </p>
