Here, new <span>housing complexes</span> are commissioned annually.  Of great interest to potential buyers is LCD "Talisman", which is being built in one of the prestigious urban areas.  The best specialists took part in its design, which was reflected in its external design.  The complex is being built using modern monolithic-brick technology, which ensures high durability and safety.  In addition, it makes it possible to create the most comfortable layouts for tenants and to use the area of ​​apartments wisely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Talisman" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678430.jpg" width="509"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  LCD "Talisman" is being built in the Northern <span>region of Krasnodar</span> in the new, actively developing micro-district "Youth", not far from Vitamincombin.  The address of the complex is as follows: Dushistaya Street, building No. 54a.  The complex is located in a well-developed area.  Its neighbors within a radius of 100 meters are the residential complex "Apricot", "Duet" and "Family Park".  LCD “Birch”, “Youth” and “On Fragrant” are located a little further, so that residents of the “Talisman” will not be bored.  At 150 meters from the complex runs the Yeisk highway, 150 meters from it there is a railway line, but there are no stations or platforms nearby.  In addition to housing complexes, around the "Talisman" there is a city building with houses of different construction periods and different storeys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Since the LCD "Talisman" is being built in the developed area of ​​the city, residents will not have problems with transport.  On the Yeisk highway, 8 bus routes and fixed-route taxis run.  The stop, however, is 500 meters from the complex, but just 200 meters away, on Dushistaya Street, there is a bus stop number 67, the traffic interval is 10 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Economy class" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678439.jpg" width="422"></div>  It takes about half an hour to get to the center from the Talisman residential complex, and only 10 minutes to the Ice Palace, the mall and the sports complex.  For motorists, the location of the complex is also convenient because, having left on the Yeyskoye highway, in minutes you can reach a major fork leading to the main highway of the city - 3rd Trudovaya Street and Rostovskoye Highway and further onto the M4 highway.  In the north direction along the Yeysk highway, you can very quickly go to the P268 highway leading to Yeysk.

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  From the point of view of environmental cleanliness, the location of the Talisman residential complex can be called conditionally favorable.  Krasnodar is the largest <span>transport hub</span> and industrial center of the south of the country.  There are many industrial enterprises, including an oil refinery, but all of them are located at a considerable distance from the considered LC.  In this case, environmental indicators are reduced only by the nearby Yeisk Avenue.  According to statistics, there are more cars per citizen in Krasnodar than in Moscow, so air pollution with exhaust gases creates serious problems here.  They are especially aggravated in the summer.  Another disadvantage of the complex from an environmental point of view is that there are almost no natural objects near it, where residents can relax and breathe fresh air.  Therefore, it is very important that large-scale landscaping is carried out in the <span>adjacent territories</span> of the commissioned housing complex, and the Talisman, in particular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Talisman Krasnodar" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678436.jpg" width="456"></div>

This is one of the youngest <span>construction organizations in Krasnodar,</span> created in 2013.  The Talisman complex is its first and only facility.  The financial position of the company is currently assessed as medium stable.  Lack of experience in the construction of complexes affects the construction period, which SK South has several times suffered.  LCD "Talisman" was to become a visiting card for the company.  At first it was planned to put it into operation at the end of 2016, but then the deadline was changed to I quarter of the current, 2017.  Now the construction of the building is completed, internal work and the connection of the house to communication networks are underway.  At this stage, the developer promises to give keys in the first half of 2017 and offers interest holders to change the information in the DDU, setting the deadline there with a margin, that is, in August 2017. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lcd mascot reviews" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678434.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and Design </h2><p>  The area where the Talisman residential complex is being built has a developed infrastructure.  Next to the residential complex, in a house on Tikhaya Street, there is a pharmacy, atelier, beauty salon, language center, created like a gymnasium, several shops and a Magnit supermarket.  Within a radius of 1000 meters there are two more schools, two kindergartens and a clinic.

There is no underground parking in the project. </p><p>  The Talisman complex, according to the project, has an economy class category.  It is a single building with 17 floors.  Among them are 15 residential floors, one basement and one upper, technical.  The house consists of 2 sections, in each of which two elevators are installed - a passenger and a cargo one, designed for lifting goods up to 1000 kg.  A concierge is not provided in the entrance areas, but it is planned to install intercoms at the entrances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="housing estate Talisman" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1678438.jpg" width="456"></div>
