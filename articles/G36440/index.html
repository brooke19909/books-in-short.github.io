  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY interior toy: execution technique, step by step instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Making toys is a very easy and wonderful task.  After all, experiencing excitement and thrills when a small bunny or doll begins to be born in your hand is really priceless. </p><h2>  Stylish, expressive and do-it-yourself </h2><p>  You can create interior toys with your own hands, taking as a basis fairy-tale characters, cute animals, beautiful princesses or copies of portraits.  Often neatly made handmade toys look amazing in the interior, they are filled with comfort and a warm homely atmosphere. </p><p>  And if you look closely at the touching details, admiration for toys will be endless.  The seemingly insignificant details added by the author to the image of the doll do not have functional significance, but they revive it.  Looking at them, it does not seem that this is an ordinary bauble on a shelf with books. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thedailytop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Upscale Interior Dolls" class="if uuid-3076383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076383.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  It is better to choose fabric for the doll‚Äôs torso that is not too dense to sew comfortably and form natural folds.  A synthetic winterizer can shine through a thin fabric, so regular cotton is best suited, and even better - knitwear.  Often, clothes for interior <span>toys with their own hands are sewn</span> from old unnecessary things with a beautiful pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the head, you can use a porcelain blank, a simpler option is a foam ball.  However, options look interesting where the head is sewn from the same fabric as the arms and legs.  As a filler, synthetic winterizer, cotton wool, holofiber are used. </p><h2>  Creating a warm atmosphere </h2><p>  To create warm knitted sweaters, scarves, hats and socks, yarn is required.  This is a great option for making DIY Christmas interior toys.  The main Christmas colors are green, red and white.  It is in this color scheme that you can choose accessories or materials for creating clothes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas toy" class="if uuid-3076382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076382.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself interior dolls and toys will be a wonderful gift for this holiday.  It can be presented to parents, children or even friends.  As parts on the toy, you can put on a red cap, and put a small bag with gifts or a holiday box in your hand. </p><h2>  Where to start sewing? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avatars.mds.yandex.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toy pattern" class="if uuid-3078315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/3078315.jpg"></div><p>  A template is drawn on paper.  The body can be solid, but a much simpler option for beginners is the pattern of individual parts of the body.  Separately, according to the template, arms, legs, torso, neck and head are cut out of fabric.  In this case, you need to leave a little fabric around the edges on the inner seam.  Do not stitch too close to the edge, otherwise the edges of the fabric may creep out over time if the seam is not very tight.  All parts are sewn together from the wrong side, and it is important not to forget to leave a hole.  Through it, the part is first turned out and then filled with a synthetic winterizer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Crucial moment </h2><p>  Stuff the toy tightly, the filler can be pushed deep into the pencil.  After stuffing, the seam is sewn up, but it should not be visible.  It can be done in places that will be covered with clothing.  Sutures on the arms and legs should be done in places with which they will be sewn to the body. </p><p>  We connect all parts together, making sure that there are no distortions: arms and legs should be in place.  It‚Äôs better to attach the head last.  Remember that if the eyes and mouth are embroidered with thread or buttons are sewn in their place, this must be done first, before stitching the head together.  If the eyes are drawn, then this is best done at the very end.  So that during work you can not be afraid that they will be lubricated. </p><h2>  Hair and hairstyle </h2><p>  Hair is usually applied with artificial curls made of kanekalon.  In specialized stores doll wigs from the same material are sold.  A simpler and more original option for creating hairstyles for an interior toy with your own hands - hay, thread or yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original hairstyle from woolen threads" class="if uuid-3076396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076396.jpg"></div><p>  The wig is first fastened with pins, and then gradually stitched along the parting, starting from the middle and walking around the entire circumference.  When done, do the hairstyle: style, braid.  Artificial hair can be cut if necessary.  A doll hairstyle can be the craziest colors.  Before you sew a wig, you can dye it in any colors. </p><p>  The hair you create for your doll gives her personality.  They actually set the character and general tone of the whole image.  The boy may have mohawk, disheveled red curls or short hair.  For girls dolls, the variety is much wider: luxurious shining curls, loose hair, pigtail, ponytails, witch's tricks or a complex evening hairstyle. </p><h2>  Creating a doll wardrobe </h2><p>  For the doll you need to sew clothes, which is much easier.  The holes should be large enough to be worn on the hero.  On many photos of interior toys with their own hands, you can see attached buttons, for example, on vests or jackets. </p><p>  Let's start with a doll shirt.  It can be sewn in two parts or according to a template from a single piece, as in the presented pattern for an interior toy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shinyhappyworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="T-shirt pattern" class="if uuid-3076369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076369.jpg"></div><p>  With your own hands, connect a piece of fabric with another exactly the same.  Do not forget which side they need to be sewn together.  Cut the shape along the outer line.  In order not to make the neckline too large, sometimes t-shirts and dresses are worn before the head is sewn.  Or clothes can be made with clasps.  For the smallest doll owners you can use Velcro.  The edge of the fabric is hemmed from the wrong side to make it look neat, the easiest way is to make a t-shirt or vest. </p><p>  A rather simple element of a doll wardrobe can be a skirt.  Regardless of style, it is very easy to sew it.  The necessary piece of fabric is cut out and sewn along the seam, at the top of the belt you need to make a fastener or fasten the elastic band. </p><p>  It is also easy to make a dress if you sew the upper and lower parts separately, and then just sew them together from the back.  Of course, there are much more complex and sophisticated styles that you yourself can create if you wish.  You can sew beautiful and even chic doll clothes using leftover or recycled textile materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shinyhappyworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern shorts" class="if uuid-3076384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076384.jpg"></div><p>  To create trousers or shorts, cut two parts, sew them together on one side, then hem the top edge so that there is a passage for the rope or better elastic band on which the pants will be held.  Then, the inner parts of the trousers are sewn together, and lastly, the other edge.  Then you can thread the gum, and you're done. </p><h2>  Parts &amp; Accessories </h2><p>  Shoes are made of felt, fabric and leather.  You can also use ready-made doll shoes. </p><p>  The finished doll is decorated with accessories.  Hairpins, hats, artificial flowers are attached to the head.  With your own hands, you can sew a cap, hat or gloves from fabric for interior toys.  To the image you can add a wide variety of beads and bracelets with elastic, made from beads or miniature beads.  You can also add jewelry on top of clothes, for example, with a sticky pencil with sparkles to draw a pattern or lines on the dress.  A small strap can be worn on the belt, and a bag, basket, bouquet and other little things can be put into your hands. </p><p>  Toys look amazing after they are decorated, and when they are dressed in beautiful dresses, they become the best Christmas gifts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="no.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A variety of interior animals" class="if uuid-3076370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/105224/3076370.jpg"></div><p>  Homemade toys tend to live longer than store toys.  If a child makes an interior toy with his own hands, he spends a certain amount of effort.  And appreciates her more.  Homemade toys are also more valuable than bought ones, because making them is as much fun as playing with them.  Doing something interesting, getting satisfaction from the result and translating the idea into tangible form is a pleasant and rewarding experience. </p>
