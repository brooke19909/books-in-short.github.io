Most banks provide a range of services that are related to sending foreign currency abroad.  Domestic systems of fast money transfers significantly expand the geography of presence.  This is only beneficial.  Available and transfer money to Germany. </p><p>  You can transfer finances, among other things, through payment terminals.  In addition, this can be done through online services.  The difference lies in the cost, speed and overall reliability of operations.  Tariffs for services can vary significantly.  In addition, as part of the appeal to the bank, the client is required to take a number of additional actions. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail how to transfer money from Russia to Germany, what restrictions exist.  We also find out which systems conditions are the most favorable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stories.paysafe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money transfer to Germany" class="if uuid-3125541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125541.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can make a transfer to Germany </h2><p>  Financial transactions related to such manipulation are regulated by the Bank of Russia.  So, according to his instructions, an individual can transfer abroad no more than five thousand dollars or a similar amount in rubles in equivalent without opening a bank account.  In the case of a resident, then the sender simply needs to present a passport.  For non-residents, no restrictions are provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The validity of large amounts </h2><p>  Amounts of transfers in excess of the above should be justified.  For example, in the event that a money transfer to Germany is required in order to pay for studies, then it is necessary to present an agreement with the appropriate educational institution.  If a citizen sends money to his family, he will have to confirm the relationship (for example, by means of a notarized certificate). </p><p>  The question of how to transfer money from Russia to Germany is most profitable, many are interested.  Let's consider in more detail. </p><h2>  Cheap Translation Options </h2><p>  Let us turn to various types of the most profitable transfers of funds from Russia to Germany: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diasporaalliance.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money to Germany" class="if uuid-3125545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125545.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The procedure can be carried out from account to account.  The recipient is required to provide IBAN and BIC international bank details.  The sender, among other things, will need a bank account.  If not, you will have to open it for an additional fee.  In general, the manipulation from one account to another is not only the cheapest way, but also the longest one: you will have to wait a few days for crediting. </li><li>  Transferring money to Germany from Russia is cheaply available in the mode from one card to another.  Both parties must have bank plastic of MasterCard or Visa payment systems.  The sender only needs to know the card number of the recipient.  You can transfer funds without leaving your home, simply using the proposed electronic service.  The procedure, as a rule, lasts only a few minutes.  Money can come right away, but sometimes you have to wait up to five days.  It is worth noting that such a translation is not more expensive than previously considered.  The average size of the banking commission is up to one and a half percent. <div class="photo" data-original="www.remittance.org.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer funds to Germany" class="if uuid-3125548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125548.jpg"></div></li><li>  Operation "cash".  This method of opening an account will not require.  The sender makes the required amount in cash, which is issued to the recipient at the customer service point abroad.  According to this principle, well-known money transfer systems operate in the form of Contact, Western Union, Zolotaya Korona and so on.  To send funds, only a passport with the full name and country of the recipient will be enough.  The daily limit is usually limited to five thousand dollars.  It will be possible to send the transfer to Germany in just a few minutes, and within one hour it will be available for payment in favor of the recipient.  The size of the commission directly depends on the system used, various promotions are often carried out and promotional tariffs are introduced. </li><li>  Cash to the account.  For these purposes, the recipient must be given the name of the bank in which the account is opened, providing the IBAN and BIC codes used in international transfers.  The advantage of this method is that the sender does not need to open his own account.  As a rule, it will be enough just to come to the bank with the specified details, and then send the money, having paid the commission.  A similar service is provided, for example, by Western Union.  The size of the commission depends on the amount and direction of the financial transfer. </li></ol><p>  How to transfer money to Germany, it is important to find out in advance, and not on the day of payment.  This will protect against potential problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.philstar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to send money to germany" class="if uuid-3125563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125563.jpg"></div><h2>  Rating of payment systems, currencies and interest rates </h2><p>  Tariffs for the operation directly depend on the selected electronic transfer system.  Consider the rating of the most profitable of them: </p><ol><li>  In the first place is the famous Moneybookers.  He takes one percent of the amount of transfers. </li><li>  Western Union is in second place.  Moreover, the payment for the transfer will be from 250 to 2,500 rubles, or from 10 to 100 dollars, depending on the amount, which averages from 4% to 6%. </li><li>  Next comes the Contact system.  She takes 2.5%.  If the amount is less than 200 euros, then the commission will be 5 euros. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank transfer" class="if uuid-3125551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125551.jpg"></div><h2>  Mixed options </h2><p>  How else can I transfer money to Germany?  In addition to standard methods, there are also mixed ones: depositing cash in cash to recipient accounts or transfers using bank cards and through cash withdrawals.  These operations are carried out thanks to payment services that carry out the relevant financial manipulations. </p><h2>  How can I send via Sberbank? </h2><p>  For large banks in Russia, the reception of sending money abroad is not exotic at all.  Similar services are provided by many credit institutions that operate today in the international market. </p><p>  Is it possible to transfer money to Germany in Sberbank?  The main condition for the client is the availability of a special currency account.  In Europe, any resident has it.  The Russians, however, as well as the citizens of the countries of the commonwealth, they open out of necessity.  This does not take a lot of time at all, and, in addition, does not require the collection of an impressive mountain of references. </p><div class="photo" data-original="akket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer funds from Germany" class="if uuid-3125566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125566.jpg"></div><p>  Before initiating the procedure for opening a foreign currency account, one must inquire which neighboring company is the correspondent for the financial organization from which the corresponding transfer will be sent.  This step is not considered mandatory, but it allows the client to save a certain amount of money on commissions. </p><h2>  Postbank </h2><p>  Money can be transferred from Germany inexpensively through Postbank.  For the transfer of five thousand dollars to the Russian Sberbank per person will take about eleven euros. </p><p>  Another advantage of this method is the ability to use online banking.  The operation here can be even cheaper (about one and a half euros for any amount), since in this case the sender does not pay for the work of bank employees.  It should be noted that the recipient may also require small compensation as a commission: more often it is a percentage of the volume of the transfer.  The downside is a long waiting time, as sometimes money has to wait about seven days.  In order not to overpay, it is better to clarify the information on tariffs for international transfers by phone or on the websites of the bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinellaslife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money to Sberbank" class="if uuid-3125556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3125556.jpg"></div><p>  For example, a person decided to use Sberbank as a recipient.  For this, an employee of a German financial institution must provide the following details: name of organization, SWIFT code, name of the recipient, twenty-digit account and card number.  In addition, you will need the details of the recipient's passport and the address of the Sberbank branch in which the money will be issued. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, you can send money to Germany if you use the services of well-known electronic transfer systems in the form of Western Union, Moneybookers, Contact, and others.  The advantage of this method is that funds can be received already on the day of shipment, that is, after a couple of hours.  Systems may differ in cost of services.  The maximum transfer can be made, as already mentioned, for five thousand dollars, the sender makes money in rubles, and the conversion is carried out directly by the payment system. </p><p>  In the article, we examined how to transfer money from Russia to Germany. </p>
