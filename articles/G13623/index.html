  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tax deduction when buying an apartment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you buy an apartment, do you intend to take a tax deduction?  Of course, because you have heard so much about this, but just do not yet know exactly how to act correctly.  It is good that we all live in a state that has taken care of its taxpayers in such a way that they are given considerable <span>tax benefits</span> when buying a home <span>.</span> </p><p>  In order to apply your <span>tax deduction</span> when buying an apartment, you need to adhere to the rules established by law.  Firstly, you should know that if the funds for the purchase of an apartment were allocated to you by the employer, local administration or another person, and you also used the funds of maternity capital, then the deduction is not due to you.  You can apply the tax deduction when buying an apartment or a private house only once.  This applies to all those who have already received a property deduction later than 2001.  Those who used the right to deduction until 2001 when buying an apartment or building a house can get it again. </p><p>  The calculation of the tax deduction is based on the cost of housing or the cost of its construction, but cannot exceed 2 million rubles.  under the new legislation (if the right to receive a deduction has arisen since 2008).  If the deduction began to be received before 2008, then its maximum amount cannot be more than 1 million rubles.  The rate on it is 13%.  That is, if you buy an apartment for 5 million rubles, then they will return you 13% from only 2 million, and this will amount to 260 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Interestingly, is the tax deduction for buying an apartment supposed to be for everyone?  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Pensioners (non-working);  individuals - non-residents of the Russian Federation, individual entrepreneurs using a simplified taxation system or <span>imputed income</span> tax will not be able to do this.  If you won the lottery, bought from relatives or received a decent amount of dividends and decided to purchase an apartment, according to the law, tax <span>benefits for buying an apartment</span> do not rely on you either. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, when will you finally be able to get this tax deduction?  From the moment you receive a document proving your right to an apartment or apartment building.  If the apartment is bought in a house under construction - as soon as you receive an act on the transfer of housing. </p><p>  How to get such a welcome property deduction? </p><p>  You will need to collect a list of necessary documents and apply at the place of residence to the tax authorities.  And here, in fact, is a list of all the necessary documents: </p><p>  - tax return strictly form 3NDFL; </p><p>  - a certificate of your income form 2NDFL (if you work on several jobs, then with each); </p><p>  - statement of an individual taxpayer; </p><p>  - a contract for the purchase of housing (copy); </p><p>  - certificate of ownership of housing or the act of transfer (copy); </p><p>  - copies of receipts, bank statements on the transfer of money, receipts, etc., in general, all documents confirming your payments. </p><p>  Attach the application for the deduction and your <span>bank account number</span> to the list to which the excessively paid tax will be credited. </p><p>  You can contact the tax authorities at any time as soon as the tax period expires. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can get your long-awaited tax deduction when buying an apartment from your employer.  But you still need to go to the tax authority with a set of all necessary documents.  No later than 30 calendar days from the date of your written application and a package of collected documents to the tax authority, your right to use the tax deduction must be confirmed.  This right will be confirmed by issuing a special notice at the place of your work.  Then it will be transferred to the accounting department of the employing organization, and based on this, the tax will no longer be withheld. </p>
