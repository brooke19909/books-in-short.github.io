  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mauritius hotels provide an opportunity to relax richly and beautifully</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mauritius is a small island located in the <span>Indian Ocean</span> .  It is sometimes called the island of treasures, although there are no special treasures in its land, Mauritius itself is a treasure.  There is no industry, no giant industrial corporations.  The main sources of income are <span>sugar cane plantations</span> and tourism.  Moreover, the development of the tourism industry is specially limited, since it is believed that Mauritius should remain an exclusive vacation destination. </p><p>  The island is very tiny: only 65 kilometers long and about 45 kilometers wide.  On this small territory, a little more than a million people live in a friendly and hospitable population.  For tourists, this magnificent island has almost everything: magical beaches and lagoons, luxurious exotic vegetation and majestic mountains.  When making tours to Mauritius, each guest will find something to their liking: you can dive, go fishing in the open ocean, fly over the jungle, simply sunbathe on the beach or soak up the spa. </p><p>  Highly comfortable hotels in Mauritius help tourists to make holidays on the island unforgettable.  The most chic hotel The Oberoi Mauritius 6 * has become just the perfect place for young couples to spend their <span>honeymoon.</span>  Cozy villas in the fabulous territory of the hotel are hidden from prying eyes and provide an unforgettable vacation for lovers.  Moreover, the bride lives here for free and as a <span>gift to the newlyweds they</span> are given a bottle of good aromatic wine.  Reviews of Mauritius hotels speak of the extraordinary luxury that many 5 * class hotels offer their guests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A truly pearl among luxury hotels is rightfully considered The Residence 5 *.  Guests of the hotel are given the opportunity to become the owner of a VIP card, which provides exclusive opportunities for accommodation: a bottle of expensive champagne as a gift, daily free lunches, discounts on drinks in the minibar and many services provided by the hotel.  This hotel also welcomes newlyweds with hospitality and makes staying for the bride absolutely free.  Such hotels in Mauritius naturally attract the attention of young couples who come here not only on their <span>honeymoon,</span> but also to hold a wedding ceremony here. </p><p>  Heritage Hotel Le Telfair Golf &amp; SPA 5 * deluxe resembles a colonial mansion of the 19th century, its cozy location surrounded by wonderful vegetation reminds guests of the Garden of Eden.  A fountain and beautiful sculptures, close proximity to the Indian Ocean, all this makes an ideal choice for a wedding ceremony.  To do this, a special gazebo is installed in the garden or on the beach, depending on your desire.  The gazebo is decorated with flowers and becomes the perfect romantic venue for a memorable wedding.  As in other hotels of this class, the bride lives on its territory for free. </p><p>  The hotels of Mauritius are perfect not only for honeymooners, there are also hotels that make it possible to spend a wonderful family vacation.  Shanti Maurice - A Nira Resort 5 * deluxe hotel is surrounded by the turquoise crystal clear water of the ocean literally from the first steps on its territory.  This hotel, in fact, is a spa resort, its unique design is inextricably linked with the philosophy of a relaxing and healthy holiday.  The whole design is made in the spirit of an exquisite blend of modern style and traditional styles of African and Mauritian cultures.  This hotel has prepared a unique offer for families with children: when adults are accommodated in a double room of any category, a separate Junior Suite is provided free of charge for children from 1 to 3 children up to 12 years old.  All hotels in Mauritius located on the ocean on white sand under palm trees in the bounty style are designed to relax richly and beautifully. </p>
