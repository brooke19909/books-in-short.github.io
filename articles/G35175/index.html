Otherwise, the advance payment will not be refunded, and the visitor will have to pay the number and all booked services. </p><h2>  Reviews of hotels in Pinsk </h2><p>  The most laudatory reviews of visitors can be found about the Sport Hotel.  Guests praise the staff and are quite happy with the comfort of the rooms.  The complaints are caused only by periodic disconnection of the Internet. </p><p>  Visitors also leave excellent reviews for the Volna Hotel.  They like clean and comfortable rooms, the level of service, friendly and helpful staff.  Guests expect to arrive at this place again upon arrival in Pinsk. </p><p>  But about the hotel "Pripyat" guests respond unflattering.  Residents complain about old repairs, dilapidated flooring, hard and uncomfortable beds.  Food according to guests also leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  The same opinion remained and guests of the hotel "Aelita".  According to them, all rooms need to be repaired for a long time, they have terribly creaky beds and uncomfortable mattresses.  All bedding in dirty stains.  The railway is very close, unpleasant sounds of a moving train are constantly heard.  Guests complain about the poor isolation of the rooms, because of which the voices from the next room are perfectly audible. </p><p>  Despite all the shortcomings in Pinsk, you can find a decent hotel in which guests can relax in comfort. </p>
