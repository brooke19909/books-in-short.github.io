Regarding the needles, this tool is very convenient.  Firstly, he is alone, there is no need to coordinate both hands at once, it is more convenient for them to pick up the thread, during the knitting process there is only 1 closed loop, respectively, the loops cannot slip and open, ruining the product globally, you can adjust the stitch height with different types of columns and so Further.  Of course, there are drawbacks, for example, the canvas connected by this tool turns out to be quite rigid and practically does not stretch, however, if we talk about interior napkins, decorative umbrellas or toys, these are also rather positive aspects of this technique.  Learning to knit is quite simple and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Bear" class="if uuid-3060942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3060942.jpg"></div><p>  This is especially fun to do, creating crochet amigurumi toys.  Schemes for beginners to work in this technique, it is easy to find on the Internet.  As a rule, they are small, but at the same time it is possible to work out the increase and reduction of loops, working with different shapes, threads, and also learn how to assemble products.  The main thing is that the canvas should be very dense so that the filler does not peek between the columns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the Internet and magazines you can find many crochet toy patterns for beginners, experienced craftsmen and professionals, but this approach, although very convenient, does not reveal the individuality of the master.  From time to time, similar products are obtained according to these schemes.  But what if you need to create an exclusive toy?  It is not so difficult.  The main thing is to understand the basic principle: any, even the most difficult toy is a combination of simple forms.  Accordingly, if you learn to knit them, you can knit anything. </p><h2>  Basic flat shapes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Schemes of flat shapes" class="if uuid-3064067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3064067.jpg"></div><p>  These elements are often used in knitting not only toys.  Crocheting patterns for beginners can be quite difficult, so the following is a detailed description of the process.  Here are the lightest schemes of basic shapes.  In all schemes, only 2 types of loops were used: air loops marked with ovals, shortening - VP, and single crochet (RLS) - sticks. </p><h2>  A circle </h2><ol><li>  Collect 4 VPs, connect them into a ring, mark the junction with a contrasting thread or a special marker. </li><li>  From each VP, associate 2 sc. </li><li>  From each RLS, associate 2 RLS. </li><li>  Alternation 1/1.  From odd loops, knit 2 scs, from odd loops - 1 sc. </li><li>  Alternation 1/2.  From the first loop - 2 sc, from the second and third - 1 sc. </li><li>  Alternating 1/3.  2 sc from one, then 3 sc. </li></ol><p>  In each next row, the number of columns between 2 RLS from one (1/4, 1/5 ...) increases.  The increments will represent 8 lines starting from the center and moving in a spiral. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Circles are often used for eyes, noses, ears of crocheted toys.  The scheme for beginners is quite simple, in addition, even from the same circles you can make the basis for a toy. </p><h2>  Frog </h2><p>  So, you need yarn in three colors: green, yellow and red.  Knit 3 identical circles of different colors.  Next, fold the red circle in half and insert it between the yellow and green, combining the sides.  Sew them together (green with yellow to half, then red with yellow and green), leaving a small hole for the filler.  Fill the blank with synthetic winterizer, sew to the end.  The workpiece is ready.  It remains to attach the eyes and paws.  The hind legs are a circle and a triangle, the forelegs are triangles with stripes (several straight rows of RLS). </p><h2>  Oval </h2><ol><li>  Dial 6 VP. </li><li>  From 5 VPs, connect 5 RLS, from the sixth - 4 RLS (with the product turning clockwise), then from 4 VP - 4 RLS, from the last - 3 RLS. </li><li>  6 sc, 2 sc from 1 - repeat 2 times (end face of the oval), 6 sc, 2 out of 1 sc 2 times. </li></ol><p>  Increases should be made only at the ends of the oval.  This figure is actively used for the design of the muzzle and stomach, as well as for the manufacture of the foot. </p><h2>  Square </h2><ol><li>  4 VP. </li><li>  Alternation of 1 PRS and 1 VP. </li><li>  From each RLS, knit 1 RLS, from the VP - 1 RLS, 1 VP, 1 RLS. </li></ol><p>  In each next row, the principle of paragraph 3 remains, that is, between the RLS + VP + RLS groups in the fourth row there will be 5 RLS, in the fifth row - 7 RLS, etc. </p><p>  Crocheted toys for beginners with a square pattern are quite rare.  Usually a simple canvas is used for this, but this option has 3 advantages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  There is no alternation of front and back rows. </li><li>  The parties will be the same anyway. </li><li>  You can knit a square until it reaches the desired size, which in the case of a simple fabric is impossible, since its size is set in the front row. </li></ol><p>  You can use this figure as a body for a doll - a pocket or mittens, as well as decorate a finished toy with pockets or patches, like a Teddy bear. </p><h2>  Pentagon </h2><p>  It is not difficult to knit a pentagon, like any other polygonal figure (six-, seven-, octagons), since the basic principle remains the same as for a square, only the rays leaving the center (RLS + VP + RLS group) as many as there were loops in the front row.  In the case of the octagon, it is better to dial 4VP, in the second row from each VP knit 2 RLS, bringing the number of loops to 8, and after that start the alternation of RLS and VP.  This will make the hole in the center minimal.  Such figures are found very rarely in toy schemes. </p><h2>  Triangle </h2><ol><li>  Bind 1 VP </li><li>  2 VP lift, 6 sc. </li><li>  2 VP, 1 PRS at the junction of the previous row and VP (obtained from the last column and the rise, and RLS), 2 RLS, from the fourth column - 3 RLS, it is better to mark it (it is always necessary to knit 3 RLS from it), then 2 RLS and 2 RLS from the last column. </li><li>  2 VP, 1 sc in the first column, 4 sc, 3 sc from one, 4 sc, 2 sc from the last. </li></ol><p>  The number of rows depends on the required size of the triangle, in each row the increments will be at the edges (2 of 1 RLS) and in the center (3 of 1 RLS).  This is a very convenient scheme for beginners.  Crochet toys knit triangular ears, paws (for waterfowl), beaks, tails and much more. </p><h2>  Basic volumetric figures </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Volumetric diagrams" class="if uuid-3061024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3061024.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting flat toys is quite simple, but not very interesting, they are uncomfortable to play and impossible to put on a shelf.  That is why flat figures are more often used to complement crocheted toys.  Patterns for beginners for knitting voluminous products are a little different in complexity from simple figures, and the basic principle is built on the example of a circle. </p><h2>  Trumpet </h2><p>  The simplest volumetric element.  To tie it, you need to dial a certain amount of VP to create a ring of the desired diameter, and then knit in a spiral RLS without changing the initial number of loops.  It is used to make the neck, tail, long parts of the arms and legs. </p><h2>  Ball and ellipsoid </h2><p>  These are the most common building blocks of crochet toys for beginners.  The diagrams and descriptions of the beginning of these forms are similar to a circle with one difference - in the initial ring there are not 4, but 3 VPs, there will be 6 and not 8 increase lines, respectively. When the size of the circumference reaches the equator length of the required ball, tie 6-10 rows without changing the number of loops, and then proceed to knitting the second hemisphere, focusing on the beginning scheme, but moving from the outer edge of the scheme inward.  In those places where 2 scs out of 1 are marked, knit, on the contrary, 2 scs together. </p><p>  To obtain an ellipsoid (the so-called "volume oval" or "elongated ball"), you can increase the number of straight rows, thereby making an even body with rounded edges, or alternate rows with additions with simple rows, then the ellipsoid will be more elongated along the edges with maximum diameter only in the center. </p><h2>  Caterpillar </h2><div class="photo" data-original="makalepark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amigurumi Caterpillar" class="if uuid-3060929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3060929.jpg"></div><p>  Such a product is quite easy to crochet.  The diagram of a simple toy for beginners looks like a ball without the last three rows (with the exception of the last, it should be whole).  It is necessary to connect 5 identical large elements (14 rows) and 2 small (6 rows).  Horns to perform in the form of pipes with a set of 3 VP. </p><h2>  Cone </h2><p>  Knitting a cone is carried out according to the same principle as a circle, but in this case there will be not 8 rays of increases, but only 4. </p><ol><li>  4 VP. </li><li>  From each VP - 2 sc (total 8 loops). </li><li>  2 sc from 1, 1 sc from 1, repeat 3 more times (12 loops). </li><li>  2 sc from 1, 2 sc from 2 (16 loops). </li><li>  2 sc in 1, 3 sc in 3 (20 loops). </li></ol><p>  Thus, in each row, 4 columns will be added.  Also, depending on the required circuit, you can use 2, 3, 5, etc.  initial loops, the number of added RLS will be equal to the initial number of VP.  The cone with the steepest slopes will be when dialing in 2 loops, and the more loops will be initially dialed, the more gentle the slopes will be. </p><p>  Crochet toys for beginners with a cone pattern are very common.  It can be the noses of mice or foxes, night caps, or an independent product - a tree.  It can be performed both in the classical technique of knitting sc, and with elongated loops, giving the tree a more fluffy look.  You can decorate such a Christmas tree with balls and serpentine (in the chain of VP in each chain knit 3 scs), crocheted. </p><h2>  Compound Shapes </h2><p>  When the technique of knitting simple figures is mastered, you can proceed to the most interesting part - their combination. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet Hares" class="if uuid-3060966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3060966.jpg"></div><p>  For example, crocheting such a toy for a beginner with basic figure schemes will be quite simple. </p><ul><li>  The head is a ball. </li><li>  Ears - a ball to the middle with the transition to a long cone (the fewer decreases, the longer the ears). </li><li>  The body is an oval, the number of rows with additions is 2 less than that of the 1 hemisphere of the head, then there are as many straight rows, then the decrease is similar to the upper part. </li><li>  Upper legs - a ball with a transition into the pipe after two rows of decreases. </li><li>  Legs - a ball turning into a reverse cone (knit not from the top, but from the base, knitting 2 loops together).  When the number of loops equal to the loops in the circumference of the hands remains in the circle, switch to direct knitting of the pipe. </li><li>  Tail - a ball equal to the size of the lower part of the forelegs.  After all the parts are ready, stitch them together. </li></ul><p>  Important!  The stuffing is done before the closed figure is completely connected.  Usually this is done 2 rows before closing or, in the case of a complex shape, such as legs, as necessary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compound shapes in toys" class="if uuid-3060949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3060949.jpg"></div><p>  Such toys are performed almost completely together, that is, the head - the ball passes into the body - the pipe, which is then divided into 2 parts and is also made in the form of pipes with closure according to the principle of the ball.  Hands - a tube with a hemisphere at the end.  For a fox and a wolf, the nose and ears are made according to the cone pattern, for the hare, the ears are cones passing into the pipe, and for the bear, the ears have 2 separate hemispheres. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkey crocheted. Apply circle and oval" class="if uuid-3060976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3060976.jpg"></div><p>  The monkey‚Äôs hands and feet are performed in the same way as the rabbits, the body is a ball turning into a cone, the tail is a pipe, the head is a ball, and the ears are gray: 2 circles of the same size, connected 1 side without additives, white part is a simple circle smaller, muzzle - oval. </p><p>  In order to <span>crochet a toy, a</span> scheme for beginners may not be necessary.  It is enough to learn to see simple figures in complex forms.  And when this happens, the master will have amazing opportunities to connect everything that he sees or presents without a long search for suitable schemes in magazines and on the Internet. </p>
