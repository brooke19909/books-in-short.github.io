This five-star hotel, as its name implies, is located in the resort of Pattaya, or rather, in its northern, quietest area of ​​Vang Amat.  To the railway station - three kilometers, but to the city center on foot for about ten minutes.  It should immediately be said that the Centara Grand Mirage hotel is a thematic one.  It is built based on the story of Conan Doyle.  This is the real "Lost World".  The vast territory of the complex has its own water park.  In addition to the usual pools for Thai "fives", guests of "Centara" can enjoy slides, a "calm river" and other water attractions for the whole family.  And for the level of service, this hotel has been among the first hundred of the best resort hotels in the world for four years running.  His management is part of the well-known chain of Central Hospitality International. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort pattaya" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of Pattaya and Vang Amat Beach </h2><p>  There are two common proverbs regarding this <span>Thai resort</span> .  First: "Good people go to heaven, and depraved people go to Pattaya."  The resort is considered the capital of the Thai sex industry.  The second proverb says: "Going to Pattaya by sea is like going to Paris to swim in the Seine."  It is understood that the resort has so many temptations that there simply will not be time for a beach vacation.  And the city promenades of Pattaya and the coastal water area are not very clean.  For clean sand and turquoise water, tourists travel to nearby islands or in the vicinity of the resort.  One of the beaches that is appreciated for the harmony between well-groomed and developed infrastructure is Vang Amat.  Also called the area in the northern part of Pattaya.  In this respectable and quiet part of the resort is a huge hotel complex Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya 5 *.  Exactly ten minutes to the rampant life that boils day and night on Woking Street (Pattaya's main street).  At the same time, you can enjoy the tranquility, silence and comfort in the hotel itself.  It is good for family people and for youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort pattaya 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Resort <span>Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya</span> is a two eighteen-story tower, interconnected by the largest <span>water park in Pattaya.</span>  The whole territory is designed in the style of a lost paradise valley, untouched by civilization.  Numerous pools are connected by bridges, sometimes suspended.  Tourists talk about waterfalls, cascades, lazily flowing river.  Due to the specifics of the hotel, families with children choose it.  Moreover, the accommodation of small tourists in the hotel is free.  Reviews say that the territory of the complex is so large that it is just right to get lost.  Everywhere greenery, well-groomed paths, which carefully give the appearance of paths in the jungle.  Two buildings of the hotel are built in such a way that all rooms in them have a view of the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  They are most popular among tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort pattaya hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you came to Thailand for a week, you are unlikely to have time to get out of the water entertainment town, which is located in the Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya.  A photo of this water park is one of Pattaya's business cards.  In the evening, after putting the children to bed, you can go to the center, watch a transvestite show, go-go-show program or just have a dark Guinness in one of the airish pubs.  Are there any interesting places in Pattaya not related to the sex industry?  Of course!  Tourists recommend visiting a crocodile farm or a zoo with tigers Si-Racha.  Children will be interested in elephant trekking in the jungle.  From sea excursions, tourists recommend a trip to the coral <span>island of Koh Lan.</span>  Those who are not alien to Asian spirituality will be able to improve their karma at Wat Yan Temple.  Near Pattaya there are several lakes where you can fish for catfish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Another positive feature that is often mentioned by reviews is that all guest rooms at Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya have a very spacious balcony.  It is even furnished with comfortable chairs and a rattan table.  The rooms are also very spacious with a pleasant psychedelic design.  Even the “standard” has an area of ​​forty-two square meters.  For large families, there are simply huge deluxe ocean face family residence rooms with a separate children's room and bunk beds in it.  But in the "standards" there is a dedicated seating area.  All rooms have a refrigerator, self-catering facilities for making hot drinks, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, a personal safe and individually controlled air conditioning.  The minibar is charged for a fee.  In addition to daily cleaning, the rooms are preparing the room for bed: a maid puts a bed, lights lamps, brings crushed ice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort pattaya reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082035.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed at the hotel and where else they go to eat </h2><p>  Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya does not practice an all-inclusive system.  All reviews mention only breakfasts, which, according to tourists, are very satisfying and varied.  Besides the fact that nobody from the Oasis restaurant went hungry, everyone was able to choose the right dishes for themselves.  Fans of Asian cuisine, fans of traditional food, and parents who fed their children cereals and pancakes were satisfied.  The hotel also has other restaurants.  These are Ginger and Lime (Asian cuisine), Aqua (seafood) and Flames, specializing in grill and barbecue.  Most tourists prefer to have lunch and dinner at the "macaques" on the beach, or in a cafe with a buffet outside the hotel.  But many visited the bars of the hotel, of which several (including the pools) were satisfied.  Near the hotel there is a Russian restaurant "Teremok".  The local cuisine is not sharp and more familiar to our tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water park and beach </h2><p>  The murmur of water will accompany you all your vacation at Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya 5 *.  The water park of this hotel consists of many pools in the form of fabulous lagoons.  A river flows throughout the hotel complex.  It can be fused on rubber rings.  There are many water slides, both for extreme sportsmen and for a more cautious audience.  What pleased the tourists was that for very young children special rides were also equipped.  The shallow pool has sand off the coast.  There, kids can mess with buckets and shovels, if, for example, the sea is stormy.  Compared to the city <span>beach of Pattaya,</span> Wang Amat looks simply gorgeous.  But, reviews warn, you should always carry a room key.  The entrance to the hotel from the beach is protected from the public, who also would like to use the water park for free, like hotel guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Centara grand mirage beach resort pattaya photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1082039.jpg" width="600"></div>
