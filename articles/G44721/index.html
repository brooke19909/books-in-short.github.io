And they show that every year the number of Russian citizens going on a trip to China exceeds three million people.  What is the reason for such popularity of the Celestial Empire?  Of course, with the proximity of the two states and the vast territories of Russia itself.  For residents of Siberia and the Far East, China is almost the only budget tourist destination. </p><p>  Of course, one should take into account the year-round nature of such trips.  In winter, you can sunbathe on the beaches of Hainan, in summer - at resorts in mainland China.  A huge proportion of tourists come to this country on business and not least for shopping.  The conquerors of the peaks and admirers of oriental wisdom beckons mysterious Tibet.  And those who do not trust traditional medicine are attracted to hospitals in China, where herbal healing, acupuncture, homeopathy are practiced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jhhotels.com" data-author=": jhhotels, "><img itemprop="image" alt="China excursion program" class="if uuid-2563101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563101.jpg"></div><p>  This country is full of attractions that all travelers would like to see.  Therefore, tours to China often have a narrow specialization.  In this article we will consider what travel agencies in Russia offer in this area. </p><h2>  Excursion trips to one city </h2><p>  China is a huge country.  Moving through its territory immediately increases the cost of the entire trip.  Travelers mainly fly to China to one large city to see the sights in it and its environs.  And what is the symbol of the Middle Kingdom?  Of course, the Great Wall of China!  Of course, there are tours to Shanghai and Harbin, but the lion's share of travelers prefer to go to the capital.  The cost of such a tour depends on the status of the hotel, room category, days spent in Beijing, and the richness of the excursion program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we consider tours from Moscow, especially since the price includes a flight, the picture opens as follows: with three stars in hotels with breakfast and one sightseeing tour, such a weekly tour will cost $ 755 (48,100 rubles) per person.  A similar trip to Beijing, but with accommodation in a five-star hotel increases the price by only one hundred dollars (6202 rubles).  Moreover, the price includes three excursions, including a trip to the Great Wall of China.  Let's look at this tour in more detail.  After all, he is the best offer for price and quality. </p><h2>  A seven-day trip to Beijing from the Wand tour operator </h2><p>  Every Saturday from June 2 to December 22, two Aeroflot charters will fly from Sheremetyevo (Moscow).  One of them arrives in Beijing at one in the morning, local time, and the second at ten in the morning.  Night tourists are immediately delivered to the 5 * hotel upon arrival, but they pay this first night (or rather, its balance) separately.  The passengers of the second flight, who had already had breakfast on board the plane, were immediately taken on a sightseeing tour of Beijing.  Particular attention is paid to the largest square in the world of Tiananmen and the Gugong Imperial Palace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chinaholidays.co.uk" data-author=": chinaholidays, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourist trip to China" class="if uuid-2563116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563116.jpg"></div><p>  After lunch at the Peking Duck restaurant (included in the price), sightseers leave for <span>Beihai Park</span> and walk along the famous street of jewelers of Lulichang.  On the second <span>day, tourists</span> expect a trip to the Great Wall.  After lunch, sightseers visit the Yiheyuan Summer Palace and Olympic venues. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And the day ends with a tea ceremony.  On the third day, excursions to the temples of Heaven and Yonghegun are planned, as well as a visit to the Tibetan medicine center.  On the morning of the fourth day, tourists can visit the Panda House and the <span>Beijing Zoo.</span>  The rest of the time remaining in China before departure is free.  Tourists can devote it to shopping or independent trips around the city and the surrounding area. </p><h2>  Futuristic Shanghai </h2><p>  This city - the largest in number in China - is often called "Asian Paris" because of the gallant development of the Bund, as well as the "Pearl of the East."  Shanghai attracts not only excursion groups, but also business people.  After all, here you can buy textiles, shoes, thousands of types of tea. </p><p>  Many travel agencies in Russia organize trips to China with a narrow specialization - shopping.  Shanghai, as well as special economic zones in the <span>Pearl River</span> Delta are the main points of such voyages.  But if you go on a shopping tour, then you will not see any excursions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eaviations.com" data-author=": eaviations., "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Shanghai" class="if uuid-2563135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563135.jpg"></div><p>  The agency assumes the organization of flight, transfer and hotel reservation with breakfast.  But the payment for such a tour goes on a daily basis (more precisely, on hotel nights), as the Moscow-Shanghai liner flies daily, except on Mondays.  The package price starts at 681 dollars, or 42,235 rubles (two nights in a superior double room). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beijing - Shanghai </h2><p>  If you are interested in the excursion program in China, then the tours should be chosen accordingly.  After all, Shanghai is shocking with its mixture of antiquity and tomorrow.  An eight-day tour allows you to get acquainted with the sights of the two cities.  Every Saturday, Aeroflot aircraft delivers sightseeing to Beijing, where they spend four days. </p><p>  During this time, they get acquainted with the sights of the capital of China.  The program includes five excursions with lunch and the ability to book additional reviews.  In the evening of the fourth day of stay in <span>China, tourists</span> leave by night train to Shanghai (soft coupe for 4 people).  The tour price includes two excursions, and all of them take place on the first day in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.spabusiness.com" data-author=": HELEN ANDREWS, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Tours in China" class="if uuid-2563146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563146.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists visiting the Garden of Joy, the <span>Temple of the Jade Buddha,</span> go up to the Pearl of the East TV tower, visit the Museum of History, and walk along the pedestrian Nankinlu Street.  For the remaining two days in Shanghai, travelers have the opportunity to go on trips to Suzhou and Hangzhou for an additional fee (booking is mandatory in Moscow). </p><p>  On the morning of the eighth day, tourists fly back to Sheremetyevo.  The cost of such a ticket to Beijing (Shanghai) starts from 87.5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Beach vacation.  Hainan </h2><p>  There is an island in China that lies in the same latitudes as Hawaii.  Hainan is very popular among Russian tourists.  You can sunbathe and swim there all year round, but the best time for a beach holiday falls on the period from November to April.  If you already go to the sea on a trip to China from Moscow, it is better to Hainan.  The Chinese government has made every effort to bring this resort island to world standards.  When you travel to Sanya or other Hainan towns, you will find only a calm measured rest on the beach. </p><p>  A usual trip to the island involves a stay in China for 8 days.  Some travel agencies give customers the right to continue their vacation on a tropical island for another week.  A trip for 7 nights to Hainan costs from 32.5 (accommodation in a 3 * hotel standard) to 65 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Beach holidays in summer </h2><p>  Despite the fact that since May, Hainan has been falling into the zone of influence of monsoon rains, the tourist flow does not stop there, but only weakens a bit.  After all, showers do not happen every day, and often they take place at night. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": PDChina, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tour in Beidaihe from Vladivostok" class="if uuid-2563152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563152.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer months, for the Russian tourists, besides Hainan, the Yellow Sea beach resorts, such as Beidaihe, Weihai, Qingdao and Dalian, become available.  The season lasts until September.  Such tours <span>to China from Vladivostok are</span> especially popular <span>.</span>  After all, beach people do not even need to spend money on expensive air transport.  To Beidaihe from Vladivostok there is a high-speed train!  Therefore, trips there are quite cheap.  You can even buy a weekend tour.  But even with air travel, a ticket from the Russian Far East will not cost space money.  For a vacation at the resorts of the Yellow Sea, a resident of Khabarovsk or Ussuriysk will have to pay 15 thousand rubles.  To spend a vacation in Hainan in the summer, you can purchase a ticket for 25 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Combined trips to China </h2><p>  Even if a person wants to buy cheap textiles or other consumer goods for resale, he will still want to see something in his host country.  The same applies to beach people and those who come to China for recreation.  Therefore, travel agencies and offer combined trips to China.  The prices of such vouchers are higher than those that provide for a simple beach holiday or shopping.  After all, the program includes excursions and transfers from Beijing to various cities of the PRC.  The most popular among tourists is a combined tour to the capital of China (3 days) + beach holidays on the Hainan Island.  Business people may be interested in a combined tour of Beijing + Hong Kong. </p><h2>  Treatment in china </h2><p>  Dalian in the province of Liaoning in the north-east of the country is not only a beach resort on the shores of the Yellow Sea.  Thanks to healing springs, the city is considered the main health resort in China.  People come here both for the sake of a general increase in tone, and for the treatment of serious illnesses.  Moreover, in local sanatoriums, not only modern medical equipment is used, on which high-class doctors work, but also practice traditional healing methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": trover, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wellness trips to China" class="if uuid-2563160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563160.jpg"></div><p>  The price of the ticket depends on the cost of the flight, the category of the hotel room and the length of time spent in China.  As a rule, such treatment tours are not shorter than 15 days.  Indeed, in order to achieve a long healing effect, you need to go through the entire course of procedures. </p><p>  Travel agency takes care of organizing a flight and accommodation in a sanatorium.  But tourists pay for medical procedures separately.  Going to Dalyan, you need to take care of translating the medical history and referring the doctor to English. </p><h2>  Ecotourism, esoteric and extreme trips </h2><p>  Among the citizens of the Russian Federation there is, though not a very large, but convinced group of people who believe that the best vacation is not lazy spending time on the beach, but trekking in the mountains, mountain climbing, river rafting or admiring natural beauties.  For such clients, travel agencies organize trips to China, where the main points are the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan, the ‚Äúroof of the world‚Äù Tibet and other similar corners of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diveprice.com" data-author=": diveprice, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ecotourism in China" class="if uuid-2563165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2563165.jpg"></div><p>  It should be said that after the release of the movie ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù, those wishing to see the Zhangjiajie Nature Park (which served as the scenery for the planet Pandora) significantly gained.  Prices for such vouchers are quite high.  It is very difficult to assemble a group. </p><h2>  Travel to China: reviews </h2><p>  Acquaintance with the ancient culture of this great country leaves no one indifferent.  Tourists emphasize the exotic trip.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if I‚Äôve been to another planet‚Äù - this is the main refrain of reviews.  Those who have visited China for a beach holiday praise the facilities and service at resort hotels. </p>
