    <h2>  Important accommodation information </h2><p>  There are several important nuances that should be noted when talking about Elysees <span>Hotel 4 (Egypt,</span> Hurghada).  And these points concern the reservation.  So, check-in, as in many other hotels, takes place at 2 p.m., and departure - before noon. </p><p>  Even for guests special conditions may apply.  So, for example, if guests have arrived with a child, and he is not yet 12 years old, then he can stay in the beds that are in the reserved apartments, completely free of charge.  And if the baby is two years old, then the administration will put a crib in the room.  This service is also free. </p><p>  If the child is over 12 years old, then you will have to pay for his accommodation - but not the full amount, but 50%.  It is important to know that in order to get an extra bed, you must first contact the Elysees Hotel 4 (Egypt, Hurghada).  There are many requests, so you should be safe for your own benefit. </p><p>  And the last nuance - if a person has planned a trip with his pet, then you need to abandon this venture.  The administration does not allow animals to be accommodated in rooms, so it is better to search with whom to leave your pet at home. </p>
