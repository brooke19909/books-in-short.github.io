    <p>  <strong>Inherited</strong> </p><p>  Twenty years ago, almost every woman could quickly and clearly tell <span>how to knit a sock with knitting needles.</span>  Indeed, there is nothing complicated in this, except, perhaps, that it was necessary to do this not on two usual knitting needles, but with the help of five at once. </p><p>  The process itself can be conditionally divided into three stages, the first of which is the choice of material and tools.  The material will be yarn.  When choosing it, you should pay attention to the fact that pure wool will prick bare skin, and therefore it is better to choose the skein, which includes a partial addition of acrylic.  The number of stocking knitting needles (five of them, pointed at both ends) must correspond to the indication on the accompanying document for the yarn.  But, as a rule, socks are knitted on a set with a mark of 3.5-4. </p><p>  The second stage is carrying out measurements.  For this, it is necessary to determine the length of the foot, the height of the heel, the foot coverage at the height of the proposed gum and the length from the heel to the little finger. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The third stage is creation itself. </p><p>  <strong>Fascinating process</strong> </p><p>  How to start <span>knitting socks with knitting needles?</span>  Of course, with a set of loops.  To do this, in the usual way, the number of loops that corresponds to the coverage of the leg is gained.  It is simple to determine: leg coverage / 10 * - the number of loops for 10 cm (from the indication on the document to the yarn).  It should be borne in mind that it should be divisible by 4 without a remainder. If it does not work out, then missing loops are added to the estimated number.  After which it is evenly distributed on the four knitting needles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start knitting socks" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/233532.jpg" width="388"></div>

    <p>  Many beginner needlewomen are surprised when they hear the phrase ‚ÄúKnit socks on 5 knitting needles,‚Äù but this is true.  The fifth spoke is working.  Once the loops are distributed, you should begin to knit elastic.  To do this, on each spoke, one front loop, one wrong loop should be knitted.  It should also be borne in mind that the spoke released from the loops becomes working. </p><p>  Having knitted the height of the elastic, you should proceed to the formation of the heel.  To do this, all stitches from two knitting needles are knitted and transferred to the working <span>surface</span> , and the remaining two remain at rest.  Once the required length is tied, you should mentally divide all the loops into four segments.  Then knit ¬æ of them, with the last connected to the first of the remaining quarter.  Turn the work over and repeat the same procedure, only on the other side.  And so in every row.  Work on the formation of the heel ends when the number of loops that is characteristic of each of the remaining spokes remains on the spoke. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next step in <span>how to knit a</span> sock with knitting needles is the formation of a lift.  To do this, from each side of the heel raise an equal number of loops, after which they are distributed equally on two knitting needles.  Next, knit a single stitch with a front stitch all rows on four knitting needles. </p><p>  In the second row at the end of the first knit, knit 2 and 3 loops together from the end, then, without changing the number of loops, form a continuation on the second and third knitting needles (those that did not participate in the formation of the heel).  On the fourth, they again knit together 2 and 3 loops, but now already from the beginning.  The third row is performed by a simple facial stitch.  This order must be repeated until an equal number of loops remain on all four knitting needles.  Then you should knit in the usual way to the toe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knit socks on 5 knitting needles" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/233533.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The toe is formed in a similar way.  To do this, upon reaching the length to the little finger, the 2nd and 3rd loops are knitted together in the first and third in the end and in the second and fourth at first in the first row.  The next row fits intact.  This should be done until one loop is left on the knitting needles.  They are closed in the usual way. </p><p>  With this simple method, you can master the process of how to knit a sock with knitting needles. </p>
