    <p>  Let's start with the fact that the 525 series phone is the direct successor to the 520 model, which once became one of the best-selling in the Lumia line.  This is explained simply - the phone has good technical equipment, attractive design and at the same time affordable price, which gives reason to attribute it to the ‚Äústudent‚Äù class of devices for young people.  Yes, and the Windows Phone operating system, which still remains a ‚Äúbold decision‚Äù on the market due to its relative unpopularity, makes it possible to take a chance and try something new. </p><p>  Just <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 525, reviews of which will be a little further, a little finalized, improved and released with a new serial code.  At the same time, the device did not change its price class and the general concept of a ‚Äúyouth‚Äù device.  And then, how successfully the developers managed to do this, read on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Case design </h2><p>  It is customary to start all reviews with a description of the appearance of the device, its design.  So we will do this time.  Externally, the <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 525 smartphone (reviews confirm this) looks pretty bright and vibrant.  This is not surprising, because the body of the device has removable color panels in yellow, orange and white.  With their help, you can personalize the look of your phone - and this is clearly a winning approach from Nokia.  What else attracts the appearance of a smartphone is the gloss.  The design of the Nokia Lumia 525 (reviews say this) looks like some kind of candy. </p>

    <p>  The build quality of the case can be called acceptable.  In some recommendations, buyers specify that they noticed a gap between the panels (or rather, the cover and the base of the case).  However, this phenomenon, apparently, does not apply to all devices: some phones are assembled quite tightly.  The material from which the model is assembled is thick plastic. </p><h2>  Device screen </h2><p>  The model has a 4-inch display, developed on the basis of IPS technology.  Due to this, the picture on the phone is transmitted such that in quality it can be compared with the image on inexpensive Chinese Android phones.  Resolution for Nokia Lumia 525 (user reviews call it normal) - 480 by 800 pixels.  Of course, when you look closely at the display, you can notice the ‚Äúgraininess‚Äù, but in everyday life you get used to it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The good news is the use on the device of a system that allows you to work with the phone even with gloves on.  This is due to some kind of modern technology, which gives the device "supersensitivity".  For residents of the northern regions, this thing really seems useful. </p><h2>  Snapdragon processor </h2><p>  Reviews are called the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of NokiaLumia 525 Yellow by the nimble Snapdragon S4 with a <span>clock frequency</span> of 1 GHz.  This is enough to ensure that the device responds promptly to user touch, does not freeze, and does not freeze even when playing complex programs and colorful games. </p><p>  As the developers explain, this is achieved due to the special technology of asynchronous operation.  This mechanism allows you to organize the maximum return on the processor with minimal battery consumption.  And besides, with such work, the Nokia Lumia 525 smartphone, the reviews we reviewed, does not heat up.  Unlike some Android phones. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  In general, if you believe the <span>technical documentation, the</span> device is equipped with a 5-megapixel main camera, capable of taking pictures with a 4-fold increase.  There is also autofocus with a phased double keystroke.  In addition to photos, the Nokia Lumia 525 phone (reviews about the quality of shooting, though not the most flattering) can also create videos.  According to the manufacturers, shooting in 720p quality is allowed here (which means actually HD-format). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Perhaps you are interested in such characteristics, but you should evaluate the real work of the smartphone‚Äôs camera based on feedback from live users.  And they, as already noted, are far from the best here.  In general, this is a common problem of budget-grade Lumia smartphones: the quality of photos and videos on them leaves much to be desired, if we talk about clear and colorful pictures. </p>

    <p>  However, there is a Panorama mode, there is a flash - in general, everything is not so bad for personal use. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The device, as we all understand, is running the Windows Phone operating system.  As indicated in the instructions for it, the device is equipped with the 8th version of this OS, which is characterized by stability, a wide range of applications and a rather convenient and intuitive interface.  Due to this, it would be wrong to say anything bad in her direction - this system has already shown itself to be excellent in its time, which is why Microsoft began to move on, releasing the 9th and 10th generation of Windows. </p><p>  Of course, there will always be proponents of Android or iOS claiming that WP is extremely uncomfortable and uncomfortable for everyday use.  However, believe me, while working with the phone, you will cease to notice this after a week.  You can get used to it quite easily. </p>

    <h2>  Other characteristics </h2><p>  Nokia Lumia 525 White (owner reviews say that this color is for some reason the most popular) also has a wide range of additional functions and features that should be mentioned in this review.  Well, let's start looking for them in the technical description.  These are various modules - Bluetooth, Wifi, GPS;  as well as software add-ons like HERE cards, SkyDrive <span>cloud storage</span> (7 GB), Office suite, various business programs and other services from Windows Phone.  In this regard, Nokia Lumia 525 Yellow (reviews confirm this) is of particular interest to those who have never before encountered this platform. </p><p>  You can also mention the battery of the phone.  As already noted, the smartphone‚Äôs processor operates in some special mode that regulates the activity of the cores, thereby reducing battery consumption.  This leads to the fact that the device can work with the Internet via Wifi-connection for 7.5 hours.  Also about the Nokia Lumia 525 Orange, reviews indicate that the phone lasts for 16 hours on 2G networks and 11 on a 3G connection.  It should be said that these are good indicators, given the small battery capacity - only 1430 mAh. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What could be the Nokia Lumia 525 Yellow reviews?  About a phone whose price does not clearly exceed the average price in a budget class?  For your money, a smartphone is just a great solution.  It has a tolerable technical filling that allows you to perform the tasks that an ordinary user faces.  The phone is also characterized by speed - and it is extremely pleasing to the buyer, especially those who are used to working with ‚Äúbraking‚Äù smartphones. </p>

    <p>  Negative reviews are aimed at the camera of the phone - yes, it really still needs to be improved.  Perhaps the developers just decided to save on equipment (lenses, a matrix) - it's hard to say.  Another point that some customers do not like is the new operating system for someone.  Windows Phone differs from the usual OS, due to which sometimes it causes a lot of misunderstanding on the part of ardent Android and iOS fans.  But it's okay, and you can get used to it. </p><p>  In all other respects, most of the reviews come to the conclusion that the device is worth the money and is quite pleasant to work with. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If we talk about the smartphone in terms of reviews left by customers, then there are generally no complaints about it.  At its price, the model clearly refers to the budget class of smartphones, which also have cheap Chinese Android devices.  However, due to the more optimized operation of the hardware on the Windows operating system, the phone behaves much more lively - and the characteristics regarding the Nokia Lumia 525, reviews confirm this.  Thus, we get a worthy alternative to already boring devices from the Middle Kingdom, which looks more attractive and fresh. </p><p>  It also attracts a lot of programs that install Windows on your brainchild.  It really matters, because we evaluate work with a smartphone not so much by the body or device of the camera, but by the impression of daily use - how much your device can solve your problems, how quickly it performs certain tasks, and so on.  Such trifles create the most vivid impression, and we can confidently say that thanks to the efforts of the developers, the WP Lumia 525 is not behind the competition in this matter. </p><p>  Therefore, in general, the conclusion is that if you have not worked with Lumia before, it‚Äôs worth a try.  This is a bright, multi-functional and inexpensive smartphone that clearly has potential.  At least many regular users of Nokia devices claim that after a little test they became real fans of this operating system and phones, which are released in the Lumia line.  So this definitely has some meaning. </p>
