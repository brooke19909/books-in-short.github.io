    <p>  The evolution of mobile devices does not stand still, literally every day something new appears on the phones.  However, Samsung phones of old models look quite tolerant against the background of many of their contemporaries. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S2 i9100 is capable of competing in functions if not with modern flagships, then with phones located in the middle price category.  For a device released back in 2011, this is a huge advantage. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy S2</span> i9100 is distinguished by its discreet appearance.  At first glance, it will be difficult to determine the functional flagship of 2011. </p>

    <p>  The case of the device is completely made of plastic, which does not provide much presentability.  But among the models produced at that time, the phone stood out nicely against the general background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the case there are three buttons for working with the phone.  On the sides are the <span>volume control</span> buttons <span>,</span> turn the device on and off, and at the bottom of the front side there is a button to wake the phone from sleep mode. </p><p>  On the front side, in addition to the wake-up button, there is a four-inch screen, an additional camera, a speaker for calls, as well as light and proximity sensors. </p><p>  The back cover that covers the battery is made of rough plastic for more comfortable working with the phone. </p><p>  On the rear panel is the main camera, which has 8 megapixels and a flash, and below, near the company logo, the main speaker of the device is located. </p><p>  At the end there is a headphone input at the top, and a USB connector at the bottom.  But that's not all, there are microphones for recording stereo at the top and bottom. </p><p>  It should be noted that the device is much thinner than many phones, and this increases the comfort of use. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  One of the greatest virtues on any Samsung phone is its display.  Regardless of the increase in diagonal size, the company remains at its best, improving and complementing the screens. </p>

    <p>  Compared with the previous model, the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 got a slightly larger screen, now its diagonal is 4.3 inches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The display in the Galaxy S2 has acquired Super AMOLED technology with the Plus prefix, which significantly improves image quality.  This technology provides a deeper image and amazing brightness. </p><p>  In addition to applying the new technology, manufacturers have improved the behavior of the <span>Samsung Galaxy S2 gt i9100</span> screen in bright light.  And for greater protection, mineral glass was used to protect the display.  Samsung i9100 Galaxy S2 is able to adjust the backlight automatically or manually. </p><p>  The phone screen has a resolution of 480 pixels by 800 and is capable of displaying 16 million colors.  Among his competitors in 2011, he was one of the best. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Another Samsung calling card is cameras of amazing quality.  The Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 camera does not fail.  Simple and clear settings allow you to fine-tune the camera to your needs. </p>

    <p>  The Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 is equipped with an eight-megapixel camera and has a resolution of 3264 by 2448. A pretty good camera even for modern phones allows you to take high-quality and deep pictures. </p><p>  The LED flash installed on the device helps to use the camera in the dark at a distance of about several meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>The front camera has</span> got two megapixels, which is good when working with communication applications. </p><p>  Recording videos on the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 is carried out in a resolution of 1920 by 1080 and with a shooting speed of 30 frames per second.  However, with prolonged use of the camera, you will need a lot of recording space.  The sound of recording from the camera is improved due to additional microphones recording stereo. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  At one time, the filling of the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 in the form of a 1.2 GHz processor, as well as one gigabyte in the form of RAM, looked very attractive.  And now, such hardware is able to compete with many budget devices. </p><p>  The phone works without problems with video with a resolution of 1080 p.  There will be no particular difficulties in using many useful programs. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S2 gt i9100 uses the Android 2.3 system.  Unfortunately, it narrows down the choice of installed programs and games. </p>

    <p>  The appearance of the system used has been redesigned for the corporate cover and has some nice additions. </p><p>  The main changes affected the appearance of the shell, some widgets were changed and redesigned, as well as slowdowns were fixed. </p><p>  There were certain flaws in the standard system on the Samsung Galaxy S2 gt i9100.  The firmware had limitations in the amount of online video loaded into the buffer.  Most likely, these shortcomings will disappear when installing a newer version of the android. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy S2 gt i9100 is equipped with 16 or 32 gigabytes of memory.  In addition to the available memory, it is possible to increase its volume using a flash card. </p><p>  The phone is capable of working with cards up to 32 gigabytes in size.  As noted in the reviews, when using a flash drive with a capacity of 32 GB, problems in the operation of the device do not arise. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a weak battery with a volume of 1650 maH, which is clearly not enough for the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100.  The high-capacity battery asks to replace the installed one. </p><p>  The device is quite capable of functioning all day, if it is not very active.  With constant use and the Internet turned on, the time will be reduced to about 4-6 hours. </p><p>  The battery for Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100, most likely, will have to be replaced with a more powerful analogue, because for such a device 1650 maH is not enough. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The earpiece of the phone produces very high-quality sound, and there are no complaints about the microphone.  A curious advantage is that the rear speaker, despite its small size, produces quite tolerable and pleasant sound. </p><p>  In addition, the presence of two microphones, allowing you to create stereo recordings, looks like a nice bonus. </p><h2>  Extra features </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with the usual functions - "Bluetooth" 3.0, microUSB 2.0, "Wi-Fi", GPRS, EDGE.  The device supports operation in GSM 800, 2100, 900, 180 modes. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is already equipped with familiar things.  Among them are headphones, a 1650 maH battery, a network adapter and a USB cable. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  The standard navigation program that works with Google maps copes fairly well with its responsibilities.  In addition to the route itself, the program displays traffic jams, which is undoubtedly a plus for motorists. </p><p>  The main disadvantage of working with the program is its constant dependence on network connectivity.  Accordingly, it affects both the consumed traffic and the increased battery consumption. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The smartphone is significantly thinner than its predecessor, due to this, the weight of the device also decreased.  The smartphone, having a thickness of only 8.49 millimeters, weighs 116 grams. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Given that the phone was still in production in 2011, the reviews that bought the device during the release period are mostly positive.  After all, at that time it was a functional flagship, it could satisfy the requests of so many users. </p>

    <p>  The filling and performance of the phone were not satisfactory, but the plastic case caused some discontent.  Despite the protection of the screen with mineral glass, there was sometimes damage when dropped.  Most users secured their device by purchasing a case for the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100. </p><p>  Also, dissatisfaction caused a great dependence of the phone on additional recharging throughout the day. </p><p>  Even now, this gadget may well compete with medium-sized devices.  Such advantages were fully appreciated by lovers of the company's products. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of the device can be considered a display that works on new technology.  Surprisingly high quality and bright, it brings a twist to the smartphone.  Watching video and working with programs will be a pleasure on such a screen. </p><p>  The camera, which allows you to take pictures of good quality, does not lag behind.  In 2011, she confidently held first place among the likes.  Video recording will not disappoint either.  Sometimes a flash fails, but you don‚Äôt have much to expect from pictures in the dark. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the amount of device memory.  Released smartphones with memory of 16 and 32 gigabytes satisfy so many requests even now. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  An incredibly huge disadvantage of a smartphone is the battery.  For Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 this is a huge minus, because users may face the need to recharge at the most inopportune moment.  Even installed in the Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 Android version 2.3, which does not require much energy, does not save the situation.  The only solution is to replace the battery with a powerful analogue. </p>

    <p>  A more minor flaw is hidden in the android itself.  On version 2.3, the necessary applications may simply not go.  Of course, installing a new firmware will slightly fix the situation, but the latest versions of the system will not be available. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Galaxy S2 i9100 phone, without a doubt, looks mediocre against the backdrop of new mobile devices market, but at one time it was a powerful smartphone with a lot of advantages. </p><p>  In terms of price and functionality, the device still has market demand.  That's just the status of the phone from the category of flagships moved into the category of budget devices. </p>
