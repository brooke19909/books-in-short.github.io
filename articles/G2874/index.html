    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, managers and tour operators tend to embellish hotel descriptions.  Thus, travelers are often disappointed upon arrival.  To avoid this, be sure to check out the negative comments awarded to Hotel Abou Sofiane 4 *.  reviews contain the following information: </p><ul><li>  due to the strong audibility between the numbers, you will always be aware of all the conversations of the neighbors; </li><li>  the shower head is aimed at the curtain, and therefore water, flowing down it, floods the entire floor; </li><li>  do not use body lotion, which is included in the cosmetic set, because many guests note allergic reactions; </li><li>  ice cream has a peculiar aftertaste that may seem unpleasant to many; </li><li>  the cooks and waiters in the dining room are not very quick, and therefore queues are sometimes formed at the distribution; </li><li>  in restaurants and bars there is an unwritten rule that allows serving Arabs out of turn (waiters even occupy tables in advance for them); </li><li>  diluted alcohol; </li><li>  weak animation (both adult and children's); </li><li>  reception staff are very slow, which may result in a short registration procedure; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that the hotel has a private beach, locals freely pass on it, who even occupy those sun loungers on which towels lie; </li><li>  for the entire period of residence, the assortment of dishes served for breakfast does not change at all; </li><li>  the staff pays little attention to cleaning the beach; </li><li>  air conditioners do not work in the hotel lobby, which is why it is very stuffy there; </li><li>  ice cream is provided in limited quantities, and therefore it may not be enough for all; </li><li>  in the mini-club, animators absolutely do not pay attention to children; </li><li>  the food is very spicy and spicy; </li><li>  if you come to the hotel out of season when there are very few guests, then the range of dishes in the restaurant will be very scarce; </li><li>  the hotel is far enough from the center of Sousse if you walk, and taxi drivers have too high rates; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel has undergone major repairs, everything literally "breathes" in the rooms of old times (cracks on the walls, crumbling plaster, mold and so on). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  You can hear many different opinions about the hotel Hotel Abou Sofiane 4 *.  The 2016 reviews contain a lot of comments, both positive and negative.  Nevertheless, the overall impression largely depends on the mood with which you go on vacation.  Anyone looking for flaws will certainly find them, because the hotel is quite old, and the repairs in it are not of the highest quality.  But is it not better to focus on a beautiful palm garden and interesting architecture?  The same can be said of the staff.  If you communicate with employees politely and with a smile, then they will reciprocate. </p><p>  Perhaps one of the main features of the hotel can be considered excessive loyalty to local vacationers.  Of course, one can understand the respect of the Arab to the Arab.  Nevertheless, turning a blind eye to attempts to go out of turn everywhere, noisy behavior and other nuances - this is not entirely correct.  In general, the hotel has enough positive aspects that completely cover all the flaws and shortcomings.  This is a clean warm sea, and delicious food in the restaurant, and date palms, and proximity to the port, and quality cleaning, and much more.  Thus, if you go for positive impressions, then you will certainly get them. </p>
