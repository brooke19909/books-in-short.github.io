Billiard school</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would seem that it could be easier than rolling balls?  In fact, the game of billiards is one of the most difficult, since all the elements are equally important: impact strength, stance, angle, etc. To become a high-level player, you need to train a lot and make maximum efforts.  However, you can understand the most elementary techniques and the essence of the game in theory in a few minutes.  How to play billiards?  First you need to come to the institution and rent a table.  Care should be taken when choosing a cue stick, pay attention to the sticker that sticks to the end.  It should be made in the form of a sphere and hold well.  If there is chalk near the table, then you can start playing. </p><h2>  The rules of Russian billiards </h2><p>  There are two most popular types of this game all over the world: Russian and American.  Let's consider them in order.  How to play Russian billiards?  First you need to take a special triangle, arrange it so that the vertex stands at a certain point (it will be visible on the table).  All balls except one are embedded in a triangle.  The game can be started from any direction.  The ball that is not in the triangle is for the first strike.  It must be placed on another special point on the opposite side. </p>

    <p>  The player strikes first, and if any of the balls hits the pocket, he continues.  In case of unsuccessful result, the right to beat passes to another player.  Two blows in billiards are distinguished here: ‚Äúalien‚Äù and ‚Äúmine‚Äù.  The first one looks like this: the player hits the ball, which, in turn, pushes another ball into the pocket.  ‚ÄúFather-in-law‚Äù is when the first ball hits another and flies into the pocket itself.  Such a blow is characteristic only for the Russian type of game. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  American billiards </h2><p>  The rules of the game of <span>billiards are American</span> (pool) significantly different from Russian.  Here the party is faster, easier and more fun.  For a beginner, this type of billiards is the most acceptable, since the pockets are several centimeters wider and, if desired, you can run several balls at once. </p>

    <p>  How to play American billiards?  First you need to collect a pyramid of balls, and put a white ball on the opposite side (all strikes will be carried out on it).  Then the player who fell the first move breaks a triangle.  Opponents need to decide what balls each of them will play.  There are striped and colored balls.  Players must score cue ball only of their type.  In addition, there is a black ball that must be driven into the pocket last.  If he flies during the game, the player who beat is considered a loser.  A game is considered correctly played if one of the opponents rolls all its balls, and then black. </p><h2>  Basic mistakes of beginners </h2><p>  How to play billiards?  To learn this art, you first of all need to be very keen.  One of the most obvious ways is to visit a billiard club with friends.  Just start playing, follow other, more experienced players, listen to tips and try to improve your level.  About 95% of all newcomers do this, and this is their main mistake.  The fact is that not all people playing nearby are professionals, and their advice can do much harm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To avoid such a development of events, you must immediately learn correctly, and for this you need to communicate only with high-level players.  Playing at the level of intuition will not lead to success.  Nobody else has learned how to hit the ball correctly, see the game and control it. </p><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  As in any other business, there is theory and practice in billiards.  Of course, the game process is very important in order to become a professional.  But no one has yet canceled the theoretical part.  First you need to learn the rules of the game.  As already noted, there are several types of billiards, the main of which are Russian and American.  Each for himself chooses the one that is closer to him. </p>

    <p>  In addition, there are billiard schools where, for a fee, from any person they will make a good player.  But it is not necessary to visit this institution to become a professional.  Oddly enough, there is literature on billiards, and quite a lot of it.  Most beginners are not interested in this, and their skills will not be very effective.  This is a very important step, helping to build the right tactics in the future.  Thanks to books, you can comprehend the basics of this game, the knowledge of which will make the learning process more interesting and faster. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rack Selection </h2><p>  Correct stance is half the success.  This term refers to the position of the body during impact.  However, in order to learn how to stand up properly, it is not necessary to hit the balls.  First you need to take a cue, and about ten centimeters from its heavy end to wrap your fingers around it.  The tool should not hang out, but you should not strain your hand either. </p><p>  Then you need to go to the pool table, and put the thin end of the cue on its edge perpendicularly.  The right leg should be placed under the brush of the right hand.  The left leg should be pulled to the left and put half a meter in front of the right.  Then the left hand must be substituted under the cue.  He should walk between the thumb and forefinger.  The remaining fingers play the role of support.  The palm should be on the table, and the knuckles are raised. </p><p>  Then you need to put your head so that the chin is ten centimeters above the cue.  Typically, beginners always have a shoulder pain, but this is a good sign.  So, he did everything right, with regular training, the unpleasant feeling will go away. </p><h2>  Hitting Billiards </h2><p>  When answering the question of how to play billiards, experienced players answer: first you need to learn how to beat the balls.  It is recommended to use chalk before each action, which helps create friction.  After that, you need to choose the ball, which is better to hit and the direction where it will end up.  Then you should use the rules of becoming a rack.  It must be formed so that the line of impact passes through the center of the ball, along which it should be beat and coincides with this direction. </p>

    <p>  Many institutions hold billiard tournaments, and if possible, it is better to attend.  Professionals play there, and observing their actions, one can note something important for oneself.  It should be remembered that before the strike you need to carry out several warm-up movements.  The gaze should be directed first to the point where the cue ball will fall, then check whether the cue rests in the center of the ball, and at the end pay attention to the level of aiming. </p><h2>  Impact Value and Stance </h2><p>  In any school of billiards, the main attention is paid to precisely these components.  Like it or not, there is nothing to do in this game without the right stance and the right strike.  These skills deteriorate over time, so you need to constantly train them.  And it is not necessary to do this during the party.  You can come to the institution yourself, rent a table for billiards and practice blows. </p>

    <p>  Before moving on to this component, you need to be able to correctly become a rack.  It is almost impossible to make a good hit without the right approach.  Therefore, in specialized schools, the stance is first trained.  It is also recommended to watch video tutorials and attend billiards tournaments.  In most cases, admission to the competition is free, but the experience gained is invaluable. </p><h2>  Beginner Exercises </h2><p>  It is not recommended to start right away from the game, at first it is better to work out some points.  Of the main types of exercises can be identified: </p><ul><li>  Training of "single" blow.  Here it is necessary to draw a cue several times along the line, you need to monitor whether it goes away. </li><li>  Beat on your own ball in a pocket.  This is quite simple to do, but strength and accuracy will be developed in the process. </li><li>  A blow to the "alien" ball.  Slowly you need to try to introduce another cue ball into training and try to get on it. </li><li>  Sliced ‚Äã‚Äãpunches. </li></ul><p>  These steps are a kind of algorithm that you need to follow when setting a strike.  Even experienced players sometimes train by placing two balls on the middle line of the table.  From this position, there are many ways out.  The simplest is to hammer a ‚Äúforeign‚Äù ball into the middle pocket. </p>

    <p>  In this case, ‚Äúyour own‚Äù can bounce anywhere, and the next blow will be quite difficult to perform.  Therefore, in the game, the location of the ball after the impact is of great importance.  Professionals can make klapshtos (a blow to the center of the cue ball), in which "your" ball will remain in place.  If you hit with a guy, the cue ball will roll back and there is a chance of falling into the opposite pocket.  If you break with the coast, "your" will roll after another and, possibly, two cue ball will fly at once.  Such a training will allow you to hone your skills in different types of strokes, if such a situation arises during the game, many options will appear. </p><h2>  Training with a trainer </h2><p>  Many believe that working with a professional is necessary on the way to a high-level player.  This has its own truth.  We have already examined how to play billiards correctly and what is needed for this.  If the goal is to become a <span>professional player,</span> then independent training is not enough.  In this case, working with a trainer is mandatory. </p>

    <p>  Playing constantly among experts is worth a lot.  After all, when training with the best, skill develops faster.  When all the basics have already been completed, you can learn different chips.  In billiards there are a huge number of them, which only costs <span>Lehman</span> or a screw.  Of course, to perform such attacks is very difficult, but if you try, you can become a master of the game. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Some tips from professional players: </p><ol><li>  The first blow breaking a triangle is called "robbery".  To successfully complete it, it is recommended that the cue ball be placed not at the center point, but 10-15 cm to the left or right. </li><li>  To punch hard, you need to get up correctly.  Legs shoulder width apart, right on the cue line, left toe at right angles. </li><li>  To get a good shot, you need support.  You can not pull the hand, the cue should be placed between the thumb and forefinger. </li><li>  The height of the support must be adjusted so that the cue abuts 1-2 mm above the center of the cue ball. </li><li>  For a soft blow you need the correct location of the cue.  He should lie on the pads of a beating hand.  During the sight, the weight must be kept on the set foot, then sharply move it to the front and pierce strongly.  If done correctly, the punch will turn out great. </li></ol>
