The world is experiencing a real ‚Äúapple‚Äù boom - millions of people have already bought a brand new device, and just as much dream about it.  He gained such fame thanks to quality and prestige.  Some iPhones are needed solely to maintain the image of a rich person in the eyes of society.  Such people buy it only on the Apple website or in a company store.  Others, seeking to save money, acquire ‚Äúapple-trees‚Äù through gray dealers.  What is the difference, we will describe later in the article. </p>

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  The country of manufacture of the iPhone is America, everyone knows that.  The world famous company Apple and the legendary Steve Jobs have released and developed this gadget.  They conceived it and put it into practice.  And what about mass production? </p><p>  When the iPhone became popular, few people were interested in the manufacturing country.  In Russia, they heard about him at the stage of release of the fourth generation of the phone, when it was acquired by ex-president Dmitry Medvedev.  And since then, for six years, the demand for the gadget has only been growing in the domestic open spaces. </p><p>  Meanwhile, the creators, in order not to lose relevance, are releasing all new series of "apple" gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chinese counterparts </h2><p>  After the iPhone 6 went on sale, the smartphone market replenished with Chinese flagships.  The quality of materials and the technical equipment of the sixth series repeated the original model, but the price was more affordable.  The owners of the American version squeamishly glanced at the "Chinese", believing that the eastern plants could not collect anything worthwhile.  And here they were mistaken.  Many models in this segment deserve praise and have quite decent characteristics. </p>

    <h2>  IPhone 6: manufacturer </h2><p>  The country producing the gadget of this model is Taiwan.  The company that collects iPhone 6 is Foxconn (Taiwan).  Its enterprises are located in China.  And in addition to Apple products, she also produces cameras for Canon, popular game consoles, and mobile phones from a number of well-known brands.  The company also <span>manufactures motherboards</span> with both its own logo and the illustrious Intel. </p><p>  Foxconn, created back in 1974, began with the creation of small plastic parts for TVs, and after fourteen years it grew to the opening of its own factory in China.  Now she has subsidiaries, she collaborates with large concerns for the production of electronics and components for her. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Why is an iPhone, the manufacturing country of which is geographically located in another hemisphere, assembled in China?  It's all about scale.  Foxconnt City is a whole town with a workforce of two hundred thirty thousand people, whose work schedule is twelve hours a day and six days a week.  There is a whole system with certain rules and work schemes.  And in the USA, there are simply not so many unoccupied engineers.  According to studies, it will take about a year before it is possible to collect the required number of workers, in China it will take two weeks on the strength. </p><h2>  Small clarification </h2><p>  The iPhone (whose manufacturing country is actually Taiwan, but with production capacities in China) cannot be called completely Chinese.  There are purely American components in it: </p><ol><li>  Glass is manufactured at the Corning plant <span>in Kentucky.</span> </li><li>  The software is being developed by a data center <span>(North Carolina).</span> </li><li>  Semiconductors are manufactured by a factory in Texas. </li></ol>

    <h2>  How to identify the country of manufacture of the iPhone? </h2><p>  If you didn‚Äôt buy your smartphone from an authorized dealer and, after reading, you became interested in its origin, information about the device will help.  On the packaging of the iPhone you need to find the <span>serial number.</span>  If suddenly you did not find it there, refer to the phone menu.  In the "Settings" section (the "Basic" tab) there is a sub-item "About the device", it also contains a number, usually consisting of numbers and four letters. </p><p>  To check the country of origin, it is important for us to remember the last two letters.  The Internet can easily find a list that decrypts all their combinations.  For example, if the number is MC352LL, then LL indicates that the phone came from the United States.  The Chinese copy will give the designation CH. </p><p>  It was previously believed that the IMEI code helps calculate the country where the iPhone was manufactured.  To do this, we used a special service, where a device code of fifteen characters was entered.  As the results showed, the data on the region contained in IMEI differ from the information of the number of the iPhone.  In this regard, Numberingplans will help determine only the make and model of the phone, it is useless to identify the country of origin. </p><h2>  Budget devices </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the iPhone (the manufacturing country of which is Taiwan or China) is a very high-quality copy, since these countries are directly involved in the production of the original.  Therefore, there are many Chinese, but adequately executed "apple-trees".  Outwardly, most of the replicas are practically no different from the Apple-original.  If you just want to show off as an iPhone, then you are unlikely to be caught in a substitute without holding it in your hands. </p><p>  But they can issue a copy: </p><ul><li>  materials that are in relation to the American version of lower quality and cost; </li><li>  name - some Goothone i5s, for example; </li><li>  the inner shell of the smartphone, which is significantly weaker than the real one and works on the Android platform, stylized for iOS; </li><li>  external arrangement of the device (quality of plastic, metal and glass); </li><li>  camera quality. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  How to check the country of manufacture of the iPhone on UnLock?  Many countries sell UnLock iPhones for a particular telephone service provider.  This makes it impossible to use the device in another country.  Until the summer of two thousand and eleven, knowing the name of the country for which the gadget was made, any person could determine whether the phone is officially unlocked or not.  Now it is difficult in connection with the launch of Apple devices with the category <span> </span>  <span>Factory Unlocked</span> , previously considered strictly locked under a specific operator.  Some mobile companies officially selling ‚Äúapple‚Äù products have begun to provide services to remove the lock (each on its own terms). </p>
