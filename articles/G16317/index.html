The advantages of new technology, expanding operational capabilities, are also highly appreciated in business areas.  One of the latest developments, which has caused widespread interest of this kind, is an interactive projector.  These are devices that allow not only transmitting a high-quality image to the screen, taking into account the characteristics of the room, but also providing the possibility of interaction of the ‚Äúimage‚Äù with the audience.  An interactive multimedia projector was available on the market several years ago, but the largest manufacturers of digital equipment quickly mastered the technology and today offer innovative equipment in a wide range. </p>

    <h2>  What is the feature of interactive projectors? </h2><p>  A prerequisite for the emergence of interactive models was the entry into the educational process of computers.  As digital media became stronger and stronger as technical equipment for schools and universities, so did the demand for more modern means of projecting visual materials.  Compared to traditional models, the multimedia projector for the school allows you to interact with the image broadcast through the computer.  This is done through an <span>electronic pen,</span> gestures and hand touches.  The mode of the so-called white board is also quite popular, in which the teacher or presenter of the presentation can literally draw on the projected image using various tools.  Otherwise, interactive devices have the same capabilities as standard projectors.  However, it should be noted that the quality requirements for the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù in this case are not as important as in entertainment complexes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Key Features </h2><p>  Among the key parameters by which the quality of multimedia projectors is evaluated, it is worth noting the luminous flux, <span>resolution</span> and contrast.  As for the first feature, it is 2600 ANSI Lm in standard devices.  This is a good, even high value, since for audiences with artificial lighting, a light flux of 500 ANSI Lm is quite enough.  Matrix resolution ranges from the aging SVGA format to ultra-high 4K.  But in most cases, multimedia projectors are equipped with matrices that provide a resolution of 1024 x 768. There is also Full HD format, but it should be noted that there is no need for improved quality of the educational ‚Äúpicture‚Äù, since information is still at the forefront, as well as a way profitable presentation of the material to a wide audience.  And in this regard, contrast is more important.  In the case of interactive models, it is 2000 x 1. But modifications with a contrast of 500 x 1 should not be ignored if it is planned to operate the equipment exclusively in artificial lighting. </p>

    <h2>  Eiki Projector Reviews </h2><p>  Under this brand, one of the first video projectors with interactive features came out - the LC-XIP2000 version.  Over the past two years, the device has significantly changed, but its basic characteristics continue to be considered by many as a reference.  The success of the entire segment is also due to user reviews of the first product of this type.  In particular, Eiki's multimedia projectors are praised for downsizing amid enhanced functionality.  The users had to pay for the introduction of new options with sound and image quality.  The fact is that projectors do not indulge a consumer with high-quality sound anyway, and in this case, a built-in 2 W stereo system in a channel is used.  However, this is enough to provide sound for rooms up to 200 m <sup>2</sup> .  The image is provided in the format of 1024 x 768. This is a little by the standards of modern devices, but the company did not plan to compete with advanced entertainment complexes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Casio Projector Reviews </h2><p>  Suddenly, the segment of interactive projectors replenished with a decent development of the XJ-UT310WN from Casio.  This model is good not only by the fact of using new technologies, but also by expanding the capabilities founded by Eiki engineers.  In particular, users indicate a favorable increase in brightness characteristics to 3100 ANSI Lm, note the support for 3D video, as well as ultra-short projection distance.  Noteworthy is the fact that Casio <span>LED multimedia projectors</span> have a high lamp life - up to 20 thousand hours.  And this is against the background of low power consumption.  Again, according to the owners, the normal operation of such a projector requires 205 watts.  In general, Casio developers optimized the concept of interactive projection, organically combining it with the functions of entertainment models. </p><h2>  Epson Projector Reviews </h2><p>  Could not pass by the new fashion and the company Epson, which is one of the leaders in the segment of video projectors.  The manufacturer not only repeated, but also functionally improved existing developments.  For example, owners of the EB-595Wi model note the convenience of using the touch function, through which you can interact with the displayed material through touches and gestures.  By the way, the developers have provided for the use of a mouse, which, if necessary, replaces finger manipulation.  Similar solutions were used by other companies, but the Epson multimedia projector provides increased accuracy when interacting with the smallest image elements.  In addition, users also note the ease of use of the device itself in terms of physical handling.  Light weight (5 kg) and modest dimensions make it possible to install equipment in almost any environment. </p>

    <h2>  Sony Projector Reviews </h2><p>  Sony works directly with educational institutions to provide interactive equipment.  In small classes, teachers often use the VPL-SW536C model, which is characterized by an ultra-small projection distance.  At the same time, this device is appreciated for the ability to transmit information to the ‚Äúboard‚Äù via wireless channels - that is, the student can broadcast materials through a smartphone or tablet.  In large audiences, it is recommended to use the Sony multimedia projector in the VPL-FH500 modification.  In this case, in addition to wide functionality, the user will receive a high resolution.  Also, the manufacturer Sony takes into account other nuances of the operation of such equipment in educational processes.  Developers provide projectors with intelligent systems that optimize power consumption.  As a result, the costs of the use and maintenance of equipment are reduced. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose the best option? </h2><p>  First you need to decide on the goals that will be achieved through the projector.  For example, who and how will use the device, as well as the image transmitted by it.  Epson models possess the broadest interactive abilities, which have enhanced the convenience of interacting with the whiteboard.  If the basic characteristics of the equipment come to the fore, among which are the parameters of the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù in the form of brightness and contrast, then you should pay attention to Casio brand multimedia projectors.  In the rest, the model lines of each manufacturer allow you to decide on the choice of equipment for solving any problems. </p><h2>  How much does an interactive projector cost? </h2><p>  Modern projectors are not cheap, especially considering the introduction of the latest technologies.  But, oddly enough, the segment of interactive technology does not differ very much sky-high cost.  The initial level is represented by models that can be purchased for 40-50 thousand rubles.  As a rule, these are devices for small audiences with basic options.  In the middle class, you can find a functional multimedia projector, the price of which will be 70-80 thousand rubles.  These are models designed for large audiences and equipped with modern communication capabilities. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At this stage in the development of the interactive projector segment, it is too early to talk about market trends and patterns.  Manufacturers, of course, seek to develop original concepts in providing technological capabilities of products, but for the most part, such attempts resemble the creative search mode.  And this is logical, because multimedia projectors with interactive functions appeared only a few years ago, and today they continue to develop.  Almost every model pushes the boundaries of user interaction with the "picture", adding new options.  Along with this, the basic characteristics of equipment are also being improved, image quality is improving, etc. A separate area worth highlighting is the desire of developers to minimize the energy consumption of projectors. </p>
