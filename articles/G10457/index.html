Someone goes to distant lands for impressions, someone for adventures, and someone needs peace and quiet.  To relax from the bustle of the city, enjoy nature, see an exotic country such as it really is, you should go to a small village called Gokarna (India). </p><h2>  Geographic location </h2><p>  This settlement is located in the northern part of the state of Karnataka (India).  It almost borders Goa on the coast of the Arabian Sea.  Many tourists who come to Goa go on vacation to this village, because there are excellent beaches, nature of marvelous beauty, and vacationers are much smaller, and the prices are lower. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gokarna India" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/1568308.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Place of pilgrimage </h2><p>  By European standards, this settlement is hardly a town, rather, it is a village called Gokarna.  India is known worldwide for worshiping the Buddha, pilgrims who cross the country to plunge into the waters of the mighty <span>Ganges River.</span>  But few travelers know that Gokarna is the second most important place among the Indians.  According to ancient legends, one of the gods of the supreme triad - Shiva - was born here.  He is revered as a destroyer god.  The triad also includes Brahma and Vishnu. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  According to legend, the <span>god Shiva</span> was born in one of the local caves <span>,</span> an altar was built in it.  Entrance is free, but for some reason mention of it is in rare guides.  Locals claim that many saints came here to immerse themselves in meditation.  Today, anyone can do it, regardless of religion.  Part of this cave has not been studied.  Some claim that it has access to the ocean, while others - that from it you can get straight to the Himalayas. </p><h2>  Sacred lake </h2><p>  Gokarna (India) is also known for the sacred lake Kotitirha.  Tradition says that it is filled with the waters of the Ganges, so bathing in it washes away sins from a person.  Thousands of pilgrims strive at dawn to clear their karma and renew themselves.  Only hereditary Brahmins who are members of the caste of priests in several generations can live on the shore. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gokarna India Attractions" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/1568311.jpg" width="379"></div>  Holy city </h2><p>  Gokarna (India) is mentioned in many legends and scriptures of the Hindus.  In translation, the name means ‚Äúcow‚Äôs ear‚Äù, because according to legend, Shiva was born here from the ear of the goddess Prithivi, who took the form of a cow.  By the way, at the bottom of the sacred lake is one of the deepest cracks on Earth, which symbolizes the ear of the planet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to this reservoir, there are many Buddhist temples in Gokarna.  In many of them, access to tourists is closed, as indicated by special signs.  But you can go into some, only visitors need to treat the shrines with trepidation, not to desecrate them with photographs, walking in obscene clothes and loud conversations.  Having entered a sacred place, you should take off your shoes and leave your shoes at the entrance.  Most Indians who came to such a revered city even walk barefoot in the streets, because this is a land favorable to every Indian. </p><h2>  Rest for body and soul </h2><p>  Most tourists rush towards Gokarna not for the sights.  This is a great place to relax.  The wondrous beauty of nature, the jungle almost untouched by civilization, gorgeous beaches - this is what attracts vacationers from all over the world.  Moreover, in this place there is no such fuss as in the more traditional tourist center - Goa.  And the prices for accommodation and food in Gokarna are almost thirty percent lower.  Perhaps the only negative of this place is the almost complete absence of the Internet. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karnataka India" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/1568313.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Gokarna (India) is famous for beaches, on which snow-white sand, warm sea, mild climate.  There are five of the largest and most popular.  And still here the sunsets are of marvelous beauty, the locals have a tradition that visitors are happy to support.  At exactly 6 p.m. everyone goes ashore on the city beach to enjoy the sunset.  A red-hot ball of fire evenly enters the water, and a warm night sets in. </p><p>  The largest beach is urban, it stretches for 10 km.  Despite this, it is quite crowded and noisy.  A little to the side is Cudley Beach, reminiscent of a bend of a braid, even further - one of the most popular Om beach for tourists.  It got its name due to the fact that nature itself laid stones around it in the form of the sacred symbol ‚ÄúOm‚Äù.  You can see this miracle only from above. </p><p>  The next route will be Half Moon Beach.  Further there is the paradise lagoon Paradise Beach, which opens only to those who show perseverance.  You need to go there through the jungle, so without a guide it is better not to go looking for adventure.  On each of the listed beaches you can rent cozy houses of different levels of comfort and spend the whole vacation right on the beach. </p>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  To fully enjoy the journey, it is best to go to these parts in the winter.  The weather in India in December is just wonderful.  From November to the end of February, the velvet season lasts.  In the afternoon the air temperature warms up to 35 degrees, in the evening the temperature drops to +24.  The winter nature of India is not as colorful as in the spring, but still it is not the harsh Russian expanses covered with a thick layer of snow, with crackling baptismal frosts.  Rains at this time are extremely rare, in a month there can be only a couple of days with rainfall that will not overshadow the rest.  The weather in India in December and other winter months, like in paradise. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists and pilgrims are attracted to Gokarna (India).  The reviews of people who came here are full of sincere admiration. </p><p>  Everyone who has visited this piece of paradise on earth wants to return here again.  Life here is measured and unhurried.  In these places, even time seems to slow down. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in India in December" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/1568309.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Tourists advise to withdraw money from the card in major cities before the trip, because in Gokarna this can cause problems.  But there are exchange points in the village, and even on Om beach you can exchange currency. </p><p>  In Gokarna, noisy holidays and discos are not arranged, from which the ocean shakes, here the Indians go for peace.  This atmosphere is transmitted to everyone who arrives in a wonderful city. </p><p>  Also, those who have visited there, note that the beautiful temples dedicated to the god Shiva, not all are open to tourists.  These are sacred places, and you should respect the culture of others. </p>

    <p>  Gokarna <span>(India), the attractions of</span> which will be of interest to the followers of Buddhism, attracts tourists with its nature, mild climatic conditions and reasonable prices.  Life here is measured and unhurried.  India makes everyone think about the frailty of being, about the meaning of life, about other philosophical topics.  But for some reason, these issues are not annoying on the seashore, but are disposed to meditation and self-improvement.  In this place I want to stay forever. </p>
