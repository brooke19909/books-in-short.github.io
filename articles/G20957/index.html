The complex was built in 2004, in the very center of the world-famous protected areas (reconstructed in 2011), but has already managed to win the honor and respect of many travelers who have chosen the largest resort on the Northern coast of Bulgaria - Golden Sands.  It is located 18 kilometers from Varna (the ancient port city) and 25 kilometers from the airport. </p>

    <h2>  On the dais </h2><p>  "Edelweiss 4 *" joined the numerous rows of resort hotels, but was not lost among the institutions serving guests at a high level.  On the contrary, it took a worthy place in the line of glorious <span>guest houses in Bulgaria,</span> providing a wide range of services.  The service here really justifies the cost of acquiring a tour. </p><p>  The modern architecture of the boarding house pleases the eye: a 9-story building looks easy, comfortable inside.  It is located on a hill, surrounded by lush greenery of the park area, a 7-minute walk from the Black Sea.  These and other factors contribute to a relaxed atmosphere where you can disconnect from the hustle and bustle.  It seems that the 21st century residents tired of the rhythm of the present time appreciate this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Germans, Poles, Bulgarians, Romanians love to relax here.  It is believed that there are not too many tourists from Russia.  But the service staff is fluent in Russian, so there is no barrier (which is observed on vacation in other countries). </p><h2>  Shared beach </h2><p>  Hotel Edelweiss 4 * <span>(Bulgaria, Golden Sands)</span> - the right choice and guarantee of a good vacation.  But people go to Golden Sands not only to spend hours and days in a boarding house.  Even excellent.  What is a resort, what can interest vacationers?  There are a lot of interesting things: these are places for a quiet, fun and noisy and secluded relaxation, informative tourist routes to attractions, sports, shopping. </p><p>  The beach is common to all resorts.  Lots of outdoor pools.  All vacationers can visit them, as well as the pedestrian zone by the sea.  Initially, it was envisaged that hotels would not be built on the shore one by one, but would ‚Äúgo‚Äù deeper and higher. </p><p>  From the guide you can hear that the conquerors from Turkey called the territory not ‚Äúgolden‚Äù at all, but ‚Äúlong sands‚Äù (Kuzunkum).  But the fine-grained, golden-colored sedimentary rock, which composes wide beaches (up to 100 m), looks so much like precious metal that the spaces were renamed. </p>

    <h2>  Under the flag of purity </h2><p>  Leaving Hotel Edelweiss 4 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) in the morning to lie on the golden sand under the sun, do not forget to hide in the shade of the park at noon, take a walk along its alleys.  <span>The seashore</span> sinks under a slight slope.  In such places it is good to relax with children - they can splash in the water in the absence of the risk of a sharp increase in water level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cleanliness of the bowl and the sloping shores themselves, adapted for swimming and sunbathing, are certified by the Blue Flag sign.  The award is annual.  It is awarded to resorts where they pay attention not only to comfort, but also to compliance with all safety measures.  There are changing cabins, showers (rinse with salt water). </p><p>  As for water procedures, the sea is quite warm (in July the temperature is 24 degrees).  The salinity is inferior to the Mediterranean (there the ‚Äúpickle‚Äù is twice as strong).  There are wild beaches, provided with the supply of healing hydrogen sulfide water (swimming, jet massage - all for you).  The climate is mild.  Rains do not "strain": in the season (July-August) they are almost absent. </p><h2>  Happy life </h2><p>  In June, the weather is changeable, with rain, but still warm (the temperature reaches 25 degrees).  September may be unstable, however, until the middle of the month, tourists stubbornly rush towards the gentle waves.  By the end of the first month of autumn, restrictive red flags are set on the beach due to the activation of underwater currents. </p><p>  It is said that Golden Sands is especially appreciated by those who love not only to sunbathe, but also to have fun in a bustling multinational company.  Bars, music, cool DJs - the beach nightlife is very busy, which attracts young people here.  But the resort is conditionally divided into two parts.  Hotel "Edelweiss" - on the one preferred by lovers of silence. </p>

    <h2>  Analyze the situation </h2><p>  Check out the resort map.  If you prefer a family vacation, consider the space to the Admiral pension.  If you have an adventure mix in your heart, head closer to the city of Varna.  For many, it‚Äôs crucial to know the distance to the beach, the steepness of the relief.  Armed with knowledge, you will avoid undesirable surprises for you.  As for the trade infrastructure, vacationers note: the resort has its own: shops, a bazaar, points where you can eat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Portions of food in restaurants and cafes pleasantly surprise tourists: they are quite large.  Dishes are different (Greek cuisine, Turkish, Slavic, Bulgarian, etc.).  Parents with children are impressed by the convenience of relaxation during the school holidays.  There is no place for boredom.  Adults will also rest: for several hours, children can be left in the leisure center. </p><p>  Children love the water park in the western part of the resort (Aquapolis, 40 thousand square meters, spa, jacuzzi, hydromassage).  So, settling in the Edelweiss 4 * hotel (Bulgaria), you only open the window to the wonderful world of entertainment!  Well, do not forget about mineral springs.  They have been used for centuries.  They drink water, apply externally (as well as therapeutic mud).  Traditional medicine methods are popular (many medicinal plants grow in the country, the local population keeps bees), including Chinese. </p><h2>  Over a hundred hotels </h2><p>  Some believe that the prices for rest and treatment in Golden Sands are quite reasonable.  Vacationers can visit the balneological center with modern equipment, undergo procedures, treat their joints (if they hurt), strengthen their nerves.  Those who suffer from pharyngitis, bronchitis, asthma successfully improve their health.  There are fitness centers, fish spas (fish therapy). </p><p>  During the existence of the resort, more than one hundred hotels have been built (including the four-star Edelweiss Hotel).  There are five-star hotels on Golden Sands.  But those visitors who do not need them can settle in an inexpensive boarding house.  There is no luxury and chic there, but get a roof over your head and you can easily get acquainted with local sights, relax, enjoy the sun and the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Everything is relative </h2><p>  There are those who believe that Golden Sands is an expensive pleasure.  But it is not so.  Prices are lower on average than, for example, at the third most popular resort in this country (Albena), but slightly higher than in Sunny Beach.  In any case, they are not sky-high, there is the possibility of variation.  Entrance to the beach is free.  With a sunbed and an umbrella (you have to spend 6-8 euros every day), the question is simply solved: sunbathe on a large towel, and buy a <span>sunshade</span> from the market and carry with you. </p><p>  Whether you choose Edelweiss 4 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) or another hotel, carefully consider the proposed tours.  Choose a trusted guide, ask for advice from experienced vacationers.  You can go to a neighboring city on your own, on a municipal bus (they say less than one euro in one direction).  Those who want to drive around in a rented car (there are many points, the cost of the service is about twenty-seven euros per day, but an international license is needed). </p><h2>  The Eiffel Tower </h2><p>  As for the sights, the first thing that comes to mind is the Eiffel Tower (an analogue of the Paris Eiffel Tower, only smaller in size - 31 m versus 324 m).  Having risen to a height of 6 meters, you will find yourself in a cocktail bar.  The institution boasts a nice viewing platform.  Come out, admire the sea, take pictures. </p><p>  What to see in Varna, which, recall, within 20 km from the Edelweiss Hotel?  Go to the dolphinarium, visit the Roman baths, a museum of history.  Many people like the cathedral.  Go shopping.  The famous Bulgarian Rose cosmetics, silver jewelry, and ceramics are traditionally popular there.  In the market are cheap fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  Six kilometers from Golden Sands - and you are at the <span>Aladzha</span> rock <span>monastery</span> (some move to it on foot or take a taxi for 5-8 euros, since there is no scheduled bus to this point).  On Wednesdays (and the tourist highlight is open all week), you can watch an audiovisual show on the theme of the Middle Ages.  There are caves nearby (700 m).  They are also loved by visitors from different parts of the world. </p>

    <h2>  Tasty, comfortable, great!  We will come again! </h2><p>  How do four-star <span>hotels</span> characterize <span>(Bulgaria, 4 *,</span> Golden Sands) reviews?  Opinions are different.  A lot of positive.  Optimists are happy with the rest at the famous resort.  Even a place on the road, "on the hill", seems to many a big plus.  They believe that it is very convenient: to any point nearby.  They like the hotel on the terrace, knocked out in the sandy mountain, staff, kitchen, which is rated at five points out of five. </p><p>  They say that the hotel is treated to fine beer, Balkan brandy, brandy.  They assure that they have not eaten such a delicious fish as the cooks at Edelweiss had prepared.  The pool is called salvation for those who like to relax on the spot without leaving the hotel.  They say that next year they will definitely choose this hotel.  These people want to believe. </p>
