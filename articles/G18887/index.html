Such character traits prophesy to the owner of considerable success and respect in society, especially if the very young girl - now the international grandmaster Tatyana Kosintseva - realizes the rich potential.  Despite many difficulties, the chess player achieved her dream, but how did she succeed? </p><h2>  Becoming and starting a career </h2><p>  Tatyana Anatolievna Kosintseva is a Russian chess player who is known for her numerous victories in many tournaments in Russia and outside the state.  A girl was born on April 11, 1986 in Arkhangelsk.  The love of intellectual games was manifested in the child from an early age, so the parents enrolled their daughter in a chess club.  Tatyana has a sister, Nadezhda Kosintseva, who also began to study chess, first for herself, and later - professionally. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatyana Anatolyevna" class="if uuid-2938565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108488/2938565.jpg"></div><h2>  Achievements in the chess field </h2><p>  Kosintseva began her career at the age of 6.  Thanks to hard work, the girl represented Russia at the European Championship, in which she won first place.  At the age of 14, the girl, together with her sister Nadezhda, jointly take a prize in the same tournament. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tatyana, along with her sister Nadezhda, was trained by Yuri Rafaelovich Dokhoyan, Honored Chess Trainer of Russia.  From 2002 to 2007, the girl three times took part in chess competitions in Russia, each time winning a brilliant victory.  In the period 2002-2004, Tatyana Kosintseva participated in European tournaments, bringing the team prizes, as well as silver and bronze medals. </p><p>  In 2010, the girl became a member of the Russian national team at the chess championship and upon graduation received the title of winner of the World Chess Olympiad.  After a series of victories in <span>Russian chess</span> competitions, Tatyana is actively storming European tournaments.  Together with the team, the girl again wins the championship in Istanbul, and later in Dresden.  During the tournament in Turkey, Tatyana had a conflict with the then-current coach of the Russian chess team.  The true details of the differences are not known, but at the end of the competition, the chess player left the team with her sister.  The trainer's training system yielded the highest results, so in an irreconcilable skirmish between the parties, the girls decided to defend their positions, even at the cost of leaving the team. </p><p>  This fact did not affect the professional activities of any of the parties.  The Kosintsev sisters continue to improve their skills and act as part of another Russian team.  Tatyana wins not only in classic games, but also in fast chess - shortened matches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aritearu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess player at the tournament" class="if uuid-2938567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108488/2938567.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal life of Tatyana Kosintseva </h2><p>  In the period from 2003 to 2008, the girl graduated from Pomeranian State University.

Lomonosov, majoring in jurisprudence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tatyana has a pet that has almost become a member of the family.  The chess player maintains personal pages on social networks: Vkontakte and Facebook.

After a couple of years, the international chess organization added the title of master to the existing title, an intermediate link to the international grandmaster.  After a series of victories in various tournaments, members of the chess organization awarded the girl the title of international grandmaster.  Three years ago, Tatyana took part in the World Cup, which included several stages.  After each game, the loser leaves the competition.  Tatyana Kosintseva completed the first round, during which more than one chess game was played.  At the moment, the titles and titles won include: grandmaster, master of sports, champion of Russia and Europe in classical and fast chess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aritearu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tatyana Kosintseva" class="if uuid-2938563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108488/2938563.jpg"></div><p>  Between the name and the word "Tatyana Kosintseva - Chess" you can put an equal sign, since the girl is a vivid example of determination, hard work and complete dedication to her beloved, but not an easy task.  Only believing in your strength and making every effort, you can achieve any heights.
