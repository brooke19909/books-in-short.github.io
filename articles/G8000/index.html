    <h2>  Climate class </h2><p>  Among household appliances, freezers are considered one of the most popular.  That is why they are used in almost all apartments and in completely different areas of the earthly world.  No matter what climatic conditions in different countries, anyway, the freezer will be an integral part of the kitchen. </p><p>  In extreme heat or cold weather, the air temperature changes both on the street and in the apartment.  Accordingly, this affects the operation of the device.  That is why the climate class is indicated on each model.  Thanks to this parameter, you can determine in what conditions this technique will work best. </p><p>  Reviews of the Indesit 167 SFR NF freezer indicate that it will function perfectly in the normal climate class SN.  What does this mean?  She calmly withstands temperatures from 10 to 32 degrees Celsius.  If necessary, this device can be installed in the corridor, where there is no heating radiator, and this equipment will also function quietly in the basement. </p><h2>  Cold preservation </h2><p>  In the Russian Federation, the operation of the electric network is adjusted to the maximum.  However, sometimes it happens that the light supply is turned off.  This is especially true for the area that is located outside of large cities.  In the village, towns or partnerships, sometimes the voltage disappears in the network.  Of course, the Indesit 167 SFR freezer stops receiving energy and temporarily does not fulfill its main function.  Because of this, foods can go bad.  That is why the manufacturer drew attention to the fact that he introduced such a feature as autonomous cold preservation.  This freezer can store the required temperature for 13 hours.  As a rule, this is enough until the light is turned on.  Recall that according to regulatory documents in cities, power outages are allowed for no more than 2 hours without reducing fees for it.  In villages and towns, this period increases to a day.  But, as a rule, the problem is eliminated quite quickly. </p><h2>  Energy class </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Indesit 167 SFR freezer is inferior to many models in terms of energy consumption.  It consumes quite a lot of energy.  Class D marking means that about 540 kW of energy is used per hour.  Accordingly, apartment owners who use this model should understand that they will have to pay a lot.  If you want to save on the family budget, you need to choose a technique that has the highest class of energy consumption.  We are talking about devices A ++, A + and A with thick walls. </p>
