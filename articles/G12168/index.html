    <p>  Sengiley reservoir, whose depth is 32 meters, is a natural gem of the Stavropol Territory.  The proximity to Stavropol makes it popular among locals.  The reservoir is 10.5 kilometers long and 5.7 kilometers wide.  It is located in a hollow on the <span>Stavropol Upland</span> and enters the city limits. </p><p>  The reservoir has a diverse ichthyofauna, which has increased significantly after the formation of protective shields, they help save a lot of young animals.  The resources of the reservoir increased significantly after students and employees of the local agricultural institute released small crustaceans into the reservoir. </p><h2>  What kind of fish is found here? </h2><p>  Fishing at the Sengiley reservoir is possible only with the appropriate permission, since there are a large number of rare individuals.  We are talking about shemay, fisherman, bacon, bream.  The Sevan temple, the hybrid of the beluga and sterlet, the grass carp <span>,</span> as well as the motley and ordinary silver carp, are especially carefully guarded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also planned to stock the reservoir with carp and several more species of silver carp.  Recently, mussels of Dreisen have been actively developing in the reservoir.  They do not allow local treatment facilities to perform their work efficiently.  That is why employees of local zoological services periodically remove mollusks from the reservoir.  It is also planned to populate the reservoir with young sterlet, which feeds on such mollusks. </p><h2>  Local recreation </h2>

    <p>  In order to enjoy a wonderful vacation, a local recreation center is suitable.  The Sengiley reservoir is surrounded by several tourist complexes.  One of the most widely known is the Blue Wave, which is located near a reservoir.  Convenient and inexpensive houses, landscaped area, low prices - the reasons for the popularity of this base. </p><p>  If there is no way to rent a house, you can move into the main building, where a large number of double rooms are available at any time of the year.  If you enjoy outdoor activities, there are sports fields, you can also rent a catamaran and go for a walk on the lake.  Locals often rent gazebos and awnings, where they hold family celebrations, weddings and corporate events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Mermaid" </h2><p>  The Little Mermaid is another recreation center.  The Sengiley reservoir is located next to it.  The base itself is located in a forest on the shore of a reservoir and is equipped with all the necessary infrastructure for recreation.  Braziers, deck chairs, umbrellas - all of this is in abundance.  There is also a playground, as well as showers, which can be used at any convenient time. </p><p>  Almost every day there are dance parties, so guests will not have to be bored.  At the base you can also rent a catamaran and go on a trip through the reservoir.  Hotel rooms are inexpensive, from 500 rubles per day.

    <p>  The Sengiley reservoir, the rest of which is relatively inexpensive, enjoys well-deserved fame.  Local entrepreneurs are trying their best to get land near the reservoir in order to build recreational complexes there, which in the future will bring big profits. </p><p>  Locals are very pleased that there is a really high-quality pond near the city where you can have a good time.  All visitors to the reservoir try to keep it clean and tidy, periodically cleanups are held on the lake shore, during which all rubbish is taken out to garbage dumps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Beach holiday </h2>

    <p>  The beach on the Sengiley reservoir is urban and can accommodate up to 4 thousand people, although in summer there are much more people relaxing there.  It was the result of the activities of a local entrepreneur who managed to obtain permission to conduct <span>recreational activities</span> on the shore of a reservoir. </p><p>  The beach has not yet created all the necessary infrastructure for recreation, now only the first stage has been erected.  In the second stage, it is planned to build sports grounds, recreational attractions, as well as a separate water park.  In addition, in the near future miniature models of the sights of the whole world will be erected. </p><h2>  The mystery of the origin of the reservoir </h2><p>  Sengiley Lake is a subject of long debate because of its origin, since it is still unclear how the deep basin arose at an altitude of 660 meters and was filled with water.  There was a hypothesis that the lake is the remainder of the <span>Sarmatian Sea.</span>  There was also an opinion about the glacial origin of the reservoir. </p><p>  Now researchers are inclined to believe that the lake appeared as a result of the activity of ancient rivers.  The ancestor of the reservoir was the Yegorlyk River, which previously flowed in the area where the reservoir is now located.  Later, the Vishnevaya River flowed there, and from the south of today's lake - the Pear River.  Both rivers have only one bank, Grushevaya - left, Tatarka (successor Vishneva) - right. </p><p>  Such an unusual geological combination gave researchers the answer to the question of how the Sengileevskoye reservoir was formed.  The reason was the failure of the area, which almost completely destroyed the Cherry River, but the remains of the old channel can be found in the western part of the shore of the reservoir. </p><h2>  Pond history </h2>

    <p>  In the mid-1940s, the Sengileevskoye reservoir was a small lake 2 km wide and 7.5 meters deep.  At that time it even bore a different name - Rybnoe, constantly dried up and revived again due to the water coming from the Yegorlyk river.  High salt concentration made people use the lake only for fishing. </p><p>  1948 was the date of the formation of the reservoir, when the water in it changed and has since been fresh.  Ten years later, the reservoir expanded approximately 2.5 times, its width was 5 kilometers, its depth was up to 35 meters, and its width was 10 kilometers.  The total length of the coastline is about 40 kilometers. </p><p>  The reservoir is divided into two parts because of Cape Shpil, it is there that water is drawn, which provides the regional center and its environs.  In the northeastern part of the reservoir you can find a large number of original stones, skeletons of marine animals, as well as prints of insects imprinted on rocky surfaces. </p><h2>  How was the Sengileevsky reservoir formed? </h2>

    <p>  Scientists have identified four stages of the formation of a reservoir.  The first of them is pre-farm, which lasted until 1777 inclusive.  Initially, it was a lake of the same name, which came from the nomadic tribes who lived here during the Middle Ages.  They began to explore the lake only when it was decided to draw it into the economic activities of the regional capital. </p><p>  The "lake" stage lasted from 1777 to 1946, inclusive.  It was then that the lake was stagnant and was practically not used by local residents, with the exception of fishing.  In the mid-1930s, up to 50-55 tons of fish could be caught from a reservoir per month, which is why it was renamed Fish. </p><p>  From 1948 to 1956, the reservoir was at the initial stage, it was then that its formation and increase in the catchment basin began.  Desalination of water occurred due to frequent fillings of the reservoir, which were carried out thanks to Kuban water.  The year 1955 was marked by the opening of a reservoir, which serves the regional center. </p><p>  The fourth stage lasted from 1957 to 1980 inclusive.  Now the reservoir consists of canal branches, a dam, a system for regulating water and its discharge, a water intake system, and also additional equipment.  The current stage continues to this day and is characterized by severe pollution of the reservoir and the formation of the sanitary zone. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2>

    <p>  <span>Residents of Stavropol</span> do not need to travel far, unlike Russians from other cities.  The latter will first need to find the <span>Stavropol Territory</span> on the map to get to their destination.  First of all, you will have to visit the regional capital, and from there it will be possible to go to the reservoir popular with local residents. </p><p>  Free access to the reservoir is closed, but a large number of public transport passes near it.  There are also trails that you can use and go to the lake so as not to catch the eye of the guard.  The reservoir is carefully protected from poachers and those who are willing to pollute it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Stavropol Territory on the map is quite simple to find, it is located in the southern part of Russia.  The reservoir, called Sengileevsky, is one of the natural monuments of the Kuban, in the purification and development of which a large amount of money is invested.  The history of the reservoir is a clear example of how nature grows and develops along with humanity. </p><p>  Inveterate fishermen should remember the need to obtain permission to conduct this activity, otherwise you can get a large fine in the amount of up to 500 thousand rubles.  In addition, even after obtaining permission, fishing will be possible only in certain places, and not at all on the territory of the entire reservoir. </p>
