One of them was the city of Chkalovsk in Tajikistan.  At one time, the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine was built in the Ferghana Valley.  Under this boring name was the first <span>uranium enrichment</span> enterprise in the USSR <span>.</span>  For many years the city, which had strategic importance, was a closed facility, access to which was possible only through special passes.  This also explains the peculiar appearance of Chkalovsk (Tajikistan), whose schools graduated from future specialists in the nuclear industry. </p><h2>  Reasons for the appearance of the city </h2><p>  Russia came to <span>Central Asia</span> for cotton, the supply of which ceased during the American Civil War.  However, the real wealth of this land was uranium.  The mineral, which until the 20th century was used only as a dye for glass and ceramics, unexpectedly became one of the most important strategic resources.  The first radio barites were mined back in tsarist times, and during the war a uranium mine began to operate in Mailuu-su. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsk Tajikistan" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1868740.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After the explosion of the American bomb over Hiroshima, the USSR began feverishly building its own nuclear industry.  The source of uranium is the mines of the Southwest Tien Shan.  Accordingly, it was necessary to build an enterprise for processing and processing ore near the mining site.  The largest settlement in the area was Leninabad, now Khojent.  It was near him that they decided to build the largest plant, which became the pioneer of the nuclear industry of the Soviet Union.  It was in this node that transport arteries from the uranium deposits of Central Asia should converge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City construction </h2><p>  Chkalovsk in Tajikistan has a complicated history.  The construction of the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine started in early 1945.  Experts from all over the country came here, the first test installations, without wasting time, were mounted directly in adobe shacks, the country's nuclear industry was born literally in wooden boilers.  In parallel, the construction of Sotsgorod-6, a village at the plant, was carried out.  It was built mainly by <span>Volga Germans</span> from the Komi camps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsk city Tajikistan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1868747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Soundly judging that the Central Asian climate is much healthier than the northern one, most of them remained here even after the construction was completed.  Wooden barracks were replaced by communal apartments, and later there were "hrushers" in which nuclear industry experts from all over the country began to live. </p><p>  It was here that the first atomic bomb was created and the first nuclear reactor was launched. </p><h2>  What is Leninabad-30? </h2><p>  In 1956, Sotsgorod-6 at the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine officially received the status of a city and became Chkalovsky.  Tajikistan has become the real homeland of Soviet secondary engineering.  So in those years the atomic complex was mysteriously called.  At the same time, he remained a closed ZATO and had the address Leninabad-30. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Chkalovsk Tajikistan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1868748.jpg" width="600"></div>

Accordingly, the unknown Chkalovsk in Tajikistan has become a real capital in this peculiar place.  Experts from all over the country came here to study and gain experience in a combat situation from other closed cities of Siberia and Central Asia. </p><p>  The heavy equipment and fruits that were grown at the Pallas state farm diverged in the opposite direction.  G. Chkalovsk of Tajikistan became the real Mecca of the Union‚Äôs nuclear scientists. </p><h2>  Science and culture of a small town </h2><p>  One of the first civilian objects in Chkalovsk (Tajikistan) was the magnificent palace of culture, built back in 1949 on the central square.  The opening of the Palace of Culture was a brilliant ball, which brought together the builders of the city.  Initially, it was designed to accommodate an educational institution, but it was decided to give it to cultural figures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsk tajikistan photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1868752.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The Central Asian Polytechnic named after Lenin Komsomol was built on the opposite side of the square.  The educational institution of the Ministry of Environment prepared specialists of the nuclear industry of the whole country and was the second symbol of the city along with the famous plant.  Today it is renamed the Mining and Metallurgical Institute of Tajikistan and trains specialists in the mining industry of the republic. </p><p>  Also in the city is the Russian Drama Theater, which moved to Chkalovsk (Tajikistan) from the former Leninabad, and now Khojent. </p><h2>  Showcase Central Asia </h2><p>  The capital of the <span>nuclear industry</span> and the closed zone lived by their own laws and were supplied much better than their neighbors.  Many even called the town a small Moscow.  Photos of Chkalovsk in Tajikistan until 1991 are very rare due to the regime.  However, the existing buildings and structures can give the impression of the appearance of Atomobad, as it was jokingly called in the republic. </p><p>  The city center is built up with residential buildings of increased comfort according to Soviet standards.  The reason for this was the earthquake that happened near Khujand in the late eighties.  The city cost almost no casualties, but many buildings were destroyed.  Civil architecture in the eighties in the USSR reached its peak, and many sought to live in new buildings of those years.  Many new houses were built in Chkalovsk instead of damaged ones. </p><h2>  Buston </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the former union republics were overtaken by a wave of renaming.  The Central Asian powers did not escape this fate.  Frunze became Bishkek, Leninabad became Khojent.  Until recently, Chkalovsk in Tajikistan retained the title of the only city with a Russian toponym.  However, due to the fact that the non-indigenous population almost completely left the republic, it was time for Chkalovsk to change his name.  Initially, the poetic-minded city leaders decided to call him Shokhkant, which means the royal city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chkalovsk schools Tajikistan" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45109/1868734.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, the central government decided to besiege the arrogant Khojent and gave the city the prosaic name Buston - blooming.  The mining and chemical plant, which was the heart of the country, changed its specialization after the independence of Tajikistan and Chkalovsk.  From now on, gold ore began to be processed here, jewelry enterprises began to work.  Today, the plant is going through hard times and is on the verge of extinction, which would be sad for Tajikistan.  Chkalovsk today is mainly supported by its institute and is, in fact, a student city. </p>
