  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The value of the circulatory system in the human body</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The circulatory system of</span> each person plays a very significant role in the life support of the body with all the substances and vitamins that are necessary for normal functioning and proper development of the person as a whole.  Blood constantly circulates through the venous-arterial system, where the role of the main pump is played by the heart, which is constantly in constant motion throughout a person‚Äôs life.  The heart itself consists of the right and left halves, each of which in turn is divided into two inner chambers - the fleshy ventricle and the thin-walled atrium.  <span>A healthy heart,</span> which works in the right rhythm, provides an oxygen supply not only to all internal organs, but also to all cells, taking carbon dioxide and other waste products at the same time.  Thus, the value of the circulatory system is extremely high. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the entire cardiovascular system is in constant development, so that when doing physical education and sports with the right selection of exercises, it is possible to maintain the body in a healthy state throughout almost its entire life.  Unfortunately, many people do not always understand what is the significance of the circulatory system in human life and how the lifestyle affects the heart.  Evidence of this is the sad statistics of an increase in the number of diseases associated with the cardiovascular system.  This is hypertension, hypotension, heart attack, and so on.  That is why all people from the school day should realize that the value of the circulatory system in human life is very important, and you need to be careful about your own health.  The fact is that blood gives the cells the necessary <span>nutrients,</span> as well as oxygen, which is vital for their growth and development. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, in many developed countries, interest in a healthy lifestyle is growing every year, and the number of people quitting bad habits such as smoking and drinking is steadily increasing.  In our country, statistics, unfortunately, is not so favorable, however, today there are some young people who prefer to lead an active lifestyle, engage in tourism and sports.  Indeed, many people simply do not know how destructive <span>ethyl alcohol</span> affects the heart and blood vessels, and as for blood, as a result of poisoning in the blood cells, red blood cells are glued together, which can lead to clogging of blood vessels, as well as internal hemorrhage.  Thus, the great importance of the circulatory system of the body is proved by life itself, since a lot depends on healthy blood.  Incidentally, proper nutrition also affects the blood composition, therefore, if it is balanced and contains a large number of useful and nutritious elements, then there will be much less waste in the body.  A balanced approach to food intake contributes to better absorption of nutrients, and also prevents oxidative products from entering the bloodstream that adversely affect blood composition.  Incidentally, it will also be useful to know that starvation helps to cleanse internal organs of toxins, since "hungry" blood cleanses the body, drawing all harmful elements and substances out of it </p><p>  Everyone wants to have good health, to be able to run and jump, to be beautiful and strong.  All this wealth has been in our hands since youth, and only with time, due to careless attitude to ourselves, we gradually lose it.  If people understood the role of the circulatory system in the body from an early age, then the health of the whole people would become much stronger.  Sports exercises such as jogging in the morning, swimming and <span>hardening with cold water</span> can have the best effect on the cardiovascular system, increasing the adaptive capacity of the body, as well as its resistance to various diseases.  Healthy blood ensures the normal functioning of all human organs without exception, helping them to overcome extreme loads at certain times in life. </p><p>  Thus, summarizing all of the above, it should be understood that the importance of the circulatory system in any organism is simply enormous, and the heart is the main organ that makes life possible as an integral biological system. </p>
