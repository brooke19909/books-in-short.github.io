    <p>  Some people are disturbed by the fact that in the room in the morning the street noise is too audible. </p><p>  And yet, for many travelers, all these shortcomings are a trifle.  Some constantly come to rest in Pattaya and stay at Thai Royal Magic.  The fact that this hotel is located almost a 20-minute walk from the beach should not upset vacationers, the authors of reviews say.  Indeed, instead of being able to quickly quickly get to the sea every day, tourists get many other indisputable benefits, namely: a cozy, clean hotel with regular cleaning, a calm and quiet location, affordable food prices and relatively inexpensive, but no less high-quality food. </p><p>  And the most important thing, according to tourists, is sincere cordiality and constant willingness to help the owners, the spouses Artyom and Svetlana, who will always tell, explain, show and help in everything.  Who does not agree that in a foreign country this is very important? </p>
