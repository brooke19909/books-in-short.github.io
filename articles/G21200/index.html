    <p>  Sorgun has recently gained popularity among tourists and is gradually developing as a resort.  The local climate is very favorable, so there are many orange groves, hibiscus, oleanders.  And the summer period here lasts from March to November. </p><p>  The easiest way to get to the village is from Antalya Airport.  The road takes about an hour.  Sorgun is convenient for those who still have the intention to see the sights.  To Side, for example, tourists can get in just fifteen minutes by dolmushey or taxi.  Transport in the direction of the city runs every twenty minutes.  In the same time, you can reach <span>the Manavgat Waterfall</span> or Kumkoy Beach.  In the village of Sorgun are some of the best hotels in Turkey.  Arcanus Side Resort also belongs to such establishments.  In general, vacation in the village has traditionally been incredibly popular among those tourists who prefer silence, solitude and beautiful nature.  Most of the hotel complexes consist of small bungalow buildings, which are built among pine trees. </p><p>  Local beaches are no worse than nature, they are incredibly beautiful and clean.  The coast has a sand and pebble coating, and the sea is characterized by an azure hue.  Some five-star hotels even built special pontoons or piers for relaxing and swimming on the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go to turkey in october" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2044002.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Since the village itself is very small, then there are no attractions in it.  But you can go for them in Side, you can also visit Manavgat Falls and Titreengel Park.  Local hotel complexes are equipped in such a way that on their territory there is everything for entertainment and relaxation, since, apart from nature, it is difficult to find something interesting outside the hotel. </p><h2>  Arcanus Side Resort reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of those tourists who managed to visit it.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the reviews about Arcanus Side Resort are extremely positive, which is the best indicator.  Even if the hotel has flaws, they are so insignificant that they are not worth mentioning.

The hotel has long earned a reputation as a great place for a comfortable family vacation.  But let's talk about everything in more detail. </p><p>  The territory of the complex deserves special attention.  From a distance, it seems very small.

In general, we can say that the territory of the complex is convenient and thought out to the smallest detail, it is pleasant and comfortable to relax on it. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  Arcanus Side Resort (Turkey) has nice rooms.  Even the standards are well equipped, and all appliances and plumbing are in excellent condition.  Tourists note that the apartments have very comfortable beds, which are incredibly comfortable to sleep on.  Each room has a safe, which you can use for free.  As for the minibar, its contents consist of sweet carbonated drinks, beer and mineral water.  Daily maids replenish his assortment. </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with central air conditioning.  But at the same time you have the ability to control the temperature of the room, which is very convenient.

Or just someone was unlucky with the maid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arcanus side resort entertainment" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2044004.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, it is worth noting that if you want to swim not only in the pool, but also in the open sea, it is better to go on vacation until mid-October.  Rest at such a time has several advantages, firstly, there is already no influx of tourists, and secondly, the cost of tours is significantly reduced.  But there are also disadvantages.  Very often in hotels at the end of the season they start saving on food, the number of animators significantly reduces or removes them altogether.  Therefore, thinking over the question of where to go to Turkey in October, you need to be prepared for such not very pleasant trifles. </p><p>  In the first half of October, summer heat still reigns on the coast of resorts, although there is no more heat.  Daytime temperature ranges from + 25-27 degrees.  But at night it‚Äôs already getting cool: + 16-18 degrees.  Large water masses are so warmed up over the summer that they cool down quite slowly.  The average sea temperature in October is + 22-24 degrees.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But near the end of the month, cold rains begin, which later lead to a cooling of the sea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even at this time you can find a lot of entertainment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Firstly, you can see interesting places, and secondly, go shopping, because at this time in the country begins the season of discounts and sales.</font></font></p><p> In addition, in October you can still visit amusement parks and water parks.  Very often hotel staff at the end of the season is very tired, which affects the level of service.  Rest in the offseason has not only positive, but also negative aspects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arcanus side resort side" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2044009.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the middle of autumn, the period of holidays begins in the country.  The most important of them is Kurban Bayram.  It is celebrated for four whole days.  At this time, you can see numerous shows, fireworks, demonstrations and festivities.  And at the end of the month, the celebration of the Muslim New Year begins.  If you are interested in festive events, then you can choose a tour that will coincide in time with the holidays.  In addition, while relaxing in Turkey in October, you can pay attention to shopping.  At this time, the weather allows you to visit the local colorful markets and shopping centers where you can buy gold jewelry and fur and leather products.  A small number of tourists during this period forces traders to be more compliant and make good discounts. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, we can recommend "Arkanus Side Resort" can be recommended for a wonderful holiday on the Mediterranean coast.  Especially the hotel is good for families with children, as if the coast itself is created for kids.  A good level of animation makes the stay of adults and children in the hotel incredibly interesting.  The complex is good in every way, because it offers excellent food, comfortable modern rooms and decent service.  All the advantages of the hotel are also complemented by the beauty of the surrounding nature and the complex itself, which is surrounded by greenery and flowers.  Holidays in this place will certainly appeal to all categories of tourists. </p>
