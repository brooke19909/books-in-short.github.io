    <p>  But not everything is really smooth and good.  Often there are often problems with broadcasting and broadcasting channels.  The most common of them is a problem with the signal when showing.  Undoubtedly, each owner of a satellite television package has repeatedly thought about the question of why Tricolor does not show.  Not every user can solve this problem on their own, so you have to contact the technical support service and call the wizard, which is already expensive in itself.  And yet this does not prevent satellite TV from gaining more and more popularity with users and potential customers every year.  This fact, in turn, leads to the search for solutions to a number of problems related to satellite broadcasting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why don't the channels show? </h2><p>  Reasons why Tricolor channels don‚Äôt show: </p><ul><li>  The most common problem causing broadcast problems is environmental impact, in particular precipitation.  This is reflected in the quality characteristics of the receiving signal.  Often does not show "Tricolor TV" in the rain.  The reason for this is the small diameter of the installed signal receiver.  Typically, the cable service provider provides the consumer with standard antennas.  In view of this, due to the numerous features of the terrain, in the presence of adverse weather conditions, the power of a standard signal receiver is not enough for high-quality broadcasting. </li><li>  The signal may be distorted or lost due to poor-quality settings of the signal receiver itself - this will ultimately cause the signal to disappear or cause image distortion.  Regardless of how often such a problem arises, solving it will not be too difficult.  Such a broadcast violation can also occur due to damage to the cable (connecting the antenna and the TV). </li><li>  A fairly common problem that carries the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy Tricolor doesn‚Äôt show‚Äù that concerns consumers of satellite television services is a variety of obstacles that arise on the ground (the presence of trees on the site, neighboring houses or buildings of a different nature, etc.) .  How to solve this problem?  First you need to understand the reasons for the broadcast violation, and then you need to reinstall your existing antenna to another location.  Perhaps removing visible obstacles. </li><li>  Sometimes the cause of interference in signal transmission may be the ice present on the antenna. </li><li>  Free Tricolor channels (or all channels) do not show in most cases when carrying out technical work on the satellite itself, in which case it is necessary to expect their completion. </li></ul><p>  You should not independently understand the structure of a satellite television system, while having the best intentions.  You can disable already sensitive equipment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><br>  Channels do not show after payment </h2>

    <ul><li>  If a number of channels are not broadcast, then the fact that for watching some channels must be paid separately may be a possible reason for what is happening.  In such a situation, you just need to pay extra for using additional TV channels and thereby extend their viewing. </li><li>  Perhaps the reason why Tricolor stopped showing after payment is the lack of an access card.  To do this, check if the access card is correctly inserted into the receiver. </li><li>  As the practice of using satellite television, as well as numerous consumer reviews of company services, show, the reason why Tricolor does not show after payment, as well as the receiver itself is the cause of signal interference or possible failures.  To eliminate any interference, a switch is provided on the rear panel of the receiver.  You can try turning the device off and on.  It is recommended that after turning off the power itself, wait 5 minutes, and then turn it on. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, such cases are not uncommon when you are unable to find out on your own why Tricolor does not show.  For example, if ‚Äú8888‚Äù is clearly visible on the receiver‚Äôs display, either the receiver blinks or is off.  In this case, you will have to contact the technical support for repair work on the device.  If the screen displays ‚Äú[]‚Äù, this means that the receiver has factory settings and you need to reconfigure it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After 1 year of using the Tricolor TV satellite TV services, most viewers no longer receive paid packages of the Optimum or Maximum HD TV channels.  You are subscribing for next year, but still does not show Tricolor.  The coded channel (TV package) is still unavailable.  It‚Äôs clear that this is not very pleasant, especially since it‚Äôs not very easy to get in touch with the technical support service, and you‚Äôre trying to determine what the reason is and whether the payment has passed, spending a huge amount of time. </p><h2><br>  Channel Activation </h2>

    <p>  Do not forget that after payment you should activate the TV channels.  Having entered the user's personal account, you can place an order to send activation codes so that the broadcast resumes as soon as possible.  If the payment is successful (you did not make a mistake when entering the DRE ID number or numbers of the contract), and Tricolor TV does not show, you should turn on your satellite receiver and leave it on for about 9 hours on the encoded channel. </p><h2>  Do not show free Tricolor channels </h2><p>  Since satellite equipment, like television, is being tested, all kinds of breakdowns and malfunctions are not uncommon here.  You will learn about them and how to eliminate them by reading the material in this article.  We will try to answer all the questions and hope that the written information will be useful.  Scrolling through a huge number of forums devoted to the operation of satellite television, you can see a large number of user opinions, which, first of all, express the hope that the quality of satellite broadcasting will become much better over time.  And these people are right. </p><p>  It is enough to recall that many years have passed since the invention of telecommunications, and at the initial stage of the formation of television there were a number of problems that today can be avoided because modern specialists have some experience and knowledge about telecommunications.  Due to the fact that broadcasting is from a satellite that revolves around our planet, there is an effect of outer space.  In other words, due to the vulnerability of the satellite, malfunctioning of the television can occur. </p><p>  One of the significant problems associated with the operation of satellite television is that the free Tricolor channels do not show.  This is a very common problem that occurs quite often.  What to do in this situation?  Here you can not do without reconfiguring the receiver and restarting it. </p><p>  To do this, it is recommended that you leave the receiver turned on on the Russia 1 channel.  This is a prerequisite that must be met to restart the coded Tricolor TV channels.  After a short period of time (equal to about 9 hours), free channels available on your <span>Tricolor</span> TV <span>receiver</span> open.  If this does not happen, you can reconfigure your equipment to digital broadcasting and enjoy watching TV programs in digital resolution. </p><p>  Tip: in no case do not lose the Tricolor TV subscription agreement and be sure to keep the DRE ID number. </p><p>  If ‚ÄúNo Signal‚Äù is displayed on the display screen, try updating the channel list.  Quite often this helps. </p><h2>  "No signal" </h2>

    <p>  The most common question asked by the technical support service of subscribers is: "Tricolor television does not show today. What should I do?"  Let's try to answer this question. </p><p>  Does not show <span>Tricolor: No Signal.</span>  It is necessary to determine where this message is issued from: from a satellite receiver or from a TV.  The best way to quickly identify this aspect is to work with the remote control of the satellite receiver.  For example, when you press the OK button, the receiver should immediately respond.  A <span>list of Tricolor TV channels</span> or an inscription about their absence will appear on the TV screen.  In this situation, there may be several reasons for the message ‚ÄúNo Signal‚Äù. </p><p>  - does not show Tricolor TV in such a situation if a <span>satellite antenna</span> having a small diameter is installed; </p><p>  - there is a failure of the <span>satellite dish settings</span> due to strong gusts of wind or a blizzard, in this case, you can‚Äôt do without the help of a technical support specialist; </p><p>  - channels are broadcast selectively, perhaps there have been changes in broadcast frequencies. </p><h2><br>  Does not show "Tricolor" what to do? </h2><p>  If there is no broadcasting of the TV channels on the Tricolor satellite television after all the steps described above, you should reconfigure the existing TV channels.  To do this, use the remote control to enter the receiver menu and search for channels.  Then you need to press the appropriate key and scan the satellite TV for channels. </p><p>  In addition, a number of other reasons could be listed that could cause interference or lack of broadcast of the Tricolor satellite television.  Depending on the existing malfunctions, they can be eliminated either independently or with the help of qualified specialists.  However, before you begin to deal with satellite broadcasting, try to pay due attention to the data entered when activating a subscription.  The fact is that the operation of satellite television is based on a subscription system, and incorrectly entered data can cause a lack of broadcasting. </p><h2><br>  Other reasons </h2>

    <p>  So what could be the problem? </p><p>  First reason.  The presence of a malfunction of the satellite converter itself.  In order to troubleshoot, replace the equipment. </p><p>  The second reason.  A broken coaxial cable connecting the satellite dish and receiver. <br>  The equipment has no reaction to pressing "OK".  In this situation, it should be assumed that notification of interference in the broadcast or the absence of the signal itself is carried out by your television equipment.  The cause of problems in the signal supply may be the use of the wrong TV connector to which the satellite receiver should be connected.  Connection is usually made using RCA, Scart, or HDMI inputs.  On the remote control of the television equipment, you need to find the "Source" button, with the help of which the television equipment is activated.  By clicking on the button, you need to switch to the input you need. </p><p>  The third reason Tricolor channels do not show.  If you are using the <span>GS 8306</span> receiver <span>, a</span> frequent problem will be the random nature of the switching of the outputs of the television equipment by the ‚ÄúSignal On‚Äù button located in the upper left area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe remote control.  You can see the active output of the receiver using the indication: if the upper indicator lights up (the indicator is on the left side of the front panel), it means RCA is used, the lower part of the indicator lights up - the HDMI output is active. </p><p>  The fourth reason.  There is an inscription on the display of television equipment: "DRE coded channel" or "no access".  It is necessary to determine the state of the Tricolor TV subscription (it must be active).  You can check the status: </p><p>  - through the personal account of satellite television; </p><p>  - on the official website of the television company, you need to go to the "subscribers" section (by entering the ID number of the satellite receiver) and see the expiration date of the subscription. </p>

To do this, go to the equipment menu, open the "Status" section. <br>  - If your satellite TV equipment with a smart card, disconnect the receiver from the power supply, remove the card, make sure that it is inserted correctly. <br>  - If your device works without a smart card (all receivers that work in MPEG2, GS 8300, GS 8300M formats), then there is a problem with the built-in module.

    <h2>  "Tricolor TV-Siberia" </h2><p>  Tricolor TV-Siberia is almost the same package of satellite television services as the usual Tricolor TV.  The difference is that the activities of TV-Siberia are focused on the eastern part of Russia.  The main difference of this package is that it includes some local channels.  Therefore, if the question arose about why Tricolor-Siberia does not show, the answer to it can be read in this article a little higher. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, from all of the above, we can conclude that satellite television is a significant step in the field of television broadcasting.  However, it does not always show perfect because of its sensitivity to environmental influences.  But this does not reduce the popularity of this type of television; on the contrary, it causes interest among potential consumers of entertainment services.  Perhaps the problems were with broadcasting in the post-Soviet era.  Now this is just a small malfunction. </p><p>  Definitely, in many respects these problems are the fault of both manufacturers of satellite broadcasting equipment, and the workers themselves, who are servicing the hardware.  Since satellite television is a relatively new method of signal transmission, there are a number of shortcomings, the elimination of which requires qualified personnel.  However, at present it is not possible to solve this problem due to the fact that our education is based on the old system of knowledge submission.  Thus, specialists who are really versed in setting up communications for satellite television can be counted on the fingers. </p>
