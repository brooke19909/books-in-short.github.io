    <p>  In 1968, the authorities of the capital presented the resort with this copy. </p><p>  One of the best attractions of the city are the Gardens of St. Clotilde.  It is a park that is easy to find.  It is located in the exclusive area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFenals.  The park offers stunning sea views.  In 1995, the park was awarded the highest title of national treasure of Catalonia.  It was founded in 1919 and is made in the Renaissance style. </p><p>  Children will be incredibly interested in visiting the Dwarf Park, which is located in the suburbs of Lloret de Mar.  The main characters are, of course, the gnomes who hide in the forest.  There are many attractions for children.  And older people can try their hand at adventure routes with many obstacles that must be overcome. </p><p>  In the city center there is a cat museum, which was opened in 2002 by Russian emigrants.  This place will appeal to tourists of all ages.  The three-story mansion has more than three thousand exhibits.  It is unlikely that somewhere else you can see so many cats.  There are figures made of wood, ceramics, porcelain, paintings, silverware, even on the walls depicted "mustachioed-striped." </p><p>  The symbol of the city is a bronze statue of Donna Mariner (wife of a sailor).  It rises on a cliff at the very end of Lloret Beach.  The image symbolizes a woman waiting for a loved one. </p><p>  The city has all the conditions for outdoor activities on water and land.  On the beaches you can ride catamarans, bananas, go on a boat trip on a boat.  A large number of diving centers operate along the coast, providing lessons for diving enthusiasts of different levels. </p><p>  City guests can visit the Water Park, the Marineland Waterpark and the mini zoo.  In the daytime, it is pleasant to stroll through the local streets leading to the center, along which there are many nice restaurants and shops. </p>

    <p>  The city does not fall asleep even after <span>sunset.</span>  Lloret de Mar transforms, dressing in colorful lights.  Night <span>clubs, discos,</span> bars open their doors for lovers of night parties. </p><h2>  Copacabana Lloret 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit this place.  Copacabana Lloret 3 * (Costa Brava) is a good three-star economy class hotel on the Costa Brava.  The hotel has a good location, being almost in the center of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLloret de Mar.  From here you can easily reach any point of the town.  But it is also necessary to mention that there is a casino next to the complex, and therefore, rooms facing the main street are sometimes very noisy from cars and late visitors to nightlife venues.  As for apartments facing the other side, there is much quieter.  Although the overall soundproofing of the walls of the hotel is very weak. </p><p>  The hotel has spacious rooms with far from new furniture.  All apartments have nice balconies with furniture and clothes dryers.  The rooms are cleaned daily and of high quality.  Towels and bed linen are scheduled to be changed.  The rooms, although not new, need repair, but are kept clean.  So it fully corresponds to the status of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="copacabana lloret 3 costa brava" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1548244.jpg"></div>

In general, vacationers praise the local chef, whose dishes are always tasty and varied.

Almost all the hotel staff are pleasant and good-natured people.  In rooms, internet is paid.  But in the lobby you can use free Wi-Fi.

    <p>  The hotel has a local travel guide offering all kinds of trips.  However, many tourists prefer independent trips to Barcelona and other cities.  There is a transport stop near the hotel, so there is no problem getting to the nearest cities.  The capital of Spain is definitely worth a visit and see the famous fountain in action.  This is truly an amazing sight. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Copacabana 3 * - an excellent hotel for a budget holiday.  It is perfect for unpretentious tourists or vacationers who do not consider it necessary to overpay extra money for additional benefits.  In general, the complex provides a full range of services that are necessary for a full beach holiday.  The main advantages of the hotel are: clean rooms, good food and a great location. </p>
