Since ancient times, all women sought to decorate their appearance.  Each nation had its own methods for this.  The Slavs wore wreaths of different colors.  Now these hats young girls can wear only for the holidays, but the hair band on the hair is still fashionable. </p><h2>  Fashion jewelry </h2><p>  Felt for needlework is considered an excellent material for any crafts.  It is easily cut with scissors, and the edges of the fabric do not split, they do not need to be further processed, which is an undoubted advantage in the work.  The fabric is dense, but soft and pleasant to the touch.  Felt for crafts is not necessary to buy meters, in the stores of sewing accessories and needlework you can buy it in small sheets of all kinds of colors and shades. </p><p>  To make felt headbands with your own hands, you need to purchase a glue gun, sheets of material of selected colors and a needle with a thread.  You can create a beautiful hair ornament with a simple bow or flower, make a bouquet or small hearts.  A little princess is suitable crown, pasted over with beads and rhinestones.  You can decorate the craft with any small details - buttons and plastic insects, beads and pebbles. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make a bezel from felt in different ways.  You will learn how to quickly create an original flower, how it can be decorated, how to attach it to a metal rim or a wide elastic band for a child.  Photos of step-by-step production of flowers and a bow will make it possible to combine different types of crafts on one product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bowknot </h2><p>  The simplest version of the felt rim is a metal hoop, sheathed or pasted with felt, on which a small bow is attached to the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt bow" class="if uuid-3110674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110674.jpg"></div><p>  Pattern of a beautiful bow with sizes will help to cut the fabric without loss.  This is the bottom element with jagged edges, the main part and a thin central strip for combining them into a single whole.  You can connect the details of the pattern with both threads and hot glue. </p><h2>  How to make a rose from felt </h2><p>  To decorate the rim of felt can be placed on its front part with small roses of one or different colors.  For their manufacture, you need to cut out a template from cardboard.  This is a circle with many identical petals around the perimeter.  Cut the flower in a spiral, repeating the pattern at each level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt headband" class="if uuid-3110693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110693.jpg"></div><p>  The flower is going on the contrary, from the central point by twisting the fabric into a dense skein.  From the back, the rose is either sewn with stitches in the middle, capturing all layers of felt, or glued with hot glue.  You can decorate the craft with several green leaves located around the flower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Layered bouquet </h2><p>  It is interesting to decorate the rim with different colors, making an effective bouquet.  You have already learned how to make a rose, let's look at how to assemble another variant of buds with separate petals from felt.  Several details are cut out according to one pattern - from 4 - 5 petals to 8, as in the photo below.  In the technique of quilling, thin central skeins are twisted from thin stripes of yellow and white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers on the rim" class="if uuid-3110686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110686.jpg"></div><p>  Each petal is pressed in the center by fingers before gluing to the core.  Such a pinch gives the crafts volume.  Hyacinths are made from a strip of fabric cut into small "noodles" on one side.  It is simply wound around the wire in a spiral. </p><h2>  Variety of colors </h2><p>  This felt headband is more like a wreath.  Large flowers are in the center of the craft, and closer to the edges there is a decrease in their size.  The crafts ends with leaflets on both sides.  The most lush flowers resemble autumn asters or dahlias.  They are made of wide strips of felt by folding in half.  Then, the noodle fold line is cut with scissors.  The flower is made by winding up a dense skein. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY felt headbands" class="if uuid-3110717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110717.jpg"></div><p>  The midpoints of other large wreath buds are twisted in the same way.  Petals are cut according to the pattern.  They can be simply round or have an elongated shape with a wavy edge.  This is already every master decides independently. </p><h2>  Large flower </h2><p>  The bezel with one large element on the side looks great.  Such a flower, as in the photo below, is made in layers.  The middle is formed as described above, that is, a wide strip is folded in half and cuts are made on the fold line.  Then they twist into a tight skein and straighten the loops in all directions.  The edge of the strip is attached to the last turn with threads or with a glue gun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large flower" class="if uuid-3110706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3110706.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to cut a lot of petals of three different sizes according to the template.  Small parts are first attached to the core, the next row is medium, the largest petals complete the assembly.  So that they are voluminous, in the center at the base, the fabric of each element is slightly incised and the ends overlap one another. </p><p>  As you can see, felt crafts are easy and quick to create; the rims are bright and saturated.  Since the fabric is soft and warm, working with it is a pleasure.  Be sure to try to make an original bezel for yourself or your child!  Good luck </p>
