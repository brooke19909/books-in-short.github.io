    <p>  The history of origin is quite interesting.  Many young needlewomen are interested in the history of the product before its creation.  The art of weaving appeared during the existence of the North American Indians who loved this type of jewelry.  In the middle of the last century, baubles were popular with some subcultures, including hippies.  At that time, fashion went not only to bracelets, but also to small bags, headbands, made in the same way.  Therefore, even now, young things are popular with various gizmos with ornaments that came from the Indians. </p><h2>  Color selection </h2><p>  Before <span>weaving a bracelet</span> , you must definitely decide on the colors.  For example, the direct weaving pattern, which depicts a specific pattern, will not look good if completely inappropriate shades are used for it.  But on neutral patterns, you can safely take your favorite colors.  A bracelet made for a gift should clearly match the preferences of a person who will soon receive such a homemade surprise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="direct weaving patterns with inscriptions" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1411574.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many rely on the fact that the baubles carry some kind of hidden meaning, so each color has its own designation.  In this case, you can make a bracelet for yourself, which will give some strength to its owner and will help in difficult situations. </p><h2>  Varieties of Nodules </h2><p>  As you know, the direct weaving scheme consists of small squares that indicate nodules.  Each cell in the circuit is a double nodule.  There are several ways to tie the thread: </p><ol><li>  Direct.  The left thread is placed on top of the right, and then the first knot is made.  The first thread should be pulled all the time.  After the first knot, the second one is done in the same way (with the same threads).  So it turns out the left <span>straight knot,</span> and the right one is done in the same way, only the right thread lies on top of the left. </li><li>  Corner  In this case, the first knot is tied in the same way as a straight one, and the second is done as follows: the main thread is skipped under a stretched one. </li></ol><h2>  Weaving patterns </h2><p>  Baubles are woven in two ways: direct or oblique weaving.  The direct weaving scheme is most acceptable for needlewomen, since only thanks to it can any pattern be created.  But the oblique weaving makes it possible to make only a repeating ornament. </p><p>  The option of <span>oblique weaving</span> is incomprehensible to many, and by no means everyone gets the first time.  It is very easy to get confused in such schemes, so beginners often start with the direct one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="direct weaving pattern" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1411573.jpg" width="310"></div>

Before starting work, you need to find a drawing, according to which the product will be made.  It could be: </p><ul><li>  direct weaving scheme for baubles; </li><li>  pattern designed for cross-stitch; </li><li>  scheme created with your own hand on a piece of paper. </li></ul><p>  The first steps for beginners will be bracelets of one or two colors, which as a result will look good.  Two colors are necessary in order to try to create any pattern on a thin bracelet.  One color will act as the basis, and the second - the background color. </p><p>  After choosing a scheme and determining colors, you can begin to work.  First you need to calculate how many cells are present in the scheme in width.  Their number will be equal to the number of required threads.  All threads are firmly fixed to the pin, and then the second color is taken, intended for the background, which is attached on the left side.  Next, straight nodules are made: first to the end in one direction, then in the other.  When the hand is a little full, the work will look chic and attract the attention of others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of baubles direct weaving names" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1411575.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Clasp for baubles </h2><p>  Direct weaving schemes with inscriptions or any other images, of course, turn out beautifully in products.  But bracelets without the right clasp will not be finished.  After the required length is reached, the bracelet needs to be fixed on the arm.  To do this, you can use a special clasp, which is sold in every needlework store.  Or you can try to make fixtures yourself.  To do this, at the very beginning of weaving, a small loop of thread is made with which the product is made.  And at the end, one or two small braids are woven from the remaining ends of the threads on which the beads are worn.  Such fasteners are very popular, because you do not have to spend money on extra little things. </p><h2>  How to make a circuit </h2><p>  Creating direct weaving patterns is a fairly simple process.  A special program on a computer or plain paper and colored pencils can help, which is a more common way.  If the picture is too large, then you can download the picture to a computer device, paste it into the Paint program and turn on the grid.  She will split the image into squares, which will be the finished scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creating direct weaving patterns" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42731/1411649.jpg" width="412"></div>

    <h2>  Additional decorations </h2><p>  Among other things, the patterns of baubles with direct weaving (names in particular) will look chic on a female or male hand, if you add other decorations.  The most common are small pendants, which are easily attached to both threads and <span>bead bracelets.</span>  Some people like to make a watch strap by weaving a bauble.  It turns out a rather original version, which can not be purchased anywhere for money.  In friendly companies, it is customary to hang <span>friendship symbols</span> on bracelets <span>,</span> for example pieces of a puzzle that can be joined together, different parts of yin and yang, and so on. </p>
