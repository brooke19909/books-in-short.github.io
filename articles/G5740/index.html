The vastness of Russia is unlimited, so it can be organized on the territory of its homeland.  However, some people prefer to spend holidays in other, hotter and exotic countries, exploring the sights and culture of various peoples.  Where can I go to relax in the winter?  What features do these or other resorts have?  This is our article. </p><h2>  Central Europe </h2><p>  In winter, the central part of Europe is a great place to visit with a tourist visit.  Where to go to have a rest in the winter abroad cheap?  A great option could be Finland, Sweden and Austria.  It is here that at this time of year the New Year atmosphere reigns, pleasing to the eyes of both adults and children. </p><p>  In Germany and Austria, New Year's fairs and sales are held in winter.  On them you can not expensively buy great things and souvenirs for relatives and friends.  In addition, here you can have fun on seasonal attractions, enjoy national treats and take part in competitions.  The most fun cities in the world are Munich, Cologne and Vienna.  However, as experienced tourists note, a large number of travelers come here, due to which a noisy crowd of people forms, which not everyone likes. </p><p>  In Rovaniemi in Finland you can meet the real Santa Claus.  That is why a trip to such a "magical land" will appeal to children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manchesterairport.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to relax in the winter" class="if uuid-2267763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267763.jpg"></div><h2>  Warm countries </h2><p>  When cold weather rages in Russia, many of its inhabitants dream of the onset of heat.  However, some prefer not to wait for warm days, but to take matters into their own hands.  Such lovers of summer go to the southern countries, to the tropics, to the famous resort islands.  <span>Where to go to have a rest</span> in the winter?  Where will it be warm and cozy even in January and February?  The most popular destinations are Egypt, UAE, India, Thailand and Kenya.  It was at this time in the above states that air temperatures were still high.  In recent years, holidays in Madagascar and Tanzania have become popular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where can I go to relax in the winter at sea?  A great option can be the Mediterranean countries.  The refreshing sea breeze here pleases tourists at any time of the year, and the prices for trips in the winter season are pleasantly surprising.  However, it should be remembered that in countries such as Greece, Italy, Cyprus in the winter is pretty cool, it can even snow.  Therefore, there is no question of beach vacations.  But at this time, prices in hotels and restaurants are quite acceptable, and in stores often arrange all kinds of promotions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manchesterairport.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to rest in the winter at sea" class="if uuid-2267762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267762.jpg"></div><h2>  Exotic islands </h2><p>  Where to go to rest in the winter at sea?  Tropical islands can become an excellent option, many of which are washed not only by sea, but also by transparent oceanic waters of blue color.  Many fans of exotic prefer this type of vacation, however, as they notice, not everyone can afford it, since the cost of a ticket to such places is usually about 1500-2000 dollars for two. </p><p>  The most popular destinations where many travelers seek to <span>relax in the winter</span> are Seychelles, Maldives and Canaries.  In addition to a wonderful paradise vacation, every traveler is offered a wide selection of excursions and all kinds of entertainment.  In addition, the islands offer top-class service, which always pleases fans of quality relaxation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Why do tourists choose these islands as places to go to sea in winter for relaxation?  Everything is simple.  It is during the cool period in the climatic zones where they are located that the real paradise atmosphere reigns, and the temperature is kept at around 35 degrees, so that the water warms up to the state of fresh milk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meetmeinparadise.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go in Russia in winter to relax" class="if uuid-2267771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267771.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to go to relax in the winter at sea inexpensively </h2><p>  Winter vacations are not always expensive.  Many travel agencies can offer quite budget options for spending time, moreover, in real paradises.  An example of this is an inexpensive vacation in the famous Maldives.  As some experienced travelers note, if you do not pay attention to hotels located on individual islands, you can please yourself with an exotic atmosphere and first-class service at a very reasonable price.  Many of them recommend visiting Maafushi - a place in the Maldives, where a huge number of guest houses are located.  It is in them that most tourists prefer to rent housing at an affordable price - about $ 45 per day.  As for food, in local restaurants it costs, on average, about 3-5 dollars per person per day. </p><p>  An inexpensive vacation can be organized in <span>Cambodia (Sihanoukville),</span> where the daily cost of a decent room is about $ 5, as well as in Gran Canaria (Spain), where you can enjoy the golden sands and a pleasant tropical atmosphere at a price of $ 18 per person per night . </p><h2>  Where to go to relax with a child in winter </h2><p>  Often, people who love to travel and have already had children, the question arises of where you can relax with them in the cold season.  Of course, there are many options. </p><p>  When choosing a place where you can go on holiday abroad in the winter, having a child, you should pay attention to whether the hotels in this region provide accommodation for minors.  As a rule, these are available in most hotels in the UAE, as well as on the island of Sri Lanka and Thailand, which offer excellent accommodation for tourists of different ages. </p><p>  For the youngest travelers in the above countries there is a wide selection of entertainment.  An example of this is the Dubai Mall and Kidzania in the UAE, as well as a huge number of interesting natural gardens, water parks, amusement parks, as well as other entertainment corners and venues that will not be against visiting not only kids, but also their parents. </p><p>  Preferring holidays in European countries (in the case of planning a family vacation), you can pay attention to such famous cities as Levi and Romaniemi (Finland), Livigno (Italy), Poiana Brasov (Romania), Bansko (Bulgaria), Jasna and Bohinj ( Slovenia). </p><h2>  Ski resorts </h2><p>  Where to go in winter to relax abroad?

Subject to the purchase of a one-day tour to a certain ancient city, it can cost up to 5000 rubles. </p><p>  Many experienced travelers recommend starting their trip from Moscow - in this case, the total cost of the trip will be much cheaper, and the tour will become more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldfortravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where you can go in winter to relax abroad" class="if uuid-2267782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267782.jpg"></div><h2>  Another vacation in Russia </h2><p>  In addition to a tour of the cities included in the Golden Ring, travelers can choose a tour to other equally interesting places.

A great option for fans of this type of vacation will be the famous resort of Krasnaya Polyana, located in Sochi. </p><p>  Fans of extreme recreation in the winter tend to get to Altai, the Kamchatka Peninsula or Lake Baikal, which is one of the main attractions of Russia.  No less beautiful nature reigns on Lake Seliger, renting a house near which can cost about 12,000 rubles for 3-4 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go for a family vacation in winter without a visa" class="if uuid-2267791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267791.jpg"></div><p>  Where to go to have a rest in Russia in the winter?

Many tourists love visiting the Nikitsky Botanical Garden, as well as the hero city of Sevastopol, where there are a huge number of sights of the war years. </p><p>  Experienced travelers recommend not contacting travel agencies with a request to organize a vacation in Crimea, to do it yourself, competently using Internet resources that offer affordable housing in the private sector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to go to relax in the winter where it is warm" class="if uuid-2267789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2267789.jpg"></div><h2>  Visa-free countries </h2><p>  Where to go to relax in the winter without a visa?
