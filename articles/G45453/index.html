This is a big mistake, because <span>loudspeakers</span> play a key role in this case and cannot be discounted. </p><p>  On the shelves of shops you can find a lot of similar equipment, which differs from each other not only in the manufacturer and size, but also in type.  There are broadband, coaxial and component car speakers. </p><p>  The latter is precisely the most technically advanced option.  In this case, a separate and independent speaker is responsible for each band of the spectrum.  A car equipped with component acoustics ‚Äúsounds‚Äù much better than other solutions.  But the cost of this option, alas, is increasing, and for the perfect sound you have to pay too little money. </p><h2>  Best offers </h2><p>  In order to facilitate the choice of component acoustics, here are a few of the most successful solutions that are very popular among Russian motorists.  For a more visual picture, we list the models in the form of a rating. </p><p>  Component Acoustic Rating: </p><ol><li>  "Focal Performance 165". </li><li>  Audison Prima APK 165. </li><li>  Alpine SPG-17CS. </li><li>  Hertz ESK 165L.5. </li><li>  Ground Zero GZTC 165TX. </li><li>  "Pioneer TS-E130CI." </li></ol><p>  Consider each model in more detail. </p><h2>  Focal Performance PS 165 </h2><p>  Component acoustics from the famous French brand Fokal is the best that can be found on the market.  Reviews about the model are only the most positive, and experts in this field highly recommend it for installation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.focal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Focal Performance PS 165" class="if uuid-2937450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937450.jpg"></div><p>  Component acoustics has a form factor of 16 cm, a rated power of 80 W and a maximum of 160 W, as well as a customizable external crossover.  The operating frequencies of the model are from 60 to 20,000 Hz, which is enough to play songs of any style. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the build quality either.  The speaker itself is made of aluminum, and other structural elements from high-quality plastic mixed with metal alloys.  The model can be bought within 13,000 rubles, which is quite acceptable for this level of performance. </p><p>  Pros of acoustics: </p><ul><li>  clear and bright low frequencies; </li><li>  dense and clear sound; </li><li>  custom crossover; </li><li>  simple installation; </li><li>  nice appearance. </li></ul><p>  No cons revealed. </p><h2>  Audison Prima APK 165 </h2><p>  Despite a very decent price tag, this acoustics fully justifies it with excellent sound, high-quality assembly, as well as a convenient, and at the same time variable installation.  At auto forums, reviews about this model are only positive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.audison.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Audison Prima APK 165" class="if uuid-2937449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937449.jpg"></div><p>  Acoustics comes in a 16.5 cm form factor with a rated power of 100 watts and a maximum of 300 watts.  The frequency range also inspires respect - from 60 to 20,000 Hz.  The kit also comes with a high-quality and reliable crossover.  In stores you can find a model at a price of 12 with a small thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pros of acoustics: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound at all frequencies; </li><li>  Sensitivity Calibration </li><li>  bright and clear voice transmission; </li><li>  good margin of maximum volume. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  too simple and plain-looking appearance. </li></ul><h2>  Alpine SPG-17CS </h2><p>  Alpine's SPG-17CS component speakers come without an amplifier, but with a very attractive price.  The tweeter received a durable dome made of silk, and the magnetic drive is made of neodymium.  Along the perimeter of the structure, ventilation ducts are correctly located for the correct distribution of air flows.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, the Alpine component acoustics offers smooth, clear and high-quality sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hinnavaatlus.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alpine SPG-17CS" class="if uuid-2937452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937452.jpg"></div><p>  The model comes in a standard 16 cm form factor with a rated power of 70 watts and a maximum of 280 watts.  The frequency range of the system is in the range of 68 to 20,000 Hz.  Complete with a column is a no less high-quality external crossover. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  good and detailed sound; </li><li>  very high-quality assembly; </li><li>  good protection against physical damage; </li><li>  convenient and easy installation; </li><li>  adequate price tag (about 6,000 rubles). </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  no amplifier included; </li><li>  for proper wake-up of low frequencies, careful tuning with an exclusively door installation is necessary. </li></ul><h2>  Hertz ESK 165L.5 </h2><p>  This acoustics from the famous brand will come in handy for those who like to jam the passing streets with bass.  This side of the system is especially well implemented.  The model as a whole has a high level of performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hertz ESK 165L.5" class="if uuid-2937455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937455.jpg"></div><p>  The tweeter is made of cellulose and is reliably protected by special impregnation, and the dome itself received a decent angle of radiation.  The rear of the column is rubberized, and the basket has additional stiffeners, which eliminates any serious damage during operation. </p><p>  Acoustics comes in a 16 cm form factor with a rated power of 100 watts and a maximum of 300 watts.  The operating frequency range ranges from 50 to 23,000 Hz.  There is an external crossover, which is also well protected and in general high-quality assembled.  All this pleasure is worth about 9000 rubles. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  good frequency spread, supporting any music genres; </li><li>  very high quality bass; </li><li>  robust construction; </li><li>  Great amplifier included. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  very long warm-up of the speaker at sub-zero temperatures. </li></ul><h2>  Ground Zero GZTC 165TX </h2><p>  This component acoustics is perfect for those who like loud and clear sound.  The system received a plastic case, which significantly reduced the cost.  This slightly affected the quality of the case, but there are no problems with door mounting: nothing rattles and creaks.  A simpler installation - under the seat or on the panel - is not recommended. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caraudio.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ground Zero GZTC 165TX" class="if uuid-2937453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937453.jpg"></div><p>  Acoustics comes in a 16 cm form factor with a rated power of 110 watts and a maximum of 160 watts.  Scatter frequency range - from 50 to 20 000 Hz.  There is also an external crossover.  The system provides detailed and soft frequencies, and also works well on superimposed effects.  You can find a model in specialized stores at a price within 6500 rubles. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  good sound; </li><li>  a decent margin of maximum volume; </li><li>  detailed frequencies; </li><li>  nice appearance. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  plastic case; </li><li>  not very convenient assembly / disassembly. </li></ul><h2>  Pioneer TS-E130CI </h2><p>  Component speakers Pioneer TS-E130CI series has a non-standard form factor of 13 cm, but this only positively affects the low frequencies.  So lovers of bass and high-quality systems should look at this model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thebassbin.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer TS-E130CI" class="if uuid-2937451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2937451.jpg"></div><p>  Acoustics has a nominal power rating of 35 watts and peak - 180 watts.  The operating frequency range ranges from 35 to 33,000 Hz.  This, judging by the reviews of the owners, is enough for high-quality listening to music in almost all directions.  An external crossover is also included. </p><p>  The only thing owners sometimes complain about is not always clear highs in some classic compositions.  There are no questions regarding the build quality and other issues.  The model can be bought in specialized stores for about 6.5-7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  excellent bass reproduction; </li><li>  good sound even without an amplifier; </li><li>  very high-quality assembly; </li><li>  convenient and easy installation; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  adequate cost. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  not always clear highs on some classic compositions. </li></ul>
