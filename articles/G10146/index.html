There are no particular complaints about the number of rooms.  Many note not entirely new furniture and a somewhat modest atmosphere, but this is not an obstacle to normal living.  Check-in is quick.  Many of our compatriots advise not to book expensive apartments, because in this hotel even the standards are quite good. </p><p>  Moreover, if for some reason the number was not liked, then it can be changed for free. </p><p>  As for nutrition, there is no dissatisfaction on this issue.  There are a lot of fish and seafood, vegetables and fruits at the buffet.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was drinks that were not provided during dinner.  Judging by the reviews, tea / coffee and water machines are only included for breakfast and lunch.  During dinner, drinks are served by waiters upon request. </p><p>  The hotel area is beyond praise.  She is completely green.  The main building has gazebos with sunbeds, hammocks are tied everywhere between palm trees.  Many of our compatriots liked to lie and watch how palms sway. </p><p>  The beach is a real "paradise pleasure."  If you move away two hundred meters from the noisy bar, it becomes not so crowded, although all the basic infrastructure is located there.  There are many sunbeds, but they need to be occupied in the early morning. </p><p>  The vast majority of Russians rated the work of the staff highly.  Regardless of whether a tip was left or not, the maids every day, during cleaning, twisted funny figures from towels, changed the water and were always welcoming.  True, there is dissatisfaction with some of the waiters, but these are rather the only cases. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The contingent of the hotel is Europeans.  Every year there are more and more Russians.  Animation is everywhere - on the beach, in the pool, in the lobby bar.  In the evenings, concerts and discos with noisy dances and free cocktails are organized. </p><p>  In conclusion, we could say that if it were not for the many hours of flight, judging by the reviews, most of our compatriots would return to this hotel as soon as possible. </p>
