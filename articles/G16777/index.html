Indeed, most people go there on sea vacations.  Indeed, many people know about crystal clear water and the cleanest Blue Flag beaches.  But the topic of our article will not be the resort charms of this city, but the sights of Budva (Montenegro).  What to see in the most ancient center and environs, where to go and go - read about all this below.  We have prepared for you a brief description of the main historical and natural interesting places of this ancient city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Budva" class="if uuid-2443500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443500.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From Russia, you can quickly get closer to the sights of Budva only by air.  There is no airport in this city itself.  Therefore, tourists fly to the nearest Tivat.  A direct flight from Moscow takes about four hours.  Near Tivat Airport, buses run towards Budva.  Getting there by public transport for about an hour.  Some tourists advise taking a taxi and heading to the Tivat bus station.  There, at least, you can take a seat and put luggage. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.2911489" data-lng="18.84029499999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/8/3/4/2834.png"></div><h2>  Sights of Budva and surroundings: where to go on foot </h2><p>  If you settled in the city itself, then you can get "for two" to the main iconic places of this resort.  The old quarters, surrounded by a fortified wall, are within walking distance.  The main attractions of Budva are concentrated there.  Not far from this quarter is a very interesting Archaeological Museum.  Also very close by is the original square of the Churches with old cathedrals.  And next to the city wall is Poets Square, where you can still listen to poems by various Montenegrin authors.  And in the vicinity of the city there is the Podmaine Monastery, which can also be reached on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="montenegrina.net" data-author=": Bratislav Tabas, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Churches in Budva" class="if uuid-2443549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443549.jpg"></div><h2>  Old Budva </h2><p>  This is the place where crowds of tourists seek.  Of all the attractions of Budva, the Old Town is probably the most popular.  It is located on a peninsula connected to the mainland only by a narrow sandy isthmus.  Here you can see such an alloy of architectural styles, which, probably, is rarely found anywhere.  Venetian palaces and ancient Slavic temples, cobbled narrow streets, twined with bright colors, as if somewhere in the East ... You can wander endlessly in this city, as if in a fairy-tale wonderland.  But if now old Budva is an urban area, then some hundred years ago the fortress walls served as the border.  Residents erected this powerful stronghold to escape from the Turkish invasions.  Despite the fact that in 1979 the city experienced a severe earthquake, and many historical monuments were damaged, many were still able to be restored.  And now thousands of travelers are beckoning medieval quarters.  And this is not just a museum.  In these old houses there are people who brew coffee and dry clothes, do their daily business. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com.sg" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g304074-d2310618-i221977790-Altstadt_Old_Town_Budva-Budva_Budva_Municipality.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old streets of Budva" class="if uuid-2443535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443535.jpg"></div><h2>  The fortress of old Budva </h2><p>  The ancient citadel, built in the ninth century, is the pride of the city.  This attraction of Budva today has turned into a cultural and entertainment center, as well as a tourist office.  There is a maritime museum, a panoramic restaurant and a theater where actor festivals are held annually.  A prominent place is occupied by the library of the citadel, where there are very ancient books on the history of the Balkans.  Tourists often like to be photographed against the background of old bookbindings and luxurious burgundy armchairs.  Although the city center is completely surrounded by walls, they have two entrances through which tourists and locals get here.  Two of them still have the appearance of an ancient gate.  The citadel is the hallmark of the city.  After all, it is she who is depicted on postcards, magnets and other souvenirs.  Of the most ancient buildings, only a few walls and a tower have been preserved here.  And everything else dates back to the 15th century, but from this it looks no less magnificent.  The height of the walls reaches ten meters.  You can climb them (entrance is paid) and from there look at Budva from a bird's eye view. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wiztours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress of Old Budva" class="if uuid-2443532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443532.jpg"></div><h2>  Temples of the old center </h2><p>  So, we visited the citadel.  And what to see in Budva (Montenegro)?  There are a lot of attractions.  Inside the fortress walls, several ancient churches, both Orthodox and Catholic, have been preserved.  This complex is located in the southeast of the Old Town.  These are six churches built in different styles.  Many tourists leave rave reviews about the Gothic temple dedicated to St. John.  Its high bell tower looks especially colorful.  No less interesting is the magnificent bishop's courtyard.  Two small but very beautiful Orthodox churches - St. Sava and Trinity - are nearby.  And adjacent to them is one of the oldest temples of the city.  This is Santa Maria del Punta.  It was built in the ninth century.  It was erected by Benedictine monks on the cape itself.  The temple was once part of a large monastery, which has not survived to our time.  Now this church is not used for worship, but for concerts.  This is not surprising, because this temple has amazing acoustics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tropki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of st. John in Budva" class="if uuid-2443521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443521.jpg"></div><h2>  Archaeological Museum </h2><p>  If you are thinking about what to see from the sights of Budva and learn more about the history of the city, then be sure to visit this place.  It is often believed that such museums are boring and there is nothing attractive to modern people in them.  But you will definitely like this museum.  Here are collected jewelry, coins and weapons of the Greco-Roman period - more than three thousand exhibits in total.  The museum opened not so long ago, in 2003.  And the earthquake that destroyed many houses in old Budva, unexpectedly turned out to be a find for archaeologists.  They were able to carry out a full-fledged excavation and bring to light the ancient god artifacts that were stored in the depths of the earth.  Here there are plates with mysterious inscriptions, and household items, and jewelry of various cultures - from ancient Greek to Byzantine.  There is even a real helmet dating back to the 5th century BC.  And on the second floor of the museum is an ethnographic exposition that talks about how the peoples of Montenegro lived. </p><h2>  What is nearby </h2><p>  Not far from the city center is the famous Podmaine Monastery, or Podostrog.  This is another interesting attraction of Budva, where you can go on foot, without using public transport.  From the historical center to the monastery is approximately 2.5 kilometers.  There are signs everywhere, so it's hard to get lost.  The monastery is very old, and even historians do not know exactly when it was built.  But he became famous during the reign of the local Nemanich dynasty - that is, from the XII century.  There is a legend that it was in this monastery in the thirteenth century that Saint Sava took the tonsure, who later founded the Serbian Orthodox Church.  The monastery is located at the foot of the Ostrog mountain.  For many centuries, it was either a functioning monastery, or the residence of Montenegrin rulers, or a defensive structure (during the time of Austrian rule).  He was stormed and robbed, and earthquakes destroyed the walls.  But now it is again a monastery for monks.  Here are two interesting churches - Malaya and Bolshaya Assumption.  The first of them dates back to the 12th century and is completely underground.  And if you are a lover of boat trips, go to the island of St. Nicholas.  It can be seen from anywhere in Budva.  There is one of the most picturesque beaches on the rocks.  It is called "Hawaii." </p><div class="photo" data-original="montenegro-for.me" data-author=": Marianne van Twillert-Wennekes, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Podmaine Monastery near Budva" class="if uuid-2443543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443543.jpg"></div><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  And what if you already looked at everything in Budva itself (Montenegro)?  Where to go?  Attractions are in the vicinity.  In this area there are a lot of ancient monasteries and even the whole island, which is an elite resort.  On the mountain above Budva is the village of Pobori.  Next to it is the ancient monastery of Stanevichi.  And on the road to Kotor, four kilometers from Budva, you can visit Podlasstvo.  This is a convent, known for the fact that in the century before last there was the headquarters of the rebels against Turkish rule.  If you go a little further to the area around Budva, you will see one of the best natural pearls of Montenegro - the Bay of Kotor.  It is difficult to resist this amazing landscape when, at the turn of the road, an emerald sea with picturesque islands suddenly opens before you.  Five kilometers from Budva is the famous Sveti Stefan - a resort with luxury hotels, authentic houses with red roofs and three ancient temples.  And from Budva you can go to the most beautiful lakes in the country - Pivsky and Skadarsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Krzysztof Żwirski, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sveti Stefan island near Budva" class="if uuid-2443526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2443526.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of the city of Budva (Montenegro): reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Most of those who have visited Montenegro leave enthusiastic comments about this country.  They are especially struck by the city of Budva.  He has a lot of attractions, most of them are accessible to backpackers.  And besides, there is magnificent nature, the gentle sea and the bright sun.  The old town begins literally a few meters from the beach.

Travelers claim that it is best to walk around the old city in the early morning, when there are still no crowds of tourists and terrifying heat.  Then you can feel the local spirit and take the best photos.  It has a special atmosphere.
