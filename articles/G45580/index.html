It is no coincidence that about 20 million people visit the resort with thermal healing baths, rich nightlife, and wonderful parks.  The pearl of the Danube is also famous for castles with centuries of history. </p><p>  However, there is a unique architectural complex, which locals call the main romantic attraction.  The most visited Vajdahunyad castle is located in the City Grove and demonstrates the features of four architectural styles, which is surprising for structures of this kind. </p><h2>  The history of the castle </h2><p>  The history of the appearance of Castle Vajdahunyad is very interesting, and, probably, it is the only castle in the world that grew out of scenery.  It all began in 1896, when the Hungarians celebrated the millennium of their homeland.  It was a real holiday with memorable events, and the authorities did not skimp on various celebrations.  In the very center of the city, where the Varoshliget park is located, an unusual exhibition called the ‚ÄúHistorical Pavilion‚Äù opened, the exhibits of which were made of cardboard and wood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vaidahunyad castle hungary" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1449784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Residents of Budapest</span> and guests of the glorious city were amazed at the copies that played an important role in the history of buildings.  The layout of the beautiful building, which was an installation of the Corvinov estate located in Transylvania, was so liked by everyone that it was decided to erect the Vaidakhunyad castle in the same place, but already made of stone, not papier-m√¢ch√©. </p><p>  Matthias I of the Hunyadi clan is the beloved ruler of the country's inhabitants, known by the name of Corvin, which translates as ‚Äúraven‚Äù.  In his honor, the pavilion was named, which became the most popular at the celebration of the birthday of Hungary. </p><h2>  The main sensation of the exhibition </h2><p>  The famous architect I. Alpar erected Vaidakhunyad castle, because it was he who invented the miniature copy of the unusual ensemble.  A talented master prepared in advance for the opening of the exhibition and visited Transylvania several times, sketching interesting structures. </p><p>  The architect was running out of time, and due to a lack of funds and time, he realized that he would not be able to build a historic castle from brick.  In the end, he created a pavilion from improvised materials, which was called the "construction on chicken legs."  However, the people liked the creation, and the visitors of the exhibition expressed a unanimous opinion that the Vaidahunyad castle became the main sensation of an important event. </p><h2>  Building Attractions </h2><p>  The ordinary people were heard by the authoritative faces of Budapest, so everyone supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding an architectural ensemble that glorified the City Grove.  So there was a magnificent building of stone, steel and reinforced concrete, called Vaidakhunyad Castle.  Hungary did not forget the merit of the architect, and a monument to Alpar, which left a cultural heritage, was erected next to an important attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vajdahunyad castle how to get" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1449782.jpg" width="600"></div>

Unfortunately, the building was seriously damaged several times during the bombing during World War II, and until 1990 the castle was completely reconstructed. </p><h2>  The combination of architectural styles </h2><p>  The architect connected in one place something that no one had ever done before.  When creating the project, Alpar took elements from other architectural structures known throughout the world. </p><p>  So, some parts of the capital's pearl can resemble the legendary <span>castle of Count Dracula</span> and the medieval fortress of Segesv√°r.  A chapel is built on the left side of the monument adored by local residents - an exact copy of the church located in the village of Yak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vaidahunyad castle budapest" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1449785.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <h2>  Medieval tale </h2><p>  The stone castle Vajdahunyad (Hungary), which has never served as a defensive structure, has long attracted special beauty.  To get inside the sights, you must go through the stone bridge through the massive gates in the Gothic style. </p><p>  Initially, they were built on the shore of an artificial lake, but only a year ago, the reservoir, which turned into a skating rink in winter, was drained, and in its place an unremarkable lawn appeared. </p><h2>  The complex of buildings in the Romanesque style </h2><p>  What awaits visitors who first find themselves in Vaidahunyad Castle (Budapest)?  To the left of the entrance is the Romanesque part of the building, which tourists love.  It consists of a consecrated chapel copying the church of the settlement of Yak, a monastery courtyard with openwork columns, in the center of which a decorative well is installed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vajdahunyad castle" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1449786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ensemble includes a covered gallery with luxurious rooms designed for the Emperor <span>Franz Joseph,</span> and later an administrative building was equipped here, inside which tourists are not allowed.  The angular structure invented by the architect and called the ‚ÄúTower of Torture‚Äù refers to the Romanesque complex. </p><p>  Behind it is a Gothic ensemble, and the Baroque and Renaissance parts are connected by a passage for the convenience of tourists.  The lavishly decorated buildings evoke sincere admiration of visitors who admit that the Vajdahunyad Castle (Budapest) is the most beautiful architectural monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Varoshliget park" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1449787.jpg" width="600"></div>
