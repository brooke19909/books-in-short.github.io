  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the human tooth and a little about other organs of the oral cavity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, a beautiful diagram of the structure of the tooth can be found in the office of almost every dentist.  The colorful picture shows a complex multilayer structure, and small parts indicate various parts of this organ.  However, not everyone is able to immediately repeat all levels of the tooth and their functional features.  This article is for those who do not yet know, and for those who do not remember the structure of the human tooth very well.  For a general idea, we supplement the presentation with information about the <span>oral cavity</span> as a whole. </p><p>  So what is the structure of a person‚Äôs mouth?  Of course, first of all, when considering this anatomical region, lips should be described.  They are unusual in that the skin of the red border is not really skin, but has a lot in common with the mucosa.  She cannot moisturize herself, therefore, from time to time, licking her lips is mandatory and natural.  Otherwise they will crack.  There is also one not very well-known fact about the cheeks - since it is possible to take cell samples without trauma, it is from the cheek that pieces of the mucous membrane are taken to determine the athlete's chromosomal sex.  Sometimes the results are surprising. </p><p>  Small mucous glands are located in the inside of the cheek.  They secrete a protein secret.  The tongue consists of striated muscles, the organs of taste sensation are located on it - 3 types of papillae.  At the root of the tongue is a special formation - the lingual tonsil.  This is an organ of the human immune system, and it is of great importance in the fight against infections.  The structure of <span>the</span> human <span>oral cavity</span> is deeply rational. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The teeth are located on the gums in two rows (normal), and the upper arch is slightly larger than the lower, so the upper teeth with a <span>correct bite</span> slightly overlap the lower ones.  Now let's talk about the structure of the human tooth.  Most of the tooth is formed by a special type of connective tissue full of lime - dentin.  The protruding part of the tooth is covered with a special strong epithelial tissue called enamel.  And that part of the tooth that is hidden is covered with another type of tissue called cement. </p><p>  The place where the surface (crown) and hidden (root) part of the tooth are connected is called the neck.  The line along which enamel and cement connect is named after the cervical line. </p><p>  Each tooth contains a cavity inside called a pulp cavity.  The wide area on top of the tooth is called the pulp chamber, and the area in the root is called the root canal.  It is about this area that dentists say when they talk about filling channels.  The content of this area - the pulp - has many nerve fibers and blood vessels.  This area provides the vital activity of the tooth.  The pulp is surrounded by a layer of special cells - odontoblasts.  They specialize in dentin production.  They are similar to the cells that form the human bone.  The structure of a human tooth resembles in many respects the structure of bones. </p><p>  The vessels and nerves that take care of the tooth enter it through the lower apical opening, which is located at the apex of the root of each tooth. </p><p>  How do teeth attach to a bone?  With the help of special fibers, which consist of connective tissue.  These bundles are called periodontal ligament or simply periodontal.  They consist of collagen fibers, from one end they are immersed in the <span>intercellular substance</span> of the alveoli bone (a special depression in the gum for the tooth), and on the other hand, into the dentin of the tooth. </p><p>  When the process of teething occurs, the gum is fixed in relation to the enamel, and the cervical line does not protrude.  But in older people, the gum "recedes" and the dentin becomes visible.  Of course, this makes the teeth of a person at a respectable age more vulnerable. </p><p>  The structure of a human tooth is not so complicated, but damage at any level is dangerous.  Therefore, you must follow all hygiene measures, and just brushing your teeth is not enough, you still need to clean the gaps between them with a special thread. </p>
