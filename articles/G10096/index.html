Many travelers choose this country for their holidays.  Some come here to immerse themselves in the ancient history of the country, others - to improve their health on the shores of the Dead Sea, and still others enjoy relaxing on the beaches of the Red and Mediterranean Sea. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Special attention in this country deserves the city of Nahariya, located on the Mediterranean coast.  Israel as a young state has its own new history.  The relatively young city of Nahariya was founded in 1935 by a group of enthusiasts led by Dr. Suskin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nahariya israel" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47695/1706817.jpg" width="549"></div>

    <p>  Having acquired a large plot of land from Arab landowners, they dreamed of organizing an original farming here.  And such vigorous activity meant the development of local infrastructure.  But the dream did not come true, because the high-quality products of Jewish farmers were replaced by cheap Arab vegetables. </p><p>  Then the immigrants, not despairing, began to develop resort holidays here with the same activity.  The first customers to come to the new boarding houses were the British, who were fascinated by the mild climate and the warmth of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Mediterranean Nahariya (Israel) freely spreads on the flat terrain in the northern part of the country.
