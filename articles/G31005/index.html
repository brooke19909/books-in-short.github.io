  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beadwork: what a beginner should know</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beadwork is considered the most common type of needlework and at the same time one of the simplest.  Each girl at least once, but tried to do something with her own hands, however, perhaps not everything worked out.  The reason for this is the lack of necessary materials.  In order to engage in this art, only a few elements are required, which you can buy in almost any department store. </p><p>  Need to get needles of the thinnest caliber.  It is recommended to purchase several samples at the same time, since they tend to fail very quickly.  Do not forget about the threads.  They can be dacron, kapron or polyester.  Shine is peculiar to these species, and to the touch they should glide slightly.  Take care of locks, they are of two types.  For example, <span>brick weaving</span> and small necklaces suggest the use of carbines.  All other larger products are recommended to be fixed with locks with curly ears.  As a material, it is recommended to use medium-sized beads, of which it is easiest to form different figures.  Now you can proceed. </p><p>  Products from small beads are simply not replaceable as a gift, especially now that the ‚Äúhand made‚Äù direction is very popular.  In addition, there is a tradition that involves gifting close and dear people with small bracelets.  According to legend, they are <span>symbols of good luck</span> and amulets. </p><p>  The history of jewelry from small beads goes far back to the days of ancient Egypt and Babylon.  During the periods of prosperity of Russia, bead jewelry could be allowed only by the richest and wealthiest women.  An active impetus to this trend was the youth movement of the hippies.  They came up with unique meanings and each color personified certain feelings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  White was considered a symbol of innocence, life and freedom. </li><li>  Yellow personified the desire to live </li><li>  Orange spoke of great love </li><li>  Red was a manifestation of passion </li><li>  Green is the color of hope and faith </li><li>  Blue symbolized infinity and depth of knowledge. </li><li>  Blue brought peace </li><li>  Violet is the color of dreamers </li><li>  Brown and black are considered negative tones that bring death and loneliness. </li></ul><p>  Beadwork is conditionally divided into several types: </p><p>  The most popular is the parallel stringing of beads.  You can execute it using either one whole thread or two separate ones.  Weaving is done by stringing one bead, while the opposite end is passed through the same bead. </p><p>  The second direction is weaving from beads due to the formation of a pattern of volumetric rhombuses.  To do this, you need to start, as in the first embodiment, and then gradually add one bead through each row.  When the desired width is reached, proceed to reduce the beads in the same order. </p><p>  Interesting are products that have completely different colors on each side.  To form an article, therefore, it is necessary to alternate two desired colors through a series. </p><p>  A cross-shaped product is considered a great option.  Start with the technique of parallel stringing, then put a bead on each end and reconnect the thread in one bead, and so on until the desired length is reached. </p><p>  There is also an option that involves weaving a <span>Christmas tree of beads</span> or the name of any person.  Drawings are made using the mosaic technique.  It allows you to create bracelets of different widths and with different patterns.  After studying the main areas, everything else will become simple and affordable. </p>
