    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The sea is just a two-minute walk from Sunbay Park Hotel.  The beach is private, small, with sectoral coverage.  It is sand and pebble and is located in a cozy bay surrounded by picturesque cliffs.  Umbrellas and sunbeds for hotel guests are free of charge.  All the necessary infrastructure is present here.  Separately, I want to say about the sea: it is surprisingly turquoise, and with depth it turns into saturated blue and then blue. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  For the youngest guests, the Sunbay Park Hotel (Marmaris) offers only an extra bed in the room and a shallow compartment in the communal pool.  Due to the small area there is no outdoor playground.  All entertainment infrastructure for younger guests is located outside the hotel.  Parents can take their children to the water park and Discovery Park, where the kids can immerse themselves in a prehistoric atmosphere and see huge monsters - dinosaurs.  With the help of special automation built into their layouts, they react to the approach of a person, move and make sounds.  Judging by the reviews, a visit to this park will really impress the children.  In addition, here you can see a huge terrarium and an aquarium in which exotic fish swim. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has a large outdoor pool.  Comfortable sunbeds are arranged around it, and a bar also works here.  Guests staying at the hotel also have free access to the Turkish or Finnish baths, as well as a gym.  A lot of reviews Russians left about the hammam of the hotel.  He is above all praise.  Everything is balanced here: both humidity and temperature, at the request of customers, employees select aromatic products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunbay Park Hotel Marmaris" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2093756.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  Water rides such as riding a banana or cheesecake are offered on the beach for young people.  Another type of dynamic and very interesting outdoor activity - parasailing, also fell in love with the Russians.  It is provided only by those who have a special license for this.  For those who wish, diving courses are organized on the beach, which will be of interest to both beginners and professionals.  Equipment can be rented on site.  Experienced divers can dive off the boat on the high seas and, together with instructors on special routes, explore water caves. </p><h2>  Tours </h2><p>  Many Russians talk about the wonderful excursions that they bought right at the hotel.  Most of all they liked Pamukkale - a rock complex made of pearl travertine, which is decorated with centuries-old salt deposits of thermal springs.  Even the ancient Romans were treated here with water beating from healing geysers.  A very picturesque picture is a natural cascade from the pools.  The most famous is named after Cleopatra.  No less unique are the rocks of Cappadocia, carved over thousands of years, as well as the Dalmatash grotto. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  To summarize, we can say that most Russians liked the Sunbay Park Hotel in Marmaris.  In their reviews, our compatriots especially note the excellent climatic conditions: there is no strong heat, so many Europeans choose this Turkish resort, especially those who have heart disease or unstable blood pressure. </p><p>  As for the rooms, there is a certain discontent.  Some write that the furniture and appliances are old, however, everything works.  Many Russians ignore this shortcoming, since they spend very little time in rooms. </p><p>  As for the nutrition, the reviews also vary: some liked it, others find it monotonous, besides, the food on the trays is present in small quantities, so I had to ask for the supplement.  But most liked the way they fed in this hotel, moreover, all products can be bought in the nearest market. </p><p>  The beach at the hotel, according to most, is excellent.  Those who are not satisfied with the pebble zone will have to walk a few hundred meters to get to the exclusively sandy bathing area. </p><p>  Some Russians did not like the stiffness of the mattresses in the rooms, there are those who are dissatisfied with the infrastructure, but there are very few of them.  Most expressed a desire to come here again, especially since the price of tours to this hotel is quite convenient. </p>
