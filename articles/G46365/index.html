  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Balance sheet preparation is an important part of accounting</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many people, thinking about starting their own business or creating their own organization, sometimes simply do not think about how they will conduct business.  Sometimes, having no accounting or economic education, a person thinks that he can completely cope with his company.  A small disappointment will befall such enterprising businessmen almost immediately.  Indeed, the effectiveness of the organization to a certain extent depends on the correct timely and accurate accounting, therefore it is necessary that only a <span>highly qualified specialist</span> conduct accounting <span>.</span> </p><p>  One of the main parts of accounting is the preparation of the balance sheet.  Having gone a little deeper into history, it can be noted that the word "balance" itself is borrowed from the French language.  In literal translation, it sounds like balance.  The preparation <span>of the balance sheet is</span> necessary so that the financial and property status of the organization is clearly visible.  This type of accounting includes data from various accounting documents (information about inventory, records about accounts, accounting calculations and others).  The content of the balance sheet consists of two parts: liability and asset.  The balance sheet asset describes the property that belongs to the organization (fixed assets, stocks, intangible assets, cash equivalents, etc.).  The liabilities indicate the sources of assets and their purpose (equity, short-term and long-term liabilities).  In order to check whether the preparation of the balance sheet was carried out correctly, the results of the liability and asset are verified.  If everything was done correctly, then they will be equal.  If the results do not agree, then this is the first sign of a mistake. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It can be incorrectly assumed that the <span>preparation of the balance sheet is</span> optional.  But this is not so.  Indeed, today tax legislation regulates the delivery of the balance sheet to government bodies.  This is a mandatory requirement for absolutely all organizations.  However, it must be said that the purpose of the balance is not limited to this.  It provides fairly complete information about the overall performance of the organization in the market.  In addition, a professional leader, using the balance sheet data, can easily make very competent organizational decisions. </p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that the balance should be carried out in compliance with certain requirements.  First, you should be aware that the balance sheet reflects the work of the organization, and not the activities of its individuals.  Secondly, this type of report is compiled for a certain period (in most cases for a year).  Thirdly, the balance of accounts should be a single uniform scheme in the same monetary terms.  You should also take into account the fact that before drawing up the balance sheet it is necessary to conduct an inventory of the organization‚Äôs assets and its obligations. </p><p>  The balance sheet has a clear structure and structure.  Outwardly, it is a table in which the <span>balance sheet items</span> are indicated <span>.</span>  For each individual article, relevant necessary data is entered.  The columns indicate the assets, expenses and income of the enterprise.  By analyzing such a balance, you can get a complete picture of the non-current and current assets that the organization possesses, as well as determine the potential for their further use for commercial purposes.  If this document is composed correctly, it will be a good example of a balance sheet, on the basis of which you can make the right <span>management decisions.</span> </p><p>  Concluding the article, I would like to briefly recall that when compiling a balance sheet and keeping any other <span>accounting documents, it is</span> absolutely necessary to constantly monitor changes and updates of legislative requirements and regulatory framework. </p>
