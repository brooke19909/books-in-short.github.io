  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Omar Mukhtar: hero of the Libyan resistance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Omar Mukhtar (circa 1860-1931) is the national hero of Libya and a member of the religious organization Sanusia (Sufi religious and political order), which performed administrative and military functions.  He led anti-colonial resistance in Cyrenaica, a historical region in Libya, from 1923 to 1931.  He was captured by the Italians and sentenced to death.  This is one of the most outstanding personalities in the history of the Italo-Turkish war, which lasted from September 29, 1911 to October 18, 1912. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Little is known about Umar al-Mukhtar until the last decade of his life, when he became the undisputed leader of the Sanusite resistance in Cyrenaica.  Even his date of birth is unknown: it is assumed that he was born somewhere between 1856 and 1862 in El Batwan in eastern Cyrenaica. </p><p>  For eight years he studied at the school of the Qur'an Jarabub - the center of the Sanusites, then taught in the Sanusi Zawi (Sufi monastery), participated in hostilities against Italians and their allies during the First World War. </p><p>  When Italians openly attacked the Sanusites in the spring of 1923 (existing agreements were officially announced at the end of April), Omar Mukhtar was one of the most competent and active figures in the organization and coordination of resistance.  As representative of Sanusia, he assumed command of partisan forces, which were often confusing and interfered with regular Italian forces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="military.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bust of lobster in venezuela" class="if uuid-2970835" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2970835.jpg"></div><h2>  Confrontation </h2><p>  In the mountainous region of Jebel Ahdar (Green Mountain), the Italian governor Mombelli succeeded in activating the anti-partisan confrontation in 1924.  As a result, the forces of the Italians in April 1925 inflicted a brutal defeat on the rebels.  Omar Mukhtar quickly changed his own tactics and was able to get the constant help of Egypt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In March 1927, despite the occupation of Jarabub (February 1926) and increased oppression under the governor of Teruzzi, Omar surprised the Italian military in Rahaib.  After successive clashes in various places of Jebel, he was forced to leave.  Between 1927 and 1928, Omar Mukhtar completely reorganized the Sanusia forces, which at that time were constantly subjected to persecution by Italians.  Even General Teruzzi recognized the leader of the rebels as a man of exceptional stamina and willpower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bouwbedrijfdezeewering.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Omar Mukhtar" class="if uuid-2970838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2970838.jpg"></div><p>  Pietro Badoglio, the new governor of Libya (since January 1929), after serious negotiations was able to reach a compromise with Omar.  The terms were similar to previous Italo-Sanusite agreements.  Italian sources falsely described the situation as an act of complete submission to Omar Mukhtar.  This was confirmed by Italian leaders, including Badoglio (who probably supported a misleading statement, hoping to influence anti-Italian resistance). </p><p>  At the end of October 1929, Omar condemned the compromise and restored unity of action among the Libyan forces, preparing for a final confrontation with General Rodolfo Graziani, the military commander since March 1930.  Having failed the mass attack in June against the forces of Omar, Graziani, in full agreement with Badoglio, De Bono (Minister of the Colonies) and Benito Mussolini, initiated a plan for a decisive end to the resistance of Cyreneica.  The plan was to transfer the population of Jebel (about 100,000 people) to concentration camps on the coast, close the border with Egypt from the coast to Jarabuba, blocking any external assistance to the rebels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Death </h2><p>  Since the beginning of 1931, the measures taken by Graziani influenced the resistance of Sanusia.  The rebels were deprived of help and reinforcements, they spied on them, aircraft were used against them, the military persecuted the rebels, using the help of local informants.  Despite the difficulties and growing risks, Omar Mukhtar courageously continued the struggle, but on September 11, 1931 he was ambushed.  He was captured and sentenced to death.  With dignity and calm, he faced this situation and accepted the death sentence with the words: "We have come from God, and we must return to God."  The execution of the old soldier, committed in the Soluk concentration camp on September 16, caused great indignation in the Arab world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.middleeastmonitor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="arrest of Omar Mukhtar" class="if uuid-2970834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2970834.jpg"></div><h2>  Opinions </h2><p>  Omar‚Äôs implacable adversary, General Graziani, left his description, which is not without admiration.  Graziani says that Omar was of medium height, strong, with white hair, a beard and a mustache.  He was endowed with quick and lively intelligence, knew a lot about religious matters.  He showed an energetic and impetuous character, disinterested and uncompromising.  He remained very religious and poor, although he was one of the most important Sanusites. </p><p>  In later times, the author A. Del Boca wrote that Omar is not only an example of religious faith and a born fighter, but also the builder of a perfect military-political organization, which for ten years kept the troops under the control of four governors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frame from the film &quot;Desert Lion&quot;" class="if uuid-2970837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100241/2970837.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Libya, independent, monarchical and revolutionary, declared him its national hero.  His portrait is depicted on a Libyan banknote of 10 dinars. </p><p>  In the Syrian-American film about Omar Mukhtar "Desert Lion" he was played by actor Anthony Quinn. </p><p>  With the beginning of the Libyan civil war on February 17, 2011, he again became a symbol of a single free Libya, his portrait was depicted on the flags and posters of the Free Libya movement.  The rebel forces called one of their brigades "Omar Mukhtar Brigade." </p><p>  In Kuwait, in the city of Gaza (Palestine), in Cairo (Egypt), in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Western Gulf of Doha (Qatar), in Bizerte (Tunisia), in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), in the city of Irbid (Jordan) there are streets named in his honor. </p>
