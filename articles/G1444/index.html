He always occupied an important strategic and geographical position and played a significant role in the history of Russia and abroad.  This is the city of Azov.  We will consider the sights of Azov in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of azov" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/729970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The only one in Russia </h2><p>  In Azov there is a unique attraction, which is the only monument of engineering and military art of the era of Catherine II in the whole country.  This is the Powder Cellar.  The sights of Azov in general, and the cellar in particular, have been studied by many historians for many years.  The research of this object is carried out by L. B. Perepachaev, a researcher at the museum-reserve. </p>

    <p>  Until 1797, the cellar served as a room in which barrels of gunpowder and cores were stored.  A little later, a red brick cellar was erected.  In those days, this building had an unprecedented construction.  So, the building was a rectangular structure, to which the entrance platform was attached.  The walls of the building made it unique.  These are double partitions with ventilation ducts built between them.  They connected with the help of products with windows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Powder Cellar is located on Lermontov Street, 6. </p><h2>  Azov Peter I </h2><p>  In the city on Petrovsky Boulevard stands a monument to <span>Peter I.</span> Many of the sights of Azov are dedicated to various historical persons.  This object perpetuates the aforementioned monarch.  The monument to Peter the Great was established in 1996.  The sculpture was cast at the Mytishchi art casting plant.  Bronze was chosen as the material.  The height of the figure of Peter reaches three meters.  The ruler was hoisted on a two-meter solid pedestal made of granite. </p><p>  The sculpture is as follows: the commander rests his hand on the mortar.  The sculptors portrayed Peter the Great at about the age of 20-22.  Inexperienced, but knowing what he wants, the king with a stern face turned his eyes to the fortress. </p><h2>  General tour </h2><p>  But ahead of us are the most interesting sights.  The city of Azov has one more pride - these are architectural structures that are located in the historical district of the village.  It is here that one of its highlights is located - the surviving ruins of the popular <span>Azov fortress: the</span> Alekseevsky Gate, a fragment of the Genoese wall, the Powder Cellar, a moat and ramparts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Azov photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/729972.jpg" width="344"></div>

For example, the paleontological and archaeological museum-reserve.  The main building of the object is located in an old charming building, which, by the way, is an architectural landmark.  The museum exhibits a magnificent collection of Sarmatian gold, the bones of trogonteries (their age is 600 thousand years), various finds of an archaeological nature, a skeleton of dinoterium, which is approximately eight million years old, and numismatic collections.  Not every world-famous museum can boast of such exhibits.  The institution has a scientific library, the fund of which is more than 20 thousand books. </p><h2>  Torpedo boat </h2><p>  The sights of Azov with addresses are described in our review.  But there is another object in this city that I would like to draw the attention of tourists - a torpedo boat. </p>

    <p>  In 1941, enemy naval assault threatened to land in the Taganrog Bay.  To protect Azov and Don, during 1941-1942 a separate Don detachment of the Azov Flotilla was based in the city.  It included armored boats, <span>gunboats, an</span> armored train and other military equipment.  But the basis of the fleet was torpedo boats.  These were ships of the Komsomolets type.  Until July 1942, the detachment heroically resisted the Nazis.  After that, the boats were transferred to Novorossiysk. </p><p>  The monument is a <span>torpedo boat,</span> which was hoisted on a concrete pedestal.  The ship arrived at its destination on its own. </p><p>  The sights of Azov, photos of which are available in our article, are the life of the city, its history and essence. </p>
