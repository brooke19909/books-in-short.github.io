  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UV LEDs. Features of the use of ultraviolet LEDs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, no one has heard of LEDs that can emit light in spectra such as infrared or ultraviolet.  And now, many areas of production can no longer imagine work without such sources.  Medicine, industry, forensics and even banking - ultraviolet LEDs quickly spread to all industries where they became completely indispensable due to the properties of radiation, durability and low energy consumption.  In today's article, we are talking specifically about similar elements, their features and properties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kerryskritters.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="With the naked eye, ultraviolet is completely invisible." class="if uuid-3058137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3058137.jpg"></div><h2>  General information about UV emitters </h2><p>  Such an LED was born due to an engineer at Nichia Corporation, Shuji Nakamura.  In the year 93 of the last century, he was able to create an element with a blue glow.  For this invention, the engineer even received the Nobel Prize.  The fact that LEDs are in demand in many areas is not in doubt.  However, they have a rather significant drawback over ordinary ones - a low coefficient of efficiency.  The reason is that half of the energy spent on its work is converted into heat.  That is why such radiators require high-quality radiators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Some parameters of various LEDs </h2><p>  Characteristics of ultraviolet LEDs are similar to simple white or color elements, but it is worth noting that the concept of color temperature is irrelevant for him.  The rated current, as well as an indicator of direct voltage or the intensity of the light flux, is similar in comparison with conventional LEDs.  But there is one important difference, which makes it valuable for a variety of uses.  100-400 nm ultraviolet LED is the indicator by which the emitter is selected for a particular application.  It is on the areas of use that are now worth dwelling in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ledfloodlightgensoba.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Various UV LEDs - clearly visible spectrum" class="if uuid-3058157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3058157.jpg"></div><h2>  Where are the LEDs of this spectrum used? </h2><p>  Here you can note 5 main areas experiencing the greatest need for such emitters. </p><ol><li>  The medicine.  Here, such rays can be used for disinfection.  In dentistry, they contribute to the rapid hardening of fillings, and in cosmetology, the disinfection of hands after manicure and the drying of gel varnishes. </li><li>  Industry.  Accelerate the drying processes of adhesive compositions that respond to such radiation. </li><li>  Banking - an indication of the authenticity of banknotes, the identification of fakes. </li><li>  Forensics - the detection of invisible biological traces, washed blood, etc. </li><li>  Agriculture.  Lamps with ultraviolet LEDs are installed in greenhouses.  Their radiation contributes to the growth of vegetables, the destruction of pests, the production of antioxidants. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.blueskyuk.world" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Widely used ultraviolet LEDs in cosmetology" class="if uuid-3058127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3058127.jpg"></div><h2>  Some features of this ultraviolet </h2><p>  There are many myths around such emitters.  For example, that from such lighting you can quickly become blind.  Many believe that if the LED has a characteristic color, then this is ultraviolet.  In fact, they are mistaken in the first and in the second case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ultraviolet LEDs do not have any harmful effect on the human body - this fact has already been proven.  Of course, if a direct stream of such radiation hits the eyes, there will be pain and tearing, but it is unlikely that anyone will do so on purpose.  As for color, it has nothing to do with ultraviolet light, which is completely invisible to the human eye.  Ultraviolet emitters may glow blue or white, and perhaps this will be generally imperceptible.  But it is worth returning to health.  Scientists have proved an interesting fact about the blue glow, which needs to be discussed in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Such lights are often used by forensics." class="if uuid-3058133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3058133.jpg"></div><h2>  What color is most harmful to the human body </h2><p>  As it turned out, the blue glow greatly affects the production of melatonin - the hormone responsible for the phases of sleep and wakefulness.  With the constant exposure of such an ultraviolet LED to the body, some changes occur.  Melatonin begins to be produced more slowly.  What does this threaten a man with?  At first, the usual mode is violated, sleep becomes restless.  Subsequently, significant hormonal changes occur, due to such disorders, a person becomes irritable, falls into depression.  The result (in theory) may be the complete destruction of the nervous system with the final cessation of the production of melatonin by the body. </p><p>  However, only initial changes were proved, which are due to sleep anxiety.  The rest is theoretical speculation, which has an official justification for it, which means that they should be treated accordingly.  Of course, such a theory immediately found many followers who, at every corner, began to "shout" about the mortal danger of such radiation.  However, at the same time, they somehow forget how much more harmful to the body was the predecessor of the ultraviolet light-emitting diodes - a quartz lamp.  Even a fluorescent tube does more harm to the body! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www6.collectionsales.shop" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how things or animals look in ultraviolet light" class="if uuid-3058141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3058141.jpg"></div><p>  In any case, you should not sow panic until the pathogenic effect of LED ultraviolet radiation on the body of humans or animals is substantiated. </p><h2>  How to compare an LED with ultraviolet radiation </h2><p>  Many people ask which of these elements are closer in technical specifications to those that are considered today.  The most similar can be called white, having the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  LED voltage range - 3-4 V; </li><li>  the indicator of operating currents is about 20 mA for weak emitters and 350-700 mA for high power elements. </li></ul><p>  It turns out that one power supply is suitable for both.  Such information is very important, because if the circuit of white LEDs is assembled in the house, it can be replaced with ultraviolet light without purchasing an additional adapter.  If the emitters have a different color, you have to spend money. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="zfX2a4T8W_s" data-url="https://youtu.be/zfX2a4T8W_s" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/9/3/3/13933.jpg"></div><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The fact that ultraviolet LEDs have become a breakthrough in the field of such emitters is not in doubt.  It is amazing how vast their scope in the modern world, although until relatively recently, there was not even a word about this.  Perhaps in the future something new will appear, but to date, the best in this area has not been invented. </p>
