    <h2>  Other features </h2><p>  The beach, on the shore of which the Movenpick Resort &amp; Marine SPA 5 * hotel is located, is always impeccably clean, like the sea itself.  Unless after a storm, many algae are nailed.  However, when the weather is getting better, everything returns to normal. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the event of a late check out, guests do not need to extend their stay in the apartment.  You can simply leave your things in the luggage storage room and continue to use the services of the complex for free. </p><p>  Guests are advised to go to the hotel in early autumn, if possible.

In any case, some say that it was exactly with them. </p><p>  By the way, people traveling here with children may not worry about the child.  The nannies are very good-natured, lovely and, which cannot but rejoice, they know the most basic phrases of the Russian language.  Children stay in the mini club with pleasure.
