    <p>  Many people, after major repairs or thorough cleaning, carried out in the apartment of a deceased relative, find in the bins various old coins that have already gone out of circulation.  Sometimes you can find treasures, ancient or relatively recent, of Soviet times, in which, along with jewelry, there is money.  If you are not a numismatist and have never been fond of this, then, as a rule, you will want to sell these treasures in order to replenish your family budget.  After all, the cost of old coins on the market is quite high, and exceeds several times the face value price. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that money minted during the time of kings and emperors is valuable, and this is partly true.  In confirmation of the legitimacy of their power, the <span>royal mints</span> minted full-weight exchange units made of metals such as silver, gold and even platinum.  But in the world of numismatics, copper penny can also be valuable - not only metal is important, but also the prevalence of such money in the world.  In this sense, the <span>value of Soviet coins</span> can also be quite high.  Although during the years of the USSR's existence, the state stamped a huge number of kopecks, some of them are of great value to numismatists.  This is, first of all, money issued at the dawn of the Soviet regime: for example, 2 kopecks of 1925 issue, as well as coins of 10, 15 and 20 kopecks, cast in silver in 1931, can cost several hundred dollars.  The money <span>of Brezhnev‚Äôs reign</span> does not have much value, but even in this time period (1961-1991) you can find the so-called ‚Äúcollection‚Äù coins that may interest collectors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Suppose you decide that you have on your hands valuable metal circles for numismatists.  It remains only to solve the question of where to sell coins.  Most major cities have special clubs and circles, but before you go there, you should evaluate your find.  In this, as always, the omniscient Internet will help.  Register on the numismatist forum, browse rating catalogs.  If you could not find your coin in them, take a digital camera with the macro function and take a picture of it on the forum: perhaps a potential buyer will come along with <span>an estimate of the cost of the</span> copy. </p><p>  <span>Where is easiest to sell coins</span> ?  Of course, in antique stores.  Are you afraid to cheapen?  Then evaluate it with the help of special systems offered on the Internet, and go to the antiquaries armed with this knowledge.  You can chat with a potential buyer through an online forum and sell your value in a virtual way.  Are you afraid that you will send the goods, but you will not receive money for it?  But all online shoppers have their own confidence rating, which grows with the conclusion of fair transactions.  Check this indicator, and if it is really high, feel free to send the money - you will definitely receive the agreed price for it. </p><p>  Another place where it is basically possible to sell coins is an auction.  However, they have a significant drawback: the organizers of such actions will charge you about 40% of the cost of the lot, and in addition, you will have to pay 13% of the tax.  In your hands you will get less than half the real value.  Private numismatists, with whom you can communicate directly, is the best option for selling such things.  But in order to meet such a person, you should be patient.  There are collectors who collect the weather series (the money of one state according to chronology) - perhaps for your complete collection they just lack your coin, and they will not stint to get it. </p><p>  And one more tip.  If you have already found where to sell coins, you do not need to bring them into a more attractive form on your own.  Often, old coinage turns black or green.  Do not clean them, especially with abrasive substances - this will not only not increase their market value, but, on the contrary, depreciate them.  Cleaning should be done by a specialist.  If you decide to keep coins for better times, do it in a dry place and less often touch them with your hands. </p>
