    <p>  The equipment mentioned is similar in principle to working with the sun.  The device emits heat, which is absorbed by objects and surfaces.  The latter give them to the air.  If you are interested in infrared heaters for greenhouses, we recommend that you continue to read about their main advantages.  They consist in the absence of drafts, optimal heat distribution, high practicality, as well as the ability to save electricity.  If you used heating systems that work on a convection principle, then you noted that heated air rises, while cold air accumulates from below.  Such heaters are ineffective.  This is due to the fact that the vegetation is located below.  As for infrared equipment, then uneven heat distribution is eliminated with it.  Due to this, heat loss can be reduced, while plants will be constantly provided with the necessary level of heating. </p><h2>  The opinion of experts </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to professionals, infrared heaters for greenhouses are very practical, this can be explained by the fact that heat can be distributed in separate zones, in each of which a certain temperature regime will be set, this is sometimes required for growing different plants.  This factor suggests that infrared heating is very economical.  If you manage to position the appliances correctly, you can achieve energy savings of up to 40 percent.  Specialists draw the attention of summer residents to the fact that the germination of plants using the described heating system can be increased by 40 percent.  Equipment of this type is not able to dry the air, which is especially important for the microclimate of the greenhouse.  No noise is generated during operation and no unpleasant odors are emitted.  As practice shows, infrared heaters for greenhouses provide soil heating at 7 centimeters in depth.  Due to this, the root system is stimulated, the plants are in conditions that are suitable for rapid growth.  It is worth considering that a similar effect is characteristic only of infrared heaters.  Rays are able to heat the soil to 28 degrees.  While the air does not overheat, and the mark of the thermometer is kept within 21 degrees. </p><h2>  Features of choice </h2>

    <p>  In order to get the maximum effect, you need to know the nuances that should be observed when choosing a heater for a greenhouse.  Modern equipment can be divided into two varieties, among which are long-wave units and light ones.  The latter during operation heat the surface of the emitter to 600 degrees.  This indicates that it is advisable to choose such equipment for large areas.  Infrared <span>industrial heaters</span> just have these characteristics.  As for the long-wave units, they are not able to heat up to such limits, they can be used in small rooms, quite often ordinary summer residents get them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Important point </h2>

    <p>  Industrial infrared heaters are impractical to purchase if there is a need to equip a small greenhouse.  For the reason that the equipment is mobile and connects quite easily, installation work can be done independently without the help of specialists.  However, it is recommended to take advantage of the experience gained over many years of operation of infrared heaters.  Quite often one wonders when purchasing an <span>infrared heater</span> whether such a device <span>is harmful</span> or not.  You can find the answer below. </p><p>  In the process of arranging the space of the greenhouse, you can use devices whose power is 500 watts.  In this case, from plants to the device must remain a distance that exceeds 10 meters.  Such powerful units are able to demonstrate their functionality in those parts of the greenhouse where the lowest temperature is noted.  Therefore, they are recommended to be installed near windows or against a wall.  The heating of a winter greenhouse is often carried out using devices that have a special mount to the ceiling.  True, it will be necessary to determine the optimal distance from such a device to plants independently.  Such devices are recommended to be installed in increments of 1.5-3 meters.  The specific distance will depend on the dimensions of the greenhouse and the height at which the device is suspended. </p><h2>  Less power equipment </h2>

    <p>  The second option for the use of devices involves the use of a device whose power is 250 watts.  In order for the infrared heater to be effective, it will be necessary to purchase a more impressive number of devices.  In this case, the step between the heaters should not be more than 1.5 meters. </p><p>  In order to conveniently adjust the height of the unit, you can suspend it on a conventional wire.  Quite often, summer residents use some tricks that can improve the efficiency of the equipment.  To save electricity will allow the location of devices for heating in a checkerboard pattern.  In this case, the number of "dead zones" will be reduced to a minimum. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of infrared heaters </h2><p>  If you want to purchase a wall-mounted infrared film heater, you need to familiarize yourself not only with the pros, but also with the minuses of such systems.  Among the main drawback is the relatively high cost.  However, it is justified by work efficiency.  Some consumers complain that heaters fail.  In order not to be disappointed in such a heating system, it is necessary to carefully approach the issue of choosing a device.  Experts recommend purchasing equipment that was manufactured by well-known companies.  If you come across equipment with a low price, then you should not rush to purchase it, as this may indicate poor quality.  When purchasing a wall-mounted infrared film heater, pay attention to the appearance of the equipment.  The device should not be damaged, dents and scratches are not allowed on its case. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Choosing an infrared heater, whether it is harmful or not, consumers are often quite interested.  There is only one answer: such equipment is completely safe for human health. </p>
