  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eastern Bosphorus Strait in the Sea of ​​Japan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Eastern Bosphorus Strait plays a significant role in the life of the inhabitants of the Far East.  Important sea routes are concentrated here.  In addition, a bridge was built over the strait connecting Vladivostok with the Russian island.  The strait was discovered in 1958.  It got its name due to its similarity to the strait, which serves as a junction for the Marmara and Black Seas. </p><h2>  Location of the Eastern Bosphorus </h2><p>  The strait is located in the Sea of ​​Japan in the Primorsky Territory.  The Bosphorus connects the Ussuri and Amur bays, and separates the Russian and Elena islands from the Muravyov-Amur Peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Strait Bosphorus East on the map" class="if uuid-2880381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2880381.jpg"></div><p>  On the western side of the strait are the Tokarevsky Spit and Larionov Cape.  On Tokarevsky Spit there is a famous lighthouse built in 1910.  It is believed that this is the place where the Pacific Ocean begins.  In the east, the strait is washed by the coast of the Basargin Peninsula and Skrypleva Island, whose lighthouses serve as gates to the port of Vladivostok.  Cape Karazina, located in the northeast of Russky Island, is located on the same side of the strait. </p><h2>  Strait Characteristic </h2><p>  The length of the Eastern Bosphorus is 9 km, the smallest width is 0.8 km.  The maximum depth is 50 m. </p><p>  Currents in the surface layer of the sea pass from the Amur to Ussuri bays on the southern side of the strait.  The reverse side of the water goes along the northern side of the Bosphorus.  The average speed of these currents is 0.2-1.2 knots.  The tides are insignificant.  In the strait are raid barrels, which are ships.  The bottom is mostly covered with silt and sand, stones are rare.  Thanks to icebreaking and the constant navigation of ships, the eastern part of the Bosphorus is open all year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In 2012, a bridge was built across the strait that connects Vladivostok with Russky Island.  It starts from the Nazimov Peninsula and ends at Cape Novosilsky.  This viaduct takes the world championship in length among suspension bridges - 1104 m, and second place in height - 324 m. The Russian bridge is one of the ten most interesting sights of Russia, among which it is the only modern building. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsfeed.time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian bridge" class="if uuid-2880403" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2880403.jpg"></div><p>  The viaduct can only be reached by road.  Driving along it, a view of the Eastern Bosphorus, Amur and Ussuri Bays, the main seaways of Vladivostok, as well as the Golden Horn, Patroclus, Ajax, Patrice bays opens.  Steel cables of the Russian bridge are painted in the colors of the Russian flag.  In the dark, the backlight works.  You can cross the bridge not only by personal transport, but also by city buses. </p><p>  In 2017, a banknote worth 2,000 rubles was issued in Russia with the image of the symbols of the Far East: the Russian bridge in Vladivostok and the Vostochny spaceport in the Amur Region. </p><p>  Due to the comfortable temperature in the summer, and the diversity of the fauna of the Eastern Bosphorus in the Sea of ​​Japan, this place attracts the attention of both beginners and experienced divers.  In addition to the animal world in the strait, one can meet the remains of sunken ships.  In Vladivostok there are dive centers that organize sightseeing tours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Far Eastern Federal University" class="if uuid-2880645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2880645.jpg"></div><p>  It is interesting to visit the <span>Far Eastern Federal University, the</span> Aquarium, the Voroshilov Battery on Russky Island.  You can see a natural attraction - Cape Tobizin.  Or just take a walk along the beautiful Embankment, see the views at the observation platforms. </p>
