  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Characteristic of a historical person. Historical eras and events</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To understand the present, one must look into the past.  Man has always sought to learn more about himself: how he appeared, why he was born in this particular family, in these conditions, at this time, in this country?  There is definitely something mystical about the answers to these questions.  There were always individuals who had a kind of definite mission on earth, their fate and life influenced large groups of other people.  Legends are made up of such persons, their life is analyzed, the work of many modern historians is devoted to the characterization of historical figures. </p><h2>  What is meant by the expression ‚Äúhistorical person‚Äù </h2><p>  There are many people who have influenced the course of history.  There are various works detailing the life of such characters.  This article is about historical figures, that is, people whose activities and life have influenced the course of important events that have occurred in a given time period.  Studying historical eras, you can find messages about them in almost every nation.  But their formation and activities were different. </p><h2>  Human Development in the Ancient World </h2><p>  Whether there were outstanding personalities in the era of the primitive communal system is a moot point.  Then man was interested in the most primitive things, his existence was more like the existence of animals.  A person is a person who is aware of his "I".  The initial stage of the development of human thinking in the Ancient World is connected with mythology, in which you can find the rudiments of religion and art, which became the basis for understanding the universe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instagram.com" data-author=": db_lion, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Writing in the Middle Ages" class="if uuid-2689664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99579/2689664.jpg"></div><p>  The most cunning and quick-witted became priests, they were afraid and revered by the rest of the tribe.  One of the first civilizations of antiquity was Egypt.  The pharaohs and priests needed to strengthen and maintain their power, they were inventive, numerous ceremonies and traditions directed the mass consciousness towards their veneration and fear of the gods.  The Egyptian pharaohs, Chinese emperors, Sumerian kings can be considered the first outstanding personalities in history, who had a huge influence on the whole people through their own deification.  Many centuries passed before each person began to perceive himself as a unique personality, realized his place in society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The ancient world </h2><p>  The appearance of cuneiform writing in Sumer, the invention of paper in China contributed to the rapid development of scientific and spiritual knowledge.  Ancient culture originated in ancient Rome and in ancient Greece.  The Greeks knew how to borrow, apply, improve the inventions of other peoples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instagram.com" data-author=": ancientreligions, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The development of the culture of antiquity" class="if uuid-2689616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99579/2689616.jpg"></div><p>  The characterization of the <span>historical personality of</span> Antiquity can be given by studying the life and work of prominent Greek scholars, whose names are known today.  For example, Hippocrates became the founder of medicine, Herodotus - history, Euclid - geometry, Archimedes - physics, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes - theater, Strabo - geography.  The development of trade and the mixing of cultures contributed to the development of various peoples.  The influence of the great people of this historical period on the development of mankind is invaluable.  Until now, all the doctors of the world pronounce the oath of Hippocrates, in schools they begin geometry with the sections set forth by Euclid in his work "Beginnings", the law of Archimedes is studied in the course of physics. </p><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  With the fall of the Roman Empire begins the era of the Middle Ages.  Barbarians from the West and invaders from the depths of Central Asia have made amendments to the development of human civilization.  Scientists usually give a description of the historical personality of the Middle Ages, taking into account the numerous wars of that time.  These military conflicts gave birth to their heroes: Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Richard the Lionheart, Joan of Arc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bakunetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crusaders in the Middle Ages" class="if uuid-2693101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99579/2693101.jpg"></div><p>  Outstanding personalities appeared in the arena of history: invaders and brave warriors, knights and kings.  The spread of Christianity, the Crusades and the Inquisition introduced into the life of ordinary people bans and fear of the High Court.  Society condemned the free development of personality, imposed religious complexes.  The development of science and technology slowed down. </p><h2>  Renaissance </h2><p>  The sunset of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance are associated with the invention of the method of mass printing.  The period of reappraisal of knowledge began, rediscovered the achievements of Antiquity.  Curious attitude to the world, craving for knowledge was encouraged.  The most striking representative of the Renaissance is Leonardo da Vinci.  He was an artist, a sculptor, a musician, a writer, a scientist, an engineer, and an inventor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pariscityvision.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="painting &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;" class="if uuid-2697957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99579/2697957.jpg"></div><p>  Society admired talents, which inspired ingenious people to show and develop their abilities.  The historical period of the Renaissance gave impetus to the accelerated development of self-knowledge of man as a person.  To this day, people line up in museums to admire the paintings of Renaissance artists.  Many of them can be attributed to historical figures. </p><h2>  New time </h2><p>  In the era of the development of capitalism, it was not a quiet, harmless, humble man from the Middle Ages that was valued, but a decisive, purposeful and active one.  Famous historical figures of the New Age are princes, emperors, politicians.  Next to them were sailors, travelers, scientists, researchers.  A separate person in modern times played a big role, she could lead everyone along. </p><p>  What are the requirements of society, such people appear.  This time of great discoveries, then were invented: </p><ul><li>  locomotive; </li><li>  electricity; </li><li>  telegraph; </li><li>  telephone; </li><li>  camera; </li><li>  subway. </li></ul><p>  Portraits of historical figures of that time can be found in museums; great scientists such as Blaise Pascal, Mikhail Lomonosov, Nikola Tesla and others are captured on them. </p><h2>  Latest time </h2><p>  From the beginning of the 20th century, the countdown of the era of modern times began.  The emergence of powerful new ideologies - communism and fascism, shocked mankind.  The psychological influence of individuals on the masses has assumed a global character.  The development of printing, radio, and later cinema contributed to the rapid dissemination of information.  Newspapers, leaflets, magazines, books become an instrument of political propaganda.  Lenin "infected" the world with the ideas of communism.  Hitler imposed fascism.  <span>Great speakers</span> become historical figures <span>,</span> their impact on the vast masses can be compared with a long-term hypnosis session. </p><p>  The second half of the 20th century was marked by rapid scientific and technological progress.  Space exploration requires new heroes, so scientists, inventors, astronauts are entering the arena of world fame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizmodo.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Man in outer space" class="if uuid-2698018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/99579/2698018.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the characteristic of the historical person is compiled taking into account the new trends of the time.  Today, an outstanding person is the leader of a successful group of like-minded people.  An individual, even if he is unusually talented, will not be able to surpass the achievements of a group of well-educated and specially trained professionals. </p><p>  After the creation of the computer and the Internet, the needs of mankind are growing exponentially, technology is developing at lightning speed.  Today, everyone has every opportunity to find like-minded people and become famous. </p><p>  In world history, many great people who have significantly influenced the minds and lives of nations have driven progress.  Famous historical figures today shape the destinies of peoples, they love or hate them, they connect entire periods with their names.  Each era is worthy of its heroes, who appeared at the right time and in the right place. </p>
