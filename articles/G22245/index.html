    <p>  Working in orbit is very difficult, you need to have excellent physical fitness and endurance.  One of the most courageous specialties involves different situations.  These are injuries and cases when there is a direct threat to health and life, so you need to be very focused and attentive. </p><h2>  General information about work in space </h2><p>  In conditions of zero gravity, constant pressure drops and other overloads, not everyone can feel good and at the same time carry out important tasks.  The possibility of flying into space looks very tempting, but out of a thousand applicants undergoing training on the ground, only one will fly into orbit.  <span>The profession of an astronaut</span> is considered one of the most fascinating and dangerous, so many people ask the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the astronaut's salary?‚Äù, Because surely it should be worthy. </p><p>  Even after growing up, many young men have a dream about how to break through to the stellar expanses, despite the danger and complexity of the profession.  But at the same time, they are thinking about what salary can be expected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Space agencies of the world </h2><p>  How much astronauts receive depends on the agency in which they work, on experience and length of service.  The most famous agencies in the world: </p><ol><li>  Space Agency of Russia - Roskosmos. </li><li>  USA - NASA. </li><li>  Europe - ESA. </li><li>  Canada - CSA. </li><li>  Japan - JAXA. </li><li>  China - CNSA. </li></ol><p>  Not every organization will be happy to talk about how much it pays to its employees, such as Japanese and Chinese.  This information is hidden to outsiders.  However, it is unlikely that anyone will have doubts about the high income of the employees of these rather developed and rich countries.  How much astronauts pay for a flight into space can be understood by the example of other developed countries. </p><h2>  Salary of foreign astronauts </h2><p>  What is the salary of astronauts in different countries of the world?  Astronauts employed by the US agency NASA receive salaries according to their qualifications: from GS-11 (basic level) to GS-14 (highest level).  Astronauts with the first category receive $ 66,000 a year, of the highest qualification - up to $ 155,000 annually.  Moreover, the income level of astronauts working on Earth is significantly different from the salary they receive when they are in orbit.  She is $ 170,000. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much astronauts get" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35954/1180285.jpg" width="600"></div>

For a year of work, astronauts are assigned category A2 and a salary of 59,000 ‚Ç¨ is paid per year.  After a flight into space, qualification rises to level A4 with an annual salary of 79,000 ‚Ç¨.  This is from $ 6,500 to $ 10,000 per month. </p><p>  Only two astronauts work in the staff of the Canadian CSA, and they have never made a flight.  Income in this company is accrued at three levels.  A minimum of Canadians receive $ 80,000 a year, a maximum of $ 160,000. </p><h2>  Salary of the Russian cosmonaut </h2><p>  Russian cosmonauts can count on a decent payment for their dangerous work while in orbit.  The average flight duration is six months, during which time income is accrued in the amount of $ 130,000 to $ 150,000.  It is not difficult to calculate what salary the astronauts get per year.  In this case, the annual salary is estimated up to $ 300,000, but such ‚Äúspace‚Äù periods are far from frequent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cosmonaut salary in Russia" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35954/1180709.jpg" width="575"></div>

    <p>  If we compare the average monthly salary of the middle manager in Moscow, who is at home, constantly with his family and works in milder conditions (from 100,000 rubles), then we can draw certain conclusions.  And if you also compare how much astronauts and sought-after actors, athletes, whose salaries per year are calculated not in the thousands, but in the millions of dollars, get it worth considering.  The salaries of engineers working on Earth are several times lower than those of astronauts entering orbit, and their working day lasts 8 hours. </p><p>  As with any job, there are supplements, <span>13th salaries,</span> bonuses, overtime.  Objectively judging the quality of life only by that indicator, what is the monthly salary of the astronauts, is meaningless.  The difference is felt here not only in the structure of salaries, additional payments and taxes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do astronauts pay for a flight into space" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30555/1182140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A US citizen has to pay serious amounts for insurance.  Housing in Cologne will cost much more than, for example, in Texas.  For something, prices in Russia are many times higher than in America, for something - much lower.  Therefore, for many, the salary of an astronaut in Russia is considered very worthy.  The work of the astronaut is quite specific, complex, but it gives a dream, and before you try to realize it, you need to think carefully. </p>
