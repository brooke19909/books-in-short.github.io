  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific worldview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are different forms of worldview.  The most ancient are religion and mythology.  These types of worldviews were a fantastic reflection of reality, which was formed in the minds of ancient people. </p><p>  However, there is a view of the world, society, nature and everything that surrounds people and happens inside every person who does not accept prejudices and superstitions.  The scientific worldview is entirely based on the achievements of modern disciplines and is imbued with the method of <span>scientific research</span> and knowledge.  This view of the Universe and the place of man in it reflects phenomena and objects as they exist in reality, without errors, lies and fiction.  The scientific worldview is based on the achieved level of knowledge in all sciences. </p><p>  There are a number of signs that distinguish this view of things from other views. </p><p>  Mainly, the scientific worldview is an explanation of the facts, comprehension of them in the whole structure of concepts of the corresponding scientific discipline.  It reveals the regular and causal relationships of objects and phenomena.  The scientific worldview perceives randomness as necessity, and for the single, the general.  In addition, it provides anticipation, anticipation of events, as well as disclosure of the upcoming phenomena and processes. </p><p>  A very significant feature of the scientific worldview is its systematic nature.  By this definition is meant a complex of ideas, ordered in accordance with certain theoretical principles. </p><p>  The generalized system of human knowledge about the phenomena of nature, people's attitude to the basics of natural being, constitutes the scientific and natural aspect of the view of the Universe.  Many questions are of a worldview character.  For example: ‚ÄúWhat is the structure and <span>driving force of the</span> development of matter?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow does nature develop - in a circle or along the path of progress?‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Every worldview contains, first of all, certain knowledge, information about nature, knowledge, social life.  A look at the Universe reflects the direction and nature of thinking, being the basis and spiritual center of human individuality. </p><p>  The scientific worldview (like everything else) reflects the way a person exists in society.  This method contains life positions, ideals, beliefs, principles of activity and knowledge.  Worldview is a necessary component <span>of human consciousness.</span>  However, it is not just one of many elements.  A worldview is a complex system in which knowledge, beliefs, aspirations, thoughts and so on interact.  Thus, an integral (to one degree or another) understanding is formed by people of themselves and the world around them. </p><p>  The worldview, including the scientific one, is an integral formation.  A combination of its components plays a crucial role in it.  Different elements of alloys in different proportions give different results.  To some extent, <span>this is</span> also <span>characteristic of the</span> worldview.  Its composition includes and performs important tasks generalized professional, life-practical, <span>everyday knowledge.</span>  An integral component is scientific knowledge. </p><p>  It should be noted that an unenlightened and naive consciousness cannot have sufficient means for a consistent, clear and rational justification and explanation of its views, in connection with this, turning to fantastic mythological fictions. </p><p>  Worldview is considered a complex form of consciousness, uniting various aspects of human experience.  It accumulates experience in understanding the semantic basis of human life.  At the same time, new generations, joining the spiritual heritage of their ancestors, contemporaries, preserve something, and resolutely refuse something. </p>
