It was as if he had left the pages of a fairy tale about beautiful princesses, brave princes and dragons.  This castle inspired many famous people to create beautiful works.  For example, Disney employees took him as a model for Sleeping Beauty Castle.  Tourists from all over the world seek to personally see the attraction.  The stories and legends of Neuschwanstein Castle are no less interesting than its architecture.  They add mystery and make the visit more interesting. </p><h2>  A brief excursion into history </h2><p>  This castle was erected by order of King Ludwig II.  The future monarch spent his youth in Bavaria in the castle of Hohenschwangau.  Until the age of 18, he lived with his parents, but even then he strove for solitude in his own possessions.  The history of the creation of Neuschwanstein Castle begins in 1868, when they began to prepare a site for its construction. </p><p>  Ludwig II chose a place for his future residence not far from his parents' house on a steep cliff.  At first it was planned to demolish the peak in order to prepare the plateau.  Then the territory was cleared, completed with road works, water piped and laid the foundation. </p><p>  The monarch set the builders a difficult task: to build Neuschwanstein in the shortest possible time.  Therefore, I had to work day and night.  The main difficulty was the difficult location of the castle and the difficulties in the delivery of building material, which required a large amount.  For this, a steam-powered crane was installed on the western side of the cliff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By 1873, fortress walls were erected, gates were installed, the first three floors of the castle.  Ten years later, construction and finishing work was never completed.  In the spring of 1884, Ludwig II was forced to settle in an unfinished castle.  But he did not enjoy solitude for long: in total, he lived there for only 172 days.  He was removed from control, transferred to a hospital, and after some time, in 1886, he mysteriously died.  They talk about suicide, although the final version is still unknown. </p><p>  But the story of the creation of Neuschwanstein Castle did not end there.  The western terrace, baths and church towers have not yet been rebuilt.  Completely construction was completed in 1891.  It is interesting that the castle was built for privacy, and now it is the most visited attraction in Bavaria, bringing profit to the treasury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hotelscombined.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fairytale castle" class="if uuid-3242066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242066.jpg"></div><h2>  Legend of the swan knight </h2><p>  The creation of this amazing place by Ludwig of Bavaria was inspired by the legend of the Swan Knight Lohengrin.  This is one of the most famous Neuschwanstein castle stories.  The name itself translates as "New swan rock (cliff)."  The castle is located in a surprisingly picturesque place on the impregnable cliffs of the Alps.  Against their background, surrounded by dark green tall firs, it seems truly fabulous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not surprising that Ludwig II, who was distinguished by wild imagination, dreamed of creating a place worthy of such a knight as Lohengrin.  Many centuries ago, the Duke of Brabant lived in Germany with his beautiful daughter Elsa.  Once an arrogant and ambitious knight Friedrich Telramund embraced her.  But Elsa refused him, and the duke did not insist. </p><p>  When the girl's father was gone, Telramund decided by cunning to marry Elsa.  The girl began to appeal to her father's friends and vassals to protect her.  But no one dared to go on a duel with Telramund.  And suddenly a melodious ringing was heard from the side of the river: everyone saw a beautiful swan carrying a boat.  And on her sat a brave knight. </p><p>  He defeated Telramund and answered all the questions that he had come to the aid of Elsa.  They fell in love and married, but with one condition: the girl should not have asked about the name and origin of her savior.  But over time, others began to heat the curiosity of Elsa.  And she, breaking the oath, asked who he really was. </p><p>  The husband replied that he was Lohengrin, the son of Parsifal and one of the knights of the Round Table.  They come when injustice is happening on earth.  Knights can stay if they love someone, but in no case should they give their name.  After this story, a swan sailed and took Lohengrin. </p><p>  As planned by Ludwig II, Neuschwanstein Castle was supposed to be an ideal place for the fabulous swan knight and his beloved wife.  The swan became its symbol also because it is depicted on the coat of arms of the Schwangau clan, to which the father of Ludwig of Bavaria belonged. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.radiustours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interiors in the castle" class="if uuid-3242067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242067.jpg"></div><h2>  Throne room </h2><p>  One of the interesting stories of Neuschwanstein Castle is related to the throne room.  There are 360 ‚Äã‚Äãof them, each dedicated to the heroes of Wagner's musical works.  The main one - the throne - is decorated in the Byzantine style.  As planned by the king, he was supposed to personify the hall of the Holy Grail from Wagner's Parsifal. </p><p>  This room has high ceilings supported by two rows of columns.  Below they are finished in porphyry, and above, artificial lapis lazuli is used as a decor.  The steps of the marble staircase are framed by images of 12 apostles.  They lead to a niche in which the throne with the image of the cross and the coat of arms of Bavaria was to be located.  But they did not have time to install it. </p><p>  For the painting of the walls, early Christian subjects were chosen.  On the second level of the columns is a luxurious gilded chandelier resembling a Byzantine crown.  The floor is decorated with mosaics with scenes from Greek mythology.  Legends of the Holy Grail and the Knights of the Round Table inspired Ludwig II to create this fabulous place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.haikudeck.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one of the halls" class="if uuid-3242075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242075.jpg"></div><h2>  Singing room </h2><p>  The history of Neuschwanstein Castle is closely connected with Wagner.  It is known that Ludwig II admired his talent, those fabulous images that he embodied in his creations.  The Singing Hall was built for the productions of the operas of the famous composer. </p><p>  But during the reign of the king was not given a single performance.  But now, classical music festivals are held here every year.  This is the most luxurious, pompous hall dedicated to Parsifal.  He is a hero of one of the medieval legends, a knight who was a naive youth and became the king of the Grail.  The central painting located in this room depicts the appearance of Parsifal in the Grail Castle. </p><h2>  Royal chambers </h2><p>  In the royal chambers, Ludwig II spent a lot of time.  The history of Neuschwanstein Castle is based on the legend of the swan knight and other myths of the Middle Ages.  All rooms are decorated in the same style: oak panels, massive furniture and curtains made of silk. </p><p>  The royal bedroom is made in neo-Gothic style.  Over its decoration 14 craftsmen worked for 4.5 years.  The walls are decorated with paintings that show the tragic love story of Tristan and Isolde.  And in the decor of the living room, a swan theme is visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="furniture in the castle" class="if uuid-3242069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242069.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  But not only the history of Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany makes it especially attractive for tourists from all over the world.  In addition to the picturesque location, architecture deserves special attention - it is truly unique. </p><p>  To get here, you need to walk along a winding road to the palace gates with high towers.  They are built of red brick and contrast with the snow-white walls of Neuschwanstein. </p><p>  First, visitors enter the Lower Courtyard, and climbing the stairs to the Square Tower, they reach the Upper Courtyard.  Inside you can admire the picturesque garden, which even has an artificial cave.  Along the perimeter of the Upper Courtyard are all the main buildings of the castle, including the House of Knights and the Women's Tower.  In the center is the castle itself, with five floors.  The pointed spiers of the towers are high in the sky, which makes them even higher.  Carved windows and balconies create a fabulous atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red gate of Neuschwanstein castle" class="if uuid-3242097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242097.jpg"></div><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The history of Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria is closely connected with the medieval epic.  Therefore, its internal design combines several time periods.  The whole decoration is more like scenery for a fairy tale - it is difficult to single out a single style in them. </p><p>  In addition to the above premises of the castle, there are other rooms, no less delightful.  For example, the Grand Salon, which was inspired by the legend of the Swan Knight.  The situation in the study is more restrained.  The large table is covered with green cloth with gold embroidery.  To match his curtains.  Office supplies are distinguished by luxury and grace: they are made of ivory and gold, decorated with precious stones.  A chapel is arranged behind the screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topworldresort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle interior" class="if uuid-3242095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3242095.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  You can listen to the stories and legends of Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany as part of excursion groups.
