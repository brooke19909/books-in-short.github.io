How to Crochet Baby Sling Globes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today it has become very fashionable to make slingobus do-it-yourself.  Mom is happy to wear these cute jewelry around her neck.  And babies can use them to play, or even to scratch their gums during teething. </p><h2>  What are slingobus? </h2><p>  They are also jokingly called mamabuses, as well as "feeding" beads.  Perhaps this is because many parents distract the attention of children who do not like to eat porridge or soup from a spoon.  Yes, and on the road or on a walk, kids often drag them into their mouths, which could also become the basis for receiving the decoration of this name. </p><p>  And why are they called slingobusami?  There is one explanation for this.  The baby, whom parents wear for a walk in a sling, plays them with pleasure.  Although many go for a walk with a stroller or holding crumbs in their hands.  However, the jewelry remained with the interesting name ‚Äúslingobusy‚Äù.  Do it yourself is extremely simple. </p>

    <h2>  What are ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù beads made of? </h2><p>  Usually, wooden beads carefully washed and processed are taken for crafts.  But rattles, plastic or rubber animals, crocheted balls, mushrooms, flowers, or miniature toys made of yarn, sewn minifigures, and wooden medium-sized toys can be used.  Since slingobuses can be made from a variety of details, most often masters combine different materials and shapes in one product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To use wooden toys in the manufacture of jewelry, you need to drill holes for the thread in them.  Such slingobuses, made with your own hands and put on the mother‚Äôs neck, bring joy to the kids, because they are bright, no one scolds if the baby pulls them in their mouths.  Adults often tell interesting stories about them: meow, showing a cat figurine, moo, if a little knitted cow hangs on the beads, buzz when a child pokes a finger into a wooden bee. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make do-it-yourself slingobus" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/366928.jpg?1396631398548" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Concern for the safety of crumbs in the manufacture of mamabus </h2><p>  It is very important, when making "feeding" beads, to observe the following rules: </p><ol><li>  The components of the decoration should not be too small so that the baby inadvertently does not swallow the part. </li><li>  The materials from which mamabuses are made must be natural.  Using wooden beads, they prefer juniper balls, which are easy to clean and have bactericidal properties.  Cotton yarn is used. </li><li>  Unacceptable materials are metal, glass, polymer clay.  You should discard beads with patch elements, as well as made of plastic. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt use easily tearing threads when assembling a slingobus, as they can break off, and the details will fall apart, at best, or be in the baby‚Äôs mouth and be swallowed - at worst.  The ideal option for this product is a thick fishing line, which, after assembling the jewelry, must be carefully knotted and sealed.  Silk braid and satin ribbon tied or sewn at the junction are good to use. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Slingbuses as a feminine decoration </h2><p>  Of course, a woman who wears this kind of jewelry on herself must take care that it is beautiful.  It is good if mamabuses are combined in color with a sling or cloak, outfit or other accessories. </p><p>  Often in the manufacture of slingobus used rings tied with lace - it is very stylish, modern.  And while playing with them, the baby has fingertips, which has a beneficial effect on the development of brain activity. </p>

    <h2>  Thundering Slingbuses </h2><p>  At first, children are happy to play "feeding" beads.  But soon it bothers, and mother again has to entertain the crumbs during long trips or waiting for an appointment at the clinic.  What can be done to arouse the child‚Äôs interest in baby carriers? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Resourceful mothers came up with: you need to build such jewelry that will rattle!  Sounds will surely attract the attention of the baby.  And in order not to hang on themselves an ordinary rattle, which is most often quite large for a slingobus, smart girls came up with their own original way out.  They decided to use a container from kinder surprise. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to guess how to knit rattling slingobuses using this plastic drop-down egg.  After all, you just need to crochet it, just as it is done for making beads.  But first in the container you need to put a few small objects that can rattle. </p>

    <h2>  Solid bead knitting pattern </h2><p>  The easiest way to make is to use ready-made large beads as the basis.  They can be taken from already unnecessary jewelry.  But if there are none, then the craftswomen make the basis of foil from chocolate, having rolled a ball of the right size out of it. </p><p>  Crochet should tie it.  To do this, use the method of knitting a single crochet if it is decided to knit with a continuous strapping.  For beginner craftswomen who decide to make slingobuses with their own hands, the schemes proposed here will be a good help. </p><p>  You just need to consider that: </p><ul><li>  the abbreviation of RLS means ‚Äúsingle crochet‚Äù; </li><li>  asterisks indicate repeated reports; </li><li>  behind the equal sign is the number of loops obtained after knitting. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Lace Sling Globes: Crochet Pattern </h2><p>  Such jewelry is so beautiful that any mother will happily wear it even if she goes for a walk without a baby.  Since it is impossible to make a slingobus with your own hands in the ‚Äúlace‚Äù technique without a base, the craftswoman will need large juniper beads.  The knitting scheme is as follows.  First, a ring of five air loops is performed. </p><ul><li>  1 row - increase.  Two double crochet stitches are knitted from each loop.  The result is 10 loops. </li><li>  2 row - increase.  To rise, you should knit two air loops, * 3 columns with two crochets from the second loop (one is missed without knitting) * - repeat the report 5 times.  The result should be 15 loops. </li><li>  3 row - increase.  To rise, you should knit two air loops, * 4 columns with two crochets from the third loop (two are skipped without knitting) * - repeat the report 5 times.  The result should be 20 loops. </li><li>  4th row - increase.  If the volume turned out to be sufficient, then the reduction of the loops should begin.  If the volume is small, then you can continue to increase, using the specified algorithm.  That is, for lifting, you should knit two air loops, * 5 columns with two double crochets from each fourth loop (three are skipped without knitting) * - repeat the report 5 times.  The result should be 25 loops. </li></ul><p>  Loops decrease in the reverse order. </p><ul><li>  1 row - decrease (for the option, when formed with an increase of 25 loops).  Two air loops are knitted for lifting.  * Knit five stitches with two crochets so that they all remain on the working hook, then make one loop, knitting all six loops together, three air loops * - the report is repeated 5 times, resulting in 20 loops. </li><li>  2 row - decrease.  Two air loops are knitted for lifting.  * Knit 4 <span>columns with two crochets</span> so that they all remain on the working hook, then make one loop, knitting all 5 loops together, 2 air loops * - the report is repeated 5 times, resulting in 15 loops. </li><li>  3 row - decrease.  Two air loops for lifting are knitted.  * Knit 3 columns with two crochets so that they all remain on the working hook, then make one loop, knitting all 4 loops together, 1 air loop * - the report is repeated 5 times, resulting in 10 loops. </li><li>  4th row - decrease.  Two air loops are knitted for lifting.  * Knit 2 columns with two crochets so that they all remain on the working hook, then make one loop, knitting all 3 loops together * - the report is repeated 5 times, resulting in 5 loops.  Knitting ends: the thread is torn off and dragged into the last loop, tightening it. </li></ul><p>  Slingobus is an eco-friendly decoration toy that gives joy to both mothers and their babies.  And made with their own hands, they are still the pride of mother or grandmother, an expression of their creative imagination. </p>
