This is not surprising, since not everyone can afford to acquire a flagship modification.  On the other hand, everyone would like to get a device with a nice design, good performance, a large display and a high-quality camera. </p><p>  As the market review shows, one of the best options right now is HTC Desire X. Feedback from the owners of the model indicates that its name is justified (in Russian, it means ‚Äúdesire‚Äù), because customers get a relatively small amount of money it has at its disposal a device that fully complies with the basic requirements listed above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire x" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The manufacturer offers three color options for the device case.  In particular, it can be black, white or dark blue.  The front glass is framed by a metal frame.  The weight of the smartphone is 114 grams, and its dimensions are 118.5 x 62.3 x 9.3 millimeters.  The location of the main controls here can be called quite successful.  In front of the screen are the touch keys "Home", "Back" and "Menu".  The last button also switches between applications that are already open.  The HTC Desire X power button is installed in the center on top, and to the left of it is a headphone jack.  The microUSB port, like the <span>volume control,</span> is located on the right side.  A microphone hole is provided at the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A distinctive feature in this model was the location of the company logo, which is shifted to the lower left corner (located under the camera window) on the back panel made of matte smooth plastic.  This decision has brought its zest to the design of the device.  Immediately below the logo is a speaker.  Its location is, to put it mildly, not quite right.  According to the feedback made by the owners of HTC Desire X, this is not very convenient, because during the conversation the speaker is covered with a hand, which does not affect the transmitted sound in the best way. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a display type Super LCD, which has a size of four inches.  The screen resolution is 480 x 800. It has ample brightness and contrast, which is not much lost when using the device in the sun.  The picture is very saturated.  It uses a high-quality sensor that supports the Multitouch function.  Fingerprints may remain on the screen, but thanks to the use of <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> there is no need to wipe it often. </p><p>  The HTC Desire X's display is large, not only enough for viewing photos, but also for using a visual keyboard.  In addition, the screen is protected from shock due to high-strength glass.  Information about its manufacturer is classified.  Along with this, it is probably known that <span>Gorilla Glass</span> material is not used here <span>,</span> as in previous versions.  In general, the display can be attributed to the advantages of the HTC Desire X. The reviews of experts and users of the device have become a serious confirmation of this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that the smartphone is a smaller copy of the flagship One X model. If you look closely, you will notice that in fact there are many differences between them.  In terms of ergonomics, HTC Desire X is a pretty successful phone.  With a four-inch display, the device is lightweight and fits comfortably in your hand, without causing any discomfort even during a long telephone conversation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire x phone" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525944.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a dual-core processor, which operates at a frequency of 1 GHz.  The amount of internal memory is 4 gigabytes (there is also a connector for its increase), and operational - 768 megabytes.  The interface works quite quickly, without any delay, even if you do not turn off several applications.  There will be no problems with games, the only thing that can cause a gripe is that with them the device becomes very hot.  At the same time, when working with mail, music and other applications, this flaw is not observed.  As practice shows, all this stuffing is enough for normal support for the Android 4.0.4 operating system, as well as the company shell of the company, known as Sense-4. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to representatives of the manufacturer, it is desirable that the smartphone HTC Desire X firmware is updated from time to time.  This is especially true in cases where the device starts to reboot constantly or does not turn on at all.  To do this is quite simple and on your own without contacting specialized points. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a removable battery, the volume of which is 1650 mAh.  As practice shows, such a capacity is quite enough for the active use of the device throughout the whole day.  If you make only a few calls a day and do not abuse the Internet, this time doubles, which allows you to safely talk about a high degree of autonomy of the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire x firmware" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The HTC Desire X phone boasts integrated Beats Audio technology that delivers deep sound and music with the so-called live performance effect.  The device is able to provide wireless sound transmission with a fairly high definition.  Equalizer in the smartphone is not provided.  Along with this, the aforementioned regimen is called upon to completely replace it.  Nevertheless, connoisseurs of outstanding musical characteristics are likely to be disappointed.  It should be noted that the sound is enough for telephone calls through a headset. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The HTC Desire X smartphone has only one camera with a size of five megapixels.  It uses a 28mm <span>wide-angle lens</span> , auto flash and back-illuminated sensor.  Moreover, the patent technology of the company, ImageChip, is applied here.  <span>The front camera,</span> with which you could make video calls, is missing here.  The resulting pictures, like for a phone from this price category, are pretty high quality.  Excellent detail can be traced only with good lighting.  In the event that photos are taken at a small distance from the subject, separate ‚Äúblinded‚Äù areas appear on the image.  On the other hand, at a great distance, the colors are muffled by the flash. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="display htc desire x" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The camera starts up almost instantly, so there will be no problems with the operational capture of an interesting moment.  Moreover, if necessary, you can disable the viewing of frames after shooting, so that the user has the opportunity to create several shots per second.  In any case, sharing a photo on social networks will not be embarrassing.  It should also be noted that thanks to the VideoPic function, HTC Desire X owners do not have to choose between photo and video modes, since they can function simultaneously. </p><p>  Filming is carried out with a resolution of 800 x 480. At this time, the device even tries to stabilize the picture.  Compared to cameras installed on similar modifications of smartphones, the recorded videos look much more solid (the main thing is not to do when shooting sharp movements).  Along with this, watching them on modern plasma TVs is not recommended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone htc desire x" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525945.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Menus and applications </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire X has a simple and fairly typical menu for devices from this manufacturer.  Entrance to it is carried out by pressing the corresponding button on the front panel.  All applications are sorted alphabetically.  In the phone book, calls are indicated by different colors depending on the type.  Search for subscribers can be carried out both by number and by name of contact.  A retractable virtual keyboard is quite comfortable.  Text messages due to her typing is very easy.  This is largely due to the large display size. </p><p>  The list of applications that are initially installed on the phone is standard for all similar products of the company.  It contains the programs necessary to start operating the model.  The price also includes a subscription to your Dropbox account with 25 gigabytes of disk space (valid for two years). </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  One of the weaknesses that the device has is the volume control located on the right side.  It is quite fragile and can quickly fail due to the constant opening and closing of the back cover.  However, if you do not do this, you should not worry about this. </p><p>  Even despite the use of high-impact glass in the model, it is not recommended to put the gadget on the front part, as scratches may appear on the screen.  Depending on the care and accuracy of the owner of the phone on the case, attritions may appear over time.  Based on all this, it is a rational decision to buy a case for HTC Desire X. Its cost is not so high, but the external attractiveness of the device will remain much longer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for htc desire x" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/525948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In general, the model can be called one of the best options in its price segment.  Of course, it cannot compete with leading smartphones running the Android operating system, but it has already earned its army of fans.  From the best side, the device is characterized by its technical characteristics, speed and the possibility of quite a long battery life.  There are no serious flaws in it (with the exception of the unjustifiably large opening for the camera and not the most reliable volume control).  As for the cost of HTC Desire X, the price of modification in domestic stores averages around three hundred US dollars. </p>
