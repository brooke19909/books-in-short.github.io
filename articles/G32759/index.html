This profession occupies one of the leading places in the modern world.  Detective stories have long occupied a very significant niche on television.  Dozens and hundreds of bestsellers have been written about the people of this profession.  Their adventures and intricacies of plots have long captivated the hearts of millions of people.  But who are the most famous detectives?  Whose names do we associate with this business?  Interestingly, but in fact it turns out that the most famous detectives are only </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most famous detectives" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/274833.jpg" width="590"></div>  fictional characters.  The products of pen and fantasy directors.  Indeed, the most famous detectives are Sherlock Holmes, <span>Hercule Poirot,</span> Mrs. Marple, Lieutenant Colombo and some others.  However, this does not mean at all <span>that such</span> brilliant minds do not exist in nature.  Moreover, without many of them, the characters of books and cinema that we loved would not have appeared!

    <p>  The most famous detectives in history </p><p>  Osip Shor </p><p>  This man, although he was formally a detective, became famous for completely opposite acts.  Moreover, Osip Shor is perhaps the most striking example of a prototype of a famous hero!  Well, who does not know the famous rogue Ostap Suleiman Bert Maria Bender.  And although the literary character was not a detective, but his prototype was something!  Osip Shor spent his childhood in Odessa.  And in 1916 he moved <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most famous detective" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/275388.jpg" width="600"></div>  in Petrograd, enrolling in a local Technological Institute.  However, his studies were interrupted by the revolution.  Returning in 1918-1919 to his homeland, to Odessa, the hero earned his livelihood by petty fraud, appearing in various places as a chess player, an artist, or even a bridegroom of famous people.  Later, stories about these adventures reached the <span>writer Yevgeny Petrov,</span> who designed them into a famous literary novel.  In the post-revolutionary years, Osip Shor worked in the criminal investigation department of the city of Odessa.  Possessing a remarkable ingenuity, by that time the famous detective had done a lot for the peace of his native city.

Eugene Widoc is perhaps the most famous detective among those that existed in reality.  Having been in the shoes of a criminal, he became one of the most successful crime fighters </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous detective" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/274824.jpg" width="445"></div>  afterwards.  Eugene Widoc was born in the last quarter of the 18th century in France.  Already in his teens, he commits his first crime.  Later, he enters the army, where he is not the best soldier and eventually deserts.  Vidok's youth takes place in constant robberies and robberies, which he committed as a member of a criminal gang.  Often a young man ended up in prison, but each time he managed to escape.  At one point, Eugene Widoc managed to make enemies in the criminal world, among his former friends.  In 1811, he appeared in the prefecture of Paris, where he offers his services and assistance in the fight against gangs.  Vidoc managed to convince everyone that only those who think like criminals can effectively catch criminals.  And he was right.  The group he created, called Security, lasted more than 20 years.  And our hero, in the end, managed to achieve the post of head of the office in the French Foreign Ministry.
