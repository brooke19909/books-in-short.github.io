Surely you will see the golden sands of deserts, oases among endless lands and tired travelers, traveling in the Sahara and dreaming of finding their happiness.  But everything is not as poetic as it seems at first glance.  The history of this place is full of tragic battles and the ongoing struggle for the independence of the homeland.  But, despite this, the Sahara is fraught with many puzzles and legends telling us how one of the most attractive and frightening corners of the Earth appeared. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Few people know that the history of Western Sahara originates long before our era, when the Carthaginian explorer and politician Gannon decided to establish Phoenician colonies along the western coast of Africa.  His journey cannot be called ordinary.  Every person living in those times knew that a ship can sail easily, only having sheared her sail when wind flows help him.  Therefore, getting to the south, sailing along Africa, was not so difficult.  But on the way back, the sailors had to overcome the north and north-east winds, as a result of this the Carthaginians discovered a method of movement, which was later called "tacking".  It was Gannon who laid down the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtraveling by sea, with the goal of discovering new lands and exploring uncharted territories.  His name, one of the few, is known to people today.  For his trip, he prepared 60 ships, on which he was accompanied by 30 thousand men and women.  When Gannon finally set foot on the coast of Morocco, he immediately established a colony.  At this place, Rabat, the cultural and political center of the country, is now located, the first thing he built a religious temple there.  In total, five cities were laid on the coast of Morocco. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.viajejet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camel Caravan in Western Sahara" class="if uuid-2306805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306805.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the edge of deserts and the endless sand of one of the parts of Africa in Western Sahara was very ambiguous and complex.  At all times, the population of the Sahara was nomadic tribes.  The power of some was replaced by others, but one thing remained unchanged: the struggle for leadership, the desire to survive, no matter what.  Previously, desert territories were inhabited by Berber and Arab tribes.  Also, the emergence and formation of no less powerful and ready for military battles states, such as Arab-Berber.  Over the long years of their existence, they will be able to conquer not only the Northern and Western parts of Africa, but also the impregnable Iberian Peninsula, with the countries located on it. </p><p>  Harsh living conditions grew warriors, real fighters, hardy and merciless.  The nature of man makes us seek the best conditions for the life of people, their offspring and, of course, fight for them.  But in order to survive, a person needs to unite, as they say, <span>one in the field is not a warrior.</span>  It was here, on the territory of Western Sahara, that a strong alliance of the Sanghaji and Lemtun tribes was formed, which subsequently laid the foundation for the Almoravid state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="betterworldcampaign.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Western Sahara" class="if uuid-2306809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306809.jpg"></div><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  The emergence of the Almoravid state was the first step towards the cultural and political flourishing of the peoples of Western Sahara.  In the XI century, the nomads of the Berber tribes Sanjaj and Lemtun, led by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, hid under the dark cloth the lower part of their faces, which they called "foxes", just as their ruler did.  As you know, the name of a tribe, a society of people is given by their distinguishing features.  Also, the Almoravids were no exception.  Due to the fact that they "wrapped" themselves, they began to be called al-mutalassimun.  But to a wider circle of people they are known as al-murabitun, in other words "people from the fortress."  We all understand that, passing the concepts from generation to generation, its sound and form itself are gradually changing.  As a result, the designation of the Almoravid dynasty is rooted in various European languages, including Spanish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sahara-overland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Western Sahara on the map" class="if uuid-2306812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306812.jpg"></div><h2>  Army </h2><p>  The Almoravid army inhabiting Western Sahara was very strong.  She, under the leadership of one of the military commanders of Yusuf ibn Tashfin, was able to conquer Morocco, capturing the largest cities - Fez, Tangier, Tlemcen and Ceuta.  During 1086-1146, the Almoravids, as a dynasty of Western Sahara, retained their power over the southern part of Spain unshakable.  This continued until the Almohad took their place.  They represented a new religious movement that arose among the Arab-Berber tribes of Morocco.  Proponents of new ideas accused the Almoravids of neglecting the unshakable principles of Islam.  A long, well-known rivalry with the sanhaji tribe has long characterized Almohad as opponents of the Almoravids, who, in turn, always relied on the sanhaji.  The Almohad empire included only Muslim Spain and Morocco, thereby giving way to the Almoravid state, which included Western Sahara and Mauritania.  This also affected the power emanating from the ruling dynasty, the strength of its application.  Almohad ruled from 1147 to 1269. </p><h2>  Unrest in the Sahara </h2><p>  When the Almoravids ended their existence, and Western Sahara was again left to itself, it began to be settled by nomads, people moving from place to place in search of favorable living conditions.  Now the desert population was distinguished by the fact that the people did not seek and did not want to create a political state, to bind themselves with any boundaries of the law.  But at the same time, despite the lack of sovereign power, certain areas of Western Sahara took control of Moroccan dynasties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="face2faceafrica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Demonstration of residents in the Sahara" class="if uuid-2306816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306816.jpg"></div><p>  Despite numerous wars and the transfer of land to various authorities, Morocco considered the Sahara a place completely controlled by them, which in reality was far from the case.  Full or total control of the region was not possible.  Western Sahara is the place through which the important trade route passed.  He played a large role in world cultural interaction.  Caravans from Guinea, Mauritania and other countries were sent to Morocco through Western Sahara.  But it should be said that all trade routes were under the protection of Sahara nomads, who were also called "great nomads."  They demanded the payment of tribute from passing ships. </p><h2>  Desert </h2><p>  The Red Stream, or Seget El Hamra, was the name for the northern part of Western Sahara.  The Spaniards called the valley of deserts Rio de Oro - "Golden River".  No wonder we started talking about Spain, because this country had a huge impact on the formation of modern Western Sahara.  Soon, as a result of increased interest in the African continent, colonization occurred. </p><p>  It is not surprising that the richest and most influential powers, such as Britain and France, got the best territories.  And Spain by that time had rather weakened in its influence, therefore it was forced to colonize Western Sahara, whose natural resources and adverse conditions were unattractive.  But do not forget that the desert was inhabited by freedom-loving and free nomads.  In their interests there was no total control of the Spaniards over their lands.  That is why the colonialists met with resistance from the local population in the late XIX - early XX centuries.  And the leader of the uprising was Ma al-Ainin, who was also called the "king of the desert."  He was a religious leader and preacher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.budgetdirect.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yellow Sands of Sahara" class="if uuid-2306802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306802.jpg"></div><p>  The struggle for independence continued for a long time.  At this time, cities were being built, fortresses, mosques and shopping arcades were being built.  The center of confrontation of the colony was the city of Smara, the construction of which was begun by Ma al-Ainin.  It is impossible to convey in words all the cruelty that occurred at that time in the valley of deserts and sands.  What strength and courage people showed when they won their independence, fighting for freedom and the opportunity to live, without being subjected to the control of the colonialists! </p><p>  Having undergone Moroccan claims, the battles of the Polisario front and the Sahara war, the desert people finally got their share of freedom.  But not everything turned out to be so simple.  Western Sahara is still considered a disputed territory between Morocco and the POLISARIO front, whose goal is to uphold the interests of the indigenous West Sahara population.  Most world powers do not recognize the independence of the Sahara Arab Democratic Republic.  All of the above does not allow people to fully create a political state.  As a result of many battles, the POLISARIO front separated the so-called "free zone", where Moroccan troops have no right to enter.  Mostly nomads live there, only 30-40 thousand people, they are mostly engaged in cattle breeding, camels.  And all the other Sahrawis live in refugee camps, which also prevents the people of Western Sahara from reuniting and building a decent functioning civilization that can develop society, create something new, and create. </p><h2>  Capital </h2><p>  Currently, the capital of Western Sahara is the city of El Aaiun, it is located in northwestern Africa, its population is 217 732 people.  This is the largest city in the territory of the Sahara, it is located near the Atlantic Ocean, so the climate there is quite mild.  The terrain can be called dune.  But, unfortunately, due to the fact that the city was built relatively recently, it does not play the role of the cultural and historical center of Western Sahara.  Despite this, it houses some art monuments, museums, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Local construction" class="if uuid-2306817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306817.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking about the cities of Western Sahara, it cannot be said that they have outstanding historical monuments or cultural values.  But they undoubtedly keep a unique history in themselves, connected with the real, pure religious faith, with the struggle for independence and upholding freedom in the name of a favorable life for future generations. </p><h2>  Political system </h2><p>  Currently, the state of Western Sahara is governed by President Brahim Gali.  He is also the chairman of the POLISARIO front since July 12, 2016.  The current Prime Minister of the Sahara Arab Democratic Republic is Mohamed Wali Akeik.  The flag of Western Sahara consists of colors that are associated with the Islamic faith - black, red, white, green.  The image of the flag was taken on February 27, 1976.  It should be noted that this flag was originally used by the POLISARIO front, some note a clear resemblance to the image of the <span>flag of Palestine.</span>  Since Western Sahara is a region dominated by the Muslim population, a crescent moon and a star are depicted in the middle of the flag.  They are important symbols of Islam. </p><h2>  Is there a second capital? </h2><p>  It should be noted that the town of Bir Lelu is considered to be the temporary capital of Western Sahara, since El Aaiun is located in the Moroccan zone, like all major cities.  As for geography, a little should be said about the relief of Western Sahara.  On its territory there are mountains that look high into the sky, and the extinct crater of the volcano Amy Kushi, and plains entirely covered with sand, but the most important thing is the salt lakes.  It was they who gave birth to one of the sectors of the economy - the extraction of table salt by the population of Western Sahara.  Also, <span>people</span> are engaged in the extraction of phosphates, fishing for export, and, of course, in agriculture and livestock. </p><p>  Describing the valley of sands and deserts, I would like to talk about the coins of Western Sahara.  Sahara peseta - the so-called monetary unit used in the region.  Initially, in 1990, coins were issued as collectibles, but a few years later they began to produce monetary units in denominations of 1, 2 and 5 pesetas.  It should be clarified that dirham, dinar, ugiya and euro are also used in Western Sahara.  They are actively used in circulation. </p><h2>  Modern world </h2><p>  So, speaking about the current situation in the region, it should be said that Morocco has a great influence on Western Sahara.  The non-recognition of independence by other powers forces the people of Sahara to lead a lifestyle of nomads or refugees, and does not allow the development of the country's economy, cultural and political progress.  In order for Western Sahara to be constantly in a state of progress, to improve its economy, the extraction of salt and phosphate, the construction of state institutions, and the increase in the level of medicine and education must take place.  For example, Sahara schoolchildren are forced to study in nearby regions, since there are either very few or no schools of their own.  But for all this to happen, the ongoing struggle for independence must end, the shedding of blood must stop, and finally, a decision must be made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="everything-everywhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="By car in the Sahara" class="if uuid-2306819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2306819.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, the centuries-old history of wars and terror will be forgotten, a new economy and a culture of society will be born.  Also, do not forget about museums and art monuments located in the capital of Western Sahara.  The purpose of the population is to increase architectural structures, historical finds.  But for all of the above, freedom and faith in a bright future are needed, cohesion is needed, which for the given period of time the inhabitants of Western Sahara do not have. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The whole world is monitoring the situation that the UN should soon resolve.  It is possible that Western Sahara will receive recognition by its international powers of its independence.  But, despite the current situation today, we can safely say that this place with its rich, centuries-old history, cultural and historical values ‚Äã‚Äãthat cannot be forgotten, with residents fighting without fear and doubt for their independence, no matter what.  And only for this we must respect the population of Western Sahara and this beautiful, mysterious and alluring valley of deserts. </p>
