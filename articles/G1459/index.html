During the hostilities, our country has achieved significant foreign policy successes and has consolidated its status as one of the leading European states. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><p>  The inevitability of a new clash became apparent immediately after the conclusion of the peace treaty in 1774.  According to its terms, Russia got access to the Black Sea, Crimea was declared independent of the Turkish authorities.  <span>The Russo-Turkish War of</span> 1787-1791, the table ‚ÄúReasons for Confrontation‚Äù for the events of which is presented in this section, arose because Turkey wanted to take revenge and regain its former positions lost on the eastern front. </p>

    <p>  This was also preceded by a series of events that further strengthened the position of our country in this region.  Three years later, the khan, who was under the influence of the Russian leadership, became the Crimean ruler.  Five years later, he abdicated and the peninsula went to Russia.  In the same year, the Georgian tsar signed an agreement with our country, according to which Georgia and Russia became allies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Participants and Stakeholders</em> </td><td>  <em>Territorial disputes</em> </td><td>  <em>Question about areas of influence</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  England, Prussia </td><td>  Concern over the territorial expansion of the borders of the Russian Empire </td><td>  Concern over the expansion of Russia's spheres of influence in the European arena </td></tr><tr><td>  Turkey </td><td>  The demand to return Crimea and Georgia </td><td>  The requirement for control of Russian ships in the Black Sea </td></tr><tr><td>  Russia, Austria </td><td>  The desire to consolidate the gains in the previous war with <span>Turkey (Russia)</span> and support the ally (Austria) </td><td>  The desire to strengthen its position in Europe </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  On the eve of the fighting </h2><p>  Against the backdrop of these successes, public opinion was greatly impressed by the journey of Catherine II to Novorossia, which was equipped by Potemkin.  She was accompanied by the Austrian emperor, who became her ally.  The Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791, the table of which clearly demonstrates these serious geopolitical changes, was largely due to these events.  Turkey presented an ultimatum to the Russian leadership, demanding the return of Crimea, the search for Russian ships passing through the Dardanelles, and the return of its power over Georgia.  The request was rejected, which led to the start of hostilities. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian turkish war 1787 1791 table" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271329.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  First battles </h2><p>  The Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791, the table ‚ÄúMain Events‚Äù which clearly demonstrates the success of Russian weapons, began with the defeat of the Turkish landing at Kinburn.  Russian troops were led by Suvorov, who successfully resisted the enemy‚Äôs attempts to seize this fortress.  In fact, this was the first major victory, which completed the first year of the campaign.  Another significant event this year was the diplomatic success of our country, which secured the support of the ruler of Austria. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Then General Tekeli organized several successful raids in the Kuban region.  The enemy‚Äôs second attempt to seize the fortress, which was undertaken in the winter, was also unsuccessful.  Then the Turkish command concentrated all its forces on the Danube, preparing for a new attack. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Years</em> </td><td>  <em>Main events</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  1787 </td><td>  Battle of Kinburn, victory of the Russian troops </td></tr><tr><td>  1788 </td><td>  The capture of Russian troops Ochakova </td></tr><tr><td>  1789 </td><td>  The victory of the army of Suvorov at Fokshany and Rymnik </td></tr><tr><td>  1790-1791 </td><td>  The capture of the Russian army of Ishmael;  naval victory at Kaliakria </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Battles of 1788 </h2><p>  The Russian-Turkish war of 1787-1791, the table of which includes the main chronology of events, was marked by brilliant victories of the army of Suvorov and Potemkin, who after the siege and assault of the fortress Ochakov took it, which was a serious blow to the Turkish military leadership, which after that was forced to postpone plans for attack on Bender.  At the same time, Austrian troops joined the military campaign under the command of Lassi, but his tactics of dispersing military forces subsequently led to serious failures.  Rumyantsev, on the other hand, commanded units in Podolia, but things didn‚Äôt come to clashes here. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian-Turkish war 1787 1791 table reasons" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271331.jpg" width="368"></div></h2><h2>  Major victories </h2><p>  The Russian-Turkish war of 1787-1791, the table of which is devoted to the main hostilities, was marked by the largest victories of domestic weapons, which glorified commanders and leaders of operations.  The next year began with the fact that Potemkin moved the main forces to Bender.  <span>The Turkish troops,</span> in turn, tried to hinder this advance, but Suvorov defeated the enemy at Fokshany.  Then the vizier went on the offensive again, deciding to take advantage of the weakening of Russia's positions in Moldova.  Crossing the Danube, he ran into the troops of Suvorov and the Prince of Coburg, who again defeated the Turkish troops.  The Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791, the table "Allies" in particular, shows that the Austrian troops supported against the Turks. </p>

    <p>  These major successes ended the second year of the war.  The victories of the Russian army seriously alarmed the Prussian and British governments, which in every way pushed Porto to continue the war.  In addition, in the same year, Austrian troops occupied Bucharest and Belgrade, which greatly weakened Turkish positions. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Generals</em> </td><td>  <em>Participation</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Suvorov </td><td>  He took a number of fortresses, won at Rymnik, Fokshany </td></tr><tr><td>  Potemkin </td><td>  He commanded the Russian army in Moldova, took a number of fortresses </td></tr><tr><td>  Ushakov </td><td>  Won victories at sea (the most famous - at Kaliakria) </td></tr><tr><td>  Prince of Coburg </td><td>  He supported the Russian troops </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  1790 year </h2><p>  The Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791, the table of the "Leaders" of which shows the basic composition of the command, entered its culmination in the above year.  This year began as a failure for the Austrians, who were defeated by the Turks, which led to the fact that the emperor agreed to peace talks and actually got out of the war.  The Russian-Turkish war of 1787-1791, the table "Allies of Russia" shows the balance of power between the warring parties.  But Catherine II did not take part in the peace talks, and the Russian troops continued the fighting. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Member countries</em> </td><td>  Russia </td><td>  Turkey </td></tr><tr><td>  <em>Allies</em> </td><td>  Austria </td><td>  England, Prussia </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The Turks tried to invade the Crimea, but were twice repulsed by the Russian fleet under the command of F.F.  Ushakova.  Then Potemkin went on the offensive and captured a number of enemy targets, but the fortress of Izmail held on.  The leadership of the assault took Suvorov.  He prepared for it very carefully, conducting exercises at night: soldiers under his leadership stormed improvised fortifications resembling enemy structures.  He sent the famous ultimatum to the Turks and, after the refusal, led the troops on a decisive offensive.  One of the columns was commanded by Kutuzov.  The fortress was taken, which, in essence, meant a turning point in the war.  The fighting at sea was also successful, the most significant victories were the battles of Fidonisi and Kaliakria. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian turkish war 1787 1791 table allies" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1271335.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Completion </h2><p>  The war ended the following year with the signing of the <span>Iasi Peace,</span> in which Russia held back all acquisitions, but territories such as Wallachia, Moldova and Bessarabia had to cede to Turkey.  This war strengthened the international prestige of the Russian Empire, and also consolidated its position on the Black Sea, which was especially important for the development of the country's fleet and its international prestige. </p>
