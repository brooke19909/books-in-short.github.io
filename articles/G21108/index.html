    <p>  Previously, company employees were holders of vouchers.  But if some competently solved the issue of using a security by investing in the development of a profitable company, then others, on the contrary, missed this chance.  Many citizens sold securities for small amounts or invested in non-profit organizations.  Some people do not know anything about their vouchers, as they are not interested in such matters. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The beginning of such events dates back to 1993.  As the country's economy collapsed, it was necessary to divide state property between those who rose in power.  Therefore, privatization of state enterprises was carried out. </p><p>  Privatization checks were offered to ordinary citizens, which were proposed to be invested in an investment fund.  They were also intended for the acquisition of shares in organizations or for sale.  Checks provided the right to a certain share of the property.  Compared to banknotes, they do not depreciate due to inflation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vouchers were bought for small amounts.  This was done by people who use the ignorance of others.  It was difficult for many Soviet citizens to change their lifestyle, understanding what was happening.  Not everyone understood the privatization procedure.  Because of this, many are wondering if there is a First Investment Voucher Fund.  It works now, so investors can earn income. </p><h2>  What to do with the voucher now? </h2><p>  Many privatization funds were closed some time after the organization, and then they deliberately went bankrupt.  They left funds deceived investors.  Some firms have been renamed, but they still exist.  And others, on the contrary, are closing. </p>

    <p>  But these organizations, moving from one owner to another, changing names, were closed.  It turns out that voucher checks have lost value.  Only some of them work now.  If you exchange a voucher, now it is inexpensive. </p><h2>  What do you do with saved vouchers? </h2><p>  It is necessary to determine where the check was attached.  In Soviet times, their applications were few, as now.  If the checks are left, then you can get compensation or sell them.  These operations are performed by the state.  But keep in mind that the amount from the vouchers will be small. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another option is also possible.  If the funds are transferred to <span>investment funds,</span> then they can then be converted to other organizations.  In this case, the depositor will not be provided with funds, or he will receive too small an amount.  If a citizen has acquired shares of enterprises, then he can receive interest.  The amount is determined by the type of organization.  If the company was ruined, then there is the possibility of claiming compensation. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  To determine the profitability, you need to know the value of the shares.  Every year this indicator changes.  In 1994, its price was 5 kopecks, in 2000 - 30 kopecks, and in 2006 - 50 kopecks.  The cost of shares in each organization is different. </p>
