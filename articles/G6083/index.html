    <p>  The socialist Republic of Vietnam (such is its official name) has been occupying leading positions in the ranking of the most popular destinations for traveling in the autumn-winter period for more than a year.  It is from November to April that the most favorable conditions for a relaxing break from everyday rush here: the rainy season ends, the air temperature rises, and the sea pleases with transparency and a light breeze.  A little fairy tale is what Vietnam is in November.  Reviews of tourists constantly prove the truth of this conclusion.  But it is based on the opinion of hundreds of thousands of tourists who have visited the country one or more times. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fun for everyone </h2><p>  <span>The weather in Vietnam</span> in November pleases not only lovers of beach relaxation, but also active tourists who prefer combining business with pleasure, for example, relaxing in a beautiful place and practicing your favorite sports - surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, diving. </p>

    <p>  This is facilitated by the presence of numerous surfers, including with Russian-speaking instructors, at the most popular resorts, as well as a colorful celebration in the first-class Stein Diving Center, dedicated to the opening of the diving season. </p><h2>  Climatic features of the country </h2><p>  The reviews of Vietnam in November allow us to conclude that thousands of travelers are very happy with their vacation, which during this period is especially comfortable and allows not only to swim in the gentle waters of the South China Sea, but also to explore the diverse sights of the Red Dragon Country. </p><p>  Since Vietnam has an elongated shape, the climate varies with location.  Three main zones can be distinguished in order to more clearly imagine the picture: </p><ul><li>  North: summer falls between April and October.  The temperature ranges from 29 to 36 degrees.  At times heavy rains are possible, which lasts just a few minutes.  In winter time (from December to March), the temperature drops to a mark of 9-16 degrees, rains and cloudy weather will be a frequent occurrence. </li><li>  Center: in this region, meteorological phenomena are caused by the mountain range, which is a kind of protective barrier in the north-west of the territory.  Most of the year there is dry, warm and sunny weather.  The exception is months such as November and December, when heavy rainfall often occurs. </li></ul>

However, May-October are characterized by almost daily heavy, but short-term rains, with a temperature of 30-35 degrees, while for November-April dry, sunny and humid weather is characteristic, and the temperature of sea water reaches 29 degrees. </li></ul><h2>  The benefits of a holiday in Vietnam </h2><p>  The country's location in three climatic zones at once - subtropical, tropical and equatorial - makes it possible to visit it all year round, because the bad weather in one part of it does not impede a trip to another, where it will be clear and sunny at the same time.  However, vacation in Vietnam in November is the most popular among travelers because the favorite tourist resorts are located in the southern part of the state, where the most comfortable conditions for a pleasant stay fall exactly on this month and all following it until May. </p><h2>  Vietnam in November: tourist reviews of Nha Trang </h2><p>  Lovers of <span>beach vacations</span> come with pleasure to Nha Trang - the largest city and capital of Khanh Hoa province, the country's oldest resort, which emperors honored with their visit.  Life is in full swing here, because numerous cafes, bars, restaurants, discos, beauty salons attract vacationers with attractive prices and various promotions.  But what else to do on vacation, how not to devote time to a full rest with all possible entertainment? </p>

    <p>  Beautiful snow-white beaches, an abundance of surfers and diving centers, healing springs and mud, many islands with pristine nature, rich history and culture, colorful cuisine and good-natured locals - these are the things for which people seek to visit Vietnam (Nha Trang) in November.  Enthusiastic tourists reviews about holidays in this part of the country awaken the desire to immediately buy a plane ticket and experience the charm of an exotic trip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nha Trang: attractions and features </h2><p>  For those who are interested in exploring the sights of the area, Nha Trang can offer different options: this is the Long Son Pagoda, and the <span>Chama Towers of</span> Po Nagar, and the Buddha statue rising on the top of the hill, and museums (A. Yersen Museum, National Oceanographic Museum). </p><p>  Of the natural features, you should definitely visit the thermal and mud springs and, of course, the island of Hon Tre - a mecca for tourists, on which the famous amusement park "Winperl" is located.  This is another peculiar modern attraction that Vietnam is proud of.  Holidays in November (reviews of a trip to this island in autumn prove this) provides a lot of entertainment. </p>

    <p>  Even before you get to Hon Tre, adventures begin: you can get here not by the usual method, but by cable car.  You will spend 12 unforgettable minutes in a cabin in flight above the sea, from a height of 50-60 meters contemplating its azure waters and picturesque surroundings.  The island itself is a continuous accumulation of all kinds of entertainment, entertainment and educational institutions that are designed to satisfy the curiosity of both adults and children.  The VIP-level hotel of the same name, an aqua park, an aquarium, play areas, a cinema, a disco inside an artificial mountain, numerous restaurants, boutiques and a musical laser show will give you an unforgettable experience.  By purchasing a ticket to the island, you get at once an affordable price for the entire entertainment package in one set, because the price includes all the services of the island, with the exception of drinks and food. </p><h2>  The amazing nature of Nha Trang </h2><p>  The weather in Vietnam in November allows you to enjoy the natural charms of the country, and especially those attractions that are located outside Nha Trang. </p><p>  Lovers of swimming the beaches of the southern islands will be especially pleased (they are much cleaner and more picturesque than in the town itself), which are located near the main resort.  Excursions to them, and already including lunch, are sold both in hotels and in local travel agencies.  A pleasant addition to a beach holiday for an inquisitive traveler will be a trip to the Tri Nguyen Aquarium, located on the same islands and famous for its unusual surreal forms. </p><p>  What else is Vietnam interesting in November?  Reviews of tourists indicate that one of the most exotic excursions is a trip to the Northern Islands of monkeys, orchids and deer.  A boat station is located just 18 kilometers from Nha Trang, from which boats depart to these 3 islands every half hour.  You can buy a tour at once for everything - it‚Äôs more profitable to do it at a local office in the city. </p><p>  From the same boat station, you can easily get to Baho Falls - a unique place where you can enjoy the beauty of the wild.  It is best to go here in dry weather, because after rain the boulders near the waterfall are wet, which is a considerable danger.  The cost of entering the park, where Baho is overthrown, is about a dollar. </p>

    <h2>  Calm vacation: where to go? </h2><p>  Vacations in Vietnam in November are also suitable for tourists who prefer a more relaxing pastime.  All the conditions for this are at Phan Thiet: wide, clean, equipped with everything you need beaches, smooth entry into the sea, coconut palms on the shore, as well as the remarkable pink dunes - this is what attracts tourists to another resort in Vietnam. </p><h2>  <span>Vietnam: Phan Thiet</span> in November </h2><p>  Reviews about the trip here will not leave indifferent fans of exotic adventures, because the resort has something to brag about.  Getting acquainted with Phan Thiet, do not hesitate to visit the ancient towers - a heritage of Cham culture  port and picturesque fishing villages;  The red creek, which got its name from the color of the water (this color is given to it by the red rocks of the canyon in which it flows), as well as the bamboo forest and waterfalls surrounding a small unusual reservoir.  Whatever side you look at, Vietnam is beautiful in November!  Reviews of tourists every year prove this fact more and more. </p>

    <p>  Choosing a place to stay Phan Thiet, do not disregard the Buddhist center of the resort, where the largest statue of the Reclining Buddha is located.  The highlight of the tour is given by the fact that you can get to this area only by funicular, because the center rises on top of the mountain. </p><p>  A trip to the country of the <span>Red Dragon</span> will please you at any time of the year - this conclusion allows us to make reviews about Vietnam.  In November, it will be most comfortable to relax in the south, so if your vacation fell in the fall, do not be discouraged: a warm sea and the gentle sun, as well as many attractions, natural beauties and attractions, await you in a country whose coast is affectionately washed by the South China Sea. </p>
