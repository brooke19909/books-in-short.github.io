What resulted in the emergence of Hellenistic states?  What are their distinguishing features and features?  This article will focus on these and many other issues. </p><p>  We will also get acquainted with specific examples of Hellenistic states, find out their brief history and talk about the famous rulers of that time. </p><h2>  Background, or where it all began </h2><p>  Hellenistic states replaced the Classical era of the state system, characterized by the ancient urban civil community. </p><p>  In that historical period, human society was organized into so-called policies, often taking the form of city-states.  Each fenced area was considered a separate country, headed by an agricultural community. </p><p>  Therefore, in short, the emergence of Hellenistic states was based on ancient policies.  What else characterized these settlements? </p><p>  First of all, each civic community consisted of a city center and adjacent agricultural territory.  Community members had the same political and ownership rights. </p><p>  There was also a separate part of the population in the policy that did not have civil rights.  These were slaves, metecs, freedmen and others. </p><p>  Each city had its own power, monetary unit, religious and secular organization.  The political system of such policies was diverse: from the monarchical political regime to the democratic or capitalist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What marked the new national system?  What has changed with the emergence of Hellenistic states?  A brief discussion of this will be given below. </p><h2>  A new round in public relations </h2><p>  First of all, the city-states were replaced by entire empires or powers, including not one city, but several large settlements and hillforts surrounded by rural settlements, vast pastures and spacious forests. </p><p>  Who was able to carry out such a national coup that affected all spheres of human society?  This man was none other than Alexander the Great.  Thanks to the conquests of this strong and powerful ruler, Hellenistic states just arose.  A brief discussion of this will be given below. </p>

    <p>  But first, let's find out what is remarkable about the Hellenistic era and what role it played in general political world history. </p><h2>  The essence of Hellenism </h2><p>  In short, the Hellenistic states were the result of the spread of Greek culture, actively introduced by Alexander the Great.  This gave rise to new political and social ties, trade and market relations, as well as the popularization of the Greek language and culture. </p><p>  The Hellenization of the <span>countries of the East was</span> determined by the adoption by the local population of the culture, customs, traditions and views of the Greek conquerors, as well as imitation of their way of life, habits and state system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main tool for the spread of Greek culture was urban planning, since the Hellenistic authorities were actively building cities in their territory.  The scale of construction of large cities was huge and impressive.  On their territory wide streets, spacious parks, religious and religious buildings and large central squares were planned in advance.  Such extensive urban development was the main feature of the Hellenistic states, since the city in Greek culture was considered the center of art, education and political life of the entire population. </p><p>  Another way of spreading the Greek way of life was to instill education, actively carried out by Macedonian and his adherents.  Alexander the Great was very fond of enlightenment.  He built schools and libraries, encouraged the works of writers and scientists, contributed to the formation of the theater and the translation of sacred books. </p>

    <p>  As already mentioned above, Hellenistic states arose as a result of the conquests of Alexander the Great.  Who was this man and what did he manage to achieve? </p><h2>  Leader of Hellenism </h2><p>  Alexander of Macedon, born in the summer of 356 BC, became a king at the age of twenty as a result of the premature death of his father.  Over the thirteen years of his reign, Alexander not only strengthened his own state, but also conquered the Persian Empire and spread Greek culture throughout the East.  Thus, he showed himself as a brilliant commander and a wise ruler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Having become king of Asia, Alexander the Great wanted to equalize and unite the victors with the vanquished.  He sought to unite the customs of different nations.  This policy also concerned the wearing of oriental clothes, and the observance of court ceremonies, and the maintenance of the harem.  However, to adhere to Persian customs or not - depended on the Macedonian invader himself, Alexander did not force his subjects to strictly adhere to certain Eastern traditions. </p><p>  And yet, riots in his own troops repeatedly flared up against Macedon.  Perhaps this was due to the introduction of the Persian custom of kissing the feet of his overlord. </p><h2>  Lord's death </h2><p>  According to many historical reports, Alexander the Great died suddenly, after a ten-day serious illness.  Some associate the disease of a Hellenistic ruler with malaria or pneumonia.  According to others, the <span>great commander</span> could die due to parasitic infections or cancer.  There is a version about the deliberate poisoning of Alexander during his next military campaign. </p>

    <p>  Be that as it may, with the death of Macedon, the decline of the Greek states came, leading to the complete fall of Greece and the tremendous prosperity of the Roman Empire - the country that conquered the Hellenistic states. </p><p>  What powers were part of Greek rule? </p><h2>  Conquered countries </h2><p>  As we saw, Hellenism and Hellenistic states are closely interconnected.  Thanks to the conquests of Alexander of Macedon and the conquest of many peoples, the spread of Greek culture became possible. </p><p>  Which countries were included in the list of Hellenistic states? </p><p>  Here is some of them: </p><ol><li>  State of the Seleucids. </li><li>  Greco-Bactrian kingdom. </li><li>  Indo-Greek kingdom. </li><li>  Hellenistic Egypt. </li><li>  Pontic Kingdom. </li><li>  Achaean Union. </li><li>  The kingdom of Pergamon. </li><li>  The kingdom of bosporus. </li></ol><p>  The main Hellenistic states (like many of the others listed above) were a kind of synthesis between the local despotic authorities and the Greek political tradition.  At the head of each individual state was the king.  His power was based on the bureaucratic apparatus and citizens enjoying special rights and privileges. </p><p>  Thanks to the emergence of Hellenistic states and their friendly relations, the empire of Alexander the Great included stable, well-developed powers, united by common cultural and political values. </p><p>  What is a brief description of the Hellenistic states?  Let's get to know them better. </p><h2>  Hellenistic states.  Their similarities and differences </h2><p>  After the death of Macedon, his great and powerful empire fell apart, as it was divided between his generals.  Individual powers carried the ideas and views of the Greeks, but nevertheless they no longer possessed their former power, either politically, culturally or militarily. </p>

    <p>  To learn more about these Hellenistic states, it is necessary to determine their main parameters and characteristics. </p><h2>  Seleucid State </h2><p>  It was a monarchy, the core of which was the Middle East.  This state, huge in terms of occupied territory, included Asia Minor, Phenicia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Iran.  In fact, it was a link between Greek and Eastern culture. </p><p>  Starting to conduct military aggression, the empire collided with the Roman army and received a sharp rebuff.  Then it was captured by the Parthians and Armenians, after which it turned into a Roman province. </p><p>  After the state became part of the Roman Empire, it was given a different name - Syria.  Greek culture reigned here, reflected in the Greco-Macedonian communities, Greek temples, bathhouses and theaters. </p><p>  The Syrians were reputed to be morally licentious people indulging in various pleasures and delights.  The state existed at the expense of domestic taxes (per capita, customs, salt, municipal and others).  Also, the state was famous for its strong, professional army, the founder of which was Alexander the Great. </p><h2>  Greco-Bactrian kingdom </h2><p>  It arose as a result of the collapse of the Seleucid Empire.  The powers included the lands of Bactria and Sogdiana. </p><p>  The state itself lasted a little over a hundred years.  At first, the country's population adhered to Greek traditions and worldviews, but over time, residents adopted the way of thinking and customs of the East, which gave rise to a cultural and religious mixture called ‚ÄúGreek Buddhism‚Äù.  The country's economy rested mainly on gold mining and silk export from China. </p>

    <h2>  Indo-Greek kingdom </h2><p>  It arose as an extension of the Greco-Bactrian, encompassing the entire territory of northern India.  The ruling dynasty in the state were the heirs of Eutidem, they significantly expanded the kingdom thanks to the numerous military operations carried out in the west and east of their country. </p><p>  In the first years of its emergence, this Hellenistic state adhered to Hindu religious beliefs, which were replaced by Buddhism, closely associated with Greek culture.  For example, religious buildings and images were a mixture of Eastern and Hellenistic traditions. </p><p>  The last king of the state was overthrown by the Indo-Scythian conquerors. </p><h2>  Pontic Kingdom </h2><p>  This <span>Greek-Persian state</span> occupied the southern coast of the Black Sea and lasted about two hundred and fifty years.  It was conditionally divided into two parts by the Pontic Alps: upland (where ore and other precious metals were mined) and coastal (where olives were grown and engaged in fishing). </p><p>  Between these areas there were differences in culture and customs.  The coastal population was Greek-speaking, while the inhabitants of the inland areas belonged to Iranian nationality.  The religion of the kingdom was mixed - Greek mythology and Persian motifs were reflected in it.  Some kings of the state adhered to Judaism. </p><p>  The country's army was considered strong and crowded (up to three hundred thousand soldiers), which included a powerful fleet.  However, this did not prevent the Pontic state from suffering a devastating defeat in the battles with the Roman Republic, after which the western part of the country joined Rome as the provinces of Bithynia and Pontus, and the eastern part was transferred to another state. </p><h2>  Kingdom of Pergamon </h2><p>  Occupied the northwestern region of Asia Minor.  Throughout history (about one hundred and fifty years), the state was inhabited by a diverse national composition.  Here lived the Athenians, Macedonians, Paflagonians, Missians and others. </p><p>  The Pergamon kings were famous for their patronage of art, literature, science and sculpture.  At the end of the existence of the state, its rulers acted as vassals of the Roman emperor, which ultimately led to the kingdom becoming one of the Roman provinces. </p><h2>  Kingdom of commagen </h2><p>  It is considered the ancient Armenian Hellenistic state located on the territory of modern Turkey (more precisely, some of its areas). </p><p>  The history of this power was not marked by any outstanding memorable events, although its kings for a long period managed to defend their independence.  And yet over time, Commagena was annexed to Rome as another province. </p><p>  However, this was not the end of the history of the Hellenistic state.  For a certain period, by order of the emperor, the kingdom of Commagenes regained its independence, so that after thirty years it would finally join the Roman Empire. </p><h2>  Hellenistic Egypt </h2><p>  It was the main center of Greek culture.  The history of this Hellenistic state began from the moment of its subjugation to Alexander the Great and ended with the defeat of the state in the battle with the Roman ruler Octavian.  Since then, Hellenistic Egypt began to enter Rome as the province of the same name. </p><p>  Egypt in those days was ruled by the Ptolemies.  In their power, they combined both Greek and local traditions and customs.  There were privileged positions at court, such as ‚Äúrelatives,‚Äù ‚Äúfirst friends,‚Äù ‚Äúreceivers,‚Äù and the like. </p><p>  Administratively, Egypt was divided into several policies that did not play a significant role in political governance, as well as nomes who did not have any influence or self-government at all. </p><p>  An important social and political force in the state was possessed by priests located at each church.  These cult workers received material benefits from the treasury, and also collected offerings from many believers. </p><p>  During the Hellenistic period, Egypt retreated from its cultural identity, gradually adopting the Hellenistic way of life.  Libraries and schools flourished here, such sciences as geometry, mathematics, geography and others developed. </p><p>  In Hellenistic Egypt, famous writers lived, such as Callimachus, Apollonius of Rhodes, Theocritus, who worked in various genres and styles (hymns, tragedies, memes, idylls and others). </p>

    <p>  The religion of the state combines Greek and Egyptian religion, expressed in the cult of the god Sarapis. </p><h2>  Achaean Union </h2><p>  Another name for the state is the military-political association of ancient Greek cities, which settled in the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula. </p><p>  There was no central leading policy on the territory of the Achaean Union.  The supreme power was synclite - a meeting of members of the Union, which could include all free men who had reached the age of thirty.  At such meetings, laws were passed and current affairs considered. </p><p>  The Achaeans had a strong army, but very rarely fought, most often for defensive purposes. </p><p>  Formed in the fourth century BC, the Achaean Union was defeated in one hundred forty-sixth year BC, losing to the Roman commander. </p><h2>  Kingdom of bosporus </h2><p>  The ancient state, territorially located in the north of the Black Sea region, in the Kerch Strait.  Having formed in the fifth century BC, by the first century before the birth of Christ, it became dependent on the Roman Empire. </p><p>  The state economy was based on the cultivation of cereals - millet, wheat, barley.  The Bospors also specialized in the export of salted and dried fish, leather and fur products, livestock and even slaves.  Among the imported goods were valued wines, olive oil, expensive fabrics and precious metals, skillfully executed statues, vases and terracotta. </p><h2>  The end of these states and the reasons for this </h2><p>  As we see, the states of the Hellenistic world played an important role in the cultural, general political and social plan of the whole era.  Having arisen almost at one moment, each power had its own history and its own administrative and political system, which negatively affected their future fate. </p><p>  What are the main features of the Hellenistic states?  First of all, this is their focus on Greek culture, reflected in art, religion, science and other areas of life of each inhabitant. </p><p>  As already mentioned above, the Hellenistic states arose as a result of the conquests of Alexander the Great and the spread of Greek culture among the eastern population of that time.  The end of these once powerful powers was devastating and epoch-making.  However, events unfolded slowly and gradually.
