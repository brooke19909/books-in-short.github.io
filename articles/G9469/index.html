Only here you can work out the shooting technique and acquire the skills of a real hunter. </p><p>  Sporting is called target shooting.  The target fully imitates a running animal or bird in flight.  There is also a booth imitating wild boar hunting.  You can simply shoot at targets with a length of 200 m. Sporting is not only a preparation for hunting, but also a good physical activity.  After all, here it is necessary to overcome obstacles, and this requires good endurance, self-confidence and good psychological preparation. </p>

    <p>  Homeland firing is England.  But today, fans of this entertainment, or even a sport, are becoming more and more.  In Moscow, for the first time they learned about this sport in 1996, and in 2000 the National Federation of Sporting was already operating.  Since that time, this area has been considered an elite entertainment, along with golf or diving.  The recreation center "Black Stone" provides an opportunity for everyone to immerse themselves in this fascinating activity.  The goal of creating the Crimean Sporting Federation, which is located in a fishing village, is to <span>promote a healthy lifestyle</span> and preserve the environment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Even beginners will be able to try their hand.  However, you should first pass a safety training, and also discuss with the instructor shooting techniques.  Weapons for firing at an imaginary target can be rented on the territory of "Black Stones" (recreation center, Crimea).  Therefore, it is not necessary to acquire a real hunting rifle. </p><h2>  Fishing </h2>
