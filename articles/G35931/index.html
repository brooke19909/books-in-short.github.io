In winter, these are majestic domes, beautifully powdered with snow, which, due to their whiteness, merge with the rest of the temple.  And in the summer - this is a multifaceted overflow of roofs in the sun. </p><h2>  Cathedral Location </h2>

    <p>  Due to its favorable location, the Resurrection Cathedral is one of the few places in the city that has remained immune to the bustle of the city.  In an atmosphere of peace and tranquility, you can think about what is really important. </p><p>  The Resurrection Cathedral is located on the banks of the river almost at the place where Yagorba flows into Sheksna.  There is a small park near the cathedral, so in the summer it may seem that the cathedral is literally buried in greenery. </p><p>  Cathedral Hill is a favorite place to spend time for many citizens.  Here you can properly relax your soul, reflect on the most important and enjoy the beauty that surrounds the Resurrection Cathedral (Cherepovets).  Photos of these places, even done professionally, are not able to convey this beauty. </p><h2>  The legend of the foundation of the cathedral </h2>

According to legend, the foundation of the monastery was as follows.  One Sunday afternoon, a wealthy Moscow merchant sailed along Sheksna to Beloozero.  Suddenly, everything began to darken and the boat with goods ran aground.  Struck by the incident, the merchant began to pray fervently and ask for help.  Suddenly, a miracle happened in front of his eyes - a mountain nearby was starting to burn, and because of it rays of light emitted, as if pointing him the way.  As soon as the boat was able to get aground, the fire on the mountain disappeared. </p><p>  Shocked by his unexpected salvation, the merchant climbed the mountain and was struck by the view that opened before him.  Two rivers crossed with silver ribbons lowlands abundantly overgrown with forest.  The rescued merchant noted this place by installing a wooden cross, so that a year later he would return to the mountain and put up a small chapel here. </p><h2>  History of the Resurrection Cathedral </h2><p>  According to experts who studied the legend about the foundation of the monastery, the merchant who put the first chapel on the mountain and the founder of the monastery, Theodosius, is one and the same person.  It is believed that after the construction of the chapel, two monks Athanasius and Theodosius came here, who founded a monastery on the mountain.  Initially, the <span>complex of the Resurrection</span> Monastery included two churches - the Resurrection of Christ and the Holy Trinity. </p><p>  The first documented mention of the Cherepovets Monastery dates back to 1449.  However, it is known that the second <span>abbot of the monastery, the</span> Monk Athanasius, died in 1392, therefore, the history of the temple begins in the fourteenth century.  The exact date of the construction of the cathedrals is unknown. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The stone church at the temple was built only in 1752.  The initial appearance of this temple is quite different from the modern one.  The first reconstruction was carried out a hundred years after the end of construction, as it was necessary to completely replace the old roof.  At the same time, the temple is fully painted by local talented artists. </p><h2>  Cathedral during the revolution </h2>

    <p>  Of course, after the revolution, the church could not avoid the sad fate of almost all the cathedrals of the Russian Orthodox Church.  In 1923, the Cathedral was captured, and after ten years - finally closed.  For two decades, the monastery almost completely ceased to exist.  Of the entire complex, only one Resurrection Cathedral (Cherepovets) has survived to our days, which was restored in the nineties of the last century.  All the rest of the historical heritage was completely lost. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2>
