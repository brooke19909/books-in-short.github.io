Probably everyone remembers the models that had the most progressive design, a large number of functions and very high reliability.  With the arrival of touchscreen smartphones running Android OS, Nokia's products began to fade into the background.  The reason for this is the wrong choice of direction and rather poor development with overpriced.  But they still remember and admire the former power of the company.  Today I would like to ‚Äúponostalgize‚Äù a little and consider the Nokia 6300 model, which began to be produced at the beginning of the already distant 2007. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  All phones and smartphones of the Finnish company were manufactured in strict forms.  The Nokia 6300 phone was no exception.  The characteristics of its <span>appearance</span> are standard and easily recognizable.  Although at the time of release, the forms were innovative with the inherent ‚ÄúNokiev‚Äù angularity. </p><p>  The phone case consists of plastic with stainless steel inserts.  The contour is framed by an attractive metal frame.  The removable back cover is also made of steel.  It additionally adds confidence and presentability to the Nokia 6300.  Reviews about the cover in some cases can come across rather negative.  The fact is that due to the use of not too successful latches, it did not move fully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Looking above the lid, you can see the large square peephole of a digital camera with a 2 megapixel sensor.  All forms and design decisions are aimed at rigor.  For this reason, the phone from the very beginning gives the impression of a model for business people. </p><p>  The front panel is equipped with physical keys, a screen and a hole for the earpiece.  The keyboard has a four-way joystick and a select button in the middle.  Its location is quite convenient, and there are no problems with controlling the phone.  This cannot be said for the reject and receive keys.  Judging by user reviews, they are very small.  <span>The keyboard backlight is</span> bright and makes it easy to navigate the layout in low light. </p>

    <h2>  Side buttons and connectors </h2><p>  The right edge of the phone has a volume control key in the form of a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù.  It allows you to control the sound both in applications and when talking on the phone.  The upper end is equipped with only a power button.  In order not to accidentally click on it, it is recessed into the body.  The left edge does not have connectors and buttons.  As for the bottom, the manufacturer has included everything that remains here: a hole for connecting a charger, a 2.5 mm headphone jack and a jack for connecting the phone to a PC via a USB cable.  It is worth noting that the last element in the kit does not go. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  As a <span>device for outputting information</span> , this phone uses a QVGA-diply with a TFT-matrix.  Its diagonal is 2 inches.  As for the colors of the screen, there are 16 million.  The image looks very bright and juicy.  Agree, this feature of the Nokia 6300 phone at the time of release was very presentable, and everyone was striving for such parameters. </p><p>  When viewing the image at an angle, a slight fading and glare is noticed.  But you can be sure that under sunlight, everything will be visible very well. </p>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  The menu in comparison with other models of that period has not changed at all.  Used Nokia 6300 firmware received a small platform update to the second service pack.  By choosing one of four display options, you can make the phone a little more diverse. </p><p>  You can change the display of icons using themes.  Two of them are already pre-installed in the phone itself, and three more can be found on the memory card that comes with the kit.  But, despite the display itself, the functionality does not change, and each element here is standard.  Virtually nothing has changed compared to the slightly earlier models. </p><p>  Setting up the Nokia 6300 is carried out immediately upon purchase.  Since most often people buy a new phone along with a starter pack, consultants enter all the necessary data to access the Internet.  Further, all procedures for changing the appearance, displaying the main menu, etc. are performed by the user himself. </p><h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  Well, we got to the multimedia capabilities of the Nokia 6300 phone.  The characteristics of the internal memory are frankly disappointing, since 7.8 MB can only accommodate a few photos or a couple of audio recordings.  But standard comes with a 128 MB microSD card.  By today's standards, this is very small, but at that time - the standard. </p><p>  All games and additional applications are located on a flash drive.  If desired, they can be deleted or transferred to the phone memory. </p><p>  Additionally, the phone has the latest Macromedia Flash Lite 2.0.  As a music player, it is used exactly the same as in the <span>Nokia 5200</span> and 5300. When playing music with headphones, the quality is pretty good.  In addition, you can <span>adjust the equalizer</span> with preset values ‚Äã‚Äãor set them yourself. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Naturally, the standard is to work in GSM / EDGE (900/1800/1900; 850/1800/1900) networks of the Nokia 6300 phone.  The characteristics of Bluetooth 2.0 and EDGE (EGPRS) Class 10 at that time were very good.  Additionally, the ‚Äúblue tooth‚Äù involves the addition of paired devices, which greatly facilitates the transfer of data. </p><p>  Synchronization with a computer is done using a cable and special software.  Firmware update is made using FOTA technology. </p>

    <h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  Since the phone has already been on sale for more than seven years, quite a lot of reviews have been gathered about it.  Naturally, the overwhelming majority are good, but there are isolated cases of dissatisfied descriptions.  The most common Nokia 6300 reviews are about battery.  With active use, it often does not survive until the end of the day.  The solution is to purchase a more powerful power source. </p>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúNokia 6300‚Äù features are simply amazing at the time of release.  For this reason, all phones of this model literally scattered from the shelves.  Moreover, there were no big complaints, and the traditional Finnish quality is, as always, on top. </p>
