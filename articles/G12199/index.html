    <h2>  Credit from Sberbank </h2><p>  However, despite many banks, the most popular is Sberbank.  In Samara, they primarily seek credit in this financial institution.  There are a number of reasons for this.  This bank has state support, which means it is one of the most reliable.  In addition, Sberbank has existed in the lending market for a long time and during this entire period there has not been a single defrauded borrower. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To apply for a loan, you do not need to stand in line for hours.  Each city has several branches.  Sberbank grants a loan in cash as well as a card at an underestimated interest rate. </p><p>  The package of documents for processing a credit transaction is minimal.  Those people who receive a salary or pension on a bank card, and most of them, can apply for a loan only with a passport.  Getting a cash loan in Samara is most profitable through Sberbank or VTB 24. </p>
