  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The significance of the Battle of Kulikovo for the subsequent history of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To overestimate the significance of the Battle of Kulikovo is very difficult.  This is a fundamental event in the history of Ancient Russia.  After the battle on the <span>Kulikovo field,</span> Russia, we can say, moved to a new stage of development, which for it became an era of prosperity. </p><p>  In this article, the subject of research will be <span>the Battle of Kulikovo.</span>  And its importance for the state and for the whole world is difficult to overestimate.  In addition, this historical event had undeniable consequences that influenced the history of Russia. </p><p>  Of course, after the Battle of Kulikovo, Russia did not gain independence from the horde.  But the state gained significant freedom of action.  The complete liberation of Russia from the yoke will occur only in 1480 and will be associated with the name of the great Moscow Prince Ivan III. </p><p>  This article will examine the question of why the Battle of Kulikovo was won?  The significance of this event for the history of the country will also be comprehended. </p><p>  However, why did Russia still win then on the Kulikovo field?  What was the reason for this success? </p><p>  1st place. </p><p>  Many researchers point out that it was the place chosen by the Russian princes and military leaders that played a decisive role in the victory of Russia over the Tatar-Mongols.  It is known for certain that Donskoy traveled all over the place in search of an ideal place for battle.  He chose this field not by chance, but from purely strategic goals.  The Russians arrived at the scene of the battle first, so they took an important and more advantageous position.  The army of Dmitry Donskoy could see everything that was happening on the battlefield.  Tatars could not boast of such luxury.  The fact is that their position was absolutely unprofitable, and the morning fog that covered the field completely complicated the view of the battlefield. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2) The national spirit. </p><p>  Russia has long been weighed by Tatar rule.  Endless requisitions and taxes oppressed the common people.  The Russians went to this battle with special preparation, with particular bitterness, dreaming of a sweet and such a close victory. </p><p>  3) The miscalculations of the Mongols. </p><p>  Opponents were deeply convinced that the tactics and strength of the Mongolian army far exceeded the same indicators of the Russian army.  Annals indicate that the Tatars arrived on the battlefield as if they were winners, completely relaxed and not inclined to impressive resistance. </p><p>  However, the battle of the Russians was won.  What was the significance of the Battle of Kulikovo for history?  We will try to answer this question not only from the position of Russia, but also from the perspective of the yoke, because for the Mongols the Kulikovo battle also had its consequences. </p><p>  The significance of the Battle of Kulikovo for Russia. </p><p>  1) There was a general strengthening of the military spirit of the country.  Finally, Russia could breathe calmly.  Now it was clear to everyone that the Mongols were not invincible, their protection also had its own gaps.  It was an important victory in terms of raising morale. </p><p>  2) After the Battle of Kulikovo, the pressure from the Mongols greatly weakened, which was in the hands of the Russian princes.  Now they could think in detail about a plan to overthrow the yoke. </p><p>  3) The victory on the Kulikovo field showed the world the power and greatness of Russia in terms of military training.  After the Battle of Kulikovo, both England and France began to consider Russia as a serious rival on the world stage. </p><p>  4) Victory in the Kulikovo field was important for the economic, political and social development of the country.  Having been in stagnation over the past few years, Russia finally began to develop at an appropriate pace. </p><p>  The significance of the Battle of Kulikovo for the Mongol-Tatar yoke. </p><p>  1) Only after the Battle of Kulikovo did the Mongol-Tatars begin to perceive Russia as a serious adversary, which should be fought more intensively. </p><p>  2) The defeat worsened the situation within the Mongol-Tatar state itself.  A crisis has long been brewing in the political system of the Mongols; defeat revealed it in all its glory.  Soon the powerful Tokhtamysh will come to power, and only he will be able to take control of the situation in the state. </p><p>  3) The defeat in the Kulikovo field affected the decline in the authority of the Mongols in the international arena.  Soon, many lands controlled by the yoke will also begin to speak out for the overthrow of the invaders. </p><p>  The Battle of Kulikovo is an event of world significance that has influenced not only Russia.  The strategy and <span>military policy of</span> Donskoy influenced the change in the balance of power on the world stage. </p>
