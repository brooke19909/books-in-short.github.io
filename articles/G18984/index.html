About how the collapse of the Roman Empire into Western and Eastern, this article will tell. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  In historical science, it is generally accepted that the Roman Empire arose in 27 BC.  e., when the republican form of government was replaced by the principle, and the first emperor - Octavian Augustus came to power. </p><p>  After a brief heyday, by the 3rd century AD, signs of decline were noticeable.  First of all, this was due to the degradation of the military-political elite.  In the "muddy water" many of its representatives began to "fish", hoping to occupy a higher position.  As a result, the empire began to shake civil and civil wars, as well as the regular raids of the barbarians. </p><p>  To top it all off, the economic situation has worsened.  The Roman Empire was no longer able to wage aggressive wars, providing an influx of gold and slaves.  The peoples who had previously silently paid tribute began to refuse to obey, and Rome no longer had the strength to suppress their performances.  In addition, in Eastern and Central Europe, his legions began to meet the resistance of the ancestors of the ancient Germanic and ancient Slavic tribes.  At the same time, armed Scythians and Sarmatians began to penetrate the territory of the empire.  Many cities in distant provinces were ruined, and Persia posed a serious threat to Rome in the Middle East. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.preteristarchive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Konstantin the First" class="if uuid-2459632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2459632.jpg"></div><h2>  The situation in the Roman Empire itself </h2><p>  Changes have also occurred in the minds of ordinary Romans.  In particular, military service has lost its appeal.  Moreover, the native Romans not only did not want to join the army, but tried not to burden themselves with offspring, preferring to live for pleasure.  Over time, military affairs passed to the barbarians, many of whom subsequently occupied important posts, and some even found themselves on the throne. </p><p>  Unable to equip a sufficient number of legions with his <span>citizens, Rome</span> allowed entire tribes of barbarians to settle in border provinces, as their leaders vowed to defend its borders. </p><h2>  Religious friction </h2><p>  By the period under review, traditional pagan cults had lost their influence and retreated to Christianity.  However, this young religion itself was already divided into several movements, the adherents of which fought among themselves. </p><p>  The emperors understood that their power needed not only the support of the army and people, but also of God or gods.  They had to make a choice between Jupiter, Mithra, which was worshiped by most of the provinces in the Middle East, and Jesus. </p><h2>  The recognition of Christianity as a state religion </h2><p>  According to legend, Constantine the Great, who ruled from 306 to 337, once saw in heaven a cross surrounded by radiance with the inscription: ‚ÄúSim conquer.‚Äù  He ordered this banner to be adorned with the legions that won.  This event made Constantine believe in Christ and the persecution of adherents of this religion stopped in the empire.  In 325, the emperor convened a church council in Nicaea.  It adopted the Nicene Creed.  For the strengthening of faith in the Lord Jesus, Constantine was subsequently recognized as a saint. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the 4th century, Emperor Theodosius recognized the Nicene branch of Christianity as the dominant one.  The persecution of representatives of the old religions, as well as heretical Christian movements began.  The center of distribution of the new cultural and religious ideology was the new capital of the Roman Empire - the city of Constantinople. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fotolibra.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Theodosius the First" class="if uuid-2459637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2459637.jpg"></div><h2>  The situation in the eastern regions of the state </h2><p>  Historians agree that the victory of Christianity was a step towards the salvation of that part of the empire, which later became known as Byzantium.  The new religion had great potential.  She mobilized society and helped strengthen its moral principles, as it considered sinful fornication, gluttony and worship of the Golden Calf.  The church gave comfort to the afflicted and fed the poor.  At the donations of the emperor and nobles, hospitals, strange houses and orphanages were opened.  In other words, the church took over the functions of the social security system. </p><h2>  Augustus and Caesars </h2><p>  Under the predecessor of Constantine the Great, Diocletian, a tetrarchy system was introduced.  She assumed the division of power in the empire between the two rulers, the Augustans, who were assisted by the younger co-regents, Caesars.  This alignment was supposed to prevent the division of the Roman Empire and ensure the continuity of power.  Diocletian wished that in the twentieth year of the reign of Augustus retired, and their place was taken by younger and more energetic Caesars.  The latter had to again choose their junior assistants and teach them the art of government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, soon such a system of change of power led to internecine war.  The winner was Constantine, who restored the power of Rome.  However, already under the sons of this emperor, an internecine war was again unleashed.  It was defeated by Constantius, who was a supporter of Arian Christianity and began to pursue the Nikonians. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rome-accommodation.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arch of Constantine" class="if uuid-2460607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2460607.jpg"></div><h2>  Julian's Apostasy and the Separation of Power </h2><p>  In 361, Constantius died, and Julian ascended the throne of the empire, nicknamed the Apostate by Christians.  He was interested in philosophy and had a good education.  The new emperor was the husband of the sister of the previous emperor and the nephew of Constantine the Great. </p><p>  Julian, whose residence was in the city of Constantinople, announced that from now on his empire would not be persecuted for religious views.  He himself was going to restore paganism on the basis of Neoplatonism, preserving such features of Christianity as charity and piety.  Two years after accession to the throne, Julian died before he could complete his religious reform. </p><p>  In 364, Valentinian ascended the throne of the empire.  At the request of the army, the new emperor approved his brother Valent as co-ruler, sending him to govern the provinces in the East.  Valentine left himself the western part of the empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="78.kidiklik.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roman warriors" class="if uuid-2460619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2460619.jpg"></div><h2>  Theodosius I the Great </h2><p>  In 378, Valens died in the famous Battle of Adrianople.  In August, the young commander Theodosius was approved.  He was transferred under the control of the eastern part of the empire.  This ruler proved himself to be a wise politician and a brave warrior. </p><p>  His diplomatic achievements include the conclusion of an agreement on the separation of spheres of influence with Persia in the long-Christianized Armenia, which at that time was an apple of discord between these great powers. </p><p>  In addition, Theodosius was able to push back the ready for the Danube and settle some Arab tribes in Syria as federates of Rome. </p><h2>  Great internecine war </h2><p>  The division of the Roman Empire into western and eastern parts within one state was originally intended to strengthen its power and facilitate the management of the provinces.  However, in 386, unrest began in Britain.  The soldiers proclaimed the emperor commander Maxim, to whose side the part of the German army also crossed.  August of the western part of the empire - the son of Theodosius Grazian - was killed.  The imperial throne was divided between his half-brother and Maxim.  In 387, the latter sent troops to Italy, deciding to usurp power.  Valentinian turned to Theodosius for help.  Their political union became especially strong after the marriage of the eastern part of the empire in August to their sister Valentinian.  During the war with the "Western" Romans in 388, the army under the command of Theodosius defeated Maxim's army, and he died. </p><p>  However, this did not bring peace to the empire, since Valentinian was killed by his own Commander-in-Chief Arbogast, who seated the governor of the imperial chancellery Eugene on the throne.  In September 394, in the foothills of the Alps, Theodosius defeated the rebel forces.  Eugene was killed, and Arbogast committed suicide. </p><p>  So, for the first time in several centuries, the Roman Empire (the years of existence - from 27 BC to 395 AD) was in the power of one emperor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="byzantium-hellas.blogspot.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Byzantine warriors" class="if uuid-2460633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2460633.jpg"></div><h2>  Division of the Roman Empire </h2><p>  Theodosius the First, nicknamed the Great, single-handedly ruled the state for only a few months.  January 17, 395, the emperor died of dropsy.  It is generally accepted that this day is the date of the division of the Roman Empire.  Before his death, Theodosius bequeathed the western part of the state with the capital of Rome to the youngest son Honorius.  The eastern "Rome" went to his first-born - Flavius ‚Äã‚ÄãArkady.  So began the sunset of the main superpower of antiquity.  From that moment, Rome was never under a single leadership, and the gap between the Western and Eastern empires was only worsened. </p><h2>  The fate of the Eternal City </h2><p>  The division of the Roman Empire accelerated the decline of the former capital of the world. </p><p>  In 401, the Goths, who had chosen Alarich as their leader, moved to Rome.  The city was protected by the guardian of young Honorius, Stilicho.  To defend Rome, he summoned legions from Germany.  Although this made it possible to repel the attack on the city, Germanic tribes, taking advantage of the departure of the legions, broke into Gaul and put its settlements and cities on fire. </p><p>  Four years later, Stilicho again had to defend Rome this time from the forces of Radagais.  However, the merits of this commander were not appreciated by fellow citizens.  Moreover, he was accused of treason and killed.  In 410, Alaric nevertheless took Rome.  This was the first fall of the Eternal City in the last 800 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Theodosius the First" class="if uuid-2460649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2460649.jpg"></div><h2>  Further History of the Western Roman Empire </h2><p>  The invasion of the Huns hastened the end of Rome.  Through Gaul, tribes escaping from nomads began to go.  They swept away everything in their path. </p><p>  The best European diplomat of this period and the brave commander Flavius ‚Äã‚ÄãAetius was able to win the battle in the Catalunian fields in 451 and stop Attila.  However, after 3 years, he was killed by order of Emperor Valentinian. </p><p>  In 455, vandals broke into the Eternal City.  They hardly knew <span>where Constantinople is located</span> on the map and did not even know what impression the Byzantines made about the fall of Rome.  Vandals practically did not leave stone upon stone in the city, destroying everything that came in their way. </p><p>  The Western Roman Empire (years of existence - from 395 to 476) fell informally. </p><p>  It is believed that this happened when the commander Odoacer illegally removed Romulus Augustus from the throne, proclaiming himself king of Italy. </p><h2>  Eastern Roman Empire </h2><p>  After the Eternal City lost its influence, Constantinople on the map of the planet became the most important center of culture, education, as well as the Christian religion. </p><p>  Although the Western Roman Empire was no longer reborn after the fall, the <span>Byzantine Emperor</span> Justinian the First, who ruled from 527 to 565, was able to annex part of its former territory to Byzantium, including North Africa, Sardinia, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, as well as Italy and the South Eastern Spain.  However, under the rule of his successor Justinian II, all these gains were lost.  The next Byzantine emperor Tiberius the First began to pay special attention to the strengthening of borders, thereby closing the question of the restoration of great Rome. </p><p>  After the Slavic, Visigothic, Lombard and Arab conquests, Byzantium began to occupy only the territory of Greece and Asia Minor.  The relative empire gain in the 9th-11th centuries was replaced by the decline caused by the invasions of the Seljuks in the 11th century.  Another blow to Byzantium was the <span>capture of Constantinople</span> in 1204 by the armies of the crusaders.  However, finally East Rome fell only in the middle of the 15th century under the pressure of the Ottoman Turks.  During the defense of Constantinople, the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Paleolog Dragash died.  In the future, the Turks tried to take over the city more than once, and after the construction of the Rumel fortress, its fate was decided.  After a long siege in <span>1453,</span> he fell, becoming the capital of a new state, the great Ottoman Empire.  Constantinople on the world map from March 28, 1930 became Istanbul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="taswestern-studies.wikispaces.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baptism of Constantine" class="if uuid-2460644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2460644.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how the partition of the Roman Empire took place in 395. </p>
