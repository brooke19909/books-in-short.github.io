    <p>  Those who enthusiastically watched the first episode of this tragicomedy will have to look into the recent past and watch Fargo 1. </p><p>  In the second season of the famous tape, the viewer is greeted by Kirsten Darst, Ted Denson, Patrick Wilson.  "Fargo 2" covers the actions and events that take place in the seventies of the 20th century.  More recently, the <span>war in Vietnam</span> died down <span>,</span> hippies and opponents of nuclear energy marched with protests.  Our heroes wear flared, large collars and strive to take their place in the sun.  Patrick Wilson got one of the main roles in the series.  He plays the young Solverston, around which the main intrigue of the series unfolds.  The main place where the events take place is a small town in <span>South Dakota.</span>  And let the word "South" not mislead the viewer - in the entire second part of the series, the action takes place under rather frosty conditions.  All series are generously flavored with blood and indescribable humor of <span>the Cohen brothers.</span>  The series is a breath of air for those who want to enjoy the "black" humor and famously twisted plot.  For participating in the second season, Wilson was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor. </p>
