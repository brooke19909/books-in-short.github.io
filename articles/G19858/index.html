The samples that have survived to this day are unique in their essence - archaeologists discovered items in Egyptian tombs that resemble modern knitwear in the structure of the canvas. </p><p>  A sock with a separately knitted finger, which, presumably, was worn while wearing sandals with a thong through the finger, as well as a children's boot, indicates that in ancient times people mastered the technology of creating products using two sticks and a thread, artfully intertwined with with myself. </p><p>  Later, scientists discovered drawings in which women were wearing knitted jackets.  Greek excavations revealed patterns of men in socks, which are practically no different from those that are still worn. </p><h2>  What is knitting </h2><p>  If the daily routine is tiring and you want to let the fantasy go free swimming, the masters come up with new and new applications for their creative potential and make knitting truly applied, adapting the results of their work in everyday life and everyday life. </p><p>  Knitting skills are not limited to patterns and yarn.  Each needlewoman considers it her duty to benefit from the results of knitting, which are constantly growing and filling the space. </p><p>  The most common are <span>knitwear.</span>  Sweatshirts, skirts, cardigans, hats and scarves - the army of fans of knitted clothes is constantly replenished with new fans. </p><p>  In recent years, knitted accessories have gained popularity again.  Needleworkers create real masterpieces from ordinary threads.  Volumetric backpacks, knitted from natural thread with an extract of nettle or flax, are not inferior in strength to those made by an industrial method.  Angora slippers with acrylic threads added to the fortress are softer and more pleasant than awkward slippers from the market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting Trends </h2><p>  Initially, knitting was considered masculine, and only male occupation.  Now, unfortunately, it is difficult to meet a man who spends time on a long trip in the subway, not with a phone, but with a skein of yarn in his hands.  And even if the representatives of the stronger sex remained with such a hobby, then they rarely speak out loud about him with pride, rather - in a whisper, as about something shameful and indecent. </p><p>  However, modern trends are such that some <span>types of knitting for</span> fragile women are difficult to master. </p><p>  For example, <span>knitting with knitting needles of volume</span> blankets and bedspreads has gained popularity.  To create such paintings, some craftsmen use ordinary PVC pipes.  New knitting techniques are also popular - knitting on the hands, when the hands of the master are used instead of knitting needles, or knitting on the box - subject to a certain pattern of weaving the threads, the fabric fully matches knitting with the front surface. </p><h2>  Pattern selection </h2><p>  Knitters who are not keen on catching up with modern trends and brands are most in demand for patterns for skirts made with needles made in various techniques. </p>

    <p>  Knitted patterns for skirts with knitting needles are completely diverse - openwork, dense, mesh, flounces.  Each needlewoman selects a cut and type of product exclusively for her preferences.  Knitted skirts for women can be large or small.  The choice of pattern is reflected only in the appearance of the finished product.  In general, when we knit a skirt with <span>knitting needles, the pattern</span> should be either a spectacular addition to the selected model, or not focus on ourselves, leaving the palm to the cut and structure of the model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting a classic skirt </h2><p>  To connect a classic straight skirt with a pattern of a pair of crossed rhombuses, you need to prepare materials and disassemble the knitting pattern. </p><p>  To knit a warm product, the pattern of the openwork skirt with knitting needles is performed with yarn containing wool or acrylic.  Strong cotton threads are also good.  The knitting needles should correspond to the yarn in thickness - if you choose a larger size than the recommended one, the fabric will turn out to be more airy and lighter, if you use smaller ones, it will come out tight and stiff. </p><h2>  Getting started on knitting </h2><p>  350 g of yarn, as well as 3,5 knitting needles, are required for work.  The product is knitted with a classic 2 x 2 elastic band pattern.  This is an elastic band whose rapport (rapport is a repetition of a pattern) is 4 loops.  Accordingly, you need to dial an even number of loops, which is divided into 4, + 2 edge.  The pattern is easy to knit - it is necessary to alternate 2 front loops, 2 wrong loops on the front side, and knit on the wrong side as the loops look (if the last loops are 2 front loops, then they will turn out 2 wrong ones on the wrong side, and so on). </p><p>  At the beginning of the work, the number of loops is equal to the waist circumference.  After checking the density of knitting, it is necessary to find out the consumption of yarn and take into account the density of the fabric when knitting the product.  It is worth considering that owners of wide hips will need to make an increase at the hip level several times, and then - several times - decrease.  This is necessary so that the skirt fits well both on the waist and on the hips. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Zigzag skirt </h2><p>  A skirt with a <span>zigzag pattern knitting</span> quickly.  It is necessary to work strictly according to the description of the scheme. </p>

    <p>  <em>1 row.</em>  The alternation of loops is knitted - one front, one wrong side.  The first loop is edge, it is removed without knitting.  The latter is always knitted on the wrong side, regardless of the pattern.  Thus a few centimeters are knitted. </p><p>  <em>2 row.</em>  According to the drawing, it fits like this: where the cross is the wrong side, where the empty cell is the front one. </p><p>  <em>3 row.</em>  Matches strictly according to the scheme. </p><p>  All rows fit in the pattern.  In this scheme, the back rows are also knitted according to the figure, but it is worth remembering that the back row displays loops in a mirror - instead of crosses, you should understand the front loops, and instead of empty cells - the back ones. </p><h2>  How to put a skirt on your hips </h2><p>  In order for the skirt to sit well, it is more convenient to knit it from top to bottom, but from bottom to top.  Work begins in this case with a set of 276 loops.  10 cm of fabric are knitted.  In this case, it is necessary to close the rows in a circle and knit further around the circle. </p><p>  Dividing the skirt‚Äôs canvas visually or using markers into two halves (one is the front part, the other is the back part), 72 rows are knitted according to the pattern and then the loops are reduced.  In order to produce a decrease symmetrically and not to shift the pattern, close 2 loops twice in each second row.  After this, two more loops are closed 12 more times, but now only in every 4th row.  Thus, the next 72 rows are knitted. </p>

    <p>  To complete the skirt, 32 rows of classic elastic are made.  If desired, you can knit 2 times more rows, and sew an elastic band inside the fabric. </p><h2>  Jacquard technique </h2><p>  A variety of patterns for skirts with knitting needles allow you to choose a pattern to your taste.  An interesting option that requires only a little practice is a skirt with a jacquard knitting pattern. </p><p>  Traditionally, jacquard is a Norwegian pattern made in two or more colors using simple geometric shapes.  It fits, most often, along the <span>front surface,</span> using a large number of threads of different colors.  Now traditional bicolor has long been abandoned, so patterns in the jacquard technique are obtained not in monochrome, but in bright and variegated. </p><p>  The jacquard can be tied out with a pull of threads on the wrong side of the fabric, while the pattern is read only on the front side.  There is also a double sided jacquard option.  In this case, the fabric is 2 times denser, since a non-working thread, and if there are not 2, but more, then all of them, is laid in the middle of the loop and picked up when knitting a loop.  In the second case, the master must take this feature into account when acquiring yarn - the constant pulling of the thread makes it involved in knitting in almost the entire fabric and greatly increases not only the density of work, but also the consumption of threads.  In this situation, yarn must be purchased with a margin. </p><p>  Most often, knitting uses motifs containing images of deer, stars, snowflakes.  Combinations of patterns among themselves allow you to create whole paintings in this technique, with a clearly traced motive or a whole story.  Especially popular are sweaters and hats made by <span>Scandinavian patterns.</span> </p><p>  <span>Jacquard patterns</span> for knitting a skirt with knitting needles contain large and small elements that can alternate around a circle or vertically. </p><p>  The most exciting thing about working with jacquard is the ability to combine different patterns and techniques for knitting a skirt.  You can knit braids with needles and supplement them with a jacquard pattern, your own pattern will also decorate the product well, which can be created using simple programs for creating patterns for crocheting embroidery. </p><h2>  Skirt for women </h2><p>  Many patterns for knitting skirts with a description are presented on the Internet.  Learning to read them is easy. </p>

    <p>  For example, to tie a beautiful and stylish women's skirt, you need to take 250 gr.  section dyeing yarn (Kauni is good), 100 gr.  plain black yarn, as well as 50 gr.  plain white yarn.  With a knitting density of 26.5 loops in 35 rows, knitting needles are recommended for yarn. </p><p>  Knitting goes in a circle from top to bottom.  Having collected 200 loops, they knit 3 cm with the front stitch, then 1 wrong side and again 3 cm with stitch.  According to the scheme, alternating threads, knit the product until the skirt reaches the desired length.  Complete the work with 3 rows of gum. </p><h2>  Skirt for girls with a jacquard pattern </h2><p>  To determine the pattern, you need to decide who the product will be connected to.  Knitting patterns for children's skirts are not very different from adults.  Most often, these are the same elements, but made larger. </p>

    <p>  Children's skirts are even easier to knit than adults.  Due to the structural features of the figure, most often there is no need to make additions and decreases in the course of work.  Starting to knit a straight skirt, as a result, the master receives a product slightly flared down. </p><p>  To choose a pattern for a skirt with knitting needles for girls, you must first focus on the preferences of the future model.  Often girls choose snowflakes or hearts that emphasize their tender and youthful femininity. </p><h2>  Knit Skirt Patterns </h2><p>  Knitting patterns for skirts are divided into two main categories - dense, which are well suited for knitting dense, opaque products for the cold season, and openwork, which are good for summer or spring. </p><p>  Depending on the choice, patterns for skirts with knitting needles are knitted from thin yarn or from dense.  It is worth remembering that for children it is better to use light, funny patterns - Christmas trees, zigzags.  When choosing a pattern for a skirt with knitting needles for women, it is better to opt for textured options that are successfully combined with both jackets and elegant blouses or sweaters.  Voluminous skirts with light or deliberately large patterns are suitable for young girls. </p><h2>  Description of openwork skirt with knitting needles </h2><p>  The skirt is made of two halves symmetrical to each other, and then the product is assembled. </p><p>  For the back: you need to dial 120 stitches on the knitting needles and knit with a pattern.  In order for the drawstring to appear, at a height of 60 cm from the first set of rows, knitting continues with facial smoothness.  By tying 2 cm, the loops close. </p>

    <p>  The front fits in the same way as the back. </p><p>  To assemble the product, side seams are carried out with a knitted seam, 25 cm are not sewn to the bottom of the product. The upper part is bent and hemmed, the elastic is threaded.  After that, the bottom of the product is completed - it is also bent and hemmed. </p><h2>  Pattern Description </h2><p>  <em>1 row.</em>  The front loop, 2 together with the front with an inclination to the left, the crochet (in the wrong row it is tied with the wrong side), 3 front ones.  Repeat knitting to the end of the row. </p><p>  <em>3 row.</em>  Knit according to the drawing, where the crochet is knitted on the wrong side. </p><p>  <em>2 row.</em>  Knitting follows the same pattern as the first row, but with an offset of one loop: 2 front loops, 2 together front with a tilt to the left, yarn, 3 front loops.  Repeat until the end of the row. </p><p>  <em>4 row.</em>  Knitted according to the drawing. </p><p>  <em>5 row.</em>  Again there is a shift by 1 loop: 3 front loops, 2 together front with a tilt to the left, yarn, 3 front loops.  Repeat until the end of the row. </p><p>  <em>6 row.</em>  How the loops look. </p><p>  <em>7 row.</em>  4 front loops, 2 together front with an inclination to the left, yarn, 3 front loops.  Repeat until the end of the row. </p><p>  <em>8 row.</em>  According to the drawing. </p><p>  <em>9 row.</em>  The scheme has shifted, now the first were 2 together, tied to the front with an inclination to the left.  Further - according to the scheme - yarn, 3 front loops, 2 along with the slope, yarn, h front.  Repeat until the end of the row. </p><p>  Any patterns for knitting a skirt with knitting needles are perfect for both everyday outfits and evening dresses. </p><p>  You can use any openwork pattern - the designations are always standard and easy to read - a vertical stick is a front loop, a circle or an arc is a crochet, a stick with a slope is two loops knitted together with a slope left or right, as shown in the diagram. </p>
