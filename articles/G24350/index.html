Convenient location of the resort contributes to popularity - it is located on the shores of the bay of the same name.  Nearby is a clear sea and beautiful nature, as well as an indescribable atmosphere, which Koktebel has always been famous for.  In the village there are many holidays, festivals, but besides them you can find entertainment for every taste.  Directly above the village, as an eternal guard of the peace of residents and guests, an extinct volcano Karadag rises, attracting tourists with its severe view. </p><p>  Where to settle, everyone chooses according to his concept of rest: some settle away from the noise, others, on the contrary, closer to the center of the village, where life boils and boils round the clock.  In the center there are many hotels where you can always book a room.  One of them is boarding house ‚ÄúVolna‚Äù.  Crimea abounds with such small establishments intended for couples with children. </p><h2>  Facility Features </h2>

The Volna pension is also of interest to consumers in this regard: reviews from tourists are the most accurate indicator of living comfort and quality of service.  Those who stayed here left a lot of reviews on the Web.  They emphasize: </p><ol><li>  Check-in and check-out are no problem. </li><li>  All equipment in the room is working properly. </li><li>  High quality food in the cafe. </li><li>  The area is clean and often cleaned. </li><li>  The staff is attentive and friendly. </li></ol><p>  There are, of course, comments, suggestions.  Many would like to have lighting on their balconies so that they can sit as a family late in the evening.  There were complaints about too calm life in the institution and the lack of recreational activities on its territory.  But "Wave" is a boarding house.  The reviews, apparently, were left by people quite young: they are best off choosing a hotel where more time and attention is paid to entertainment programs. </p>
