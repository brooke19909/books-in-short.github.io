    <p>  The appearance of the G4s is similar to its predecessor, with the exception of small details.  For starters, the <span>LG G4s has</span> become slightly smaller, and the material of the device has also changed.  In a simplified version of the flagship, plastic is used, not leather. </p><p>  Changes almost did not affect the style of the device.  The design is very unusual and definitely stands out among the same mass.  The arched shape attracts the eye and gives the smartphone elegance. </p><p>  An interesting solution was the location of the controls.  <span>The volume control</span> along with the power button are not on the side, but on the back of the device.  At first, working with them will be unusual, but the location is very convenient. </p><p>  The shape of the case adds convenience when using the phone.  Although the size of the device is impressive, in his hand he lies like a glove.  Adds comfort and light weight, only 139 grams. </p><p>  External details turned out very catchy due to its unusual location.  On the front part there is a display, front camera, sensors, speaker, as well as an indicator.  The upper part is reserved for the headset jack, and the lower part is for the USB connector.  In addition, both ends have a microphone.  The back side has become a haven for the camera, flash, volume control, power button, speaker, logo and autofocus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Smartphone LG G4s received three colors.  Not without standard white, but added a variety of gray and gold colors.  It is worth noting that the front in all colors is black. </p><p>  The back panel of the device is removable.  Behind her are two card slots.  Unfortunately, the user is presented with the choice to sacrifice one SIM card in favor of a flash drive or refuse to expand the memory.  Although, given the small amount of device memory, the owner will have to be content with one communication card. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Smartphone LG G4s has an excellent screen.  The diagonal was slightly reduced from 5.5 to 5.2 inches, but it is almost imperceptible.  The large display has a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels and 423 ppi.  The user, even with a detailed study, will not find any flaws.  Actually, the Full HD image is already an indicator of quality. </p><p>  The matrix installed in the LG G4s will also please.  The color rendering characteristics of the display are not satisfactory.  The only drawback is the lack of a brightness sensor.  The owner will be forced to configure this parameter manually.  Despite such a trifle, in the sun the screen of the device does not fade.  The matrix provides an excellent <span>angle overview</span> for the <span>LG G4s</span> , although it was not expected otherwise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  As for the images, the predecessor significantly surpassed the LG G4s.  Characteristics have changed very noticeably, namely, instead of 16 megapixels came only 8 megapixels.  Surprisingly, the camera allows you to take good photos, but it falls short of the prototype. </p><p>  Resolution is pretty familiar for 8 megapixels and is only 3264 by 2448 pixels.  Smoothes out the many functions left over from the LG G4.  For example, the device has improved color rendering and color spectrum recognition. </p><p>  The device got five megapixels of the front camera.  Of course, you should not expect much from the front camera, but it will do for self-portraits.  In good lighting, you can achieve good quality images. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the "filling" will delight owners of the LG G4s.  The processor specifications are similar to some Samsung representatives, namely the A7 model.  The smartphone received a Snapdragon 615 chip that provides high performance.  In addition, as many as eight cores were installed in the device, four of which have a frequency of 1.8 GHz, and the rest received 1 GHz. </p><p>  The RAM, which has 1.5 gigabytes in the device, did not fail.  There is enough memory for most of the needs of the device.  Adreno 405 was installed as a video accelerator, designed specifically for devices that have Full HD. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there are also flaws in the LG G4s.  The characteristics of the native memory definitely do not meet the needs of most users.  The phone was equipped with only 8 GB, and in fact only 5 GB is available.  Naturally, there is the possibility of expanding to 32 GB, but there is a problem.  The smartphone has only two slots designed for either a SIM card or a flash drive. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The phone is controlled by the Android version 5.1.  Actually, the owner does not need to worry about updating.  In addition, the smartphone has almost all the necessary applications for work.  Most features of the system are hidden behind the proprietary shell, but the manufacturer‚Äôs interface is also quite pleasant. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Manufacturers pay a lot of attention to the design and functionality of the devices, but sometimes they forget about the duration of the work.  This happened with the LG G4s, in which they placed a battery with a capacity of only 2300 maH. </p><p>  The autonomy of the device is depressing, because with active use the device will last only 4 hours.  This is an incredibly poor indicator for the representative of the middle class.  The only solution is to replace the battery. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The delivery set is standard.  Along with the device is a USB cable, documentation, adapter.  As with most expensive devices, there is no headset.  Perhaps, in addition to headphones, the user will need to buy a case for LG G4s. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  Although the G4s was produced as a cheap analogue of the flagship, the cost was impressive.  You can become the owner of the device for 18 thousand rubles.  In principle, it‚Äôs not a particularly frightening price for the middle class with excellent ‚Äústuffing‚Äù. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  For some owners, the problem was the unusual placement of controls.  Instead of the familiar sidewall, the power and volume buttons are located behind the device.  It‚Äôs quite difficult to get used to such a change. </p><p>  After reviewing the review compiled for the LG G4s, you can see that the phone is incredibly dependent on the outlet.  The small battery size is not at all suitable for such an advanced device. </p><p>  An unpleasant moment was the need to choose between a flash drive or a second SIM card.  This is especially strange to observe in the apparatus of the middle category. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2>

    <p>  A smartphone has significantly more advantages than disadvantages.  You should start with a powerful "filling."  The only thing that fails is the memory, but otherwise everything is on top. </p><p>  It is impossible not to mention a solid screen.  Large diagonal and high resolution will allow the user to enjoy the image. </p><p>  Stand out also modern "Android".  The new version 5.1 greatly expands the selection of games as well as applications. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  In general, the budget version of the flagship was fully implemented.  There are minor flaws, but they are insignificant.  Only the constant need for recharging upsets.  It is clear that among the competitors, the LG G4s looks incredibly attractive. </p>
