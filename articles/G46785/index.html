    <h2>  Facts from the development of the city </h2><p>  The city of Cesis (Latvia) was founded in 1206.  It is one of the three most ancient settlements of the country.  Starting from the IV century, there is information about people living in the area.  During the existence of Livonia, the city received its fastest development.  The status of the city was assigned to Cesis in 1323.  There is a theory that it was here that the <span>flag of Latvia</span> was developed <span>.</span> </p><p>  Since the end of the 19th century, Cesis is known as a cultural center, a center of relaxation and art.  Even in our time at the state level, it is considered the most important center of art and culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cesis Latvia sights" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1344902.jpg" width="450"></div>

The most chic among them was the castle park (Pils Park) in Cesis.  Local people like to relax here.  The park began to emerge in 1812 and then it belonged to Count K. Sievers.  By 1841, this lady landscaped the park to the end.  The place where the square was broken was a swampy lowland.  But the count managed to create a landscape park of a romantic nature.  And in the middle of the object he placed a pond and an island.  At the end of the XIX century, Pils Park was planted with flowers, excellent flowering bushes, equipped with benches, pavilions and gazebos. </p><p>  Castle Park (Latvia, Cesis) was rebuilt several times throughout its existence.  Today, its total area reaches almost seven hectares.  Every summer, concerts are held on the stage under open skies, which are attended by people from all over the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cesis city Latvia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1344899.jpg" width="563"></div>

    <h2>  Newest square </h2><p>  Latvia (Cesis), in addition to ancient sights, also has new, modern facilities.  These include Unity Square ("Vienibas"), which is an important part of the village.  This place was equipped at the beginning of the last century and was called the Convention Square.  In 1925 it was renamed Victory Square to honor the soldiers who died for the liberation of Latvia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the late 1930s, the object gained a modern layout.  Today Unity Square is open to vehicles.  It is surrounded by hotels, banks, cafes and other important buildings.  It is also often used for various events, for example, for parades, City Day celebrations and other celebrations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mr. Cesis Latvia" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1344901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Order Castle </h2><p>  Staying in the city, you must definitely go to the Cesis castle (Latvia).  Venden Castle is the largest castle that has survived in Latvia to the present day.  Under the canopy of this order fortress, the current city of Cesis has arisen.  The castle, together with the pre-castle buildings, forms the historical part of the village. </p><p>  The attraction was built around 1220.  But she was rebuilt many times.  So, only the remains of the one-nave chapel located in the eastern part of the fortress were saved from the original structure. </p><p>  The troops of Ivan the Terrible partially destroyed the facility during the Livonian War.  At the beginning of the XVIII century it was abandoned altogether.  But a little later, in the pre-castle part, the tower of Ladamacher was built, near which the New Castle was built, which is a two-story palace with an attic roof.  In the middle of the twentieth century, restoration work and archaeological excavations were carried out in the castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to castle Cesis Latvia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1344900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Exhibition Hall in Cesis </h2><p>  The modern building of the Exhibition Hall in Cesis (Latvia) used to serve as a stable and Carriage Yard.  The stable was intended for the master's horses, as well as for the horses of the guests of the tavern.  The carriage kept the carriages and wheels for them.  At the beginning of the last century, the building was converted into garages and a warehouse.  Upon completion of the reconstruction in 1985, the current Exhibition Hall is located there. </p><p>  The attraction is characterized by a difficult architectural solution.  The interior is located on two floors.  They are expressive rooms built of wooden structures.  Such premises are ideal for exhibitions.  And due to the fact that excellent acoustics are provided in the premises, concerts can be arranged in them.  The exhibition hall is involved in the cultural life of not only Cesis, but the whole planet. </p><h2>  Beer city </h2><p>  Cesis (Latvia), the sights of which are described in our article, is famous for the fact that since 1590 beer has been produced here - the national drink of Latvians.  Cƒìsu alus was founded in the same year.  For more than four hundred years, many brewers worked in the city.  They kept the secrets of making a foamy drink, and passed their recipes from generation to generation. </p><p>  In 1878, the old Alus br≈´zis brewery, owned by Count Emanuel Sievers, was erected.  Today, this brewery is a modern exhibition center, where in the month of August various art exhibitions are held annually.  The brewing tradition in the Latvian Cesis continues to this day.  And in the center of the village there is a new brewery. </p>
