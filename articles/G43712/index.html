    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The four-star hotel in question is a few meters from Ham Tuan Nam Beach.  In just 10 minutes, guests can walk to a local attraction - Ke Ga Lighthouse.  Ocean Dunes Golf Club is a 20-minute drive away.  In the vicinity of the hotel, according to tourists, there is no special infrastructure.  For all the entertainment you need to go to Mui Ne or Phan Thiet.  The hotel provides a free shuttle service twice a day.  Also, you can always go to the place of interest to you by public transport (bus) or taxi.  Many travelers, however, prefer to rent a motorbike.  In this case, you will be able to freely move around all the surrounding areas.  In addition, if you plan to travel a lot, renting a scooter will cost you much less than taxis and buses.  As for the distance from the airport, the journey from it takes about eight hours.  According to travelers, this fact is the only serious drawback of Saigon Suoi Nhum Resort 4 * (Phan Thiet).  Although tourists who want to spend a relaxing vacation away from the noise of big cities, this fact is not particularly embarrassing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="saigon suoi nhum resort 4 phan thiet" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1154092.jpg" width="600"></div>
