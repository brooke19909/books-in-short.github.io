Some want to start their own business, others trust bank deposits, others invest in cryptocurrencies.  However, there is a safer and more effective method of investing - an individual investment account.  Consider its features, advantages and disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to open iis" class="if uuid-2940855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940855.jpg"></div><p>  It will tell you how to open IIS and where to do it better. </p><h2>  What is and how does it work? </h2><p>  IMS is understood as a type of brokerage account with a reward from the state for long-term deposits.  If the deposit remains open for three years, you can get from it a 13% tax deduction or 52,000 rubles in cash. </p><p>  The idea is quite simple.  The investor has a certain amount of money.  He does not want to own his own business; instead, he wants to engage in trade.  Acquires valuable assets, waits for them to rise in price.  After some time, the market value rises, and the investor can make a profit. </p><p>  People often ask where it is better to open IIS.  A comparison of brokers will be given below. </p><h2>  Promotion of the state: what are the benefits? </h2><p>  Understanding people immediately have a question: why such actions are encouraged by the state, and it exempts from tax payments - its main income?  But in fact, both parties benefit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Large finances revolve in the state, but they are held by individuals, and the country cannot legally dispose of them.  If rubles are not included in circulation, they will soon lose their value due to inflation. </p><h2>  The solution of economic problems </h2><p>  For this reason, ISS makes it possible to simultaneously solve many economic problems: </p><ul><li>  help the economy grow through the influx of new funds; </li><li>  teach citizens how to manage money and invest rationally; </li><li>  increase demand for domestic rubles, futures, stocks, etc .; </li><li>  open civil income for tax inspection. </li></ul><p>  Both parties remain in a favorable position: </p><ul><li>  the country receives an influx of new financial resources; </li><li>  the investor learns to increase his own savings, is actively involved in the financial world. </li></ul><p>  Why is it worth opening an <span>IMS (individual investment account)?</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="financeandmarkets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open IS through public services" class="if uuid-2940854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940854.jpg"></div><h2>  Deduction Methods </h2><p>  There are only two ways to get your benefits: </p><ul><li>  Salary deductible account.  It is necessary to provide information on the payment of 13% tax on official salaries, then personal income tax returns up to 52,000 rubles.  The maximum investment amount is no more than a million per year. </li><li>  Account with a deduction on income.  When the deposit is closed, it is not necessary to pay 13% to the total treasury.  Thus, at the end of the term, all income is withdrawn, without the payment of personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  The amount of money earned in the future depends on the right choice.  Therefore, it is advisable to obtain the advice of a brokerage specialist before concluding an agreement.  He will analyze the official salary, profitable strategies, risks, and based on this information he will advise you to choose one or another way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All brokerage companies have the opportunity to provide advice free of charge. </p><p>  Let‚Äôs figure out whether to open IIS? </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages, is it worth discovering? </h2><p>  In the financial sector, the rule applies: the risk of burnout is greater, the higher the profit.  In banks, a very low percentage due to increased reliability, the state and the insurance company additionally guarantee payment obligations: </p><ul><li>  Return personal income tax.  The country encourages the purchase of its securities, the investor is exempt from tax.  13% are extremely important, thanks to them you can return a large part of the profit. </li><li>  The potential profit every year up to 50%.  The increase in the amount is largely determined by the choice of securities.  Just the same, investors are counting on their growth.  If you choose the asset correctly, then within six months you can withdraw without problems 15%.  When trading without any particular risks, on average for the year they receive plus 12% of the investments made initially. </li><li>  More profitable bank conditions.  Banks offer customers deposits at 6-7% per annum.  A positive return on risk-free manipulations with assets is on average 12%, a tax deduction is also added to this (approximately 3.5% of the total amount), and 15% is deducted by net profit. </li><li>  Free choice of assets.  Each stock exchange player has an independent choice in which projects to invest in and at what time to close the deal.  Active players and professionals consider this an important aspect.  Thanks to constant observation, you can open or close positions at any convenient moment, and therefore you can always stay in the black. </li><li>  Reliable debt to the country.  The banking sector, as you know, is one of the most favorite places for thieves and scammers.  A bank can often close, go bankrupt.  And almost all the savings burn with him.  The state prints money itself, and therefore it easily repays the debt to the depositor. </li><li>  The percentage surpasses inflation.  For 2018, inflation in Russia is planned at about 4.5%, the maximum value is up to 6%.  In bank deposits, after a year of investment, the amounts practically do not increase, losing their value.  Income from investments not only allows you to cover the depreciation, but also brings at least another 7% profit. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open an individual investment account" class="if uuid-2940858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940858.jpg"></div><p>  However, this type of investment also has characteristic disadvantages.  There are only three of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Exchange risk.  Even if the idea seems very promising, assets can become cheaper due to the influence of a large number of factors.  However, here the risk can be compensated by trusting professionals and analyzing the market situation. </li><li>  Long term.  To get benefits, you do not need to use your investments for 36 months. </li><li>  Payment intermediary.  This drawback applies only to active players.  With a fairly frequent reinvestment, the exchange will take its minimum interest from each bet - 0.017.  These little things with frequent transactions are transformed into a significant loss. </li></ul><p>  If we compare the positive and negative sides, we can conclude that giving money to the state on loan is more profitable than entrusting it to the bank system. </p><h2>  Comparison of brokers, recommendations </h2><p>  Finances can be invested independently through exchange intermediaries, or you can entrust this to the decisions of the management company.  Accordingly, a trader, when trading on his own behalf, has the right to choose a broker himself. </p><p>  If a person has never been involved in trade before, it is recommended to transfer finances to trusted management.  When a person wants to try himself as an individual investor, he must choose a broker and learn how to analyze deposits. </p><p>  Where is better to open an IIS account?  With a more detailed analysis, it is clear that almost every bank provides opportunities for customers to invest.  That is why, when you have to choose an intermediary, you need to pay attention to such criteria: </p><ul><li>  financial statements; </li><li>  experience; </li><li>  the proposed package of services (consultations, tools, analyzers, etc.); </li><li>  trading volume; </li><li>  interest. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs easiest to open an IIS in a bank, for example, in Sberbank and VTB.  They do not offer such favorable conditions, however, you can conclude an agreement or seek help in almost every city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.bankbazaar.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open a broker account" class="if uuid-2940856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940856.jpg"></div><p>  List of possible brokers: </p><ul><li>  "Opening".  The intermediary, according to 2017, is the leader in turnover in the domestic market.  In addition, they provide a large number of services, ideas and tariffs to their customers. </li><li>  "BCS".  Russian national broker.  It has been operating since 1995, the highest degree of reliability is AAA.  A lot of trading tools, low interest rates and advantageous offers are the main areas of work of BCS. </li><li>  Finam.  It has been operating since 1994.  Provides assistance in the preparation of documentation, professional advice and most importantly - guarantees with trust management per year 16%.  On their website you can also find a large number of additional services such as consultations, automated trading, trust management, training, etc. </li></ul><p>  So how to open IIS online? </p><h2>  Opening online: a step-by-step description, methods </h2><p>  You must complete the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Make a choice of a stock exchange for further cooperation. </li><li>  To write an application. </li><li>  Conclude an agreement. </li><li>  Fill up a purse. </li></ol><p>  Next, we will consider how the statement is made, an agreement is concluded on the example of VTB, Sberbank, online companies (Zerich, Finam, BCS, etc.).  Not everyone knows where it is better to open IIS.  Comparison of brokers will help to figure this out. </p><h2>  Opening an account with Sberbank </h2><p>  First you need to find the nearest branch of Sberbank.  To this end, you can familiarize yourself with the city map or call the numbers indicated on the official website.  They will answer which department to apply to and which documents to take with you.  Then, on-site specialists will arrange everything on their own. </p><p>  To conclude an agreement, you need to bring your TIN, passport. </p><p>  After visiting the branch, a login and password will be issued into your hands, by which the client is authorized on the bank‚Äôs official website.  Using a browser, you can monitor your assets and control expenses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="writready.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open an individual investment" class="if uuid-2940860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940860.jpg"></div><h2>  Open IIS through Government Services </h2><p>  The department is not always convenient to contact.  In this case, you need to resort to the "State Services" portal.  First you need to register an account on the site and confirm it.  Using the portal, it is possible to work with the following companies: BCS, Finnam, Zerich, Otkritie. </p><p>  Go to the website of the exchange agent, for example, ‚ÄúBCS‚Äù, and fill out their application form, indicating the TIN number, passports and mailing address in it.  Then the necessary contacts about cooperation come to e-mail.  They are signed by the investor with a code from the SMS confirmation. </p><p>  How to open an <span>individual investment account of IIS</span> at VTB? </p><h2>  Opening an account with VTB </h2><p>  Actions with VTB are similar to Sberbank.  You need to find the nearest branch, apply.  However, in online mode it is impossible to do such operations.  After signing the agreement, the new wallet is replenished.  Then the assets are selected and the trade begins. </p><h2>  Return personal income tax </h2><p>  Getting personal income tax has a very simple algorithm: </p><ul><li>  Collection of documentation.  We need a certificate of availability of an IIS at the exchange, a certificate of 2-NDFL, a 3-NDFL declaration in full, a passport.  All this is drawn up at the tax office. </li><li>  The application is submitted to the tax.  This can be done at the city office or with the help of a personal taxpayer account. </li><li>  Verification response pending.  This usually takes about two weeks.  The check sometimes lasts about two months. </li><li>  Paid funds are returned.  After the audit, the taxpayer receives the money. </li></ul><p>  If you need to receive a deduction on income: </p><ul><li>  You need to apply for tax help.  It indicates that for three years a person has not used a tax deduction. </li><li>  Information is provided to the exchange agent.  He then transfers the funds to the client's deposit without withholding personal income tax. </li></ul><p>  Brokers most often help and independently carry out all the actions.  Thanks to this, you can avoid various errors, as well as save time. </p><p>  Where to open IIS is now clear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog-dev.wealthvenue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where better to open brokers comparison" class="if uuid-2940859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940859.jpg"></div><h2>  The main difference between IMS and deposits in the bank </h2><p>  The main difference is exemption from tax payments.  In addition, the authority to which the funds are trusted is different.  When it comes to investments, finances are transferred to public use.  More precisely, they are invested in the country's economy, government bonds are acquired. </p><h2>  Tips for novice investors </h2><p>  Before opening an IIS brokerage account, you first need to calculate the benefits and possible risks. </p><p>  You cannot trust only articles on the Internet.  The financial world is changing very quickly, and it is better to double-check all the risks in person.  If a person doubts his skills, it is better to consult a specialist.  It is much more profitable to give him 10,000 rubles for a forecast and analysis than to invest and then lose money due to hasty conclusions. </p><p>  All major investors have connections with financiers, advise before operations.  That is why wealthy people remain safe finances. </p><p>  No need to chase a large percentage, all risks should be controlled. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.benzinga.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open iis in the bank" class="if uuid-2940857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2940857.jpg"></div><h2>  Aggressive strategies are not needed </h2><p>  It is not recommended to use aggressive strategies at first, as they involve a high probability of losing all savings.  It is better to use them already with the accumulation of experience and the ability to carefully analyze the situation on the market.  You need to replenish immediately with a minimum deposit.  36 months are calculated immediately after replenishment of the client‚Äôs account for the minimum amount.  That is why it is better to throw money right away and then supplement it gradually as far as possible. </p><p>  We told how to open IIS. </p>
