Why was collectivization accompanied by dispossession?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dekulakization and collectivization have long been recognized as the bloody pages of Soviet history.  It was the real war that the USSR government declared to the class of small "exploiters."  During the repressions caused by dispossession, an incredible number of people suffered - more than two million ordinary peasants were deported, more than six thousand died of hunger, hundreds of thousands died in exile.  The bloody violence perpetrated against the peasants is a decisive step in the <span>Stalinist terror.</span> </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  But why was collectivization accompanied by <span>dispossession?</span>  <span>This</span> is due to the fact that Stalin sought to get rid of the stratum of society, which could rise to fight against him, to overthrow the dictator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why collectivization was accompanied by dispossession" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/397473.jpg" width="402"></div>  The ruler's plans included collectivization in 1930 in the North Caucasus, the Middle and Lower Volga.  Later, several more agricultural regions producing grain were to join this process.  Stalin announced that he intended to completely eliminate the kulaks as a class in December 1929.

    <h2>  Fist categories </h2><p>  The dispossession was entrusted to a specially organized commission of the Politburo, which created a classification of representatives of the kulak class.  The first, most dangerous category included people participating in counter-revolutionary activities.  They were going to be arrested, then sent to <span>correctional labor,</span> and in case of disobedience - to be shot.  Families of fists of this category were expelled, and things were confiscated.  This was the strongest class capable of fighting, that is why the policy of collectivization was accompanied by dispossession, these peasants needed to be eliminated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The commission classified the kulaks in the second category, who, although they were not directly related to counter-revolutionary actions, exploited other people's labor.  Representatives of this group were arrested and sent into exile with their families in distant regions of the country.  The third category included kulaks who did not oppose the Stalinist regime.  They, together with their families, were evicted from their places of residence and sent to new territories not related to collectivization. </p><h2>  Operation </h2><p>  In each separate district commissions and brigades were created that were directly involved in the process of dispossession.  This was a terrible and cruel sight: those who were considered objectionable were simply robbed and sent into exile to avoid any kind of uprisings and protests, which is why collectivization was accompanied by dispossession. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the policy of collectivization was accompanied by dispossession" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/397476.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The district brigade came to the homes of these peasants, removed all their clothes from them, first of all taking away shoes.  These groups could and should have confiscated all the property of the kulaks, including tea, jugs and pillows.  Even the icons were taken from the victims, they were smashed and thrown away. </p><p>  Representatives of the brigades left the selected property to themselves or sold to their colleagues in the workshop - the same dispossession teams.  Members of this group had absolutely unlimited powers.  The definition of a person objectionable at this time was very often due to the reduction of personal accounts. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dispossession and collectivization" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/397474.jpg?1400212478787" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The government sought to avoid any potential danger and eliminate all possible rebels in order to create conditions in which there would be no one to overthrow the government, which is why collectivization was accompanied by dispossession. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The history of <span>Stalinist repressions</span> will forever be captured in centuries as a bloody, terrible period.  Joseph Vissarionovich tried to protect himself even from potential threats, and this led only to an incredible number of deaths and to the fact that he will forever remain one of the most cruel dictators of world history.  And the answer to the question of why collectivization was accompanied by dispossession was very simple: Stalin did not need people capable of fighting, and he got rid of them. </p>
