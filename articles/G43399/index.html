For a long time it was only a theoretical argument, practically nothing confirmed.  However, in recent years, scientists have actually been able to detect, in more or less detail, as much as possible, describe this <span>celestial body.</span>  In general, officially, the planets in our system are still the same 9. Nevertheless, in the very near future, it is quite possible that a new body will also appear in all educational literature.  Naturally, provided that scientists can agree and come to a common opinion on this issue. </p><h2>  Solar system structure </h2><p>  For many years it was believed that in our system there are only 9 planets.  Basically, such an opinion arose only because the available tracking equipment was not enough to study the most distant outskirts.  Nevertheless, technology is constantly evolving, and humanity begins to receive more and more new data, among which there is information that in fact there is the 10th planet of the solar system.  Despite the availability of confirmed data, disputes do not subside to this day.  Some scientists do not agree that this cosmic body is truly a planet.  It‚Äôs too small, and with a certain strain of fantasy, it is quite capable of being just too big an asteroid.  In any case, no one refuses from the fact that something like this really exists.  The only question that remains open is exactly what the name of the 10th planet of the solar system will be.  But provided that it really will be assigned to this category, and will not be considered a kind of planetoid or something else, different from the more familiar to most people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  UB313, or 10 planet of the solar system </h2><p>  Naturally, the <span>cosmic body</span> cannot remain anonymous by definition.  In practice, all newfound objects of this type are given designations of numbers and letters, which make it possible to better navigate and not explain for a very long time, which is specifically discussed.  Officially, the tenth planet of the solar system is called UB313, but it also has an unofficial nickname - Xena.  It should be noted that there are several such names in the open cosmic body, and so far not one has settled down completely.  Most often, a designation consisting of numbers and letters is used. </p>

    <h2>  Detection </h2><p>  In fact, the first data appeared back in 2003, when the remaining planets of the solar system were studied.  10 the planet was not originally considered in this form.  Then it was considered that this is some strange object with an incomprehensible trajectory, size and so on.  To clarify the data, further study was required, but it also became impossible, because immediately after the discovery of the planet disappeared from sight for a very long time.  In 2005, new data came - just then it turned out to once again find this object.  Nobody was thinking about the name of the 10th planet of the solar system.  Despite all the available information, they could only say something about this celestial body quite recently, when no one already had any doubts about the existence of this object.  They discovered the planet with a telescope located in Hawaii, the equipment of Samuel Oshchina, with the help of Professor David Rabinovich, Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo.  All these people in one way or another helped in the search and deserve to have their names sealed in history.  Many astronomers, both amateurs and professionals, note that this is the first major discovery since 1846, when Neptune was found. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Planet parameters </h2><p>  10 the planet of the solar system in size slightly exceeds Pluto.  Approximately 700 kilometers.  The total diameter is approximately 3 thousand kilometers.  The most interesting thing here is exactly where this object is located.  It used to be that Pluto was the most distant celestial body from a star.  But this planet, Xenia, or UB313, is just twice as far.  That is, Pluto has lost its status as the most distant of large objects.  Judging by some reports, Xena is a rocky planet, incorporating various rocks, as well as ice.  There is a theory that such a position of a space object is due to the gravitational influence of Neptune.  Recently, another very interesting information has appeared.  It turns out that the 10th planet of the solar system in structure and surface features is very similar to Pluto.  This provides food for numerous theories about how a given celestial body was formed. </p>

    <h2>  Movement speed </h2><p>  One of the main problems on which information about this object has been collected for so long is its speed.  It is known that all the planets of the solar system move.  10 planet in this regard is no exception.  But the speed of its movement in space is so insignificant that for a very long time no one could accurately predict and calculate exactly where it will be in the next moment.  As soon as we were able to deal with this issue, new data immediately began to appear.  In general, no one knows the exact trajectory of the planet yet, but it's just a matter of time.  To understand exactly how the object will move, you need to detect its position in as many points as possible.  Prior to this, one can only take into account theoretical calculations. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the outskirts of our system </h2><p>  Now that the questions about whether there are 10 planets in the solar system can be considered closed, scientists turned their eyes to the remote outskirts of space.  It is believed that beyond the orbit of UB313 there are many more such bodies, the size of which can vary over a fairly wide range.  It is known that on the outskirts of the system there are a huge number of asteroids.  Among them, the most unusual and unexpected cosmic bodies may well be hiding.  Unfortunately, until mankind has evolved to normally fly to distant borders or to study them in detail remotely, nothing will be said for sure. </p>

    <h2>  Theory of Nubiru </h2><p>  The fact that some kind of similar object exists has been known for a very long time.  One of the theories says that this planet is called Nubiru, and not everything is so simple with it.  Indirect references to various features and incomprehensible moments in the history of mankind clearly indicate the direct influence of the inhabitants of this celestial body on our planet.  It is believed that the population of this facility is much more developed than humanity.  Naturally, they do not have a question about which 10 planet of the solar system.  They live on it.  Scientists are skeptical of the idea for so many reasons, but the theory still has a lot of fans, especially since there really is a lot of data that cannot be explained in any other way.  Supporters point to the extremely disproportionate development of mankind, which happened as if a sharp jump.  Very similar to changes at the genetic level.  On the other hand, they also say that the Nubiru trajectory is such that it only approaches the Earth once every 3600 years.  Where the planet is all the rest of the time is unclear.  And if this is really true, then, in theory, the inhabitants of this mythical object live in incredible conditions radically different from ours. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  10 planet of the solar system exists.  This is a proven fact.  Mankind so far knows very little about it, but this is true in relation to any other cosmic body.  In any case, this is a really significant discovery in a very long time period, which opened a new page in astronomy.  Now, scientists will peer more closely at the outskirts of our system, because no one excludes that there are a huge number of similar objects there, and some of them may be even more mysterious than anything that has already been discovered. </p>
