Periodically, this figure changes - some organizations close, new ones come in their place.  And it is precisely because of some instability that modern people, before turning somewhere for services, first find out about the reliability of an enterprise. </p><p>  However, there are organizations that can be trusted even so.  They are in the TOP 100, as a rule.  And I would like to note with special attention the rating of Sovcombank, which is well advertised. </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  So, the subject of discussion is the universal Russian bank, whose head office is located in Kostroma.  This is a public joint stock company.  The rating of Sovcombank is high: the institution ranks 19th among all financial institutions in Russia.  The amount of its assets is more than 501 billion rubles (at the time of December 2016). </p><p>  The organization is also included in the state <span>deposit insurance system,</span> which is an additional reason for trust (the maximum amount of compensation is 1,400,000 rubles). </p><p>  By the way, there is a bank since 1990.  True, initially he had a different name.  And it sounded like ‚ÄúBuykombank‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the organization is not under the actual control of an individual or legal entity.  Its beneficiaries are a group of Russian businessmen and key members of Sovcombank management. </p>

    <h2>  Investment activities </h2><p>  This area is very loved by financial institutions.  Just not every one of them can prove itself properly.  But the rating of Sovcombank is impressive.  Moreover, on December 9, 2016, the annual Cbonds Awards ceremony was held.  The <span>best banks of</span> Russia acted as applicants for the award.  And there were 24 nominations. Sovcombank became the winner in two of them.  He was recognized as the best investment bank for working with municipalities and entities and the organizer of the secondary bond placement. </p><p>  The organization also received two second places.  As the 2nd best investment bank, working with companies of the 3rd and 2nd echelons of borrowers, as well as with financial institutions. </p><p>  After the ceremony, the deputy chairman of the board of the organization said that, despite the relatively high level of competition in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, they will strengthen their positions in the priority investment area in our time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Official Confirmation of Reliability </h2><p>  At the end of November 2016, it was announced that the credit rating of Sovcombank is now indicated by the mark ‚ÄúA-‚Äù.  It has been assigned by an organization you can trust.  Namely, analytical credit rating agency (ACRA). </p><p>  Leading experts note: Sovcombank boasts stability.  He has a satisfactory position in the risk profile, has a good liquidity management policy, and he also has a very adequate business profile. </p><p>  Attention was also paid to the stable franchise of the organization in the field of retail lending and the growing position in lending to a solid business. </p><h2>  Active development </h2><p>  As it was already possible to understand, Sovcombank Bank's rating on reliability is very good.  2016 is another confirmation of this.  Why?  Because in 2016 there were many offices and branches of this bank throughout Russia.  This indicates the reliability of the organization and the universal demand for its services. </p><p>  Own offices in October appeared in the popular resort cities - Sochi and Essentuki.  Also in the capital of Karachay-Cherkessia and the city of Donetsk, Rostov region.  Back in November 2016, one branch was added to Yaroslavl, Novokuybyshevsk, Neftegorsk, Leninogorsk and Tchaikovsky.  But that is not all.  Not so long ago, offices were opened in Vilyuisk, Yakutsk, Kurtamysh, Vyborg, Volkhov, Rostov-on-Don and Tevriz (urban-type settlement). </p><p>  In general, according to the latest statistics (06/01/16), this bank serves about 1,500,000 people living in 947 settlements in 65 different regions of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <h2>  Customer help </h2><p>  As you can already understand, Sovcombank is a good and reliable organization.  What place in the ranking he takes was also said.  Now we can note the attention of some special offers that demonstrate the organization in the best light. </p><p>  This bank has an excellent program to improve credit history.  And many use it.  It is carried out in three steps, and the first is known as the "Credit Doctor."  The meaning is this: a person, having provided a passport and a second document of his choice, takes a small loan - 4,999 or 9,999 rubles (for a period of 3 to 6 or 6 to 9 months, respectively).  40% per annum.  This is a loan that is not taken in order to help yourself financially.  And to "clean" your credit history.  Having borrowed 5,000 from the bank, at the end of the term a person will repay 5,500 rubles.  He will receive not only a ‚Äúplus sign‚Äù in his credit history, but also an MC GOLD card and insurance for 50,000 rubles. </p><p>  The second step is the ‚ÄúMoney at stake‚Äù service.  10,000 or 20,000 rubles for 6 months at the same interest rates with the same principle.  The third step is Express Plus.  A loan at 29% or 39% per annum in the amount of 30 to 60 thousand rubles for a period of 6, 12 or 18 months. </p><p>  Having gone through all three steps, a person is guaranteed to ‚Äúbleach‚Äù his credit history.  Not surprisingly, Sovcombank has an excellent rating.  Reviews of his customers, by the way, once again confirm this. </p>

    <h2>  For business </h2><p>  This financial organization works not only with individuals, but also with domestic enterprises of various orientations.  And for this kind of activity, Sovcombank has everything necessary.  On what place in the ranking he stands, has already been said.  Now a few words can be said about business services, due to which he, in many ways, achieved such a high position. </p><p>  So, for example, the bank offers each client to become his partner, agent or service representative for legal entities. </p><p>  That's not all.  It also provides capital market services related to bond issuance and private equity business development.  This also includes securitization, <span>syndicated loans, the</span> provision of guarantees to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, bridge financing, issue documentation, analytics and much more. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Experts, who determine what place Sovcombank takes in the rating, agree: at the national level, this organization is fully responsible for its loan obligations.  It is reliable for investors, and resistant to stress.  At the international level, of course, Sovcombank can also pay off its obligations, but is more exposed to negative factors. </p><p>  In general, its popularity is growing.  Over the past year, for example, the volume of deposits of the population has increased significantly - by 1.83%.  The total amount of deposits, by the way, is 105,082,313,000 rubles.  That is, Sovcombank takes the 25th place among all Russian financial institutions in terms of the volume of deposits.  Which is also a worthy indicator. </p>
