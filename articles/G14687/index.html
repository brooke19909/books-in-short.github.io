  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hitler's death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hitler's death brought moral relief to the inhabitants of the whole world, because it meant the impossibility of repeating the horrors of World War II. </p><p>  And the meaning of his life, Adolf Hitler lost in April 1945, when the Allies completed the defeat of Germany.  It became quite clear that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworld domination would no longer be realized.  It is said that, realizing the imminent defeat, Hitler gave instructions to destroy factories, food supplies - everything that belongs to the people of Germany, because this nation was weak, and therefore should not continue to exist.  Adolf Hitler said then that from now on world domination should belong to the more stable eastern people. </p><p>  Recall the chronicle of the days after which Hitler died. </p><p>  26 April.  Three quarters of the German capital were occupied by Soviet troops, but on this day the hope had not yet completely abandoned the F√ºhrer.  Then he was in an underground bunker at a depth of eight meters, anxiously awaiting news.  But by evening it became clear that it was impossible to liberate the capital by the forces of two armies - the ninth and twelfth.  Hitler was not alone in his underground shelter.  He had a lover with him - Eva Brown, Goebbels with her family, chief of staff, adjutants, secretaries, security guards.  Witnesses claim that the quick death of Adolf Hitler made itself felt.  If he had not been poisoned, then for health reasons he would still have lived for a very short time.  He moved awkwardly, barely dragging his legs and throwing his body forward.  It was difficult for him to keep his balance, his <span>hands were trembling.</span>  And his eyes were - no, not full of tears.  His eyes were bloodshot.  Hana Raych, a pilot fanatically devoted to Hitler, who was also in the dungeon, testifies that in his last days he was a tragicomic picture - it was clear that Hitler was losing his mind and did not control himself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  April 27th.  Hitler orders to open the floodgates on the Spree and flood one of the metro stations, where, according to the information he received, the soldiers of the <span>Soviet army</span> entered <span>.</span>  The order was executed, and as a result of flooding, thousands of people who were then in the subway died.  These were wounded German soldiers, children and women. </p><p>  April 29th.  The wedding of Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler took place.  The ceremony was held in full accordance with the law - there was a wedding ceremony, made up a <span>marriage contract.</span>  Bormann and Goebbels (witnesses), Krebs, secretaries and adjutants were invited to the celebration.  The feast did not last long, after which Hitler made a will. </p><p>  April 30.  On the order of the F√ºhrer, 200 liters of gasoline were delivered to the garden of the office.  Hitler and his wife invited all of their close associates (those who were with them in the bunker) to the meeting room in order to say goodbye.  After parting, Adolf Hitler and his wife remained in the room, and all the others left her.  The mystery of Hitler's death is that the further could happen according to two versions.  If you believe the testimony of Linge, the personal valet of the Fuhrer, in the afternoon at half past three spouses shot themselves.  When they entered, wounds in the temples were clearly visible, revolvers were located near the dead.  However, the main version, accepted by an absolute majority of historians, says that <span>potassium cyanide</span> poisoning <span>,</span> which had long been planned, caused the death of Adolf Hitler and his wife. </p><p>  The bodies were wrapped in blankets, carried out into the street, laid in a funnel from a shell and set on fire with cooked gasoline.  However, they burned badly enough, so the bodies still had to be buried.  Soldiers of the Red Army discovered the bodies on May 4, and it was not until May 8 that they were brought to one of the local morgues for identification.  Due to the fact that it was widely known that there were several doubles in both victims, the Soviet authorities wanted to thoroughly investigate what had happened. </p><p>  The studies were carried out mainly according to the data of the dentist Hitler, who described in detail the features of his oral cavity, which coincided with those found in the corpse.  The identification of Eva Braun‚Äôs body also took place.  Fragments of ampoules were found in the mouths of the corpses, and a trace from the wound was found in the chest of Eva Braun.  According to the examination, Hitler died from <span>potassium cyanide</span> poisoning <span>.</span>  Nevertheless, it is impossible to say with absolute certainty that it was Hitler and his wife, because a carefully thought-out cunning plan could work out.  Hitler‚Äôs death today seems difficult for a reliable investigation, because not a single expert and pathologist were left alive who could shed light on this story.  The fate of the remains of Hitler is also unknown.  Presumably, they were sent to Moscow, but so far no one has been able to find the traces. </p>
