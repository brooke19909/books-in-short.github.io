We will try to understand why this tariff plan is so good, and also learn how to connect it and disconnect it.  In fact, this is a very interesting, so-called anti-crisis proposal.  In addition, it is also important for us to know the opinion of those who have already used this tariff.  Maybe you shouldn’t switch to it at all?  Let's figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tariff zero doubt" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What kind of beast? </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the issues of connecting / disconnecting a mobile plan, you will first need to understand what we will have to deal with.  Beeline tariff “Zero doubts” is, as already mentioned, an anti-crisis solution for many subscribers. </p><p>  But why exactly such a name was given?  The thing is that for the first minute of a conversation with a Beeline subscriber you will pay 1.3 rubles, and starting from the 2nd minute the dialogue will be absolutely free.  Thus, if your environment uses this mobile operator, then the tariff plan considered today will become the most suitable. </p><p>  Of course, <span>Beeline tariff “Zero doubts”</span> receives positive reviews.  But among those who are surrounded by other mobile operators, the words of flattery are not observed.  Indeed, for a minute of conversation with "third-party" subscribers, you will have to pay 2.3 rubles per minute.  And this, frankly, is quite expensive.  <span>There is no subscription fee</span> for this plan, but the cost of the transition is 150 rubles.  However, these are trifles.  Let's try to understand how to start using the Zero Doubt tariff with the Beeline operator. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Purchase at a communication office </h2><p>  The first option that can only be advised to subscribers is probably not the best.  Nevertheless, it has a place to be.  After all, we are talking about buying a new number with a tariff plan in a mobile office.  What is needed for this?  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  In general, this process is more than simple.  Take your passport along with your mobile phone.  Next, go to the nearest mobile operator’s office.  Tell the employee that you would like to activate the “Zero Doubt” tariff with Beeline.  Next, they will have to tell you the features of the plan, after which they will ask for a passport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tariff zero doubt connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874555.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Give your ID.  After a while, they will give you a completed room purchase agreement.  Sign it, and then get a new SIM card.  Insert it into your mobile phone.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><p>  Now you know one of several ways that will help answer the question of how to get the tariff "Zero Doubts" <span>("Beeline").</span>  <span>Moscow</span> or any other city doesn’t matter.  The main thing is that there are mobile offices everywhere. </p><p>  In addition to the above, there is another method.  Come to the Beeline operator (if you were his subscriber before), and then inform the employee about the intentions of changing the tariff plan.  Pass the phone and wait a while.  If there is more than 150 rubles on the balance, you will be transferred to the tariff directly in the office.  And all the problems have been resolved. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  Another rather interesting and simple approach to solve the problem is to call the operator from your mobile phone.  It is enough to simply inform about your desires to get the “Zero doubt” tariff from Beeline.  Connect it, in other words.  This process will take place almost automatically.  You just need to know the algorithm of actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tariff zero doubt reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874554.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  To start, dial 0611, and then wait for the operator to respond.  Next, tell him about your intentions.  You may be asked for passport data, as well as a place of registration.  Do not be alarmed - this is necessary in order to understand that you are the true owner of the number.  Otherwise, only buying a new number will help you. </p><p>  When your identity is established, the operator will inform you of the tariff details.  Agree with them and say that you would like to connect it.  Wait a while.  In cases where you have enough funds to go, you will receive an SMS notification about the successful operation.  Otherwise, the operator will ask you to fund your account, and then resume the attempt.  That's all.  Nothing difficult or supernatural. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this method is not very popular.  All this is due to the huge probability of getting on an answering machine.  Then the dialogue can drag on for 20 minutes.  It’s much easier to go to the nearest Beeline mobile office.  But there are some more very interesting approaches to solving the problem.  Which ones?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  Special teams </h2><p>  For example, each client has a great opportunity to use the so-called USSD requests for the transition.  These are commands that are specially designed to automatically carry out actions on a SIM card by the subscriber.  All that is required is the availability of a sufficient amount of funds necessary to change the tariff plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable tariff zero doubt beeline" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874557.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  If you want to use this approach, then dial 0674 10 222 on your mobile phone, then click on the subscriber’s call button.  Now you will notice how the sending of the request began on the screen.  After processing it, you will receive a notification about the successful transition to Beeline (tariff "Zero doubts").  Otherwise, you will receive a message stating the reason for the impossibility of processing the request, as well as a short troubleshooting guide.  As you can see, everything is extremely simple. </p><h2>  Through the Internet </h2><p>  Disable the tariff "Zero Doubts" ("Beeline"), as well as connect it can be without any calls and visits to cellular offices.  The Internet, or rather the official website of the mobile operator, will help in this idea.  And the "My Account" on it. </p><p>  Visit the Beeline.ru page, and then go through authorization there.  You will be taken to the "My Account".  Select the menu "Services", and then - "Tariffs".  Find "Zero Doubts" and click on this line.  You will see a menu with available actions.  It remains to click on "Connect".  That's all, you can wait for a notification about a tariff change. </p><p>  Disconnection occurs after switching to some other tariff plan.  This is done in any way listed above.  That's all the problems are solved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff zero doubt beeline Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874558.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned several possible ways to connect the tariff “Zero doubts” from “Beeline”.  As you can see, modern mobile operators offer a wide range of approaches to solving the problem.  This is actually very good.  Someone may prefer more traditional and time-tested methods.  These are mainly people of the older generation.  They will not understand how to switch to a tariff plan using the Internet.  And someone, on the contrary, prefers only advanced technologies and innovations.  In general, choose what is right for you, and then act. </p>
