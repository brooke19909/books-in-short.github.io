What kind of device is this, what kind of fireplace can it be, and how does it work?  Consider also the advantages, disadvantages of the product and selection criteria. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="electrofireplace.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of fireplace with humidifier" class="if uuid-2395636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2395636.jpg"></div><p>  By purchasing a fireplace with the function of an air humidifier, you can not only decorate the room additionally, but also heat it, without drying the air in the room. </p><p>  It works on the basis of plain water, which using a special technology creates a flame effect.  An <span>ultrasonic generator</span> is built into the design <span>,</span> which converts the water flow into cold steam.  The effect of burning a live fire that cannot burn your hand is created due to the fact that halogen lamps illuminate scattered water droplets.  The tank is filled with water once every 24 or 36 hours. </p><p>  In this case, the device performs several functions at once: heating (since heat is released), moisturizing (does not dry the air) and decorative (it can complement any existing interior in the room).  It is important to determine the model of installation, which can be floor, wall or corner. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learn.allergyandair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Corner fireplace" class="if uuid-2395637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2395637.jpg"></div><p>  All fireplaces - humidifiers can be divided into two main groups: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  with an open flame (most of all, this type of installation suits the classic design of the room, in addition, it is possible to touch the flames, but you need to be careful when arranging such a fireplace for families who have small children); </li><li>  with a closed flame (access to the fire is blocked or restricted, it can be covered with glass or grill, this installation is suitable for the modern design in the room). </li></ul><p>  The division of devices into these two groups is purely conditional in nature, since any existing installation can be supplemented with accessories and modified. </p><h2>  How does a fireplace humidifier work? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interiordesignnewyork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation options" class="if uuid-2395642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2395642.jpg"></div><p>  When using heating devices, the humidity in an enclosed space is always reduced, which affects not only the well-being of a person, but also harms indoor plants and wooden furniture, causing it to spoil. </p><p>  The air humidifier in the form of a fireplace acts on the principle of a steam generator.  It simultaneously creates a warm atmosphere in the room, and does not dry the air.  In this case, the combustion mode can be adjusted.  The most popular is an electric fireplace with humidifier function and the additional sound of a wood burning stove.  On a special player built into the device, such sounds are recorded, and if you also add scented candles, then you might think that it is not an artificial fireplace that works, but a natural one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is important that the device meets all safety requirements.  The tank is filled with water carefully so that it does not get into open parts of the mains.  The temperature of the heating lamps is high enough, but even if you put your hand under artificial tongues of flame, a person will not get a burn, he will only feel the heat. </p><p>  The fireplace is equipped with a timer, with which you can configure the period of operation of the device and turn it off at a certain time. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learn.compactappliance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Warm and comfortable" class="if uuid-2395646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2395646.jpg"></div><p>  Like any device, a humidifier in the form of a fireplace has its advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  The benefits include the following: </p><ul><li>  a wide range of models depending on the design, ranging from classic installations to children's and fantasy ones; </li><li>  compact and easy to install and maintain; </li><li>  does not need fuel or wood for work, respectively, there are no combustion products; </li><li>  it is possible to regulate the degree of heating and brightness of the flame itself using the remote control; </li><li>  timer and several modes of operation. </li></ul><p>  Among the disadvantages of the installation can be noted the high price, control over the liquid level in the tank, as well as the periodic replacement of halogen lamps that are in direct contact with moisture.  The tank should be filled with liquid at least once a day during continuous operation of the electric fireplace. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><p>  When choosing a fireplace humidifier for the home, it is important to consider the following aspects: </p><ol><li>  Electricity consumption (the less halogen lamps in the installation, the less the amount of electricity consumed). </li><li>  Installation size (for starters, you need to determine a special place in the room where the fireplace will stand, and only then proceed to choose a model; they can vary significantly not only in design, but also in size). </li><li>  Type of installation (this can be not only a floor fireplace, but also a wall-mounted version, then additional time and knowledge will be required for its installation). </li><li>  The principle of operation (when choosing a fireplace, you need to read the instructions and know not only its nature of operation, but also the operating rules - the installation works on the principle of a Philips air humidifier, which evenly distributes humidified air, turns off if there is no water in the tank or notifies that the container must be filled with liquid to continue working). </li><li>  Additional functions (it can be a firebox sound or a timer that will make an artificial fireplace more attractive, and not only useful). </li></ol><p>  When purchasing an air humidifier - a fireplace, the price of which varies from 50 thousand to 70 thousand rubles, it is worth paying attention to the functions of the device and additional options.  There are also exclusive and decorative models worth from 100 thousand rubles. </p>
