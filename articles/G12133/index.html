    <h2>  Hasty action </h2><p>  International politics and relations with the Allies had a negative impact on the quality of planning and organization of the East Prussian operation of 1914.  The government of the Russian Empire promised France to hurry with the start of the offensive.  Hasty actions led to serious problems with obtaining detailed intelligence data on the deployment of the enemy and the establishment of communications between the Russian corps.  The invasion of German territory was almost blind.  Due to lack of time, the supply of troops was not properly organized.  The reasons for the interruptions in supplies were not only in a hurry, but also <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">in the absence in Poland of the</span> required number of railways. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Command miscalculations </h2><p>  The likelihood of the failure of the East Prussian operation in August 1914 increased significantly due to the dramatic error <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">made by the Russian</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">General Staff</span> .  Having learned that only the German territorial troops (landver), which are distinguished by low combat effectiveness, defend the Berlin direction, the high command decided to create an additional strike group to develop an attack on the enemy capital.  The reserves, which Samsonov and Rennenkampf's armies were supposed to strengthen, joined the new formation.  As a result of this error, the strike potential of the participants in the East Prussian operation of 1914 was significantly reduced.  The outcome of the battle was to some extent decided even before it began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="East Prussian operation of 1914" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2089643.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  German army plans </h2><p>  The Kaiser <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="3" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">General Staff</span> assigned its troops in East Prussia only the task of retaining territory.  The High Command did not give the army a concrete plan and to some extent provided freedom of decision-making depending on the development of the situation.  The troops of General <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="19" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Pritvice were</span> waiting for reinforcements, which were supposed to arrive 40 days after the start of the mobilization in Germany. </p><p>  It should be noted that the German side, like the Russian side, was poorly prepared for the conduct of hostilities in terms of intelligence gathering.  The German headquarters had very vague information about the size and deployment of enemy forces.  The German command was forced to make decisions blindly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Features of the landscape contributed to the conduct of defensive actions.  On the territory of a powerful fortified area there were a large number of lakes, marshes and forested hills.  Such a terrain prevented the advancement of the enemy.  The narrow passages between the reservoirs made it possible to create effective defensive lines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="East Prussian operation 1914 results" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2089645.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Start of operation </h2><p>  In accordance with the plan, the army of Rennenkampf crossed the state border on August 17 and immediately got into a battle with the enemy near the city of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="25" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Stallupenen</span> .  This was the first battle of the East Prussian operation in 1914. Briefly, the result of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">this</span> battle can be described as follows: Russian troops forced the Germans to retreat, but suffered serious losses.  Given the fivefold superiority of the Rennenkampf soldiers, this episode can hardly be called a great success.  The Russian army took <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="26" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Stallupenen</span> , and the Germans retreated to the city of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Gumbinnen</span> .  The next day, the offensive continued.  The Russian cavalry tried to bypass <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Gumbinnen</span> from the north, but collided with a brigade of German territorial forces and suffered losses.  Samsonov‚Äôs army entered <span>East Prussia</span> on August 20.  Having received information about this, the German headquarters decided to immediately enter the battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="East Prussian operation August 1914" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2086560.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battle of Gumbinnen </h2><p>  German divisions suddenly attacked the right flank of the Russian troops.  This section of the front was opened due to the fact that the cavalry, after suffering losses, retreated and was inactive.  The Germans managed to push back the Russian right-flank divisions.  However, the further development of the attack was stifled due to dense artillery fire.  The German army retreated, but the Russian troops were too tired to pursue them.  Both sides suffered heavy losses.  As a result of this battle, a threat to the environment loomed over the German corps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="East Prussian operation 1914 participants" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2089652.jpg"></div>

The new commander decided to concentrate his forces to defeat Samsonov‚Äôs army.  The Russian headquarters mistakenly accepted the transfer of enemy divisions as a retreat.  The command concluded that the bulk of the operation was completed.  Based on these considerations, the two Russian armies began to pursue the enemy and move away from each other.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">Hindenburg</span> took advantage of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="34" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">this</span> situation to surround Samsonov‚Äôs divisions. </p><p>  The flanks of the Russian troops, which advanced deep into enemy territory, were unprotected.  Concentrated attacks by the German corps and landver brigades led to the flight to the rear of individual parts of Samsonov‚Äôs army.  Communication with the headquarters was lost, and command and control was disorganized.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">During a</span> random retreat, five divisions led by Samsonov were surrounded.  The general shot himself, and his subordinates surrendered.  Western European historians call the defeat of Samsonov‚Äôs army a battle at <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">Tannenberg</span> . </p><p>  Eliminating one threat, the German command turned its attention to another.  Superior enemy forces launched an offensive on the southern flank of Rennenkampf‚Äôs troops, intending to encircle them and destroy them.  The attack was repelled with the help of the remains of Samsonov‚Äôs army, but the losses grew and the situation became hopeless.  Russian troops returned to their original positions.  The Germans could not encircle and destroy the army of Rennenkampf, but the offensive operation, the purpose of which was the capture of Prussia, ended in failure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="East Prussian operation 1914 summary" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2089653.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The attempt to invade the territory of Germany did not bring any results and turned into heavy losses.  The results of the East Prussian operation of 1914, of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">course,</span> were negative for the Russian army, but in the long run the tactical defeat turned into a strategic gain.  For Germany, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">this</span> theater of operations was secondary.  The Kaiser government concentrated forces on the Western Front in order, first of all, to defeat France with one quick and powerful blow.  The Russian invasion violated the strategic plans of Germany.  To eliminate the new threat, the German <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="5" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">General Staff</span> needed to transfer more than a hundred thousand people from the Western Front.  Russia diverted the forces intended to participate in the battle for France and saved the ally from defeat. </p><p>  Briefly, the results of the East Prussian operation of 1914 can be formulated as follows: the invasion forced Germany to conduct military operations on two fronts, which predetermined the outcome of the world confrontation.  The German side did not have enough resources for a protracted struggle.  The intervention of the Russian Empire not only saved France, but also condemned Germany to defeat in the world war. </p>
