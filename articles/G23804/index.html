    <p>  The views from the balconies rented out in the complex of rooms, judging by the reviews of tourists, are not very attractive.  Even surcharges for beautiful landscapes outside the window are not provided in this hotel. </p><p>  Showers in the hotel, according to many guests, look really very nice.  However, the complex, unfortunately, does not provide for a traditional set of toiletries.  Tourists should book gel, shampoo and soap when booking rooms at the Magda Hotel.  For the use of the refrigerator and safe in the rooms from the residents take 2 euros per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Infrastructure </h2><p>  Of course, guests of the Magda Hotel 4 * complex (Greece, Gouves, Crete, Heraklion) can use all sorts of amenities directly on its territory.

    <p>  The hotel also has its own sauna.  Many hotel guests periodically go fishing.  In addition, residents of this complex have the opportunity to go windsurfing.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, spending time at the hotel can be quite fun.  The hotel periodically arranges interesting animation events.  Also, many residents of the complex visit the TV lounge. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  Of course, they took care in this four-star hotel, including small guests.  For children, the hotel provides: </p><ul><li>  playground; </li><li>  pool; </li><li>  kids club. </li></ul><p>  If necessary, parents can temporarily leave the child with a nanny.  The hotel restaurant, among other things, has high chairs.  If necessary, the cot can be rented by contacting the reception staff. </p><h2>  Magda Hotel 4 *: hotel infrastructure reviews </h2><p>  The service provided by the hotel is generally praised by tourists.  The pools in this hotel are small, but quite clean and comfortable (there are two of them in the hotel).  Actually, the territory of the complex itself is fenced with a rather high fence.  Therefore, the wind in the courtyard of the hotel almost never happens.  The gym in this hotel is equipped, according to many tourists, very well.  The same goes for saunas. </p><p>  Regarding the animation at the hotel, vacationers have developed, unfortunately, not a very good opinion.  Some time ago, a very good organizer, Andreas, who understood Russian, worked at the hotel.  But this employee, unfortunately, quit.  Therefore, there are no particularly interesting events for domestic vacationers at the hotel (at least for 2016).  For a fee, this hotel also features barbecue evenings and special Greek animations. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has earned some complaints about the part of tourists due to the fact that guests are allowed to smoke on the territory here.  Ashtrays and urns are everywhere in the courtyard.  However, the absence of a ban on smoking in the courtyards for hotels in Greece is quite traditional.  Therefore, those who absolutely can not tolerate tobacco smoke, it is better to choose some other country for relaxation.  In any case, no one smokes in the rooms at the Magda Hotel 4 * (Greece), observing the rules. </p><p>  Reviews about the staff of this hotel, its guests are basically only good.  Arriving at the hotel tourists at the reception are greeted with a smile.  The hotel rooms are populated quickly.  If you have to wait for some reason, then beginners may even be offered a complimentary breakfast as compensation. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Rooms at the hotel can be rented with breakfast, half board or all-inclusive.  The latter option is recommended by most tourists.  The food at the Magda Hotel 4 * is really good and delicious.  Dishes in the hotel restaurant are changed every day.  At the same time, food is always served fresh and warmed up.  The restaurant's menu provides many desserts, pastries and fruits.  The meat and poultry in the first and second courses are always natural, juicy and mouth-watering. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the restaurant, the hotel has two bars - a regular and a snack.  Here you can order all kinds of drinks and snacks to them.  The hotel also has a coffee machine.  True, the drink in it, according to many vacationers, is poured not too tasty. </p><h2>  Holidays by the sea </h2><p>  The presence of a well-equipped picturesque beach, most of the guests consider almost the main advantage of the hotel Magda Hotel 4 * (Gouves).  To go to the sea from the hotel, its residents need no more than 2-3 minutes.  The hotel is built right on the beach.  The sand on the hotel beach is very shallow and soft.  Therefore, you can walk here even without shale.  It is very convenient to sunbathe on this beach not only on a sun lounger, but simply on a rug. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea in this place of the coast is very gentle and convenient, and the water itself is crystal clear.  Since strong winds blow quite often in Gouves, bathing here can sometimes be disturbed by excitement.  But this is perhaps the only drawback of the hotel's beach.  In addition, on the coastline in this place there is also a small enclosed harbor.  Here the excitement almost never happens. </p><h2>  Magda Hotel 4 * (Crete): reviews of the infrastructure on the beach and in the village </h2><p>  Tourists and the promenade running along the beach in this place are very praise.  Like the coastline itself, it looks very beautiful and picturesque.  If you wish, you can go to a cafe on the promenade and order breakfast, lunch or dinner at a low cost.  Work on the hotel beach and shops of various specializations. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, there are not too many cafes and entertainment establishments in the village itself.  However, if you walk along the sea to the end of the fence of the Aphrodite Hotel and turn right, you can get onto the street with all kinds of cafes and shops.  But nevertheless, in most cases, for those who want to make some interesting purchases in Greece or have fun, experienced tourists are advised to go to Khersones. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Convenient hotel Magda Hotel 4 * (Crete), tourists consider, among other things, and for the fact that there is a guide manager.  If necessary, in the hotel‚Äôs tour desk you can get advice on nearby attractions or even book a mini-tour. </p><p>  The most popular attraction, located near the Magda Hotel 4 *, among tourists is the village Aquarium.  You can reach it on foot in just half an hour.  The place is really very unusual.  According to most vacationers, the Gouves Aquarium is not like any other.  Sharks living in this center make a special impression on tourists. </p>
