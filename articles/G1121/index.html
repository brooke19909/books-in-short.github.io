  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prefabricated buildings: design, modern construction methods and safety requirements</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The current pace of development of the construction industry requires market participants to erect buildings in record time.  Quickly erected buildings and structures help to keep within the established time frame without sacrificing the quality of buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pirazizint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prefabricated building" class="if uuid-3045966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3045966.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for the popularity of prefabricated buildings </h2><p>  The customer expects the contractor to be quick, while the quality of the structure must be up to par.  Prefabricated buildings combine the lightness of metal structures and the reliability of the foundation, resistance to weather conditions and increased loads.  Installation of such structures takes little time, and their reliability is not inferior to capital structures. </p><h2>  Practical use of facilities </h2><p>  Metal elements in building structures have been used since the 50s of the last century.  Such construction was first successfully completed in Canada.  Mostly prefabricated buildings are used as hangars, cowsheds, greenhouses and other structures related to agriculture.  Warehouses and shops, sports facilities and exhibition centers are popular. </p><p>  In the construction of housing, such technologies did not take root due to the high requirements for earthquake resistance of residential buildings and the time spent on shrinkage of the foundation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Save time and financial investment </h2><p>  The main reason why more and more entrepreneurs are opting for the construction of prefabricated buildings is that this process allows saving on the financial side of the issue. </p><p>  Buildings made of lightweight structures are durable - they can function properly for more than 70 years.  This is feasible provided that all necessary safety rules are observed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ozgeyapi.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lightweight building" class="if uuid-3045968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3045968.jpg"></div><h2>  Competent design - half the success </h2><p>  It is at the design stage of prefabricated buildings that the foundations for successful construction are laid.  If you take into account all the rules, then the construction of the building will take a little time, and the result of such work will please the customer for many years. </p><p>  The development of project documents is preceded by surveys, the result of which will be an understanding of the composition and characteristics of the soils on which it is planned to build the building. </p><p>  Designers will have to analyze and evaluate many factors, including the climatic features of the area, as well as the limits of the location of groundwater.  Only taking into account all the nuances is it possible to build a durable structure. </p><p>  After carrying out all the design work, the customer receives estimates, drawings and installation diagrams.  Given that the project documentation contains the most accurate information, obtaining permission to erect a building in the authorities will be facilitated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.busydoor.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prefabricated Hangar" class="if uuid-3045965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3045965.jpg"></div><h2>  Production of structural elements </h2><p>  Based on the project, the manufacture of metal structures and other elements that are required for the construction of the building is ordered.  Prefabricated buildings consist of light and durable materials that are manufactured in the factory. </p><p>  Practice shows that most often the frame of prefabricated buildings is made of lightweight steel, the sheets of which are galvanized. </p><p>  The construction of prefabricated buildings and structures is rapidly gaining momentum, which affects the quality of assembly structures - it is becoming higher, which makes it possible to build buildings of high complexity. </p><h2>  Foundation laying </h2><p>  During the construction of the structures under consideration, preference is given to the strip foundation.  The foundation is poured to a depth not exceeding one and a half meters.  This value can be adjusted depending on the type of soil and other features that should be taken into account when designing and constructing pre-fabricated buildings and structures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coastalsteelstructures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Design and construction of prefabricated buildings" class="if uuid-3045969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3045969.jpg"></div><h2>  The construction of the building frame </h2><p>  Metal elements and sandwich panels, as a rule, come from the manufacturer in full, along with assembly instructions.  All these elements are assembled in a single design - it resembles a puzzle in which there are no extra elements. </p><p>  Given that the foundation is shallow, long-term and expensive work, such as drilling, is not provided in this case, and therefore, immediately after the construction of the frame, facade work and roof construction begin. </p><p>  The facade is sheathed with insulation, waterproofing the building.  Last but not least, the necessary communications are brought to the building. </p><h2>  Safety Requirements for Prefabricated Buildings </h2><p>  In the first place among the safety requirements applicable to easily erected structures are their fire safety.  Care must be taken to comply with the rules and regulations already at the design stage.  This means that the raw materials and materials that are supposed to be used in construction must be made of fire-resistant material. </p><p>  An appropriate certificate must be obtained for each element, which will guarantee its quality and fire resistance.  The certificate should spell out the limits of the spread of fire on a particular material. </p><p>  The document prescribing the standards for compliance of buildings with fire safety standards is called “On Fire Safety Requirements”.  It entered into force in 2008 and is valid to date. </p><p>  Taking into account that the supporting structures of prefabricated structures are made of steel, in terms of fire resistance, such structures are of the third type.  This means that insulation and other insulation materials must have high fire resistance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gaiapsychology.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lightweight and durable materials" class="if uuid-3045971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3045971.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to fire safety, special attention should be paid to research and the construction process itself.  Experienced specialists who have undergone appropriate instruction should be involved in the construction of the facility.  Installation of the building should also be carried out taking into account building codes and rules. </p><p>  Compliance with reasonable safety requirements, attention to detail and verification of certificates of conformity for the materials used in construction guarantee the durability of the structure being built and the absence of complaints from the controlling authorities. </p>
