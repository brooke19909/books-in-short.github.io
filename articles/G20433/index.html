Women inspired and sung by Pushkin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Alexander Pushkin is a man who went down in history as the greatest Russian poet.  However, contemporaries of the genius had a chance to see him in other roles.  He became famous as a gambler, cutler, duelist and, of course, the conqueror of women's hearts.  The plain appearance did not prevent the creator from seducing the fair sex.  What were Pushkin's women who left a mark in his life and work?  The search for an answer to this question to biographers was greatly facilitated by the famous “Don Juan list” of the poet. </p><h2>  First love </h2><p>  How many women did Pushkin have?  Hardly anyone can name the exact number.  However, the girl’s name, with the advent of which the “romantic” part of the poet’s biography began, was established.  <span>First love</span> came to Alexander at the age of 14, when his age was attracted by the same age as Natalya Kochubei.  He met the young countess while strolling through Tsarskoye Selo Park.  At first glance, he liked everything about her, from a smile to a gait. </p>

    <p>  Like many other women of Pushkin, Natasha was mentioned in one of his works.  It is believed that the genius in “Eugene Onegin” remembered exactly about her when he wrote “she was unhurried, not cold, not talkative ...”.  Passion did not last long, but was deposited in the poet's memory as the first strong feeling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pushkin women: Ekaterina Bakunina </h2><p>  Alexander Sergeevich’s love for another mysterious beauty lasted a little longer.  Ekaterina Bakunina was a sister of one of the poet’s friends, who remained with him from the time of training.  The young lady shone at the lyceum balls, making visits to a relative.  She served as a maid of honor at court and was seriously interested in painting, taking lessons from the famous artist Bryullov. </p>

    <p>  To calculate how many women Pushkin had, at least approximately, his poems help.  The image of Catherine, a man considered the true heritage of world poetry, immortalized in 22 of his works, reflecting his experiences of that period.  The most famous of them was called "To the painter." </p><h2>  Platonic relationship </h2><p>  Not all women who inspired Pushkin reciprocated the poet's passion.  Among those with whom he was associated only with <span>platonic relations,</span> <span>Ekaterina</span> Karamzina is <span>also</span> listed.  Everyone who personally knew the second wife of the historian Nikolai Mikhailovich paid tribute to the amazing beauty that she possessed in her youth. </p>

    <p>  Ekaterina Karamzina managed to create one of the most popular salons in Petersburg at that time.  At the same time, the hostess did not follow fashion, did not arrange gambling and did not allow her guests to communicate in any other language except Russian.  At one time, Pushkin remained a regular visitor to this salon, unusual for the mid-19th century, sincerely admiring its creator.  Feelings of genius were perceived by Catherine with humor, which allowed them to carry the friendship that had arisen through life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Like all other important women in Pushkin’s life, Karamzin “earned” several wonderful poems.  For example, one can recall the lines of the melodic and riddled with sadness elegy "But I have been forgotten with love."  Interestingly, Catherine was born as much as 20 years earlier than Alexander Sergeyevich. </p><h2>  Princess of the night </h2><p>  The women whom Pushkin loved were mostly bright personalities.  A perfect example is his passion for Avdotya Golitsyna, the wife of a powerful prince.  This woman was the owner of the <span>literary salon, which was</span> not empty for a day and attracted many famous people. </p><p>  The personality of the princess is marked with the seal of the riddle.  It is known that this woman took seriously the prediction of Madame Lenormand that she would leave this world at night.  Since then, her salon has remained open for guests from 10 pm until dawn.  That is how an unusual nickname arose - "The Princess of the Night."  In honor of this beautiful lady, who was also 20 years older than him, Alexander Sergeyevich also wrote several soul-taking works.  One of them was an appendix, along with which the ode to Liberty was presented to the readers' court. </p><h2>  Merchant's Wife </h2><p>  Amalia Riznich - the lady with whom the creator met while in the southern exile.  Like all women in Pushkin's life, she had an attractive appearance.  The poet admired her silky hair and expressive eyes, thinness and high growth.  This girl settled in the heart of a genius for several years, making him forget about other representatives of the fair sex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfortunately, the fate of the wife of the merchant Riznich was tragic.  Consumption abducted her life even before she turned 30, which plunged Pushkin into deep sadness.  Of course, many famous poems were addressed to Amalia, for example, “The Night” of 1823.  By the way, Alexander Sergeyevich not only sang in poems, but also painted the image of his beloved using a pencil. </p><h2>  Scandalous love </h2><p>  The poet would not have won the reputation of a duelist if he fell in love only with girls free of marriage.  Many of Pushkin's women, who left a mark on his soul, were married ladies.  One of them is Elizaveta Vorontsova, who came from a noble family and was the wife of the Governor General. </p>

    <p>  Alexander and Lisa met in Odessa, where the Vorontsov couple moved after her husband received the post of governor of the Novorossiysk Territory.  Pushkin sang the image of his new muse in many of his creations.  It was about her that he recalled, composing The Burned Letter, The Talisman.  She served both him and the model, the poet enthusiastically painted her portraits.  Of course, rumors of a forbidden connection could not fail to spread.  An angry governor made sure his wife's lover was exiled to Mikhailovskoye.  There are historians who believe that the daughter of Elizabeth born to Elizabeth was not conceived at all from her legal spouse. </p><h2>  The prototype of Tatyana Larina </h2><p>  Some women of Pushkin <span>left a mark</span> in history only thanks to his eternal poetic works.  They include, and at first glance, nothing remarkable Eupraxia Vrevskaya.  The creator met this lady as a child, as her family owned an estate in his native Mikhailovsky. </p><p>  Researchers still have not come to a consensus that Aleksandr Sergeyevich’s neighbor really became the woman with whom he wrote off the image of Larina, or she was confused with another young lady.  All that is known is that throughout his life the poet remained in warm friendly relations with her, constantly exchanging letters. </p><h2>  Fleeting vision </h2><p>  Some women praised by Pushkin gained fame comparable to the fame of modern show business stars.  There is hardly a resident of Russia who received a secondary education, who never heard the name of <span>Anna Kern.</span>  It was to this amazing woman that the writer dedicated the work “I Remember a Wonderful Moment”. </p>

    <p>  Anna Pushkin met while in the St. Petersburg house of his own aunt.  At first glance, a plain-looking young man did not interest the beauty, but his poetry made her change her mind.  Their relationship was special, riddled with irony and humor.  It is known that Kern closely communicated with the family of the one for whom she became a muse. </p><p>  Interestingly, the poet was in love with Anna's cousin.  The girl's name was Anna Andro (nee Olenin), she was educated, well-read, was fond of composing music.  People who knew the “second Anna” personally praised her divine voice.  Pushkin was so impressed by the young lady that he even sought her hand, but he was rejected, considering it unnecessarily narcissistic.  Nevertheless, the ruthless beauty also received several poems.  For example, the work “What is in my name?” </p><h2>  Poet's wife </h2><p>  Talking about who the women of Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin were, one cannot ignore his only lawful wife.  Many fans of the genius are convinced that it was Natalia Goncharova who played a fatal role in his life.  It is believed that the duel with Dantes, which interrupted the life of the great creator, was the result of her frivolous behavior. </p>

    <p>  There are those who claim that Goncharova never experienced true love for her famous husband.  Some researchers cite more and more evidence in favor of the theory that she married him, guided by an ordinary calculation.  Natalia's family needed, moreover, was in the power of an autocratic grandfather.  By agreeing to a marriage, the beauty got the opportunity to escape from the inhospitable paternal home. </p><p>  Like all women of Alexander Pushkin, Goncharov for some time was a <span>source of inspiration</span> for him <span>.</span>  It was his poet who addressed his wife when he wrote, "I am in love, I am fascinated."  Natalia gave birth to four children: two sons and two daughters. </p><h2>  Poet's nanny </h2><p>  It is interesting that a person recognized as a treasure of world poetry never used the images of parents in his works.  However, he did not forget to perpetuate the identity of his modest nanny, which also cannot be forgotten, talking about how Pushkin's women were.  The list containing a list of the poet's romantic hobbies, of course, does not contain the name of Arina Rodionovna.  But it was to her that Alexander Sergeevich turned in his most moving creations, affectionately calls her "girlfriend of the harsh days" in the famous "Nanny".  Judging by the poet’s work, the most pleasant memories of his childhood are associated with this woman. </p>

    <p>  So look the most famous women of Pushkin.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to see the photos of the beautiful women, since the life of a genius fell on the first half of the 19th century.  Their images are captured only by artists who painted beautiful portraits. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Researchers still have not come to a consensus about who were 4 women of Pushkin, whom he loved more than anyone else.  Each of the ladies listed above has earned many exciting poetic confessions.  It is possible that Alexander Sergeevich himself could not choose the most important ones, since his hobbies belong to different periods of his life. </p>
