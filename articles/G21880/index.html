After all, nobody wants to give extra money.  And just pay off bills that you really don't have to pay, too.  Who can count on exemption from property tax?

    <h2>  Property tax is ... </h2><p>  First you need to understand what kind of collection is involved.  The fact is that property tax is not paid by all citizens.  It is payable only by those who own certain property.  Or rather, real estate.  More precisely, property tax is charged for: </p><ul><li>  apartments; </li><li>  rooms; </li><li>  at home; </li><li>  cottages; </li><li>  buildings; </li><li>  shares in the indicated real estate objects. </li></ul><p>  When a person is the owner of the listed property, he will have to pay property tax annually.  The same payment is made by organizations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Due date </h2><p>  Who is exempt from property tax?  This payment will have to be paid off before a certain date.  Some believe that beneficiaries are given a respite.  This is a false statement.  Beneficiaries (a full list of them will be presented below) are completely exempted from this payment.  In this case, it is inappropriate to speak of a postponement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heroes of the Russian Federation" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488973.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, citizens who are subject to property tax must pay the state in December 2016.  After this date, interest will be charged.  Accordingly, there will be a debt.  It has already been said that no one can get a deferred payment.  Only full tax exemption.  But who and under what circumstances is entitled to such bonuses from the state? </p><h2>  Ambiguity </h2><p>  The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.  The fact is that property tax is a payment that is regulated at the regional level.  And in Russia it is allowed to assign certain categories of beneficiaries who are given discounts on this fee.  Cities also have the right to independently establish a list of those who may not pay for their property. </p><p>  That is why quite often it is recommended that all payment features be clarified in the administration of a particular locality or in tax inspections of certain regions.  Despite this, there are generally accepted beneficiaries.  These are persons exempted from property tax in all regions of Russia.  Who are they?  And who in general can be called a beneficiary? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Senior citizens </h2><p>  So, the first category of people is pensioners.  They are considered to be eternal beneficiaries in Russia.  Exempted in full from property tax.  It is important to understand what is meant here are persons who, by age, have come to a well-deserved rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disabled since childhood" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Russia, men become pensioners at 60, and women at 55. It is after these age restrictions that you can declare your benefits on property.  The bonus applies to both working and unemployed.  The main thing is to receive pension payments in the prescribed manner. </p><p>  Benefits are provided for all types of property.  For each type of property, only one benefit is provided.  This means that a pensioner can not pay only for one apartment, one house, one cottage and one room, which he has in private ownership in the presence of several similar real estate objects.  A tax credit is automatically granted for a more expensive property.  Or a pensioner (any other beneficiary) himself declares which property is subject to preferential treatment. </p><h2>  Heroes </h2><p>  The following category of people is most often found among pensioners.  Heroes of the Russian Federation are fully exempt from property tax.  Also here can be attributed the Heroes of the Soviet Union.  These are categories of the population, which, like pensioners, are called permanent beneficiaries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  True, you will have to report your status to the tax office.  And provide evidence that the citizen is indeed a hero.  Otherwise, no one will exempt him from property tax.  Families of these categories of citizens do not have any bonuses regarding the payment of contributions for property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax benefit code" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Disabled people </h2><p>  What's next?  Who else has the right to full exemption from the tax being studied?  In fact, there are a lot of beneficiaries.  Some categories of citizens do not even suspect that they may not pay for their property.  For example, <span>people with disabilities</span> are <span>disabled since childhood.</span>  This category of persons also includes people with disabilities who have the 1st or 2nd disability group. </p><p>  They are granted exemption from the fee only after contacting the tax service with the appropriate application and medical certificate confirming the state of health of the citizen.  It follows that not all persons with disabilities are beneficiaries.  People who belong to the 3rd group will pay the tax in full, unless otherwise provided at the regional level.  This fact should be considered by every citizen.  Persons with disabilities from childhood will always be exempted from this payment, regardless of the group received. </p><h2>  Veterans </h2><p>  Veterans of the Great Patriotic War and people who participated in the civil war are regular persons exempted from property taxes.  These categories of citizens are found in regions less and less.  In addition to veterans, one can also distinguish people who were awarded the Order of Glory of three degrees.  Cavalry is also exempted from the payment being studied.  And without fail.  Regions cannot collect property tax from the indicated categories of citizens.  These beneficiaries are federal.  So, you can only supplement the list of persons who are exempt from property tax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property tax rate 0" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Military </h2><p>  What other people may not make the specified payment?  Military personnel are exempt from property tax.  But only under certain circumstances.  In what cases is the military entitled to exemption from tax on existing property?  Today it is: </p><ul><li>  Dismissed soldiers who have served at least 20 years. </li><li>  Participants in the liquidation of military facilities. </li><li>  Participants in the war in Afghanistan and hostilities in other hot spots. </li><li>  Parents and wives of the military who died in execution. </li><li>  People who have experienced especially dangerous weapons (thermonuclear or nuclear). </li><li>  Families of the military who have lost the breadwinner. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, not all servicemen are entitled to privileges regarding property payments.  Only people with a certain length of service (fixed-term service is included here) can count on exemption from property tax. </p><h2>  Individuals </h2><p>  Who is exempt from property tax yet?  The fact is that some individuals also may not make the specified payment.  But under certain circumstances.  Today, among the beneficiaries are: </p><ol><li>  Persons who work in the creative field.  Then for the property that is used for labor, you can not pay.  These include libraries, studios, studios, galleries and museums. </li><li>  People who have suffered radiation sickness.  This also includes those who became disabled due to exercises, tests and other work related to nuclear installations.  And any.  For example, Chernobyl victims may not pay for property. </li><li>  All individuals with small outbuildings.  Exemption is granted when it comes to real estate not exceeding 50 square meters in area. </li></ol><p>  These are the rules that apply in Russia in 2016.  All these facts should be known to everyone.  Otherwise, he may make an extra payment.  But this is not all the important information. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="persons exempt from property tax" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Children </h2><p>  And are children exempt from property tax?  A similar question interests many parents.  And it causes great controversy in all regions of the country.  After all, if real estate has an owner, he must pay for the property.  How to be with children?  Minors are partially exempted from property tax.  Payments in their names will come.  But payment should be made by their legal representatives.  Non-payment threatens with debt and a fine in large amounts.  Therefore, it is worth remembering that in relation to property tax, children do not have any benefits.  As adults, they will have to pay for their property on their own. </p><h2>  Other beneficiaries </h2><p>  When else can there be a 0% rate on property tax?  All previously listed categories of citizens are <span>federal beneficiaries.</span>  They, as already mentioned, will always be exempted from the specified payment.  But what other scenarios could there be?  Among those who may not pay property tax, quite often distinguish: </p><ul><li>  the poor; </li><li>  large families; </li><li>  disabled people of all groups. </li></ul><p>  Most often, these categories of people are regional, or, as they are also called, local beneficiaries.  The heroes of the Russian Federation and all the previously listed categories of persons, as was emphasized, will still receive exemption from property tax. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children are exempt from property tax" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1488977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The organization </h2><p>  Also, some organizations are entitled to the studied benefit.  In which cases?  Since 2015, such opportunities are provided: </p><ol><li>  In relation to all movable property, which has been registered since 2013.  The property tax benefit code in this case is 2010257. </li><li>  All property, which is recorded in the balance sheet of the company participating in the FEZ.  In the declaration you will have to indicate the code 2010258. </li></ol><p>  All other property is fully taxed.  It is these rules that apply in the Russian Federation in 2016.  From now on, it is clear who is exempt from property tax. </p>
