    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Picturesque Utrecht, whose sights reflect all the milestones of its history, appeared around 47 BC.  The Roman soldiers, who wanted to mark the borders of the great empire, erected a powerful fortress, which turned into a modern city, considered the country's railway capital, as all trains pass through it. </p><p>  In the 7th century, after the appointment of the pope‚Äôs protege, the Utrecht bishopric appears here, and a small town becomes a real stronghold of Christianity.  A huge number of <span>temples, cathedrals,</span> monasteries appear that reflect a rich religious life.  Utrecht, located near the Rhine River, in the XII - XIII centuries turns into a large shopping center, and in the middle of the XVI century the heads of seven provinces sign the Utrecht Treaty, which laid the foundation for the creation of a single republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two-level channels </h2><p>  The colorful Utrecht, whose sights made the city unique in the eyes of vacationers, is similar to its neighbors, and at the same time has its own uniqueness.  The fabulously beautiful city cut by canals resembles the colorful Amsterdam, however, there is still one difference: the promenades are lowered to the water, and the residential houses are a little higher.  The two-story structure was invented by merchants who had trading shops, and below them, at the pier, they built their warehouses, and now you can have a bite to eat at cozy cafes and restaurants near the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="utrecht landmarks photo" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1833479.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  St. Martin's Cathedral and its tower </h2><p>  In the very center of the city is the Cathedral of St. Martin - one of the main religious attractions of Utrecht and the Netherlands.  The Protestant church, considered a model of French Gothic, appeared in 1254 on the site of an ancient temple.  Located next to the cathedral tower, St.  Martin's Cathedral was originally associated with it, but after a terrible tornado in the XVII century, the two structures separated from each other, since the central part of the architectural monument was destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="utrecht sights reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1833524.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The episcopate‚Äôs symbol - a tower with a bell tower 112 meters high - was built on the spot where the Roman soldiers erected a defensive fortress.  In the Middle Ages, it was considered the tallest building in the state.  Amazing views of the ancient city, shrouded in legends, open from the observation deck, but not everyone can climb it, because you will have to go through 465 steps.  However, tourists who have overcome the path upstairs admit that the result is worth such an effort, and on a clear day you can even enjoy the panorama of Amsterdam. </p><h2>  Attractions in Utrecht: Castle de Haar </h2><p>  Not only the largest, but also the most famous due to its unusual appearance, a luxurious castle is located near the city.  A powerful building that carries tourists during the time of the valiant knights, was built by an architect from Holland.  Castle de Haar, surrounded by a moat and an impregnable wall, is a wonderful illustration of the turbulent Middle Ages.  An authentic architectural miracle with suspension bridges, towers, spiers every year hosts guests participating in knightly tournaments.  So the authorities are trying to revive the traditions of medieval life.  Broken near the castle a huge park where it is so nice to walk, many vacationers compare with Versailles. </p><h2>  University of Utrecht </h2><p>  In 1636, the largest university in Europe appeared in the city, then dormitories, academic buildings were built, and since then a special student atmosphere has reigned here, which distinguishes cozy Utrecht from other cities in the Netherlands.  Sights, photos of which can be seen in all tourist guides, attract the attention of foreign guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="utrecht landmarks castle" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1833532.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By the way, the university has an open observatory open to the public, equipped with modern telescopes, and everyone can watch the distant stars. </p><h2>  Railway museum </h2><p>  Since the vibrant Utrecht is a major railway and automobile hub of the country, it is not surprising that the city has an unusual museum, the exhibits of which will interest people of all ages.  Located at the former Het Spoorwegmuseum train station, this is a unique place where you can see a gigantic collection of antique suitcases and chests, sit in the driver's cab simulator or ride a mini-train. </p><h2>  River Tram Walks </h2><p>  In order to fully enjoy the wonderful atmosphere and see the various attractions of Utrecht (photos with descriptions and their addresses can be found in the guide maps), just go for a walk on the river tram.  The tour lasts about an hour, and during this time guests will see old houses, powerful city walls, and, of course, the very two-level canals that have become unique for the whole of Holland. </p><h2>  Light illumination </h2><p>  Utrecht, which locals call the "ancient city with a big heart", is famous throughout the world for the light show Trajectum Lumen.  Held on the streets all year round, it delights with fantastic lighting made by real professionals.  Modern craftsmen create amazing paintings on the walls of buildings, asphalt, roofs and even under bridges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Utrecht attractions photo with description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1833516.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As tourists admit, to see the light show is the best way to find out the wonderful city from the other side.  I would like to wander the night away, enjoying the most beautiful images that are embodied both on the facades of the buildings and on the cobblestones of the streets, and tourists call colorful illuminations one of the main attractions of Utrecht. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Foreign guests say that you need to go here for the impressions of walking around the city, transferring to the Middle Ages.  Luxurious architectural structures, two-level canals, catchy light illumination are worth seeing for everyone who wants to know how the past is combined in Utrecht with the present.  A city that is not like the others has its own flavor. </p><p>  As tourists admit, the reality exceeds all expectations, and some even experience a cultural shock at the sight of the main attractions of the pearl of Holland. </p>
