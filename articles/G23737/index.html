Time is running.  Children grow, they learn, develop.  And modeling from plasticine takes the first place in the development of motor skills of kids' hands. </p><p>  So why don‚Äôt you sit next to the child now and with him not blind the military soldier?  This is a very exciting experience.  For example, such a soldier can be presented to a friend or grandfather, a veteran.  A DIY gift will be just right.  After all, it symbolizes the tremendous strength and power of our country and the people themselves.  So how to mold a soldier from plasticine? </p><h2>  Material needed </h2><p>  <span>Making a</span> soldier out of plasticine is easy!  First you need: </p><ul><li>  large pieces of green plasticine; </li><li>  yellow medium size; </li><li>  small pieces of white, black, red; </li><li>  beige plasticine; </li><li>  wire or matches to connect parts of the body. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plasticine soldiers" class="if uuid-3085894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121563/3085894.jpg"></div><p>  Green plasticine, together with yellow, must be used for a military uniform.  These two colors must be mixed.  Then the shade of form itself will be more vivid, sandy. </p><p>  Small pieces of plasticine will be needed to sculpt small parts of the face and body itself.  Also black color is needed for boots.  Matches come in handy to collect all parts of the body.  But it is better to use wire.  With its help, a soldier can be given any shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So how to make a soldier out of plasticine in stages? </p><h2>  How to mold a warrior‚Äôs body </h2><p>  Now you can begin to sculpt the soldier.  First, mix the green and yellow colors (discussed earlier).  We knead the clay well so that it is soft.  Then we divide all this mass into seven different parts.  From these plasticine balls should be obtained: </p><ul><li>  cap; </li><li>  riding breeches; </li><li>  sheepskin coat (tunic); </li><li>  two hands; </li><li>  two legs. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Make a soldier" class="if uuid-3085895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/121563/3085895.jpg"></div><p>  And how to mold a soldier from plasticine so that it is original and cool?  It all depends on your imagination. </p><h2>  Sheepskin coat and legs </h2><p>  We begin to sculpt the details.  The main part of the tunic (uniform) must be made of two different parts.  It is possible from one, but do not forget that then you will need to arrange a small groove for the belt. </p><p>  We stick the yellow plasticine belt itself.  Then we make the stack (a tool for cutting plasticine) a vertical line from top to bottom.  These will be the sides of the jacket.  And then we fasten small buttons along this line. </p><p>  After we made the uniform and designed it as it should, we begin to sculpt the following details.  The lower (legs) and upper (torso, arms) of the soldier should be connected using a wire. </p><p>  Getting to sculpting boots and collar.  For shoes, you need to make two cylinders with oblong bases from the bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the collar, we also make a cylinder, only thinner and longer.  For a more spectacular look, you can attach a small strip of yellow plasticine. </p><p>  Now that the boots and collar are ready, they need to be connected to the main part.  It is better to use matches for better fastening. </p><p>  The main parts of the soldier are ready.  It remains to make a head and hands.  To do this, you need beige plasticine. </p><h2>  Head and arms </h2><p>  For the head we make an oval blank.  We mark with a stack where the eyes will be located.  For them we use white and black colors of plasticine.  Then make out the nose, eyebrows and lips. </p><p>  For the hands, we form two small cakes curved inward.  Stack to highlight the fingers.  We mold hands and head to the sheepskin coat with matches in the same way as the main details. </p><p>  From two small balls of beige plasticine we make ears. </p><h2>  Headdress </h2><p>  Do not forget that a soldier needs a cap.  For its manufacture, you need to take the yellow-green and black plasticine. </p><p>  Of these, blanks for a cap and a visor should be made, and then blind together with the help of a red edging.  In the middle we make out a small star.  We collect all the details and attach them to the head. </p><p>  We attach shoulder straps to our shoulders.  For them we use black and yellow plasticine. </p><p>  At will - for greater effect - such a soldier can be mounted on a pre-prepared stand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself plasticine soldier" class="if uuid-3088337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24824/3088337.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know how to mold a military soldier from plasticine.  As you can see, this is very simple.  Even an schoolboy can easily make such an interesting man in a green uniform. </p>
