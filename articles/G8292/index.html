It is noteworthy for world-famous monuments that belong to the white-stone architecture of the twelfth century. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Bogolyubovo (Vladimir region) is located on the right (high) bank of the river.  Nerl.  A few kilometers from the village of Nerl flows into Klyazma.  At the foot of the hill, a little to the south, a railway was laid (communication from Nizhny Novgorod to Moscow).  Here is the station Bogolyubovo.  Parallel to the railroad track is the old highway from Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod. </p><h2>  Village History </h2><p>  Bogolyubovo <span>(Vladimir region) was</span> first mentioned in chronicles in 1158. Andrei Bogolyubsky founded the village for his residence.  There is a legend according to which it was in this place that the prince had the appearance of the Virgin, who ordered the founding of a monastery and city.  For a relatively short period (from 1158 to 1165), large-scale construction was carried out on the right bank of the Nerl River.  A palace, a cathedral and various fortifications appeared on the hill.  The <span>Church of the Intercession on the Nerl</span> was also erected <span>.</span>  Interestingly, all these structures are built of stone. </p>

    <p>  After a short time, a city was built around the princely palace, which was called Bogolyubov.  Unfortunately, the heyday of this settlement was very short-lived.  The city began to decline even after the death of Andrei Bogolyubsky.  In 1177, it was destroyed by the Ryazan prince Gleb, and in 1238 the troops of Batu razed all city fortifications to the ground.  Since then, Bogolyubovo (Vladimir region) has become a small village under the existing monastery, which was founded on the site of the palace of the prince.  In this form, this locality exists at present. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In the village of Bogolyubovo (Vladimir region) in almost all cases it is worth going through the regional center.  Here, eight times a day, electric trains run eastward.  These are flights to Vyazniki, Kovrov and Gorokhovets.  Those who decided to get acquainted with this historical place closer are unlikely to be happy with the train schedule, because from half past eight in the morning until 15.30 there are no departures from Vladimir.  In this case, it is most convenient to get to the village of Bogolyubovo by city bus.  From the regional center, routes number 103 and 152 go here. The route of these buses lies through the central streets of Vladimir.  Their stopping points are located at Cathedral Square or at the Golden Gate. </p>

The reference point is a large monastery, which is located on the right side of the road.  Here is a stop called Bogolyubovo Center.  It is easy to find a railway station in this place.  It can be reached by the road that goes right behind the monastery.

    <p>  Those who prefer to travel by car should go from Vladimir towards Nizhny Novgorod.  Bogolyubovo is the first settlement after the regional center.  It should be borne in mind that in the village the road is very narrow, so you can choose a little parking places.  Free parking is available at the entrance to the monastery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church of the Intercession on the Nerl </h2><p>  The village of Bogolyubovo, Vladimir Region, cannot boast of a large number of attractions.  But at the same time, most of what is available is on the UNESCO World Heritage List and is popular with many tourists. </p><p>  One of these structures is the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin on the Nerl.  It was erected in 1165 according to the order of Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.  Moreover, the place for this most harmonious structure existing in the Russian architecture of a religious direction was chosen very well.  There is a church on a hill in the middle of the field, at the very confluence of the Nerl River in Klyazma.  It is no coincidence that such a place was chosen by Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky.  The fact is that in those days the mouth of the Nerl served as a navigable gate, passing through which merchants fell into the Vladimir region.  The gaze of visitors was revealed in an amazingly beautiful picture: a white stone church towering above a picturesque green meadow.  Currently, <span>the Nerl River</span> has changed its course. </p>

    <p>  The architectural design of the temple is extremely simple.  It is a one-headed four-pillar three-apse structure of the cross-dome type. <br>  Many experts note that the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl has a common harmony, as well as sophistication of proportions.  Thanks to this, the illusion of its weightlessness is created.  The temple seems to soar in the air.  A particularly stunning picture is observed in the spring.  The temple during this period is similar to a burning candle, which is facing the sky. </p>

Thanks to these techniques, the building visually increases.  Carved reliefs serve as decoration of church walls.  The central composition of the three facades of the temple is King David, seated on a throne.  In his left hand he holds a psalter, and with his right he produces a two-breasted blessing.  In the design of the walls there are also images of lions, birds and female masks.  In 1992, the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

    <h2>  Holy Bogolyubsky Monastery </h2><p>  This building was founded in the late 12th century.  However, only buildings erected in the 18-19 centuries survived to our days.  In the village of Bogolyubovo (Vladimir region), the monastery was built in the pseudo-Russian style. </p>

    <p>  The sights of this architectural monument are the Staircase Tower with a gallery adjacent to it.  These structures are what remains of the destroyed palace of Andrei Bogolyubsky.  Currently, they are part of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in the 18th century.  Fragments of the ruined palace are easily recognizable by unique stone decorations, similar to those found in the <span>Dmitrievsky Cathedral</span> in Vladimir, as well as in the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl.  In the monastery there is a cathedral of the <span>Bogolyubsky icon of the Mother of God,</span> which was erected in 1855-1865.  However, the most notable building is the gateway church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, delighting with its beauty since 1841. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  The village of Bogolyubovo (Vladimir region) attracts tourists with another construction.  This is the church of Joachim and Anna.  It is located on Lenin Street, 48. The structure was built in the 19th century.  It is made in the style of classicism.  The church has undergone great destruction, but restoration work is currently underway here. </p>
