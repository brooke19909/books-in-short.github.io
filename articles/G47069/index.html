    <h2>  <span>How to pay "Tele2"</span> using a card? </h2><p>  In order to replenish the balance, you can use any bank card issued by a Russian bank.  Before this procedure, you should clarify in advance with your operator servicing the hotline of a banking organization the possibility of such replenishment.  The fact is that some organizations specifically block such functions.  It is important to remember that to unlock it you need to do everything yourself.  Namely: enter your mobile phone number, which is planned to be replenished with a cash amount.  Next, you will need to enter the parameters of the plastic card.  After that, you should once again check all the completed data regarding the payment and confirm the transfer.  All of the above actions will need to be carried out through the official website of your bank, where, if necessary, you will need to enter additional information regarding the owner of the credit card.  This applies to cases when the card is untethered.  In subsequent cases, the replenishment of the balance will be many times faster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on Tele2 through a bank card without commission" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/956318.jpg" width="600"></div>

After the client discovers the option "Payment for services" in this section, you should choose your carrier, namely "Tele2".  The mobile operator is popular, therefore, it is on the list of all banks of the Russian Federation, as well as foreign and CIS countries.  The main thing to do is to check on the ATM display all the completed fields and make sure that there are no errors.  So, it becomes clear: there is nothing complicated in depositing money on Tele2 through a bank card.  It is enough to find the nearest device and complete the operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on Tele2 through a bank card of Sberbank" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/956321.jpg" width="600"></div>

Next, you need to select the payment by card and indicate the mobile phone number and the amount of the payment.

In this case, the number should be in rubles and without cents.  This opportunity is provided to subscribers whose card account is tied to a mobile number.  Each message sent to number 109 is not charged, so it costs the cardholder free of charge.  Thus, to save money, you can put money on Tele2 through a bank card without a commission. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="put money on Tele2 through a bank card" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/955300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  There is another way to replenish the balance of your phone - this is Internet banking.  To carry out this operation, you need to go to your personal Internet banking account and select "Cellular Payment" in the menu.  Next, you need to find the name of your mobile operator and enter the phone number and the amount of money by which the subscriber wants to replenish his account.  In order not to waste time in the future to replenish the balance in the future, it would be better to set up auto payment.  Almost all banks provide such a service.  For example, you can deposit money on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù through a VTB 24 bank card using Internet banking using an automatic payment system within a few minutes.  If for some reason there is no ATM or computer or credit card at hand, then you can ask the operator for a loan.  To do this, send a request or message to the number, which will need to be clarified with the manager of "Tele2".  If the money has not been received, you should also contact the office of the company. </p>
