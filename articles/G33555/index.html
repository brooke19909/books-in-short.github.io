    <h2>  Grand Central Terminal: description and architectural features </h2><p>  The building was rebuilt three times in its entire history. </p><ul><li>  The very first Grand Central Depot station lasted only 8 years, from 1871 to 1879. </li><li>  The second, Grand Central Station, was located at this site from 1899 to 1913. </li><li>  The latter was named Grand Central Terminal, it was opened in 1913. </li></ul><p>  The design of today's station was done by well-known <span>American companies</span> at that time <span>.</span>  The first was engineering, the second - architectural. </p><p>  The development of a construction plan began in 1904.  When engaged in the project, the companies had to consider the wishes of the authorities.  The main requirement was to hide the railway tracks in the tunnel in order to rid the townspeople of soot and excessive noise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The idea was not just difficult for those times, but extremely difficult to implement.  Nevertheless, the designers managed to achieve the desired result, even if it took a whole decade.  The grand opening took place on February 2, 1913. </p><p>  The services of Grand Central are used by everyone who lives here or comes to New York.  Central Station covers an area of ​​19 hectares.  It has two underground levels on which paths and platforms are located.  On the upper floor - 41, and on the lower - 26. </p><p>  Unique architecture is a separate issue.  In 2011, the station was recognized as the most outstanding in the world.  This title was awarded to him by the authoritative Travel &amp; Leisure magazine, and precisely due to its architectural features.  In addition, annually the number of tourists visiting Grand Central is 22 million people, and this is the sixth attraction in the world in terms of number of guests. </p><p>  And finally, about the architecture itself.  Few have heard about such a style as bezar.  It is a mixture of baroque and renaissance.  Railway Station in New York is one of the few buildings made in this architectural style.  It is difficult to describe all the beauty that bezar bears in itself.  The combination of rigor and symmetry with bas-reliefs, stucco molding and other decor.  This is just what is best to see once. </p><p>  The interior is dominated by vaulted ceilings.  The main hall, somewhat similar to a temple, gives a lot of impressions to visitors: this room is 84 x 38 m in size and 37 m high. The windows have an arched shape, as well as many columns in the hall. </p><p>  Nearby is Winderbilt Hall.  The Christmas Market is held here annually and exhibitions are organized.  And in Campbell's Apartment, where the style of the 13th century Florentine palace predominates, there is a cocktail bar and restaurant of the same name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  A cult place in New York </h2><p>  Pope John II once said that New York is the capital of the world.  And the railway station is a cult place in this city.  Indeed, just looking at him recalls the many films and animated series shot here.  For example, in Madagascar, on Grand Central, they caught a group of animals looking for Marty.  He can also be seen in the movie "13" with Statham, "Kiss for Good Luck" with Lindsay Lohan and many other films. </p><h2>  Meeting place can not be Changed </h2><p>  Where to date if you don't know New York at all?

But even being within the walls of this institution, you can find something to your liking. </p>

    <h2>  Conquer hunger </h2><p>  The Oyster cocktail bar and restaurant, which was mentioned above, is a popular place in New York, considered the most “delicious” in the whole city.  It serves fresh oysters, cut right in front of customers.  And they are offered amazing wine that improves the taste of seafood dishes.  A large assortment of various goodies and a pleasant noble drink will refresh and make the evening memorable. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this institution can not be compared with the forecourt eateries.

    <h2>  Secret, or Secrets of NY Central Station </h2><p>  Grand Central's pride, a watch with opal dials, is estimated at around $ 10-20 million.  And if you look at the ceiling of the main hall, you can see the universe.  It is decorated with a fresco that depicts zodiac signs and 2500 stars, 60 of which are equipped with backlight. </p><p>  One of the halls (Vanderbilt) was named after its owners, people who donated about 6.5 million dollars for the construction.  The family motto reads: "The great oak grows from a small acorn."  Therefore, as a tribute to the memory, the station building is decorated with stucco molding with similar images. </p><p>  Caring for the health of citizens of the country, workers, cleaning the ceiling of the main hall from tobacco raid (they constantly smoked at the station), a small part of it, located next to the cancer claw, was left as it is.  The goal is to show people how harmful smoking is to their health. </p><p>  There is even a secret basement, and rather big.  Its area is about 200 thousand square meters.  Part of this territory is occupied by a secret room, which is not even on the drawings.  Generators are installed in it, and there is also a red button, when clicked, all trains stop.  Continuing the topic of secret rooms, it is worth mentioning the platform, the whereabouts of which no one from outsiders knows.  It was created back when Roosevelt, when the president needed to hide his state of health from citizens of the country: he was defeated by paralysis resulting from polio.  So, he quietly got to his residence.  Now this platform exists to ensure the safety of the president in the event of a threat. </p><p>  It will also be interesting to know that the clock on the bulletin board is in a hurry for 1 minute.  And this was done on purpose - so that passengers are not late.  What can you do is business New York.  The central station is very interesting, a walk along it will give a lot of pleasant impressions, and maybe souvenirs, if you look at shops and boutiques or get to the <span>Christmas market.</span> </p>
