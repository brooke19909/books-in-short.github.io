The Russians are especially fond of the mysterious and fashionable Sharm el-Sheikh, whose name already sounds something east-intriguing and luxurious. </p><p>  But rest, even in the most heavenly place, can be spoiled by poor quality staff and a poor hotel.  Therefore, the choice of housing should be approached more than responsibly.  What is necessary for a quality and comfortable stay?  The issue is purely individual, but in general terms it can be said that this should be the perfect combination of price, quality, location and the required infrastructure.  One of the popular hotels among compatriots is Cleopatra Luxury Resort Sharm el Sheikh 5 *, we will talk about it and a little about its analogue in Hurghada. </p>

    <p>  The hotel can also often be found under the name Cleopatra Luxury Resort Collection 5 *.  This is due to its complex architectural solution and a large number of objects on the territory.  Visiting the sea and not tasting its gifts would be a big mistake, so you should definitely pay attention to the second restaurant - Red Sea Wharf.  Delicious dishes made from the freshest seafood will delight even the most sophisticated gourmet.  And the Fellini restaurant, as the name implies, offers visitors Italian cuisine.  You need to keep in mind that both of them work a la carte, that is, for an additional fee. </p><p>  Excellent meat and vegetables will be served by the Beach Grill restaurant located on the territory of the hotel overlooking the waters of the Red Sea.  In addition to the main dishes, they offer tea, coffee and delicious sweets. </p><p>  All restaurants have a special children's menu. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Hotel Bars </h2><p>  There are many places for a relaxed and relaxing stay in the hotel, including four bars.  Each of them is special and has indescribable color and charm.  So, near the pool you can enjoy refreshments and cocktails, as they say, without departing from the ticket office in Central Park or in Villa, where everything else is served exquisite ice cream of various varieties and types.  And in the Pilli Pilli Pub, in an exceptional atmosphere, you can play billiards and try a real oriental hookah - a multifunctional and interesting place. </p>

    <p>  But for water activities, diving courses and dives will have to pay extra.  However, for children snorkeling, that is, diving with a mask, is free, as well as equipment rental for this. </p><h2>  health and beauty </h2><p>  The hotel is not in vain called the Cleopatra Luxury Resort 5 *: in addition to entertainment, it also offers services to maintain health and beauty.  Women will especially enjoy their own spa.  Massage (regular and water) is a good addition to a sauna or a real Turkish hammam. </p><h2>  Leisure and sightseeing programs </h2><p>  Many tourists who visited this hotel respond positively to the work of its animators and note rich entertainment programs in the evenings.  There is plenty of space for this: our own amphitheater, Waves Club Privee (night club).  Numerous entertainment programs will not let vacationers get bored.  Fans of a combination of beach and sightseeing holidays also have something to offer.  Domestic and local tour operators will be happy to take you on a wide variety of excursions.  Including the historical and cultural center of Egypt - Cairo and Alexandria, the majestic pyramids and the Sphinx, Luxor and the monastery of St. Catherine, Jerusalem and Jordan. </p><h2>  Guest reviews on location and infrastructure </h2><p>  I would like to note right away that Cleopatra Luxury Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh) has a generally positive reputation among tourists, but you can often find criticism against it.  Hotel guests who have been there on vacation unanimously note its excellent location (near the sea and the airport), which is perhaps the most important plus.  Particularly emphasize the cleanliness and comfort of the beach.  The entry into the sea is quite small, and you will not be able to see the marine inhabitants easily like that, but everything is calm and there is a pontoon from which you can plunge into the water without any problems. </p>
