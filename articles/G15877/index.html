  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of the Internet and Email</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the development of the Internet begins in the late fifties, when the second generation of computers was already operating in the world.  Foreign international relations of the leading world powers of the USSR and the USA pushed for new research, necessary to protect and transmit information in a reliable way. </p><p>  The U.S. Department of Defense initiated the first development of computer networks, which began the history of the development of the Internet.  Scientists from four well-known universities in America took an active part in them.  Their computers were connected in 1969 by ARPANET - the first computer network. </p><p>  ARPANET began to be quickly used not only by the military, but also by specialists in various fields of science.  The first server appeared at the University of California (Los Angeles), the computer had a RAM capacity of 24 Kb.  The first communication session took place in October 1969 with the Stanford Research Institute, which was conducted by Charlie Klein and Bill Duvall. </p><p>  In 1971, it became possible to send e-mail, as a special program was developed.  In the future, the history of e-mail development was driven by the desire of users to expand the horizons of communication. </p><p>  A year later, ARPANET became international by connecting the UK and Norway via telephone cable.  In the seventies, the first computer network was mainly used for sending mail. </p><p>  In 1983, the term Internet was assigned to ARPANET, and the next year a domain name system appeared. </p><p>  The history of the Internet continued with the creation of other networks that are based on data transfer protocols.  A special role was played by John Postel, who developed and standardized several network protocols: IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Telnet, FTP, DNS. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1984, the NSFNet inter-university network appeared, including other small networks, to which about ten thousand computers were connected during the year. </p><p>  1988 was the year of the development of chat, a protocol that allowed real-time communication. </p><p>  In the late eighties, the history of the Internet has regained new names.  Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who developed <span>the HTTP protocol,</span> HTML, URIs, proposed the concept of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989. </p><p>  In 1990, the first computer network left the arena of the Internet, and the <span>World Wide Web</span> by 1995 became the main provider of information on the Internet. </p><p>  Currently, the world is not conceived without the Internet.  The search for useful information, shopping, business, entertainment - it is difficult to list all the features of the global network. </p><p>  The history of <span>creating email is</span> no less interesting than the history of the development of the Internet.  Back in 1965, Tom Van Vleck and Noel Morris developed the first MAIL program.  In the future, other scientists made efforts to create a modern look and functionality of e-mail: </p><p>  - Ray Tomlinson - special mail programs and the introduction of the @ symbol, which linked <span>the username</span> and the domain name in the address bar. </p><p>  - Larry Roberts - a program for creating and sorting lists of letters. <br>  - Steve Walker - first mailing list </p><p>  - John Vittal - a <span>mail program</span> that provided the ability to compose a response to a received message, forward letters and sort correspondence. </p><p>  A significant event was the year 1976, when the <span>English Queen</span> Elizabeth II first took advantage of e-mail. <br><br>  Over three decades, email has gained immense popularity.  Today it occupies a leading position in relation to other <span>methods of transmitting information</span> on the Internet.  The software allows you to contact anywhere in the world from any computer, send not only a text message, but also files of other types.  Such e-mails as emoticons, spam and viruses came to e-mail. </p>
