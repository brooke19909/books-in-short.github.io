In addition, you will need a plastic container for drinking yogurt (or any other that resembles the shape of a human body) and a thick wire.  We recommend using not too thick tights with a density of no higher than 40 den for the manufacture of this craft.  Remember that too strong lycra products do not stretch well and can complicate your work.  We also advise you to tear the sintepon with your hands into pieces, and not cut off with scissors, otherwise the surface of the pupa may turn out to be uneven. </p><h2>  The technology of manufacturing frame textile toys </h2><p>  So, dolls from nylon tights with their own hands are made as follows.  The frame is initially made.  Two wire segments are inserted into the plastic bottle, which in the future will become the arms and legs of the doll.  Next, small pieces are cut from the wire, which will be fingers.  It is advisable to try to observe proportions, making them of different lengths.  These segments are attached to the hands with electrical tape.  So, the wire frame is ready.  Next, we start working with sintepon.  It will allow us to give the body of our doll a beautiful shape.  We cut the synthetic winterizer into strips 2 cm wide. We lubricate the parts of the toy body with glue and begin to wrap the obtained strips of hands, legs, torso and even fingers. </p><h2>  Frame dolls from nylon tights: do it yourself with our own hands </h2><p>  After the body of the toy takes a realistic shape, you can begin to manufacture the head.  We tear off a piece of synthetic winterizer and give it the shape of a ball. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to sew a doll from nylon tights" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/337676.jpg?1392924745211" width="525"></div>  We make a small protrusion - the nose.  We tear off another piece of padding polyester and wrap it around his head.  Now we take kapron tights and cut out a rectangle from them.  We wrap the synthetic winterizer ball into the resulting segment, collecting the material from above and below.  We take two tailor pins and use them to mark the places of the hooks.  Tighten the nose on both sides.  Next, we need to form the nostrils: we pull them diagonally.  We form the wings of the nose.  Now outline the mouth and cheeks.  We make two ducks, forming a smile.  Ears can also be made if desired: two places are marked with pins.  Ducks are made from the center of the ear down and up.  We make doll eyes from two monophonic buttons.  We draw the pupils with blue and black varnishes.  Sew them on the face.  If desired, glue cilia on the eyelids.  Do not forget to make the eyebrows: we select them with two horizontal hooks.  Here we have such a cute smiling face.

Let's give it a spherical shape.  Now we will form a small piece of synthetic winterizer and roll it up - this will be the nose of the doll.  Next, make two more pieces for the cheeks.  Roll up the material preferably denser.  We form sponges from two small stripes.  We also make from syntepon another two medium-sized balls, which later become the legs of the ass.  Now we take a sock and wrap a head ball with a capron.  Next, insert the ball for the nose into the capron and install it in the center.  We also push the cheeks and two strips for the lips.  We place the legs in the lower left and right corners of the sock.  We tighten the edge and fix with threads (wrap and tighten).  We cut off the excess part of the capron, leaving only a small "tail".  We can easily hide it under the hair or headdress of the doll.

Beginners are advised to flash every detail using a new thread.  So, we proceed to the design of the <span>face of the doll</span> from nylon tights with our own hands.  First, we take a large needle intended for stitching knitted products, and we correct all the lumps with it, moving them to the right places.  That‚Äôs it, now you can proceed to the immediate tightening of the face.  To do this, use beige threads and a needle.  First, make out the nose of the doll from nylon tights.  The instruction is as follows: we take it, squeeze it and stitch it from above (between the eyes), and then we pull it down to the desired thickness of the nose bridge.  Next, we sew the nose diagonally, forming the first nostril.  After that, we raise the needle up to the starting point, and from there we pass the needle into the second nostril.  Return the needle to the starting point.  Now let it go down again, pierce a place just above the nostrils, make a stitch, and come back.  We perform another stitch and send the needle up to the starting point of the nose bridge.  Next, do the same with the second nostril.  You should get a beautiful snub nose.  It remains to slightly raise it.  To do this, we take the needle up to the bridge of the nose, grab the fabric and pierce the capron slightly higher, put the needle back (to the back of the head).  Thanks to this, the nose rises.  We fix the thread behind the head and make a knot.  That's it, the pull is ready.

    <h2>  Popeye face muzzle: cheeks and sponges </h2><p>  How to make beautiful cheeks?  First, we outline a point near the nose and drive a needle into it, make a stitch, return the needle back, but we puncture the fabric not in the same hole, but select a new point, a little closer to the nose, go back and fasten with a knot.  On the other side of the nose we make the second cheek by analogy.  We pass to the lips.  We take a thick needle, we adjust the synthetic winterizer to the nose.  This is necessary so that the sponges are chubby.  We take the needle and pass it to the working point on the left cheek.  We make a stitch in the right cheek, letting the thread between the upper and lower lips.  Tighten, form a knot.  Now we launch the needle back to the point on the left cheek, laying the thread under the lower lip.  The result was a charming mouth.  Also, do not forget to make the legs on the legs.  Now you know how to sew a doll from tights.  It is not difficult to make such a mini-pop, the main thing is to work with pleasure. </p>
