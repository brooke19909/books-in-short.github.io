Candolim, like Sinquerim, is considered most convenient for guests to relax.  This beach is very popular with guests of North Goa.  Many tourists come from all over India to look at it.  Therefore, it is always noisy and crowded.  <span>Candolim beach is</span> covered with soft fine sand.  The waves at sea here are always quite high.  Therefore, Candolim beach is most popular among young tourists who know how to swim well.  There are no jellyfish and biting plankton in the sea in this place.  The tourist infrastructure on this beach is developed just fine.  At least, there are many cafes and restaurants where you can inexpensively have lunch or dinner on the coastline. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, there is no</span></span></span> <span><span><span>tour desk at</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Per Avel Beach Holiday Home</span></span></span> <span><span><span>in Candolim (India)</span></span></span> <span><span><span>.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Therefore, guests should plan their trips to various <span>sights of North Goa</span> independently</span></span></span> <span><span><span>or by contacting their tour operator.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The closest place to visit</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Per Avel Beach Holiday is</span></span></span> <span><span><span>worth visiting</span></span></span> Agriturismo <span><span><span>(1.5 km).</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This historical monument appeared on Goa in the time of the Portuguese.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Aguada fortress once performed two functions.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Firstly, it protected the city from enemies, and secondly, it served as a place to store water supplies.</span></span></span> </p>
