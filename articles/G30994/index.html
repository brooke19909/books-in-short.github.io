    <h2>  The oldest exhibits </h2><p>  You can easily trace the evolution in the development of the company, because the museum presents products from 1977 to the beginning of the XXI century.  The pearl of the collection are such rarities as the Apple I and Macintosh.  All exhibits are in working condition.  You can not only inspect equipment - on laptops and computers it is allowed to print text, draw, "climb" in the system.  Each visitor has the opportunity to test the device - play the first computer games. </p><p>  Among the exhibits you can see the Apple II, which appeared in 1987.  It was the <span>first serial personal computer of</span> the time.  Apple II offered users sound, color graphics, a plastic case, as well as the integrated programming language BASIC - this was the beginning of a revolution in the development of personal computers.  This computer worked with a TV and floppy disks.  The popularity of Apple II was so high that it can now be compared with the popularity of the iPhone.  Computers of this series were produced until 1992. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Failures </h2><p>  Apple Museum of Technology has another interesting collection.  The company had really failed models.  Apple III is a computer for business.  It was developed by a group of engineers.  The machine was technically so designed that when a person bought it or received it by mail, it could no longer work.  With a little vibration, the connectors went out, and the computer became unusable.  This was the first failure of Steve Jobs. </p><p>  Apple Lisa is named after Steve Jobs's daughter.  The computer had a number of successful innovations: a separate keyboard, a hard disk built into the case.  The biggest minus of the car was its price, which amounted to 10 thousand dollars.  The Lisa series of computers is considered commercially unsuccessful. </p>

    <p>  The first Macintosh also started unsuccessfully.  The line of personal computers got its name from the Malus variety of apples "McIntosh".  With compactness and convenience, it had a very small memory - only 128 kilobytes, and sold extremely poorly.  But it was here that the graphical interface was used for the first time, and graphic and text editors were also applied.  It is a curious fact that the <span>first computer mouse was</span> installed on this series of computers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Successful models </h2><p>  Fortunately, the black bar soon ended, and successful developments appeared.  Apple Museum of Technology will introduce tourists to this part of the company's history.  Externally, the Macintosh Plus practically did not differ from <span>Macintosh computers.</span>  But there are two big advantages.  The memory grows to 1 megabyte, which could be expanded to 4. And there is an interesting interface with which the Macintosh Plus could transmit and store data on an external hard drive. </p><p>  Solid externally and externally Macintosh II has gained popularity among users.  The museum presents models of this series with a vertical monitor, which was convenient for book publishing, because the size of the screen corresponded to the size of a sheet of A4 paper. </p><h2>  The first bold decisions </h2><p>  To stay afloat, it was not enough to produce standard devices.  Bold innovations were required.  They will be opened to tourists by the Apple Museum of Technology.  For example, the Macintosh LC is a computer built without a single screw.  At a price acceptable to the middle class.  Macintosh TV is a model with a built-in TV receiver and the ability to connect a VCR. </p>

    <p>  In 1997, iMac series computers appeared, designed for convenient access to the Internet (the letter i in the name indicates the Internet).  The advantages of the iMac were a beautiful case, translucent panels, the absence of a floppy disk - only the CD-ROM remained.  The price of the computer was only 1300 dollars.  It could also be carried, he had a special pen.  The only incident - the mouse model was round, beautiful, but terribly uncomfortable. </p>

    <p>  But soon this problem was solved with the help of a standard form overlay.  The first iMac models were aquamarine, the color of subsequent batches was constantly changing, and at the same time, the power of their processors was growing. </p><h2>  Technically unusual models </h2><p>  iMac G3 - a convenient case, practical handles on the sides, one movement - and it opened, and the computer was equipped with a special lock system so that not everyone could open it. </p><p>  iMac II attracted users with screen freedom.  The turn of the monitor was 180 degrees.  This model is called the Jobs bulb, because when they made the first cartoon on Pixar, the screensaver had a very similar lamp.  At least for the sake of this exhibit it is worth visiting the Apple Museum of Technology.  Guest reviews say that this is the brightest item in the collection. </p>
