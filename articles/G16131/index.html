    <p>  The beach is just a 5-minute walk away.  The towel can be changed at any time at the reception.  Sunbeds free enough, you can even choose the color.  Beach workers will put a deck chair anywhere.  For small tips, they can open coconuts. </p><p>  The beach bar sells only drinks.  Cocktails are not very good quality.  But they say that they did so on purpose so that vacationers would not get drunk, but also from thirst so that they would not die.  There are practically no merchants on the beach. </p><p>  You can‚Äôt swim in the sea at night.  This is carefully monitored by the coast guard.  But admire the endless sky and constellations is available to everyone. </p><p>  In the ocean, the water is clean, algae and other garbage is not.  There are always animations on the beach.  Rhythmic music sounds, you can do water aerobics or zumba.  You can ride kayaks, catamarans and sailboats absolutely for free.  The entrance to the ocean is gentle, which is great for swimming with young children. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Every evening, the hotel hosts animation.  Many tourists claim that there is little interesting, but not annoying.  For the evening program, the animators work hard during the day.  Choreographers rehearse with groups throughout the day to delight guests in the evening.  There are scenery on the stage that change every day. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel staff does a good job.  For a small tip, you will be extremely polite and courteous.  Cubans love to be given small gifts.  They will be happy even with regular toothpaste, since Cuba has a lot of stress with this.  Such little things can significantly improve the quality of service and even establish friendships.  For an additional fee, you can hire a separate Russian-speaking guide who will accompany you throughout the rest period. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Going to such a distance just for the sake of the ocean is not entirely advisable.  The hotel also does not have much entertainment to spend all day in it.  Every tourist who comes to Cuba will definitely want to explore all the significant sights of this country, which are many here.  Seasoned vacationers are advised to visit the following interesting places: </p><ol><li>  All of Varadero can be seen by taking a double-decker bus ride.  For the whole day of a fascinating journey you will pay only 5 cookies.  You can get off at any stop, take a walk, and then board the bus with the same ticket and drive on. </li><li>  You should definitely visit the crocodile farm.  But it‚Äôs better to do this as part of an excursion that provides a stop in the Indian village of Guamu and the beach of the Caribbean Sea.  The only drawback is the lack of locker rooms on the beach.  Tourists had to ride wet on the bus.  But the coast itself is incredibly picturesque. </li><li>  An excursion to Mantanzas and B√©llamar Cave takes half a day.  It is an atmospheric Cuban city with its own history.  It is very beautiful in here. </li><li>  You should definitely go to Trinidad.  It is an ancient city with colonial-style buildings, towers and ancient streets. </li><li>  It is believed that if the traveler did not visit Havana, then he did not see the real Cuba. </li></ol><p>  All excursions can be arranged with the hotel guide.  So it will be much cheaper. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  Be Live Experience Hotel Turquesa 4 * is an ideal place to relax in Cuba.  The complex is famous for good value for money.  You feel at home here.  Food is of the highest rating.  The food at the hotel is so varied and tasty that many guests for the entire period of their vacation do not even have time to try all the dishes. </p><p>  But in Cuba, travelers go not only to lie on the beach.  This is an incredibly interesting resort with a friendly atmosphere.  Local attractions will tell a lot about the history of the country, about its unusual past.  And friendly Cubans love to show tourists all the delights of national color. </p>
