People leave reviews about this town often.  After all, every person who gets here is satisfied.  Holidays in the town are wonderful. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Lucca <span>(Italy), the sights of</span> which we will consider in the article, is located near the River Serkio. </p><p>  Its history is rich in various events.  Founded even before our era, the city of Lucca in the period of early feudalism occupied a very favorable position.  It was at the intersection of roads that led to Rome, Parma, Florence, Pisa and Looney.  In addition, the city was on the way of pilgrims who went from northern Europe to Rome.  From century to century, the rulers of the city have changed.  By the end of the eighth century, the city was the residence of the Dukes of Lombard, then passed under the auspices of the Frankish Count.  It was the capital of the Margraves of Tuscany. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages it was a rich city.  Mainly due to the development of banking and the sale of silk.  The city achieved particular power in the fourteenth century, under the rule of Castruccio Castrani.  From the seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth, Lucca was the second largest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Italy</span> with a republican form of government.  During the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, this city was turned into a principality and transferred under the auspices of the sister of the French emperor - Elise Bachchokka.  And in the mid-nineteenth century, the city became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.  And this is not a complete list of all the political upheavals that fell to Lucca. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city impresses all tourists with an abundance of its attractions.  This is an ancient fortress and magnificent temples, incredible natural beauties and chic restaurants. </p><h2>  Lucca Fortress </h2><p>  What is Italy, Lucca proud of?  The attractions of this place are really interesting.  The city is famous for its fortress.  Especially beautifully preserved are two of the four gates of the once powerful fortress.  The Borga Gate, built at the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, as well as the gates of San Gervasio erected in the first quarter of the twelfth century, have great architectural and historical value.  Gates made in the Romanesque style, framed on the sides by two beautiful and powerful towers, skillfully decorated with limestone.  In the inner part of the hemisphere, rare murals have been preserved.  With the image of the Virgin and several saints.  Tourists can admire the San Donato Gate, built in 1590.  Their exterior facade is decorated with sculptures of two lions made of marble. </p><p>  The city walls are the oldest in Europe.  Their length is more than four kilometers.  True, in very small numbers, even the walls built during the Roman Empire have been preserved here.  This wall served to protect the city until the beginning of the eleventh century, until it was destroyed by the Marquis Bonifacodi Tuscany for the rebellion of the townspeople.  A fragment of the ancient Roman wall is part of the wall of the Church of Our Lady of the Rose.  Particularly seriously, the city's inhabitants engaged in the reconstruction of their defensive walls in the sixteenth century, rebuilding them using the best trends in the construction of defensive structures of the time.  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, by order of Maria Louise Bourbon, part of the wall was landscaped and turned into a magnificent park.  Where in modern times there are not only great places for walking, but also cozy cafes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  St. Martin's Cathedral </h2><p>  It is often said that a city like Lucca is a city of hundreds of temples.
