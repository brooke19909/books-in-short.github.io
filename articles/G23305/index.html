    <p>  Of course, according to many customers, the main advantage of the hotel is its proximity to the sea - five minutes walk to Putnam beach, ten minutes by taxi - and you are already on <span>Palolem beach.</span>  It is possible to sleep with the window open, quietly, calmly, because near the hotel there are no parties, discos, only the sound of waves is heard. </p><p>  If you are looking for a place to relax - Sea View Resort 3 * is just for you.  Visitors note that the service is friendly and smiling, the room is always clean and new towels are provided. </p><p>  The hotel has few tourists, so no clutter and noise does not threaten you.  Thanks to the security service, you are always protected, at night the hotel gates are closed.  The restaurant serves delicious food and is inexpensive. </p><p>  Some guests complain about room service, because in order to clean you need to ask.  They do not provide free water here.  There is constant noise from the side of the road. </p><p>  Also, some tourists claim that this hotel has terrible service, absolutely poor quality and very slow service.  But it‚Äôs hard to say how objective are the tourists leaving such reviews, because everywhere and always there is someone who for some reason does not like it. </p><p>  Having summarized and revised a wide variety of responses about this place, we can safely say that the hotel is worthy of its 3 stars.  Agree, coming to rest in a hotel of this class, you need to rely on the 3 * declared by the administration, and not expect, as much as we would like, 5 *. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  The hospitality of the hotel, comfortable conditions and amenities will certainly be remembered by tourists and will leave a good impression of Goa.  Excellent, clean and calm beaches, amazing landscapes, interesting culture and entertainment will make you return here more than once. </p><p>  Hotel Sea View Resort 3 * is always glad to new guests.  He will make your stay even better! </p>
