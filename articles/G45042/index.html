  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forex - features, strategies, general tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Interbank currency exchange at free rates and prices has been developing very rapidly and for more than a dozen years.  The system began in 1971, when Richard Nixon, the president of the United States, abandoned the gold standard by allowing free dollar exchange.  The formation of the international monetary system began actively with this historical event, gradually more and more new participants were drawn into this currency game.  Now the market captures all countries of the world and many world currencies, which are quoted there as the main types of value. <br><br>  You can talk about what Forex is forever, but the whole principle of this system for a person who wants to make money is the simple principle of "buy as cheap as possible - sell more expensive."  The standard principle of conducting trade agreements and cases, but not only within the currency, but also in any world trade.  We need to find the lowest possible rate, buy a certain amount of currency, and then resell at a higher cost. <br><br>  The difference in profit is the final revenue.  It is natural that a huge number of participants in this market will not be able to constantly remain in profit.  In order for one person to work, someone else must suffer losses, which is quite natural in the framework of the economic situation of the planet.  Traders (namely, the so-called people who earn on the difference in exchange rates) work exclusively for themselves, and themselves bear full responsibility for all possible risks.  Since the exchange rate is largely unpredictable, no one can predict its movement at 100 percent, all analytical forecasts and models are based solely on all previous estimates. <br><br>  Through companies such as Alfa-Forex, it is possible to minimize risks through intermediation.  A demo account is issued to the trader, which can immediately be used to start the game on the exchange.  In addition, within the framework of this system, it is not necessary to be a trader, since investors have recently earned no less.  It all comes down to the need to invest in successful traders in order to receive high interest income.  No one can guarantee the complete absence of any risks, but they will always be lower if an experienced player is in control of the account. </p></div></article>
