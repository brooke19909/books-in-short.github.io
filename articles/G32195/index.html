According to a huge number of people, the best option is the one that is made with your own hands.  For this reason, we suggest exploring various ways to decorate a vase with your own hands. </p><h2>  What can be decorated? </h2><p>  To begin with, you can transform not only a vase, but also any vessel.  Or rather, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe technology under study is to turn a glass jar, a bottle and even a plastic glass into a real work of art.  In this case, you can use almost any material at hand.  It all depends on the imagination of the needlewoman. </p><p>  It is also important to note that it is not necessary to decorate empty containers.  If you wish, you can originally design closed (most often the choice falls on alcoholic beverages), and then present it to a loved one, friend or colleague. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="twine vase decor" class="if uuid-3075822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075822.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Regardless of what you plan to decorate the vase with your own hands, you will need glue.  Basically any clerical, but in some cases you will have to use the "Moment".  Then it is better to purchase the "Moment Crystal".  There is nothing to say about the rest of the materials and tools.  After all, you can literally work with anything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most popular are vases with mosaic patterns.  It is carried out with the help of an egg shell.  Vases wrapped with twine are also considered fashionable.  Of interest are those that are decorated with openwork fabric, ribbons, buttons and other sewing paraphernalia.  As we noted earlier, it all depends on the wishes of the needlewoman.  However, in the article we propose to consider step-by-step execution of the most spectacular options. </p><h2>  Decoupage eggshell bottles </h2><p>  A similar idea is implemented quite simply, but it looks (with quality work) really impressive and expensive.  If you also like this option, prepare: </p><ul><li>  eggshell; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  brush - at will; </li><li>  white water-based paint; </li><li>  white paper napkins with a pattern; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Do-it-yourself vase decoration is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The first step is to prepare the shell.  To do this, you can fill it in a package, and then roll it out with a rolling pin. </li><li>  Then apply glue to a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe washed and dried vessel. </li><li>  Fill the area with shell pieces, laying them out at a distance (not more than 0.5 cm) from each other. </li><li>  Having designed the whole bottle in this way, we leave it to dry.  It will take about 3-4 hours. </li><li>  Then we coat the work with paint and also dry thoroughly (7-10 hours). </li><li>  At the next stage, cut out pictures from napkins and glue them on a vase.  Sushim. </li><li>  At this, the do-it-yourself vase decoration master class ends.  But if you wish, you can open your craft with varnish to extend the service life. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tremontgrand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage vases" class="if uuid-3075805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075805.jpg"></div><h2>  A bottle decorated with pasta </h2><p>  Various food products have recently gained enormous popularity.  Moreover, they use everything - the possible and the impossible.  But the most popular material for creativity is pasta.  Therefore, we suggest using them for decoration of a vase. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This requires: </p><ul><li>  pasta of various shapes and sizes; </li><li>  glue "Moment-Crystal"; </li><li>  spray can with black (or other color) acrylic paint. </li></ul><p>  Decorating a vase with your own hands implies simple manipulations: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we paint the prepared vessel with paint. </li><li>  We wait until it dries completely.  Usually 10-12 hours is enough. </li><li>  Then with glue we attach the pasta.  In this case, you can completely rely on your imagination. </li><li>  After drying, dry the craft.  About 3-4 hours. </li><li>  And proceed to the final stage.  We take a spray can and spray it onto a vase from a short distance. </li><li>  We are waiting for drying again. </li></ol><h2>  Twine Vase Decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lenny-face.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vase decor" class="if uuid-3075392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075392.jpg"></div><p>  A similar version of the craft is also in great demand.  Therefore, if you decide to give it to someone from your loved ones, you are unlikely to lose.  In this case, it is better to take as a basis a glass bottle of complex shape. </p><p>  To implement the idea you need: </p><ul><li>  twine; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  small and medium pebbles; </li><li>  dried leaves; </li><li>  leather harness; </li><li>  two types of glue; </li><li>  awl and hook. </li></ul><p>  Step-by-step description of decorating a glass vase: </p><ol><li>  First, make a hole in the tube of PVA glue. </li><li>  We stretch twine through it. </li><li>  Wrap the vase with a rope dipped in glue.  Dry for 3-4 hours. </li><li>  Then we draw up the lower part of the vase with small pebbles.  We attach them to the glue. </li><li>  On the main part of the "Moment-Crystal" we glue a leather cord, more leaves and pebbles.  Dry for 3-4 hours. </li></ol><h2>  Decor groats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.lenny-face.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY vase decor" class="if uuid-3075386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075386.jpg"></div><p>  Another great idea is implemented much easier than it seems at first glance.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves!  First, consider the necessary materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  gouache or watercolor; </li><li>  2 small bowls; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  semolina. </li></ul><p>  Description of the process of decorating your own vases with the photo presented above: </p><ol><li>  First, mix the semolina and glue in both bowls.  As a result, a curd-like mass should be obtained. </li><li>  We make one a little thinner and add a little paint of any shade.  Mix. </li><li>  We use a mixture for decoration - we roll up sausages and attach to a vase, forming a pattern. </li><li>  Then we dry the finished craft for 10-12 hours.  If desired, after it can be coated with colorless varnish.  Although it is permissible to leave it like that. </li></ol><h2>  Elementary option </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pl.tutkrabov.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple vase decor" class="if uuid-3075425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075425.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to make a simple and effective option, you can use the instructions below.  It begins with the preparation of tools and materials for creativity: </p><ul><li>  adhesive tape (both paper and regular); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  spray can of acrylic paint. </li></ul><p>  It is important to note that this idea is suitable for decorating glass vases with your own hands.  Because such crafts look much more interesting and more expensive.  The principle of operation implies the following actions: </p><ol><li>  First you need to cut strips of adhesive tape of the desired width. </li><li>  Then stick on the vase, creating the desired geometric pattern. </li><li>  Next, take the paint and spray on the entire surface. </li><li>  Carefully remove the adhesive tape. </li><li>  And leave the vase to dry.  About 10-12 hours. </li></ol><h2>  Fabric decorated vessel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric vase decor" class="if uuid-3075446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075446.jpg"></div><p>  To implement this idea, you will not have to perform extremely complex manipulations.  Rather, if you do not want to create a spectacular product of an interesting shape, decorated with an abundance of details and other inventions.  The simplest option requires preparation: </p><ul><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  a cut of thin tissue of sufficient size; </li><li>  spray paint of the color you like. </li></ul><p>  When everything you need is at hand, we proceed to decorate the floor vase or smaller specimen.  The creative process involves the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Wet the fabric with glue.  It is important that the material is well saturated. </li><li>  Then we wrap the prepared vessel with it.  Moreover, it is necessary to create many folds.  Then the craft will look more interesting. </li><li>  Do not forget to bend the corners of the fabric inside the vase to get a beautiful and neat edge. </li><li>  After leaving the product to dry.  Since in this case we soaked the entire canvas, the drying time is 24 hours. </li><li>  When the necessary time has passed, we paint the vase with a spray can.  If desired, you can add decorative elements to your taste.  Although the craft is already quite textured.  Can be left in the original version. </li><li>  Finally, we can only wait until the paint has completely dried.  About 3-4 hours. </li></ol><h2>  Button Decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="izbushkinet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="button vase decor" class="if uuid-3075751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075751.jpg"></div><p>  The following idea is as simple to implement as it is original and attractive.  To implement it, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  glue "Moment-Crystal"; </li><li>  many different flat buttons; </li><li>  spray can of favorite color. </li></ul><p>  It is important to consider that decorating a floor vase with your own hands involves preparing a huge number of buttons.  Therefore, in the absence of the necessary material, creativity will be very expensive.  Perhaps it is worth preparing a smaller vessel? </p><p>  Regardless of which vase you decide to decorate, the actions will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we glue the vessel with buttons.  Dry for 3-4 hours. </li><li>  After we cover the crafts with paint. </li><li>  And dry again 10-12 hours. </li></ol><h2>  Natural decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="izbushkinet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decor vases shells" class="if uuid-3075752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3075752.jpg"></div><p>  Many people bring from the sea many small shells, pebbles, and glass.  However, then they don‚Äôt know where to adapt them.  Creative craftswomen propose to decorate them with a vase.  For this we need: </p><ul><li>  shells, pebbles, glass; </li><li>  glue "Moment-Crystal"; </li><li>  colorless varnish - if desired. </li></ul><p>  When everything is ready, get to work: </p><ol><li>  We glue every detail with glue and place it on a vase.  In this case, you can place one object on top of another.  The main thing is to be beautiful. </li><li>  After the transformation, leave the vase to dry for 4-5 hours. </li><li>  After (optionally) varnish.  Or we don‚Äôt touch anything and immediately present it to friends. </li></ol><p>  So, in the article we examined the most original and simple ideas.  With which even beginner craftswomen will cope.  However, it is not necessary to execute them exactly. </p>
