After the release of the supposedly eVic Supreme, the vapers faced a problem: there were no clearomizers on sale to reveal all the capabilities of the device.  As a result, the designers developed the perfect Joyetech Delta Clearomizer model. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  <span>Clearomizer is an integral part of the electronic cigarette.</span>  <span>The design of the device provides for two main parts: an evaporator and a tank for storing liquid.</span>  <span>There is a special wick and spiral in the evaporator.</span>  <span>As a result of heating of the spiral, steam is formed.</span>  <span>A distinctive</span> feature of the Joyetech Delta Clearomizer is its amazing transmission and the absence of extraneous odors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ecigmods.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique Joyetech Clearomizers" class="if uuid-3093951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3093951.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, the evaporator becomes unusable, so carbon deposits form on the spiral, and the wick is poorly saturated with liquid.  This leads to a deterioration in the transmission of taste, vaporization and the appearance of a bitter aftertaste. </p><h2>  Device specifics </h2><p>  Many call Delta Clearomizers a real revolution in the vaping market.  The <span>Delta</span> series is <span>aimed at connoisseurs of powerful clearomizers, which differ in diameter.</span>  <span>A large tank volume, stylish design and excellent taste transfer - all this made this development very popular.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vardex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Practical Clearomizer" class="if uuid-3093928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3093928.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Evaporators have three spirals, in which a fluid supply system is correctly designed.</span>  <span>The resistance of the spirals is 1.4 Ohms, which allows them to maximize their capabilities.</span>  <span>The case of the device is made of stainless steel, and the liquid tank is made of tempered glass.</span>  <span>The main feature of the evaporator is the presence of three air inlets.</span>  <span>The product has a special traction control system.</span>  <span>If necessary, users can easily replace the mouthpiece and connector.</span>  <span>Clearomizers are made in two color options: in black and stainless steel.</span>  <span>Reviews about Joyetech Delta Clearomizer will help to create an objective opinion about this device, as well as understand the specifics of its device.</span> </p><h2>  Model Delta 19 review </h2><p>  The design feature of this model is a diameter of 19 mm.  <span>The manufacturer offers two product options: double-spiral and three-spiral.</span>  <span>The device has high power and works on third-generation evaporators.</span>  <span>The Joyetech Delta clearomizer is completely disassembled, so any item can be easily replaced or washed.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clearomizer Delta 19" class="if uuid-3093945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3093945.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The volume of the tank is 3.5 ml.</span>  <span>The air ring allows you to adjust the tightening force.</span>  <span>Reviews about the Joyetech Delta 19 clearomizer report that the device uses interchangeable evaporators, which delight clubs with thick steam and good taste transfer.</span>  <span>Many vapers talk about how the device will look harmonious on any mod.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Delta 2 Model Overview </h2><p>  This model is equipped with a special interchangeable Delta 2 - LVC heater.  Clearomizers of this type have an adjustable fluid supply.  The user can adjust the required diameter of the hole through which fluid is supplied to the spiral.  User reviews contain information that the device has the function of air supply and draft level adjustment.  The Joyetech Delta 2 Clearomizer has a large glass tank with a volume of 3.5 ml.  Users can replace the mouthpiece, because it has a standard diameter.  <span>The clearomizer is equipped with a connector, so it is compatible with any battery mod.</span>  <span>However, users report that not all mods can fully reveal the potential of this model.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.premiumecigarette.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clearomizer Delta 2" class="if uuid-3093890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3093890.jpg"></div><p>  The clearomizer has impressive dimensions, since the body hides a vertical spiral of solid thickness.  The heating element simultaneously processes a large amount of the mixture, and the maximum power is about 50 watts.  User reviews report that at maximum settings the device provides a huge amount of steam, so it can give odds to professional smoke machines.  As a drawback, the owners of the device note a loud sound that appears even at a power of 30 watts.  Many users appreciated the unprecedented power, stylish design and the presence of several evaporators.  <span>Reviews report that in the device you can independently set a comfortable air supply mode.</span>  <span>Some users talk about the significant drawback of the clearomizer, which is the flow of fluid, regardless of the settings of the device.</span> </p><h2>  Delta 16 model overview </h2><div class="photo" data-original="." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Convenient Clearomizer" class="if uuid-3093887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3093887.jpg"></div><p>  Clearomizer has a simple design, which greatly simplifies the operation process.  The device consists of a mouthpiece, a reservoir and a base.  User reviews report on the economical consumption of evaporators, which lasts for one month of intensive use.  The Joyetech Delta 16 Clearomizer is equipped with a durable mouthpiece with 510 type connector, which is highly resistant to elevated temperatures and mechanical damage.  Such a connector is compatible with the vast majority of battery mods.  Many consumers like the stylish look and roomy tank of the device. </p><p>  Numerous users talk about a simple and convenient refueling procedure that even a person who sees an electronic cigarette for the first time can handle it.  It should be noted that medium nicotine content mixtures can be perceived very ‚Äúfirmly‚Äù at high power. </p><p>  Users claim that the Delta 16 is ideal for people who want to purchase both a powerful and compact clearomizer.  Model Delta 16 is the ancestor of the entire line of clearomizers.  Vapers claim that the model can not leave anyone indifferent, because it has excellent taste and durability. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  Joyetech Delta clearomizer owners recommend purchasing evaporators that are designed for this device.  You should not save and buy cheap analogues, since it is impossible to predict how the clearomizer will work on another evaporator and what this may lead to.  Users are not advised to use the device <span>at high power, as this directly affects the battery charge and mixture consumption.</span> </p>
