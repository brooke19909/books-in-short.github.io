Probably nowhere else are there so many carnivals, traditional street processions and costume parades.  Moreover, the Spaniards celebrate secular and religious holidays with the same scale.  Here is the largest number of restaurants and clubs in Europe.  Clear sunny weather is in Spain almost all year round.  People from all over the world come here to relax in order to plunge into the festive and joyful atmosphere of the sun, sea, smiles, <span>Mediterranean cuisine,</span> bullfighting and flamenco.  A striking representative of this holiday is the small town of Calpe.  This article provides a brief overview of holidays in Calpe (Spain), reviews of tourists and photos. </p><h2>  Calpe - Mediterranean Pearl of Spain </h2><p>  Calpe is one of the most respectable and popular resorts on the Costa Blanca.  With the invasion of tourists, a small fishing village has turned into a fashionable resort with a population of more than 30,000 people. In the season, tourists increase the number of people living on this stretch of coast to 200,000. </p><p>  The history of Calpe has always been connected with the sea.  For centuries, the inhabitants of the village were engaged in fishing and cultivating olive plantations.  For several centuries in a row, the coast was subjected to pirate raids.  The ruins of the fortress wall and watchtowers testify to those times.  The territory of Calpe has always been inhabited by a variety of peoples. </p>
