  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summer Holidays: Dzhubga</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Tuapse district, on the banks of the Dzhubga Bay, there is a surprisingly beautiful place, which the shapsugs <span>(indigenous people)</span> call the ‚ÄúValley of the Winds‚Äù.  This is the resort village of Dzhubga, hidden in the forests that have grown along the valley of the river of the same name.  Young people and families love to stay here, who want to enjoy peace of mind away from noisy centers.  And people traveling in their cars often spend their holidays here. </p><p>  Dzhubga was founded in 1864.  At first it was a village, then a village, later a village.  In the sixties of the twentieth century, she received the status of a resort village. </p><p>  The location of the village is very good: it‚Äôs only 50 km to Tuapse, and a little more than a hundred to Krasnodar.  Thanks to this neighborhood, many Kuban people come here for a weekend break. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation dzhubga" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15539/311988.jpg" width="448"></div>  Dzhubga in the summer </h3><p>  The wonderful subtropical climate, <span>coniferous forests</span> and the breeze that blows here even on the most gentle summer day make this place unique and inimitable.  Forest, mountain, river and sea created a special humid climate, similar to the Mediterranean.  You can swim from May to October, but the hottest month is August, when the average temperature is set at +26 <sup>0</sup> C. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the natural local attractions is Mount Hedgehog.  From a distance it resembles a large hedgehog who came to the shore to get drunk.  Also in Dzhubga is one of the largest Caucasian tile dolmens dating from the III millennium BC. </p><p>  From entertainment, it should be noted the museum "Fads of the Forest" created and opened by a local craftsman.  Guests are greeted by a large concrete dinosaur, and the museum itself exhibits more than a thousand exhibits of wood. </p><p>  For active pastime, you can choose a jeep, ATV rental and excursions.  The village is located at the crossroads of three roads, so from here you can move at least to Gelendzhik, at least to waterfalls, even to Abkhazia. </p><h3>  <strong>Evening promenade</strong> </h3>

    <p>  Cozy cafes and restaurants serving local cuisine in the afternoon, are filled with live music in the evening, and closer to the night, they host discos. </p><p>  In 2008, a water park was opened.  The resort offers over 20 water rides, slides and pools.  And at night, young people have fun at discos and <span>foam parties.</span>  Vacationers should definitely visit it at least once for a vacation. </p><p>  Dzhubga is not the noisiest place on the coast, but there is enough entertainment for everyone. </p><h3>  <strong>Residence</strong> </h3><p>  There is everything for those who come on vacation.  Dzhubga has a developed resort infrastructure.  Pensions, health resorts and sanatoriums are surrounded by shady gardens and parks in which rare relict trees grow. </p><p>  There are very decent <span>private hotels that</span> provide a high level of comfort at appropriate prices. </p><p>  There is also housing for those who choose a vacation in the private sector.  In Dzhubga, you can stay in guest houses, apartments or rent a room with the owners. </p><p>  Resort rules apply here: the closer to the sea, the worse the service and higher prices.  In high season, cheap housing is hard to find. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dzhubga rest at sea" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15539/311989.jpg" width="448"></div>  Dzhubga: rest on the sea </h3><p>  Sea activities here are the same as everywhere: bananas, jet skis, pills.  Once a day, a boat departs from the shore, taking tourists to <span>Inal Bay.</span>  In its center is a lake with blue clay.  Healing baths are absolutely free, and the rest of the therapeutic mud vacationers run to wash off into the sea, which is why the bottom in this place also turned blue. </p><p>  The sea in the bay is affectionate, and the long beach, stretching for 800 meters, is strewn with fine pebbles, interspersed with sand.  The entrance is smooth and gentle, vacationers with young children really like it. </p>
