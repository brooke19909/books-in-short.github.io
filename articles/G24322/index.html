Many mothers make such products in order to capture their baby on a beautiful background next to the digit.  After all, children grow up so fast, and parents want to leave memories of their babies.  Although growth figures are made not only for babies' birthdays, one can often see that such products are prepared, for example, for the fiftieth anniversary of a person.  By the way, you can either make a volumetric number 2 from cardboard with your own hands, or buy it, but of course, the first option is much more pleasant and economical. </p><p>  To create a craft, you do not need to have any special skills, even a person who is far from creativity and needlework will cope with the manufacture.  Older children can be involved in the manufacture of decor, entrusting them with simple operations, offering to choose the color of the future figure or, for example, twist the flowers.  This will contribute to the development of fine motor skills, as well as the child and mother will have a good time together. </p><h2>  Types of Growth Figures </h2><p>  Two can be made in two forms: volumetric figure and flat.  Both that, and another will look great at a children's holiday.  The fundamental difference is as follows: the volumetric figure can stand on the floor due to its own design, and flat - only with support or show off in the arms of the baby. </p><p>  By the principle of manufacturing, the 3D trick will, of course, be created longer and with the use of more materials.  Flat can be done quickly and easily.  This article will tell you how to make a three-dimensional number 2, as well as the usual one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Materials for the manufacture </h2><p>  In order to create the number 2 with your own hands, you will need: </p><ul><li>  cardboard (you can take an old cardboard box); </li><li>  paper tape; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  scissors or clerical knife; </li><li>  glue or glue gun; </li><li>  corrugated paper or napkins; </li><li>  tape; </li><li>  twine; </li><li>  any decor elements as desired. </li></ul><p>  The larger the number, the more expensive it will be at the time of creation.  The same applies to materials, they will require quite a lot. </p><h2>  How to make volumetric number 2: wireframe </h2><p>  Such a product looks more impressive, but it will also take 5 to 6 hours to manufacture it.  So, first things first. </p><p>  First you need to take cardboard, draw a number 2 of the desired shape and size on a sheet with a simple pencil.  If you think a small two, then you can print it on a printer, on a regular A4 sheet, then circle it on a cardboard sheet.  Use a stationery knife to cut the part. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makebakecelebrate.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric digit creation" class="if uuid-3181776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3181776.jpg"></div><p>  How to make volumetric number 2 from cardboard to keep its shape?  Pretty simple.  To do this, you need two elements of a digit.  You do not need to draw it again on another sheet ‚Äúby eye‚Äù or measure it with a ruler, just attach the cut-out part, circle it with a pencil on the whole sheet.  Thus, the elements will be the same.  The second digit is also cut out.  Put them together and trim the edges if necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lakelandconnect.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="number two made of cardboard" class="if uuid-3181786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3181786.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the figure to stand, you need to make the sides.  To do this, the cardboard is cut into strips 10-15 centimeters wide.  Now you need to start the most difficult part - the assembly of the frame.  To do this, you need to lay and fix the strips of cardboard between two parts of the paper with paper tape so that they are between the "deuces".  Carefully glue the frame around the entire perimeter so that it does not stagger.  As you can see, making volumetric number 2 with your own hands is not at all difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ww1.speechfoodie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric figure" class="if uuid-3181759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3181759.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, by analogy with this technique, you can make large letters.  It is not necessary to make the whole name, for the photo shoot only the initial is enough. </p><h2>  How to make volumetric number 2: decor </h2><p>  Now let's get down to the fun part: the design of the deuce.  To do this, you can take corrugated paper (Italian or Chinese, but the first will be much more expensive) or paper napkins.  Cut into squares of approximately 7x7 or 10x10 cm. If you use corrugated paper, you need to stretch it a bit before cutting, it will become a little softer and its consumption will be less.  When using napkins, you can not measure the squares with a ruler, just cut them into folds.  If the elements are very large, then they can be further cut into four parts. </p><p>  Next, put a pen in the center of the square and crush it.  Glue the middle of the resulting ‚Äúflower‚Äù onto the cardboard frame.  Parts must fit snugly together.  Thus, you need to glue the entire frame.  In order to make the digital look more spectacular, you can make it two-tone with a smooth transition of colors. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="h-sEBDgahts" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-sEBDgahts&amp;t=2s" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/6/4/3/5/16435.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a flat number </h2><p>  So, with the question of how to make volumetric figure 2, we figured it out, now let's move on to the second view.  Such a product is much easier to create than the previous one.  To do this, cut out only one part of the digit.  The second "deuce" and narrow strips of cardboard on the sidewalls are not needed. </p><p>  Further, you can also decorate it with napkins in the same way as a volumetric figure.  The digit can be pasted over with corrugated paper, satin ribbon, twine.  A manufacturing option for such a work can be seen in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="number 2 is flat" class="if uuid-3181773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3181773.jpg"></div><p>  A two-piece, partially trimmed with any flowers, beads, will also look very beautiful.  Ready-made buds can be used to save time. </p>
