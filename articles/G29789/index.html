    <h2>  <span>Yalta: Attractions</span> and Entertainment </h2><p>  This city has various architectural monuments, museums, parks, clubs, etc. One interesting attraction is the castle, located in the village of Gaspra, on the ledge of Cape Ai-Todor - the <span>Swallow's Nest.</span>  The price of a boat trip along the cape is quite acceptable (you can‚Äôt say exactly, since it changes every year), and you don‚Äôt have to pay at all for a walk along the observation deck.  For lovers of hiking there is an excursion to the castle along the Black Sea, where you can enjoy nature and no less amazing views.  Or you can arrange a self-guided tour if you know how to get to the Swallow's Nest.  In any case, you will get an unforgettable experience, you can make memorable photos and, of course, buy souvenirs. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clubs of yalta" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/947858.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Massandra Palace </h2><p>  Fans of historical architectural monuments should visit the Massandra Palace in the village of Massandra, near Yalta.  This complex began its history since 1783.  It was originally designed by the French architect Bouchard in the Neo-Baroque and Neo-Renaissance styles on the orders of Count Vorontsov.  But after the death of the count (before the end of construction), the palace was acquired by Alexander III.  And it was already finished according to the project of Messmacher, which made significant changes to the decor of the building.  Now, the Massandra Palace has turned into a museum, the first and second floors of which were occupied by the exposition of the palace interior.  Halls of the third floor are given for exhibitions. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2>
