    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  If we talk about the negative moments of rest at the Cosmos Hotel, the most significant are the following: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is located next to the courtyard of a residential building, and therefore, if your windows do not look outside, the room will be quite noisy; </li><li>  guests are allowed only by appointment and for a strictly limited time; </li><li>  linen is changed quite rarely - about once a week; </li><li>  there is no way to pay by credit card; </li><li>  in summer, there is an acute shortage of air conditioning in the room; </li><li>  despite a fairly fresh repair, there are small cracks on the plaster; </li><li>  the room does not have a hairdryer or large bath towels (all this must be requested at the reception); </li><li>  the bathroom has very poor lighting and ventilation; </li><li>  the rooms have very poor soundproofing, and therefore noise from the kitchen and the corridor will interfere with you; </li><li>  the cafe has a very uncomfortable schedule, and there are no similar establishments nearby. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Cosmos Hotel in Yaroslavl is an excellent option for those who are looking for affordable accommodation near the city center.  This hotel is often chosen by those guests of the city who stay for a long period.  The hotel is located in a quiet residential quarter, and therefore there is a fairly calm atmosphere.  The city center can be reached on foot or by bus.  I am glad that on each floor there is a shared kitchen where you can cook for yourself.  But the cafe here leaves much to be desired.  It is located on the ground floor, and only breakfasts deserve attention here. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the rooms in this hotel are quite comfortable, despite the simple atmosphere.  It has everything you need for a full stay and relaxation.  Pleased with fresh repairs, as well as the fact that the furniture in the room is new and designed in the same style.  There is also a good shower, which is a rarity for budget rooms.  But there are also shortcomings.  For example, cracks in the walls, as well as poor ventilation.  There is no electric kettle, hairdryer, iron and large bath towels.  In general, the living conditions and related services are fully consistent with low cost. </p>
