  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest in Abkhazia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes people mistakenly believe that the most beautiful places are somewhere far away from them, that you can have a good rest only abroad, forgetting about the beauties that are very close to them.  Against the backdrop of general excitement regarding the Arab countries and Europe, tourists somehow lost sight of the small, friendly Abkhazia and completely did it wrongly.  This small state borders with Russia and Georgia.  It is worth noting that holidays in Abkhazia due to its <span>subtropical climate</span> are no worse than the famous resorts of the world.  Here is a huge number of architectural monuments, beautiful gorges and grottoes, clean beaches and comfortable hotels. </p><p>  Vacation in Abkhazia attracts many Russians because of its affordable price and lack of a visa regime.  Most importantly, in this small republic there are so many places that you must visit.  In the capital of <span>Abkhazia, the city of</span> Sukhumi, there is <span>Theater Square,</span> which goes directly to the embankment, to the sea.  It is so named because it houses the Abkhaz State <span>Drama Theater, Drama Theater</span> .  S.Ya.  Chanby and the Central Exhibition Hall of the Union of Artists.  Another street that travelers have chosen is Leon Avenue, where the Botanical Garden is located.  It was built in 1838.  A large number of subtropical plants are grown here: flowers, shrubs, trees.  You can visit the Botanical Garden any day, any time of the year.  Next to it is the Abkhaz State Museum, which displays household items and valuable finds made in the territory of Abkhazia, Egypt, Georgia, etc. Here is another hedgehog that will make your vacation in Abkhazia unforgettable, this is the Monkey Nursery.  The main purpose of its existence is scientific, but tourists can also visit the nursery. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most often, vacationers choose Gagra for their holidays - the most resort city in this republic.  It was here that the heroine of the Soviet comedy "Ivan Vasilievich Changes the Profession" was going to.  In the city there is an old Gagra fortress, the hotel is now operating within the walls of the bark.  Only a part of the wall and several towers remained from the fortress itself.  Another old building is the Gagra Temple, which was created by the first Christians as early as 6-7 centuries.  The building is very simple and rough, unprocessed stones were used for its construction.  Inside it is the entrance to the underground tunnel leading to the sea.  Acquaintance with the oldest buildings of this country will make the vacation in Abkhazia interesting and exciting.  In Gagra, in an area of ‚Äã‚Äã14 hectares in 1902, the Seaside Park was founded, where today about 400 species of plants grow.  Here, forever green plants were mainly planted, many of them were brought from foreign countries. </p><p>  Almost all tour operators offer their customers last-minute trips to Abkhazia, which makes vacation almost free.  In view of the fact that the tourism business in the republic is developing rapidly and today hotels are operating here that can compete with European hotels of a good average level, it makes sense to give preference to such a small and native Abkhazia.  The republic has a single currency - the ruble, which greatly facilitates the vacation of Russian tourists.  Great nature, clean cities, excellent Caucasian cuisine, centuries-old interesting history - all this can be obtained practically for nothing, if you buy last-minute tours to Abkhazia.  You can come here with a big company, families with children or young couples who want to spend a vacation together.  Local beauty and hospitality will not leave anyone indifferent.  Have a nice rest! </p>
