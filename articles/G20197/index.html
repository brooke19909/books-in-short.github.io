It is located in the west of the Republic, 45 kilometers from the well-known metropolis of Izmir.  It was founded at the foot of Sipil, a mountain range and is surrounded by magnificent vineyards.  In the south of Manisa is a famous national park.  The city is a very large industrial center, next to the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  Rapidly developing, facilitated by fertile soils and proximity to Izmir. </p><h2>  A bit about the history of the city </h2><p>  The entire region, including the administrative center, has an ancient history, each stage of which is reflected in the monuments of local art and architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manisa Turkey" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/440491.jpg" width="600"></div>  The birth of the city of Manisa (Turkey) has its roots in the depths of millennia.  Once upon a time it was called ‚ÄúMagnesia at Mount Sipila‚Äù, and, according to the works of Homer, arose after the end of the <span>Trojan War.</span>  In 1901, Roman troops defeated the army of the famous Antiochus III, who longed for a foothold here.  In 1313, Sarukhan Bey, the Seljuk leader, came here and entrenched, and after a century and a half Manisa entered the Ottoman Empire.  During the Ottoman rule, the city and the region were the most important administrative unit of the empire, since it was believed that the local governors, the heirs of the Sultan, became the first contenders for the throne.

    <h2>  Manisa (Turkey): Attractions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this settlement and its surroundings are not saturated with attractions, like some other regions, there is also something to see here.  History could not leave no trace for such a long time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manisa Turkey Photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/440494.jpg" width="600"></div>  Let's talk about some of them.  First of all, you need to pay attention to the many mosques that are dispersed throughout the city.  And each of them is distinguished by its own unique history.  For example, the Sultan Mosque, built in 1522 by the daughter of the <span>Crimean Tatars</span> Khan Mengli Giray and the mother of the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.  Its complex included a psychiatric hospital and madrassas.  Now this place is famous for the holiday held on the vernal equinox - Mesir.  Everyone on this day can try for free the legendary miracle cure - Mesir paste.  By order of the Sultan Murad in 1585 an amazing mosque of Muradiye was built.  Imagine, 12 kg of gold was spent on its design.  On the slope of the mountain, on the ruins of the basilica, in a green park, in 1367 the Big Mosque was built, which was a complex of structures: a turbine, Turkish baths, a madrasah, a patio with several fountains and a dervish monastery - Mevlevehan.  Do not forget to bring a camera with you when you go to the city of Manisa (Turkey).  Photos taken here will for a long time remind you of the wonderful time spent in these places.  How many impressions can be obtained by contemplating the ruins of the city of the future, Sardis, the former capital of Lydia, a powerful state of the beginning of the VIII century BC

For example, the ancient city of Kutahya, carefully preserving Turkish traditions.  Its fame lies in the monuments of Ottoman architecture and in china.  In the 19th century, the famous Hungarian national hero Lajos Kossuth lived here.  His house has been turned into a museum.  Not far from Kutahya, in Chavdarhisar, is the ancient city of Aizana.  At important transport interchanges is Usak, which is famous for its carpets.  The local museum of archeology exhibits Karuma - world-famous treasures.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the city we are considering, in September, every year, a grape festival is celebrated.  As already written, beyond the outskirts there are its extensive plantations.  Most of the harvest is spent on making wine.  Raisins are made from the rest of the grapes and exported.  If you decide to visit the city of Manisa, Turkey will gladly open its arms to you.  But whether you set out to attend a grape festival or some other, to inspect local architectural monuments and sights, keep in mind that one day is not enough.  So book a hotel for yourself, and there are many of them, for every taste and budget, come and enjoy your vacation. </p>
