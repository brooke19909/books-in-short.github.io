    <p>  The Gold Horde formed in the Middle Ages, and it was a really powerful state.  Many countries tried to maintain good relations with him.  Herding became the main occupation of the Mongols, and they did not know anything about the development of agriculture.  They were fascinated by military art, which is why they were wonderful riders.  It should be especially noted that the Mongols did not accept weak and cowardly people into their ranks. </p><p>  In 1206, Genghis Khan becomes a great khan, whose real name is Temuchin.  He managed to unite many tribes.  Possessing a strong military potential, Genghis Khan defeated <span>East Asia, the</span> Tangut kingdom, North China, Korea and Central Asia with his army.  Thus began the formation of the Golden Horde. </p><p>  <span>This state</span> lasted about two hundred years.  It was formed on the ruins of the <span>empire of Genghis Khan</span> and was a powerful political entity in Desht-i-Kipchak.  Gold Horde appeared after the <span>Khazar Kaganate</span> died <span>,</span> she was the heiress of the empires of nomadic tribes in the Middle Ages.  The goal set for the formation of the Golden Horde was to take possession of one branch of the (northern) Great Silk Road. </p><p>  Eastern sources say that in 1230 a large detachment consisting of 30 thousand Mongols appeared in the steppes of the Caspian region.  It was a site of nomadic Polovtsy, they were called Kypchaks.  The many thousands of <span>Mongol army</span> went to the West.  On the way, the troops conquered the Volga Bulgars and Bashkirs, and after that they captured the Polovtsian lands. </p><p>  Genghis Khan appointed Jochi to his eldest son, who, like his father, died in 1227 as a ulus (region of the empire) in Polovtsian lands.  Complete victory over these lands was won by the eldest son of Genghis Khan, whose name was Batu.  He and his army completely subjugated Ulus Jochi and stayed on the Lower Volga in 1242-1243. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In these years, the <span>Mongolian state was</span> divided into four destinies.  The Golden Horde was the first state in the state.  Each of the four <span>sons of Genghis Khan</span> had his own ulus: Kulagu (this included the territory of the Caucasus, the Persian Gulf and the territory of the Arabs);  Dzhagataya (included the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpresent-day Kazakhstan and Central Asia);  Ogedei (it consisted of Mongolia, Eastern Siberia, Northern China and Transbaikalia) and Jochi (these are the Black Sea and Volga regions).  However, the main was the Ugadei ulus.  In Mongolia, was the capital of the common Mongol empire - Karakorum.  All state events took place here, the leader of the kagan was the main man of the whole united empire. </p><p>  Mongolian troops were militant, they initially attacked the Ryazan and Vladimir principality.  Russian cities again turned out to be the goal of conquest and enslavement.  Only one Novgorod stood.  In the next two years, the Mongol troops captured all of the then Rus.  During the fierce hostilities, <span>Batu Khan</span> lost half of his troops. </p><p>  The Russian princes were divided during the formation of the Golden Horde and therefore suffered permanent defeats.  Batu conquered Russian lands and taxed the local population.  Alexander Nevsky was the first who managed to negotiate with the Horde and temporarily suspend hostilities. </p><p>  In the 60s there was a war between the uluses, which signified the collapse of the Golden Horde, which the Russian people took advantage of.  In 1379, Dmitry Donskoy refused to pay tribute and killed the Mongol commanders.  In response to this, the Mongol Khan Mamai attacked Russia.  The <span>Battle of Kulikovo</span> began <span>,</span> in which the Russian troops won.  Their dependence on the Horde became insignificant and the troops of the Mongols left Russia.  The collapse of the Golden Horde was completely completed. </p><p>  The Tatar-Mongol yoke lasted for 240 years and ended with the victory of the Russian people, however, the formation of the Golden Horde is difficult to overestimate.  Thanks to the Tatar-Mongol yoke, the Russian principalities began to unite against a common enemy, which strengthened and made the Russian state even more powerful.  The formation of the Golden Horde is estimated by historians as an important stage for the development of Russia. </p>
