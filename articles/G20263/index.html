  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lightweight browsers for Android: an overview of the best programs, features, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Judging by the statistics of sales provided by mobile phone stores and online stores of mobile gadgets, the best-selling devices are not premium, and not flagship, but budget models of smartphones.  Such data is especially applicable to Russian consumers who are accustomed to counting every ruble. </p><p>  Devices of such a plan have never been distinguished by an impressive set of chipsets and a high performance indicator as well.  Nevertheless, despite the disadvantages of such a choice, a clear plus in the face of the cost of the gadget comes with a decent margin. </p><p>  On budget devices, the list of correctly working applications is noticeably shorter than that of premium counterparts, so it‚Äôs quite difficult to find normally functioning software without lags and brakes.  This problem also concerns the subject of our article - browsers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the lightest browser for android" class="if uuid-2935509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935509.jpg"></div><p>  On the same ‚ÄúGoogle Play‚Äù there are a lot of them, but not every web browser pleases the user with a good response, speed and functionality.  In the case of budget smartphones, it‚Äôs worth looking at a separate caste of such applications - light browsers for the weak Android.  They consume system resources to a minimum and at the same time allow surfing the network calmly and without nerves.  This segment of web browsers we will just consider in our article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We present to your attention an overview of the lightest browsers for weak Android gadgets.  Consider the main features of the applications, notable features, as well as the opinions of users regarding each product. </p><h2>  Opera touch </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest browsers for Android.  Initially, the web browser was designed to control with one hand, which is very convenient for those who are used to an active lifestyle: trips, walks, a gym, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpolice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="opera touch" class="if uuid-2935510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935510.jpg"></div><p>  For such cases, a special mode is provided - Fast Action Button.  With it, you can open the settings and change tabs in one click.  But at the same time, some functionality disappears.  After disabling the Fast Action Button, the browser goes into normal mode, designed for two-handed control. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techpp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="opera touch browser" class="if uuid-2935507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935507.jpg"></div><p>  One of the best and lightest browsers for Android takes up very little space on the internal drive and consumes RAM to a minimum.  In addition to the usual tools for surfing, users in their reviews note the presence of such a useful mode as Flow.  After activating it and launching the web browser, only a search bar appears on the main screen, which further simplifies the application and speeds up its work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Judging by user reviews, the lightest and fastest browser for Android is able to recognize not only text, but also voice requests, which greatly simplifies working with it while driving.  There is also basic virus protection and terminal encryption for greater security, which is also pleasing. </p><p>  Browser Features: </p><ul><li>  convenient one-handed interface; </li><li>  quick search mode; </li><li>  the ability to exchange data with friends (personal tape); </li><li>  voice search; </li><li>  own antivirus; </li><li>  ad blocker. </li></ul><h2>  Yandex Browser Light </h2><p>  Another easy and fast browser for Android from the domestic search engine.  The code of the web browser is written on the Webview engine, which uses a minimum of system resources and does not load the processor with RAM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="browser.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex light browser" class="if uuid-2935508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935508.jpg"></div><p>  The platform code is qualitatively optimized as part of standard Google tools.  Lightweight browser for "Android" takes up very little space on the internal drive and can easily work in the background. </p><p>  Not without branded applications from Yandex.  Here we have progressive support for the Yandex.Zen service, which, taking into account your requests and wishes, will provide news that is relevant to you specifically and some related information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also familiar tools in the face of visual bookmarks, panels with history, plugins and add-ons.  But you should not get involved in the latter, otherwise the web browser can hardly be called a light browser for Android. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Users respond very well about this app.  The browser really loads the system to a minimum and is very undemanding to a set of chipsets and firmware.  You can run it and work normally with it even on the most ancient smartphones. </p><p>  Browser Features: </p><ul><li>  nice and intuitive interface; </li><li>  the availability of an intelligent and complete Yandex.Zen service; </li><li>  convenient bookmarks and toolbar; </li><li>  "Smart" search working in tandem with "Alice". </li></ul><h2>  Firefox focus </h2><p>  The desktop version of Firefox cannot be called light, because a web browser for a PC is demanding on the amount of RAM and allocates a decent amount of megabytes from RAM for each open tab.  But the mobile application with the prefix ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù can be safely designated as an easy browser for ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techwibe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="firefox focus" class="if uuid-2935505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935505.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main advantages of this web browser is its advanced privacy modes.  The browser with due care blocks all tracking tools, from analytical services to social and advertising trackers. </p><p>  The users liked the application interface.  It is intuitive, simple, and very easy to manage.  The main browser screen is not burdened with unnecessary elements.  There are no shortcuts, icons, transitions, etc. that are familiar to desktop and advanced versions of web browsers, which would at least somehow affect the speed of the application. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  The main screen is an address bar and nothing more.  This approach ensures perfect concentration, and at the same time, quick work.  Judging by user reviews, some important functions were cut out for the sake of speed, but for owners of budget and low-power devices, Firefox Focus has become an ideal tool for surfing. </p><p>  Browser Features: </p><ul><li>  advanced privacy modes; </li><li>  great tools to block ads; </li><li>  Instantly delete your browsing history </li><li>  ascetic, but at the same time convenient and nice interface; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù line with the ability to connect a voice assistant. </li></ul><h2>  Naked browser </h2><p>  The name of this lightweight browser for Android speaks for itself - ‚Äúnaked‚Äù (naked).  This web browser really looks naked.  There are no tools familiar to such applications: no menus, no toolbars, but only one search bar with the current web address. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aryo27.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="naked browser" class="if uuid-2935504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935504.jpg"></div><p>  This browser is perfect for owners of very ancient and low-power mobile devices, whose resources are extremely limited.  After installation, the web browser will not ask you to open access to the contacts, messages or other sections of the phone.  This again allows you to save extra megabytes from RAM that connect the browser with local data. </p><p>  Despite the lack of a menu as such, managing a web browser is very simple.  The interface is changed using simple gestures, and you just have to drive a search query into the address bar.  It is simply impossible to get lost in management. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Users leave mostly positive reviews about the browser.  Those who are sitting on old gadgets are happy with everything, but the owners of more powerful smartphones lack the functionality familiar to web browsers: bookmarks, folders, panels and more. </p><p>  Browser Features: </p><ul><li>  minimum requirements for system resources of a mobile device; </li><li>  high speed of work; </li><li>  ascetic and extremely simple interface; </li><li>  gesture management; </li><li>  verification, authentication and other synchronization with phone data or accounts are not required. </li></ul><h2>  APUS Browser Pro </h2><p>  This browser will be especially useful for those who prefer video content to text.  The developer focused on technologies that reveal exactly the video component: flash players, HTML5 players, and other tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seedroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apus browser pro" class="if uuid-2935506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2935506.jpg"></div><p>  So if there can be any problems in the above browsers like lags or delays when playing videos, then here the code is hit from and to.  Even at the minimum Internet connection speed, you can get a perfectly suitable video sequence.  Provided, of course, that you have to wait a bit while the content is processed in the buffer. </p><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  As for the interface, users call it pretty, convenient and practical.  Owners of weak devices with a small amount of RAM were also satisfied with the decent speed of the browser. </p><p>  Users note that, unlike other Chinese applications and web browsers in particular, this is almost completely devoid of advertising, and during operation, the blocks of some ‚ÄúAliexpress‚Äù do not pop up at the most inopportune moment on the whole screen. </p><p>  Browser Features: </p><ul><li>  excellent playback of video content even with a low speed Internet connection; </li><li>  simple, intuitive and beautiful interface; </li><li>  almost no advertising; </li><li>  convenient work with menus and bookmarks. </li></ul>
