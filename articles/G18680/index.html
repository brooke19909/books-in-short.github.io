Fillet knitting is one of them.  Its grace lies in its simplicity.  But there are some nuances that allow you to create really chic things for your wardrobe or home. </p><h2>  Foundation basis </h2><p>  Fillet crochet is an alternation of several loops and columns in certain patterns.  As a rule, they are similar to patterns on cells or monochrome embroideries.  To create things in this technique, you need to know how the air loops (v.) And the double crochets (st. N.) Fit together. </p><p>  An air loop is the basis of all crochet.  It is obtained by pulling the thread through the working loop without any additional actions.  Several of these elements create a chain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sirloin crochet patterns" class="if uuid-2397939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397939.jpg"></div><p>  A single crochet column is done like this: </p><ul><li>  The working thread is thrown over the hook, as for further knitting.  p., does not extend inward. </li><li>  The hook is inserted into the canvas and catches the thread on the other side. </li><li>  After that, it turns out that there are three working loops on the instrument: new, double crochet and main. </li><li>  At the next stage, the thread is drawn through the first of them and two loops remain on the hook. </li><li>  In the end, you need to knit them so that one loop remains on the working tool. </li></ul><p>  This will turn out a little protruding above the edge of the canvas part in the form of a column.  Then it remains only to disassemble the patterns and patterns for sirloin crochet to get started. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of loin knitting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet square sirloin" class="if uuid-2397947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397947.jpg"></div><p>  You can knit products in this technique in different ways: with individual motifs from the center, a rectangular cloth with front and back loops, in a circle, like a sock or mittens.  Each of them has its own characteristics. </p><p>  If you knit a separate motive from the center, you need to correctly turn it into a square.  For this addition, the loops in each row are made only at the corners with the same distance between them, so as not to disturb the geometry.  For example, we make an initial ring and a chain of 3 in.  n. for lifting.  Then in the same ring we knit 7 tbsp.  n., alternating them with one in.  n. The last column after 1 c.  p. we connect with the chain of lifting, knitting in its second loop. </p><p>  The second row we do this: 5 in.  p. for lifting, 1 tbsp.  n., 2 in.  item, 1 tbsp.  n., 5 c.  item, 1 tbsp.  n  in the same place as the previous column.  We continue to knit according to this pattern until the row is over.  The following are done the same way, but in each of them the number of cells from the air loops and double crochets will be added. </p><p>  Fillet crochet solid fabric even easier.  You need to dial the required number of air loops in one chain.  The calculation is made so that 4 loops of the base are accounted for in one cell.  You also need to remember the lifting chains.  The number of loops in them is 4. So, count the fifth loop from the hook and knit a crochet into it.  Further we work according to the scheme: 2 c.  item, 1 tbsp.  n  When the row ends, turn the fabric over and knit a new one according to the same pattern, starting with the lifting chain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern of fillet crochet in a circle is the same as the previous one, except that a chain of air loops of the base must be connected with a ring.  In this case, knitting will always be on the front side, the fabric does not need to be turned over at the end of each row. </p><h2>  How drawings are created </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2397959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397959.jpg"></div><p>  The basics of fillet knitting is the creation of a checkered fabric that can be ‚Äúpainted over‚Äù.  This is pretty easy to do.  The cell that needs to be filled fits a little differently.  When the first double crochet is created, you do not need to make a chain of air loops.  Instead, two double crochet columns are crocheted for filling and the third is its outer line. </p><p>  But the further creation of the pattern on the canvas is the alternation of filled and empty cells.  Therefore, in this technique you can create the most unusual patterns that can be transferred to a notebook in a cell. </p><h2>  Where to get patterns? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fillet crochet different patterns" class="if uuid-2397960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397960.jpg"></div><p>  Here is just this question fillet crochet copes best.  You can find examples of finished products and transfer them to a notebook sheet.  To make it easier to count, you can draw any ornament yourself, or you can look at the <span>monochrome cross-stitch patterns.</span>  These are great options for translating them into a finished product.  Even some bobbin lace patterns can be useful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is still a rather difficult option.  Take the finished black and white drawing and apply a grid of cells to it.  Most of it will translate perfectly to the layout format.  With the same cells that will be partially filled, it is worth doing this: if more than 50% of them are filled, make them completely black, if less than this amount, leave them white. </p><p>  And one more nuance: it is not at all necessary to make the main pattern filled with cells, because this creates a too transparent product, which is not always appropriate in some elements of clothing.  You can "paint over" the background, leaving only the necessary cells to create a pattern.  This will help to connect a fairly dense canvas with slight accents of lace. </p><h2>  The hardest thing to do </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet picture" class="if uuid-2397958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397958.jpg"></div><p>  A significant part of sirloin knitting patterns does not have a strict report (repetition of pattern elements).  Therefore, experienced craftswomen recommend carefully monitoring the number of empty and filled cells, because this is the most difficult thing to do. </p><p>  It will be even more difficult if you knit the fabric in a circle.  In this case, you need to read the scheme from right to left, then from left to right.  If this is not done, then the pattern will be smeared, and the pattern will turn into abracadabra.  In order not to get confused during the work, in addition to the scheme, hook and thread, take a pen or pencil with you.  At the beginning, we can designate those rows that will be knitted in the opposite direction.  You can also delete one that is already ready.  This will allow you not to get confused and not stray during operation. </p><h2>  What can be connected? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sirloin crochet skirt" class="if uuid-2397985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397985.jpg"></div><p>  That's just at this moment the fantasy does not limit the craftswoman in any way.  The technique of fillet crocheting allows you to create a wide variety of household items.  Most often they knit clothes (especially beachwear), napkins and tablecloths, bedspreads, handbags and even curtains. </p><p>  Using this technique allows you to realize the most unusual ideas.  For example, you can tie a top or blouse with a picture of your favorite animal or flower or make a long skirt on the floor, along the hem of which beautiful floral ornaments will rise up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sirloin crochet blouse" class="if uuid-2397988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397988.jpg"></div><p>  But do not forget that all these products turn out to be quite transparent, therefore it is better to take care of the contrast lining in advance so as not to look vulgar with almost bare parts of the body that will be visible through the pattern. </p><h2>  Features of the development of technology by beginners </h2><p>  Although sirloin crocheting seems like a fairly simple technique, it also has its own nuances.  And if they are neglected, then the work will have very little value. </p><p>  So, each subsequent double crochet should be knitted to the top of the column of the previous row.  This ensures clear lines in our squares. </p><p>  If it is necessary to fill the box, then the inner columns can be knitted under the chain of air loops, which is located below.  This will speed up the work and will not stretch the loops, which will definitely stretch from the introduction of a working tool into them. </p><p>  Do not over tighten the loops and select a hook that matches the number of yarn.  If this is not done, the fabric may become too stiff and rough, which is not typical for fillet knitting.  It should be light and soaring, and not hang in a heavy piece. </p><p>  The most exquisite things are obtained from thin threads.  For these purposes, "Iris" or "Chamomile" is perfect, you can use other yarn, but not thicker than a hook of 1.5-2 mm.  Thicker options seem too heavy.  Their only appropriate use is pillowcases on pillows.  Obviously, woolen and terry yarn is not suitable for this technique. </p><p>  If you consider these recommendations, then filet crocheting for beginners will be just a godsend in mastering the features of working with a hook. </p><h2>  The use of technology in the interior </h2><p>  If you need original curtains on a covered terrace, and to them in the same style sofa cushions, tablecloths, and maybe cloaks for sofas and chairs, then you have found the perfect way to bring your idea to life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sirloin crochet curtains" class="if uuid-2397982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2397982.jpg"></div><p>  Among other crochet methods, this one looks the most exquisite.  Of course, there is a lot of work to be done, but if you take up it at the beginning of the cold weather and spend only an hour or two on long winter evenings, by spring you will get the most elegant set for any room that you need to improve. </p><p>  Of course, in this example, everything is a little exaggerated, but you can tie a pillowcase on a sofa cushion for a couple of evenings.  And, believe me, it will stand out against the background of purchased ones, even if they cost a lot of money. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Above, we examined in detail fillet crochet.  Useful tips of experienced craftswomen will help you quickly and easily master this technique.  And she has quite a few options for practical use: from children's clothes to bedspreads on large beds and curtains. </p><p>  The main thing to remember is that the hook and yarn must match each other, so the product will be as light as possible.  You will get used to following a pattern or picture literally in a couple of rows.  But even if you decide to neglect this experience - go for it.  Perhaps this is how you will create something that no one before you could not do. </p>
