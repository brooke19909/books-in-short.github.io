    <h2>  Plyakho village </h2><p>  The private sector is almost the only option to stay in this place.  There are no huge sanatoriums and "tricked out" hotels here.

Rest here is still traditional: noisy parties, night clubs and incendiary discos here you simply will not find.  For all this you have to go to Tuapse.  But in the children's camp "Eaglet" there is a beautiful park with relict trees.  For attractions and entertainment for kids, come to the neighboring resort Novomikhailovsky.  Moreover, to go there no more than five to six minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Private beach accommodation" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1924861.jpg" width="350"></div>
