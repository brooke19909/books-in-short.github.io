    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  In the ratings of countries beloved by Russians for beach holidays, Tunisia is not the last place.  When is it better to go to rest in this state?  This question can be answered if we evaluate the local climate.  The country is located immediately in two natural areas: the Mediterranean subtropical and tropical desert.  The weather in the state is influenced by two main factors: the Mediterranean Sea, which softens and moistens the air along the coast, and the Sahara desert, which in the summer contributes to a significant increase in temperature. </p><p>  Tourists mainly come to the coast, where the mild Mediterranean climate dominates with long <span>hot summers</span> and short rainy winters.  In the summer, the thermometer rises on average from 22 to 32 degrees, and in winter - it stays in the region of 7-15 degrees of heat. </p>

    <h2>  Best season </h2><p>  The main question for those who are going to go to Tunisia: when is it better to go on vacation?  It depends on why the tourist is going to this interesting country.  For those who are eager to swim and sunbathe, but not much "fry" in the sun, the best time is from April to June and September to early October.  In July-August there is quite a lot of heat up to plus 40-45.  But the sea breeze greatly facilitates the existence in such heat.  Therefore, these months are attributed to the "high" tourist season, which affects prices, which increase by 30-40%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But for those who want to get acquainted with the culture and history of this ancient country, March-April and October-November are perfect.  The rainiest months are January-February, and traditionally at this time the flow of tourists is reduced to the lowest levels.  This instantly affects the prices of hotels and food, so those who want to see Tunisia and save a lot of money come here during this period.  Therefore, a definite answer to the question: in Tunisia, what is the best time of the year for a vacation, which is not.  It all depends on the needs and opportunities. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  When going to Tunisia, you need to soberly weigh the pros and cons.  Compared to the usual ‚Äúbeach‚Äù destinations, entertainment and animation services are much less developed in this country.  The state religion is Islam, and this is reflected in many areas of life, including tourism.  In non-resort cities, it is not customary to walk in the beach, that is, with bare arms, chest, legs.  Therefore, it is important to decide, going to Tunisia, where it is better to go on vacation - to small non-tourist cities or untwisted resort places. </p><p>  The state has a low standard of living, and therefore the prices here are not very high.  But away from the tourist routes, you can see almost glaring poverty.  The country has a very long history, so the excursion program here is rich and varied. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel base of Tunisia can not be compared with the same Turkey and Egypt, there are few modern buildings.  The state has long been a French colony, so the main language of international communication here is French, although the English service sector is fluent in English.  But the Russian language is not in use here. </p>

    <h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  Reflecting on which part of Tunisia it is better to go to rest, it is again worth evaluating your desires and interests.  The most famous and popular resorts of the country are Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia, Hammamet.  The latter is the most prestigious and fashionable vacation spot.  Only Djerba island can compete with him in a luxurious vacation, where the best luxury hotels are located.  Prices in these places are above average, but the service is excellent. </p><p>  Sousse is a gathering place for young people, there are many nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and open-air discos, the largest and most famous of which is Voga-Voga.  A universal resort can be called Hammamet, which harmoniously combines the possibilities for a relaxing, and for youth recreation. </p><p>  Monastir can be called calm and quite economical, but you need to be prepared for the fact that the <span><span>tourist</span></span> infrastructure here has long been in need of modernization.  The capital of the country is a real eastern metropolis, therefore it is better to come here for a tour, but not to stay for long, since it is difficult to relax here. </p><p>  One of the youngest and most developing resorts is El Kantaoui, where you can find fairly modern hotels and a good infrastructure for tourists, but the prices here can not be called low. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  More and more Russians recently visit Tunisia.  When is it better to go to rest?  Reviews say that the country is beautiful at almost any time of the year, except for cloudy and rainy January and February, although there is something to do in these months too. </p><p>  Tourists note in their stories the excellent centers of thalassotherapy, fascinating travels in the Sahara and a rich excursion program.  Also, vacationers talk about the excellent beaches of the country with fine white sand and a convenient gentle slope to the water. </p><p>  You can also read in the reviews that additional security measures must be observed in the country, as fraudsters and thieves are often found here, and the rest of the country is friendly and safe. </p>
