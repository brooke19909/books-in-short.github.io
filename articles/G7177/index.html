From <span>time immemorial,</span> people <span>have been</span> following the movement of the stars in the sky.  Astronomical observations of that time helped to navigate the terrain, and were also necessary for the construction of philosophical and religious systems.  Since then, much has changed.  Astronomy has finally freed itself from astrology, has accumulated extensive knowledge and technical power.  However, astronomical observations made on Earth or in space are still one of the main methods of obtaining data in this science.  The methods of collecting information have changed, but the essence of the methodology has remained unchanged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739453.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What are astronomical observations? </h2><p>  There is evidence to suggest that people possessed basic knowledge about the movement of the moon and the sun in the prehistoric era.  The works of Hipparchus and Ptolemy testify that knowledge of the luminaries was in demand in Antiquity, and much attention was paid to them.  For that time and for a long period after astronomical observations were the study of the night sky and the fixation of what was seen on paper or, more simply put, a sketch. </p><p>  Before the Renaissance, scientists’s assistants in this matter were only the simplest devices.  A significant amount of data became available after the invention of the telescope.  As it improved, the accuracy of the information received increased.  However, whatever the level of technological progress, astronomical observations are the main way to collect information about celestial objects.  Interestingly, this is also one of the areas of scientific activity in which the methods used in the era before scientific progress, that is, observation with the naked eye or with the help of simple equipment, have not lost their relevance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations are" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/453605.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Today, astronomical observations are a fairly extensive category of actions.  They can be classified according to several criteria: </p><ul><li>  qualification of participants; </li><li>  nature of data recorded; </li><li>  location. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, professional and amateur observations are distinguished.  The data obtained in this case, most often represent the registration of visible light or other electromagnetic radiation, including infrared and ultraviolet.  Information in this case can be obtained in some cases only from the surface of our planet or only from space outside the atmosphere: astronomical observations made on Earth or in space are distinguished by the third criterion. </p><h2>  Amateur astronomy </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations with binoculars" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739449.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The beauty of the science of stars and other celestial bodies is that it is one of the few that literally needs active and tireless admirers among lay people.  A huge number of objects worthy of constant attention account for a small number of scientists engaged in the most complex issues.  Because astronomical observations of the rest of the near space fall on the shoulders of lovers. </p><p>  The contribution of people who consider astronomy to be their hobby is quite tangible in this science.  Until the middle of the last decade of the last century, more than half of the comets were discovered precisely by amateurs.  Variable stars, observing the Novae, tracking the coverage of celestial bodies with asteroids often also fall into their area of ​​interest.  The latter is today the most promising and sought-after job.  As for the New and Supernova, as a rule, amateur astronomers are the first to notice them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations on earth" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739451.jpg"></div>

This includes astronomical observations with binoculars, a telescope or with the naked eye.  The main goal of such activities, as a rule, is to get pleasure from the opportunity to observe the movement of the bodies, as well as from the process itself.  An interesting branch of this direction is “sidewalk” astronomy: some amateurs take their telescopes outside and offer everyone to admire the stars, planets and the moon. </li><li>  Astrophotography.  The purpose of this direction is to obtain photo images of celestial bodies and their elements. </li><li>  Telescope building.  Sometimes the necessary optical instruments, telescopes and accessories for them, fans make almost from scratch.  In most cases, telescope construction is to supplement existing equipment with new components. </li><li>  Research.  Some amateur astronomers seek, in addition to the aesthetic pleasure, to receive something more material.  They study asteroids, variables, new and supernovae, comets and meteor showers.  Periodically, in the process of constant and painstaking observation, discoveries are made.  It is such an activity of amateur astronomers that makes the greatest contribution to science. </li></ul><h2>  Activities of professionals </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations made on earth or in space" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739450.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Specialist astronomers around the world have more sophisticated equipment than amateurs.  The tasks facing them require high accuracy in collecting information, a debugged mathematical apparatus for interpretation and forecasting.  As a rule, the center of the work of professionals is quite complex, often remote objects and phenomena.  Often, the study of the vastness of outer space makes it possible to shed light on certain laws of the universe, to clarify, supplement or refute theoretical constructions regarding its origin, structure and future. </p><h2>  Classification by type of information </h2><p>  Observations in astronomy, as already mentioned, can be associated with the fixation of various radiation.  On this basis, the following areas are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  optical astronomy examines radiation in the visible range; </li><li>  infrared astronomy; </li><li>  ultraviolet astronomy; </li><li>  radio astronomy; </li><li>  X-ray astronomy </li><li>  gamma astronomy. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the directions of this science and the corresponding observations that are not related to electromagnetic radiation are highlighted.  This includes neutrino, studying neutrino radiation from extraterrestrial sources, gravitational-wave and planetary astronomy. </p><h2>  From the surface </h2><p>  Some of the phenomena studied in astronomy are available for research in ground-based laboratories.  Astronomical observations on Earth are associated with the study of the trajectories of the motion of <span>celestial bodies, the</span> measurement of the distance in space to stars, the fixation of certain types of radiation and radio waves, and so on.  Before the era of astronautics, astronomers could be content only with information obtained in the conditions of our planet.  And this was enough to build a theory of the emergence and development of the universe, the discovery of many patterns that exist in space. </p><h2>  High above the earth </h2><p>  With the launch of the first satellite, a new era in astronomy began.  The data collected by <span>spacecraft is</span> invaluable.  They contributed to a deeper understanding by scientists of the secrets of the universe. </p><p>  Astronomical observations in space allow you to record all types of radiation, from visible light to gamma and x-ray rays.  Most of them are inaccessible for research from the Earth, since the planet’s atmosphere absorbs them and does not allow them to reach the surface.  An example of discoveries made possible only after the <span>beginning of the space age</span> are X-ray pulsars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="astronomical observations in space" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739448.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Information miners </h2><p>  Astronomical observations in space are carried out using various equipment installed on spaceships, orbiting satellites.  Many studies of this nature are being conducted at the <span>international space station.</span>  The contribution of optical telescopes launched several times in the last century is invaluable.  The famous “Hubble” stands out among them.  For the layman, he is primarily a source of stunningly beautiful images of deep space.  However, this is not all that he “knows how to”.  With its help, a large amount of information was obtained on the structure of many objects, the laws of their "behavior".  Hubble and other telescopes are an invaluable provider of data necessary for theoretical astronomy working on the problems of the development of the universe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is astronomical observation" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/739452.jpg"></div>
