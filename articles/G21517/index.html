    <h2>  What vacationers say </h2><p>  Naturally, the reviews about the Fishing Village (Lazarevskoye), as well as about other places, are very different.  Someone does not like the pebble beach, and someone does not like the fact that there are few entertainment venues nearby.  Indeed, the village is quiet and more suitable for families with children, there is no fuss and fewer people, when compared with the center of Lazarevsky.  The village of Rybatsky is suitable for an economical but comfortable vacation on the Black Sea. </p>
