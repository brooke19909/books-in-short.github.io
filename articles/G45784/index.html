Recreation facilities on lake Kisegach</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the Urals, in the Chelyabinsk region there is a system of lakes remarkable in their beauty, in the name of which there is the word Kisegach.  They are located where lowland meets mountainous.  Due to tectonic activity, cracks, faults, folds first appeared in the earth's crust, and then they were filled with water.  So the lakes formed. </p><h2>  Where the forest is cut </h2>

The word "kisegach" means a place, in this case a lake, where a forest is cut.  On the shores of the lakes there really is a lot of forest.  However, they came to this name not very long ago.  In ancient times, it was written differently in various sources (Kisigach, Kis-Agach, Kisegatash and the like).  This name was also translated in different ways.  For example, there was such a meaning as "a lake with steep shores."

In Chebarkulsky district there are Big and Small Kisegach, in Sosnovsky district - just Kisegach, in Kaslinsky - two more lakes with the same name. </p><p>  The largest and most beautiful of them is Big Kisegach.

    <p>  Of course, over such a long period, the lake not only changed its shape, but depending on the climate, it became warmer and colder. </p><p>  Once upon a time the tundra passed along its shores.  Deciduous forests rustled here about nine thousand years ago.  And now in these places you can find birch, pine, oak, linden, elm and other <span>deciduous trees.</span> </p><p>  The primordial nature was preserved in these places, probably because for a long time they were not inhabited.  At least archaeologists have not yet found evidence of parking near primitive people near Bolshoi Kisegach.  No traces of residence and a later period were found.  Only there are burial sites of ancient Scythian origin.  Scientists suggest that it was the Old Believers who were hiding from the persecution of the authorities. </p><h2>  Deep and transparent </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is about 15 square kilometers.  Kisegach is a lake that stretches more than six kilometers in length and four in breadth. </p><p>  In the Chelyabinsk region, Bolshoi Kisegach is one of the three <span>deepest lakes.</span> </p><p>  Its maximum depth is 33 meters.  Only deeper than it are the lakes of Turgoyak and Uvildov.  The depth of the latter reaches 38 meters.  The depth of Lake Kisegach on average over its entire length is 10 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The water on this forest lake is very clean, almost transparent.  The bottom is visible at a depth of 10 meters.  Therefore, rest on Lake Kisegach is so appreciated. </p><p>  In addition, the lake is running water.  Six small rivers flow into it, which mainly originate in the Ilmen mountains.  Some of them connect Kisegach Lake with other reservoirs of the Ural Territory, thereby contributing to travel to these places by boats and catamarans. </p><h2>  Picturesque coast </h2><p>  The coastline of this Ural lake stretches for 26 kilometers.  And there is hardly a corner on it that would not attract with its unique beauty.  Slender pines and birches rise on the stony slopes of the banks, and many other trees and shrubs grow.  At the same time, here and there along the entire coast there are cozy bays, Kurya bays and sandy beaches.  Not surprisingly, recreation centers on Lake Kisegach are popular. </p><p>  In 1969, the surroundings of the Greater Kisegach and the lake itself received the status of a natural monument and a conservation area.  In addition, the western shore of the lake comes close to the Ilmensky state reserve. </p><h2>  Numerous islands </h2>

They are different in size and picturesqueness.  Saddle, Tall, Linden, Donskoy, Kopeshka ... Some names speak for themselves, some are based on local legends and customs.  There are also unnamed islands on the lake.

    <p>  At a time when the water level in the lake decreases (either because of the heat, or for other reasons), stone ridges come out from under the water, which are called loaches.  Birds like to rest on them.  By the way, there are a lot of birds on the islands of Kisegach.  They nest there and stop to rest on long flights.  After all, Big Kisegach is a lake rich in fish, moreover, it is well protected from the winds, since hills surround it from almost all sides. </p><h2>  Fishing island </h2><p>  Not only wonderful nature attracts vacationers to Kisegach, but also great opportunities for fishing.  There are many different fish here: pike, perch, crucian carp, chebak, ruff, tench, ide.  And even smelt and whitefish are rare for these places.  The latter is very large. </p><p>  Fans of fishing not only occupy the shores of the lake, but also master the islands.  And in winter, they fish directly from the ice, setting up entire tent settlements on it.  Attracts them at this time of the year most smelt. </p><p>  It may be possible to hunt on Lake Kisegach, but for this you need to get permission in local forestries.  But on the territory of the <span>Ilmensky reserve,</span> which borders the lake in the west, both hunting and fishing are prohibited. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities on lake Kisegach </h2>

    <p>  Of course, you can relax on the lake on your own, as a tourist, with a backpack and tent.  However, not everyone likes this type of relaxation.  There is an alternative: sanatoriums and recreation centers. </p><p>  Already in Soviet times, Kisegach was a well-known balneological <span>resort in the Southern Urals.</span>  The first holiday home was opened in 1926.  During the war years, a hospital worked there, and in the post-war period, the Kisegach sanatorium was opened.  He is now considered one of the best health resorts in the Urals.  In addition to coniferous forests, clean air, the sanatorium offers mineral baths, procedures with sapropelic mud, hydromassage, magnetotherapy and other various treatments. </p><p>  If you do not focus on treatment, then for a good rest, boarding houses and bases on Lake Kisegach are suitable.  For example, you can settle in the boarding house "Utes" or at the recreation center "Ural Dawns".  The list goes on: ‚ÄúSpark‚Äù, ‚ÄúMetallurg‚Äù, ‚ÄúKisegach‚Äù - these are all recreation centers.  We are glad to see guests both in the Sunny Valley ski resort and in the Utesoff hotel complex.  And in the holiday village Kolokolenki you can rent a house.  So the choice is quite large, the main thing would be a desire to go to these wonderful places. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2>

    <p>  When traveling by car, the easiest way is to take a car map and find Bolshoy Kisegach <span>(lake, Chelyabinsk region) on it.</span>  If you have to go from the side of Yekaterinburg, then you need to move along the Chelyabinsk highway to Miass.  There, turn to Chebarkul.  Before reaching the city for several kilometers, turn onto the road to the lake.  There should be signs: "Big Kisegach" or "Sanatorium" Kisegach ". </p><p>  From public transport, you can choose a train or bus that takes you to Chebarkul.  From there it will not be difficult to get to the Kisegach sanatorium - minibuses and local buses run to it daily.  And indeed, a distance of 5-6 kilometers from Chebarkul to Lake Big Kisegach can be overcome even on foot, getting additional impressions on the way from contemplating the beauty of the surrounding nature. </p>
