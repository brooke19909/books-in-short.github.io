The First World War was supported by America much later than all the allies, however, this allowed it to extract the greatest benefits from this situation.  The USA in the First World War behaved more cunning than Odysseus.  It will be reasonable to note that this practice was adopted by them and with some variations is used even now. </p>

    <h2>  Trickiest of all </h2><p>  In 1918, July and partly August found German and French-Anglo-American troops fighting bloody near the Marne River.  The general offensive of the German troops was the last, since the battle was a failure for them and led to the final defeat.  It was then that American troops first took a direct part in this war.  Prior to this, there was only economic support, not without a certain benefit for themselves.  In the First World War, the United States even overcame the global crisis, which also got the most prosperous of the countries.  It should be noted that in 1913 the industrial production of the United States was ahead of the rest of the world, much more steel and cast iron were produced there, and mining was more successful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we compare the countries of Europe and the USA according to these parameters, then taken together France, England and Germany did not produce so much coal.  The USA in the First World War sharply increased its economic activity.  The Entente fought, so she had to experience certain difficulties.  The United States, in collaboration with the rest of the allies, was able to double production.  It should be noted that it was with their light hand that the mass destruction of people began, never before before: America supplied its allies with chemical and explosives, thus rapidly enriching itself.  But they were not in a hurry to introduce their own US troops in the First World War. </p>

    <h2>  Winners feast </h2><p>  So, the United States preferred a judicial role to military feats ("moral judge," according to President Wilson).  However, when the denouement became clear, Washington was alarmed.  Suddenly it will happen that a peace treaty will be concluded, and at the "feast of the winners" they will have no place.  Only in 1917 a decision was made, and finally the United States entered the First World War.  This slightly extinguished anti-American sentiment among the allies.  Eighty-five thousand US troops entered the <span>battle on the Marne.</span>  Death awaited half of them.  Allies, it must be said, have lost millions at this point.  The objectives pursued by the US entry into World War I are clear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to historian Andrei Malov, the Americans traded very actively with all the warring countries, receiving dividends, raising the class of industry, and reducing unemployment.  And managed to enter the war, when it was time to share the cake.  They managed to participate in this divide.  A redistribution of the world took place, further improving the results of the First World War for the United States.  After the conclusion of peace, the United States took the most interested part in the creation of the League of Nations, in the liberation of Belgium, in returning France to Lorraine and Alsace, in expanding the territory of Serbia with its access to the sea, in rebuilding Poland.  Were concerned about the welfare of other countries?  No, hardly. </p>

    <h2>  "Teaching" democracy in any way </h2><p>  The United States firmly took up the entire device of a dilapidated world.  Economic policy during the war concentrated more than forty percent of all the world's gold reserves in the banks of the United States, and foreign countries owed them twelve billion dollars - at that time the amount was huge.  Wilson and his successors drew up a plan that significantly outlived the creators; moreover, he is still working.  The neocons after Roosevelt formulated the results of World War I for the United States: "We are a model of democracy and we must teach it to all other peoples by any means."  Already after 1918, the largest countries in Europe owed the United States two generations in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What is happening now?  The whole world owes them, and it will not be possible to pay off debts until the very last days of human life.  The USA during World War I created a good reserve.  Immediately after graduation, American tourists took over Europe, learning how to use the difference in exchange rates.  Young Europeans were terribly jealous until the <span>American way of life</span> became the object of blind imitation: technological progress with its poisoned fruits, advertising and gloss.  The USSR was the last on this path, exchanging freedom for the Sneakers.  After all, freedom is not in the accessibility of shameful things, but in equal rights to housing, education, work, rest.  It is easy for a creditor to become not only a trendsetter and a trendsetter, but also a dictator of the aspects of the political economy he needs.  Global hegemony.  Russia and the United States in the First World War played diametrically opposite roles, and then their fate divorced in two completely different ways - to confrontation. </p>

    <h2>  The League of nations </h2><p>  Since 1914, the United States conducted diplomatic maneuvers in the behind the scenes, creating and playing all kinds of dramatic conflicts, while maintaining a neutral status.  And only in March 1917 (April 6 in a new style) did Washington realize the impossibility of further maneuvering.  When the United States entered World War I, President Wilson clearly calculated the situation: a powerful blow could be dealt to the pre-war order, where the United States played a secondary, marginal role in the world practice of international relations.  Nevertheless, they were not formally attached to the Entente, but remained its associate member.  Thus, it was possible to maintain freedom from mutual obligations, purely allied, which expanded significantly in wartime.  But to be free in terms of annexations and territorial reorganization of the United States is absolutely unprofitable, which is why the United States entered the First World War. </p><p>  The Entente was constantly experiencing an ever-increasing need for help from the Americans.  And not only finances and weapons, but also troops.  Wilson proclaimed the goals of the United States in this war, which fundamentally contradicted the European concept of balancing forces, even at the cost of losing peoples' right to self-determination.  Great powers, as the United States believed, constantly violate the principle of self-determination, which means that the world order will not be stable.  That is why Wilson proposed the creation of a new, permanent international body, which is called upon to observe collective security and ensure a fair resolution of all international disputes.  The basis of the work of the created League of Nations was a certain set of generally agreed principles, among which the self-determination of nations was present.  So, the role of the United States in the First World War became dominant, despite the very late entry into it. </p>

    <h2>  London, Paris, Moscow </h2><p>  In planning the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson convinced the Allies that the first organization of this kind was universal and would be able to maintain both the safety of sea lanes for unlimited use by any state of the world and the prevention of any war launched in violation of contractual obligations.  Submission of all global issues to a unified public opinion of the world.  Paris and London considered the tasks set by Wilson to be far from reality and too abstract.  In a word, neither David <span>Lloyd George</span> nor Georges Clemenceau was enthusiastic about this proposal initially.  The problems in Europe were much more urgent: military efforts did not increase, because the United States maintained neutrality, things were bad at the rear: strikes, pacifists, and even the Vatican became an intermediary between the warring countries.  So it was possible to lose the war. </p><p>  Regarding Russia, not everything was smooth either.  Attempts to revise specific conditions in a future peace treaty have already taken place, and Russia's interests were severely infringed both in Europe and the Middle East.  Then the Provisional Government and exchanged <span>diplomatic missions</span> with the United States <span>,</span> trying to get military and economic assistance, plus foreign economic benefits.  In Russia then, everything was bad too: the crisis was not only economic, but also political, the complete collapse of the army and the assigned front.  Russia has become an extremely unreliable ally.  The Entente took control of the situation: England was in charge of sea transportation, France contributed to the combat readiness of the Russian troops, and the United States engaged in rail transport.  At the beginning of November 1917, the Provisional Government still saw the bright future of its reign and with might and main demonstrated the desire for war to a victorious end.  But on November 7th in a new style with his own signature: "Which ones are temporary here? Slime!"  - has come. </p>

    <h2>  Neutrality </h2><p>  From 1914 until the 1917th, the United States showed sympathy for the countries of Western Europe, but remained neutral, this desire dominated.  Wilson testified that he was shocked by the destructive nature of the ensuing conflict, tried to mediate, seeking peace without anyone's victory.  This was not successful.  Maybe because the armament of the Entente countries from America arrived on schedule, and this was the first weapon in the history of mankind of mass destruction.  Great Britain has always controlled the oceans, and the United States did not like it, disputes about the right to sea of ‚Äã‚Äãneutral countries have never subsided. </p><p>  Germany, with ships blocked in its ports, tried by all means to break out of the siege.  So a new weapon was born - submarines.  Now neutral, peacefully trading countries have lost the safety of walking on the seas.  In 1915, the Germans sank an English ship with passengers - Lusitania went to the bottom, taking with it more than a hundred American citizens.  Wilson tried to pretend to be Germany, arguing his claims with international law.  Germany did not allow herself to be persuaded until 1917 and did not stop the submarine war.  Then, as if agreed.  However, she did not comply with the agreements, having sunk several more large American vessels in a couple of months.  And on April 6, 1917, the US Congress declared war on Germany. </p><h2>  Save face </h2><p>  Wilson, having failed as a peacemaker and mediator, did not reach the world.  The objectives of the United States in the First World War at first concerned purely the economy while maintaining neutrality.  But it didn‚Äôt work out that way.  I had to make a military contribution to this victory over Germany.  The new goals, which were determined and gradually rising to full growth even before entering the war, concerned the creation of the League of Nations and gaining control over Europe and the world.  After Germany intensified the submarine war, the United States immediately enlarged naval and economic assistance to their opponents and began preparations for an expedition to the Western Front as part of combat units. </p><p>  <span>General Pershing,</span> appointed commander-in-chief, called up the army, and about a million men from twenty-one to thirty-one years old put on khaki.  From the very beginning of March 1918, the Allied forces tried to restrain the advance of the enemy.  The Germans attacked powerfully, the British and French were heavily bloodless.  That is why the fresh US army has succeeded significantly in helping the allies, and in the counterattack, and in the subsequent defeat of the German troops.  The Americans rebuilt the entire system of the economy under this war.  The measures were truly unprecedented.  The economy of the country did not know such state control. </p><h2>  Federal control </h2><p>  In organizing rear services, Wilson passed laws that were extremely effective.  A special railway management was created, ending competition and ensuring the strictest coordination of all activities.  And the military-industrial administration was given wide powers to control enterprises, which stimulated production and prevent duplication.  Wheat prices have become fixed, and at a very high level.  ‚ÄúWheatless‚Äù and ‚Äúmeatless‚Äù days for the population were introduced to increase army supplies.  Fuel resources were also rigidly fixed, their distribution and production were constantly monitored. </p><p>  These were excellent measures not only to strengthen the army and military power.  They brought good benefits to both farmers and industrial workers, that is, the poor.  The American war machine developed and strengthened.  In addition, the United States gave huge loans to the allies.  The above says about the size of the external debt of European countries to the creditor.  Freedom Loan bonds were issued, thanks to which the country managed to withstand such large expenses.  The USA in the First, Second World Wars found a way through world woes to own enrichment. </p>

    <h2>  Fourteen points </h2><p>  That was the name of the 1918 declaration that Wilson presented to Congress regarding World War I and the US goals in it.  In it, he outlined a program to restore stability in the world and called for the creation of the League of Nations.  Of course, it was contrary to the military objectives that the countries of the Entente approved, and also contradicted many secret treaties between the allied countries.  But this step has become very effective. </p><p>  Already in October 1918, the countries of Central Europe offered peace directly to Wilson, ignoring their European opponents.  A mission led by the House headed from Europe to the USA.  In November, Germany signed an agreement.  All this indicates how strong the contradictions were in the positions of America and Europe.  The economic component of the life of the old and finally disintegrated Europe did not promise quick stabilization and restoration, and the United States significantly strengthened its economy during the First World War.  Plus there were no destruction.  This country has never waged war on its territory. </p><h2>  World </h2><p>  In 1919 and 1920 there were endless peace negotiations.  Wilson completely subordinated them to the creation of the League of Nations.  To achieve this goal, he was forced to make a number of compromises: from indemnities to territorial issues. </p><p>  At the end of June 1919, a treaty was signed, culminating in Wilson's political career.  Not everything went smoothly.  The Republicans won the 1918 election, and therefore a powerful movement was organized against the League of Nations not yet created. </p><p>  The first decision in her favor was blocked, ratification was in jeopardy.  The Senate wanted changes to the treaty; Wilson resisted until July 1921.  So, formally, up to this point, the United States was still at war.  The ‚ÄúRed Threat‚Äù forced us to compromise, and only Congress adopted a resolution of both houses, which announced the completion of participation in the war.  The US situation after the First World War was strengthened economically, but a political crisis was ripe.  And so the League of Nations began its work without the participation of the United States. </p>
