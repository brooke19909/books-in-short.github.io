For many, it remains a mystery how ordinary sticks can become the foundation for masterpieces!  But if you delve deeper into this hobby, you can find many nuances regarding both the material and the features of making crafts. </p><h2>  How to make a child a tank of matches? </h2><p>  Crafts made from this material help develop manual dexterity and patience in children.  This lesson is especially fascinating for boys who love to build vehicles.  There are three ways to create simple tanks with your children. </p><ol><li>  Volumetric hand-drawn tank.  Start with what the boy can do.  Let him draw a model of the tank.  And then with the help of matches and glue give the picture volume.  Also, with their help, "grow" trees, clouds, road.  In this case, you need to help the child with the preparation of matches of a certain length. </li><li>  Create a mock tank from the boxes and paper, and then paste over it with matches.  As a case, you can use ordinary matchboxes. </li><li>  Volumetric tank of matches.  First, create a drawing of the model, mentally dividing it into geometric figures: for example, a rectangular muzzle, a square cabin and rectangular-oval caterpillars.  Using glue, you can recreate these figures, while before the tank make sloping by reducing matches on the principle of a ladder. </li></ol><p>  Remember that crafts can be made from whole matches, remove sulfur heads or cut them to the desired length.  In the latter case, the details should be drawn using paints and a brush. </p><h2>  Making a simple matchstick tank with glue </h2><p>  Using conventional PVA, you can create masterpieces.  To make a tank, you need to stock up on a visual picture, a model on which we will recreate in three-dimensional projection.  To make a small transport, we need to build five cubes whose edge is equal to the length of the match. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="matchstick tank with glue" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/357259.jpg" width="200"></div>

To start, we make the platform: </p><ul><li>  glue two cubes, forming a long caterpillar; </li><li>  we put two "chains" parallel to each other so that the distance is half the match; </li><li>  cut the sticks of the desired length and glue the tracks together (if there are gaps in the cubes, then simply insert the matches between them); </li><li>  the connection of the chains is not done along their entire length, leave 0.5 cm from the ends; </li><li>  further in front of the tank it is necessary to make a bevel (‚Äúbuild up‚Äù a right triangle of matches) to convey the correct image of the tracks. </li></ul><p>  On the fifth cube, stick a cannon of ten matches in this order: </p><ul><li>  1 row of three matches; </li><li>  4 things.; </li><li>  3 row, as the first. </li></ul><p>  At the top of the cube, you can glue sulfur heads in the shape of a circle, forming the hatch of the tank.  The last step is to glue the cube to the base of the platform.  That's it, the car is ready for battle! </p><h2>  Tank without glue: part preparation </h2><p>  We also assemble a combat vehicle from cubes and houses, which we then connect using matches.  Houses form the edges of the tracks, and simple cubes are a connecting element and a cabin.  According to these <span>geometric figures</span> , a tank of matches is created.  Instructions for creating a simple cube are placed below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="match tank" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/357264.jpg?1395383559683" width="600"></div>

It turns out that the sulfur coating of the two foundations forms an angle. </li><li>  Make walls by shifting matches among themselves, whose heads look around the perimeter of the cube. </li><li>  After 7 rows, lay out the roof of 8 sticks - the same as the foundation (the heads look in the opposite direction compared to the floor). </li><li>  From above, perpendicular to the middle of the roof, lay out 6 matches, in the center of which put a simple coin. </li><li>  Holding it with your finger, on four sides, fix its position with matches, "piercing" through the walls of the cube.  In the same way, dice with 6 matches the whole coin, which then needs to be pulled out and the cube carefully formed. </li><li>  Turn the square over and work with its bottom, which will be the front side.  From each side, lay vertical match rows with the heads up. </li><li>  Next, also insert horizontal circular rows to fasten the structure. </li></ul><p>  According to this scheme, we make 8 cubes. </p><h2>  No glue tank: tracks and cab </h2><p>  We continue to consider how to make a tank out of matches.  To form caterpillars, we need to "build" houses out of four cubes by laying out the roof. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tank of matches" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/357263.jpg?1395383615646" width="217"></div>

    <ul><li>  Insert the corner matches, with the vertical sticks starting from the second, pull them upwards by the heads, forming a triangular roof (seven pieces elongated without taking into account the two extreme ones). </li><li>  Now in triangular forms you need to insert matches, starting from the extreme row, - two pieces, then four, six, eight, eight, six, four, two.  In this case, the heads alternate with the ends to form a pattern. </li><li>  Spread eight oblique matches on top, crossing each other at the top of the roof with sulfur-coated ends. </li></ul><p>  From one cube you need to make a tank cabin: </p><ul><li>  Make a sloping roof on one side, while inclined matches overlap the entire surface of the cube.  In this place, then we will build the barrel of a combat vehicle. </li><li>  On the reverse side, make a ladder, pushing five sticks to different lengths. </li></ul><h2>  Tank without glue: assembly </h2><p>  Well, we almost figured out how to make a tank out of matches.  Now the last step remains.  We connect all the details. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tank out of matches" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/357269.jpg?1395383652415" width="200"></div>

    <ul><li>  Insert four matches into the base of the house and fasten them to the cube. </li><li>  In the same way, insert four sticks into the cube and connect with another "house". </li><li>  It turns out one caterpillar. </li><li>  So do the second chain. </li><li>  Insert four matchsticks into the free cube on both sides. </li><li>  Carefully connect this cube with the middle cubes of both tracks. </li><li>  From the bottom of the tank cabin, insert four connecting matches and insert them into the central cube connecting the tracks. </li><li>  Make the muzzle of the tank on the sloping side - of eight matches, forming a square, into which you insert four more matches, forming the muzzle. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to build a tank of matches with your own hands.  Just remember three rules: 1) purchase all the material at once;  2) draw a diagram of your product;  3) assemble your project slowly and carefully. </p>
