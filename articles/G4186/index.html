    <p>  Employees can carry out activities both together and separately.  The demand for them is associated with the development of computer technologies that are used in all areas of human life.  If you are interested in what kind of salary they have, an IT specialist is a highly paid position.  But the amounts may vary depending on the profile. </p><h2>  Salary level </h2><p>  Today there are 2 categories of named workers: </p><ul><li>  applied: carry out work with ready-made applications; </li><li>  system: create software on their own. </li></ul><p>  Specialists of the first type have the opportunity of career growth, as they can learn how to create their own programs.  System specialists usually occupy important positions in large firms.  What is the average salary of an IT specialist?  It is 70,000 rubles, but the specific amount depends on the type of position. </p><p>  If you are interested in a specific salary, an IT specialist in the field of 1C receives about 60,000 rubles.  Employees creating C ++ applications have a salary of 60-80 thousand rubles.  JAVA programmers receive 120-200 thousand rubles, and a PHP worker - 30-100 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such data includes popular employment sites.  But the salary of an IT specialist depends on many different factors.  So, having considered all the offers, you can see vacancies with more modest pay.  For example, if numerous skills and experience are not required, then a salary of 10,000 to 20,000 rubles is offered. </p><h2>  What affects the size of wages? </h2><p>  In terms of the salary that an <span>IT specialist has, Moscow</span> is a leader, which, in general, is not surprising.  In other regions, the amount of income is slightly less. </p><p>  Specialists working in popular companies, for example, Apple, Google, Facebook, have a higher income.  This also applies to independent developers who independently launch the project.  For example, <span>Pavel Durov,</span> who is considered the creator of the VKontakte network, is one of the richest Russian developers. </p><p>  By the way, in this area quite often working with customers without intermediaries is more profitable than stable employment.  An IT specialist can work remotely. </p>

    <p>  To raise your income, you need to constantly improve.  To do this, there are computer courses to improve skills.  For example, if an employee has the skills to work with JAVA, then he should study PHP, NET JavaScript.  Firms value employees with various skills more.  In addition, a professional with several specializations can use various methods to create software. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What will be the salary, an IT specialist can find out based on his work experience.

But thanks to the development of computer technology, such a specialist can work from anywhere in the world.  It is only necessary to learn how to allocate personal time. </p><p>  And in small Russian cities there are not many information technology companies.  And there are demanded job vacancies for technicians who perform optimization of ACS and 1C tuning. </p><h2>  What is taken into account when applying for a job </h2><p>  The work of an IT specialist is quite in demand in the country.  A competent resume is necessary for the device.  If you have the skills and experience, then, as already mentioned, you can apply for a higher position.  When applying, employers evaluate the following criteria: </p><ol><li>  Level of education - graduated higher education is appreciated, although there are many self-taught workers. </li><li>  Experience - if you have at least 3 years, then such an employee is considered reliable. </li><li>  Age - in this specialty young employees are preferred, because they are active and purposeful. </li><li>  The ability to work with several areas - for this the employee must have knowledge in several industries. </li><li>  Teamwork - IT specialist interacts with other employees to achieve common work goals. </li><li>  Foreign language proficiency - English is preferred. </li><li>  Learning - the employee must be ready to constantly improve, for example, to take IT specialist courses. </li><li>  Print speed. </li><li>  Skills of working with created programs. </li><li>  Ability to work with financial systems. </li></ol>
