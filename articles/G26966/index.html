Crimea has its own unique history, a lot of attractions, which people from all over the world come to see, but most of all it is famous for its resorts.  One of such vacation spots is the small village of Katsiveli (Crimea).  Reviews about this place, located on the southern coast of the peninsula, are most positive. </p><h2>  Katsiveli: resort history </h2><p>  If you believe the written sources of the ancient Greeks and Romans, once upon a time the southern coast of Crimea, where the village of Katsiveli is now located, Taurus inhabited for a long time.  This is confirmed by modern archaeological excavations, during which burials in stone boxes were found that were typical for representatives of this people.  Starting from the 2nd century AD, the Romans replaced the Taurus, and in the era of the Great Migration of Nations, this territory was inhabited by the Goths and then the Huns.  In the 19th century, the village was not yet an independent settlement and was part of the village of Kikineiz. </p><h2>  Katsiveli in Soviet times </h2>

The radio astronomy department of the <span>Crimean Astrophysical Observatory,</span> founded here in the 1960s, also had a great influence on the development of the future resort.  Around the same time, the scientific radio astronomy station was launched, which for a long time was the most powerful in Europe.  All this time, the village of Katsiveli was considered a closed resort.  Holidays in Katsiveli could only be allowed by scientists for whom the House of Creativity was specially built.  At first it was wooden houses in a very small area.  The main advantage was that these houses were located almost by the sea.  Later they were rebuilt into stone buildings, equipped with loggias with beautiful sea views. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park katsiveli" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43989/1396177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern Katsiveli </h2><p>  The resort became open recently.  Not more than 10-15 years ago, a small village for scientists began to be actively built up.  There were multi-storey buildings, shops, hotels and hotel complexes.  Now everyone can enjoy the beauty and climate of this small village.  That is why a vacation in Katsiveli will leave you the most pleasant memories. </p><h2>  Climate in Katsiveli </h2><p>  Modern Katsiveli is a great place to relax.  Weather in Katsiveli year round pleases vacationers.  The mountainous area protects the village from cold winds, and the sea helps maintain a comfortable temperature almost all year round.  Winter in this region is mild and warm.  Snow, if it falls, melts within a few hours.  In summer, the temperature is quite high, but the heat is almost not felt and is easily tolerated due to high humidity and refreshing sea breezes.  The best time to relax in this part of the Crimean peninsula is considered to be September.  It is this month that the weather in Katsiveli is the most favorable - the summer heat subsides, but the sea does not have time to cool down yet.  Due to this favorable climate, the swimming season in Katsiveli lasts a very long time - from May to the end of October. </p><h2>  Types of holidays in Katsiveli </h2><p>  From the moment the village became available for everyone to relax, the infrastructure began to rapidly develop.  Here appeared modern hotel complexes, comfortable hotels, many cafes and restaurants offering their visitors a diverse selection of dishes.  On the territory of the village opened a network of stores with the most diverse set of necessary goods.  The beaches were landscaped for a comfortable holiday for tourists.  However, despite all these modern transformations, the village of Katsiveli is still famous for its beautiful virgin nature and clean mountain air.  This is an ideal place for those who want to relax with their families and for lovers of walks through the woods and mountains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Lovers to lie on the beach will not remain indifferent.  There are few of them, but you can always find a place.  Due to the compactness of the village itself, the road to the sea from anywhere in it does not take much time. </p><h2>  The remains of the "science campus" </h2><p>  Most of the sights are connected with the scientific past of the village of Katsiveli (Crimea). <strong> </strong>  Reviews about these places among tourists who have been there are most positive.  A curious sight is an oceanographic platform.  In 1980, it became the first place in Europe for geophysical exploration.  Currently, this platform is not operational, and the equipment located there was washed away into the sea during a severe storm. </p>

It is located next to the radio astronomy department of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.  Unlike the oceanographic platform, the radio telescope operates to this day.

    <p>  The Black Sea Geophysical Station, built here in 1929, also attracts a lot of curious holidaymakers.  At the base of this station is a storm pool.  And although it does not function today, huge fans designed to pick up storm waves up to 1.5 meters high are still preserved. </p>

In the "Blue Bay" a large selection of slides from the smallest, for children, to the coolest and tallest, which adults with pleasure will spend time on.

    <h2>  Oyster farm </h2><p>  I did not hear and did not speak about sanctions against Russia, probably only lazy.  The imposition of sanctions gave rise to the concept of import substitution.  Many have heard this tricky word, but not everyone understands what it is.  Immediately the joke of one of the KVN teams comes to mind: "... well, so far only a word has been invented ...".  However, it is in the village of Katsiveli (Crimea), the reviews of which people who visited this place are the most positive, lives and embodies import substitution in the life of Sergey Kulik.  The entrepreneur recently realized his old dream - he organized an oyster farm and is now the main supplier of these delicacies to many restaurants in Crimea.  By the way, Sergey receives orders for oysters from the Crimea from many cities of Russia, but so far he is only able to serve the peninsula. </p><p>  Ideally, Sergey Kulik would like to revive the population of the Black Sea oyster, but this would require a large number of people, the organization of special laboratories and, of course, high costs.  But the entrepreneur found a way out - to import the larvae of Pacific oysters and grow them on the spot.  As a result, such "home" oysters even outperform their overseas relatives.  The oyster farm of Sergei Kulik, or, as he calls it, an "underwater garden", is so far the only one of its kind in Russia. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Housing prices in the village of Katsiveli will pleasantly surprise you.  Unlike large resorts, the cost of living here is much lower.  This is especially true for the private sector.  Accommodation here will cost an average of 500 rubles per day.  In hotels and hotel complexes, the price is an order of magnitude higher - from 1800 to 5000 rubles.  The most expensive, but also the most comfortable accommodation will be provided by the Alexandria Hotel (Katsiveli). </p><p>  In the many cafes and dining rooms you can have a tasty meal for a very small price.  A comprehensive lunch will cost tourists 250-300 rubles.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for local stores.  Prices for food and essentials are clearly overpriced.  However, one can also find a way out of this situation - in neighboring cities, for example, in Yalta, you can buy everything you need at reasonably reasonable prices.  The transport connection between Katsiveli and nearby cities is well developed, travel there will not be a hassle. </p><p>  Entertainment prices are also quite acceptable.  This includes a variety of attractions on the water, and horseback riding, and a visit to the water park "Blue Bay". </p><h2>  Hotels of Katsiveli </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the village is very small, the choice of hotels and hotels for every taste is quite wide.
