But it turns out that you can make such an interior decoration with your own hands, moreover, without spending too much effort, but just enjoying the process of creating violets from beads. </p><p>  So, how do you make violets from beads on a wire?  First you need to prepare all the necessary material for work.  To complete the main work you will need beads of beautiful <span>lilac color</span> matching the color of a real violet, as well as a lot of green beads for leaves and a little yellow.  For stringing beads, a thin copper wire is ideal, and for fastening all the main details you need a mouline thread that matches the color with the tone of the leaves. </p><p>  The weaving of violets from beads begins with the creation of a flower, namely its petals.  For each petal you need a piece of wire thirty centimeters long.  Five beads of violet color are strung on it and are fixed by threefold scrolling.  It should be noted that one end of the wire should be long, all the main work will take place with it, and the length of the second should be left so that it is enough for fastening with the main parts.  Next, the second row of the petal is performed, for this it is necessary to collect such an amount of beads that is enough to parallelly wrap the first row.  Then again it is necessary to connect the wire by scrolling it three times.  Then the work continues with the same sequence, in each next row, an amount of beads is collected that will be necessary for wrapping the previous row and secured with a triple weave of wire.  All rows should be parallel to each other.  Work with the petal ends after the fourth row and is necessarily fixed by a triple revolution of the wire.  For each violet flower from beads, five such petals are required, respectively, for nine flowers, forty-five petals must be made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, to create a violet flower from beads, it is necessary to prepare its center.  To do this, you need to cut nine pieces of wire ten centimeters and string four yellow beads into the middle of each of them.  Fold the segments exactly in half and put two more beads on the connected ends.  This will be the middle of the violet flower of beads on the wire. </p><p>  Weaving of violets from beads continues by creating leaves.  Their total number is ten.  The entire technology of this process is practically no different from creating flower petals.  All rows of beads should also be parallel, but in this case, the beads are strung on both ends of the wire.  To create a leaf of violet from beads, you will need a piece of wire sixty centimeters long.  Fifteen beads are put on it and twisted.  Then, the same number of beads is strung on each end of the wire and, having passed the ends of the wire into the first loop, is fixed.  Four rows of beads on a leaf are made in the same way.  On this, the main work on the preparation of parts can be considered completed.  Next begins the assembly of violets from beads. </p><p>  Using a mouline thread, we connect the middle and flower petals.  Then, to give perfection to the appearance, it is necessary to wrap all the stems of leaves and flowers with green thread.  Now you can connect all your imagination and collect a bouquet of violets, laying flowers in the middle and framing them with green petals.  So a magnificent bouquet is ready! </p><p>  It remains only to fix it in a beautiful flower pot.  This can be done with gypsum.  And why not present a gorgeous gift to your friends in the form of a bouquet of violets made by yourself?  Such a gift will certainly become the most pleasant and dear to the heart surprise for a loved one. </p>
