    <p>  In a short period of time, the Palace of Independence has become the hallmark of the capital.  This is a great example of Art Nouveau architecture. </p><p>  The Independence Palace (Minsk) is a huge building, inside of which there are several hundreds of different rooms.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout fifty thousand square meters. </p><h2>  How is the main residence of the president of the republic protected? </h2><p>  Such structures, in view of recent cases of terrorist attacks that have intensified recently around the world, require a very high degree of protection.  Since this building is the residence of the President of the Republic of Belarus, it is naturally equipped with the latest technology to ensure safety.  All entrances to the palace are equipped with modern metal detectors built into arched passages.  As well as conveyors with x-rays, which are checked including trucks entering the territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In addition, equipment has been installed in the palace that protects you from listening.  These devices of voice information protection ‚ÄúSurf‚Äù allow you to create micro-noise, which makes it impossible to read vibrations from window glasses with laser listening equipment.  Thanks to these latest devices, any listening attempt is simply blocked.  Who guards the Independence Palace in Minsk?  Near the building you can see the policeman on duty.  This is not a static guard, like those guarding the <span>Lenin mausoleum</span> in Moscow or one of the royal palaces in London.  It is quite possible to turn to him with a question and get a polite answer. </p><h2>  Description of the Independence Palace, which is located in Minsk </h2><p>  The construction of the palace was finally completed about three years ago, its grand opening took place in October 2013.  Around the palace there is a low elegant trellised fence.  The new residence of the president is also equipped with protective devices.  They are 100% likely to scare away birds and rodents from the building.  The palace is equipped with a spare autonomous sufficiently powerful power supply unit. </p><p>  Independence Palace (Minsk) is an imposing tall building with a glazed facade.  Glass walls on the sides are interspersed with national ornaments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the middle of the facade is a massive wide staircase.  On the central pilaster of the building there is an image of the coat of arms of the Republic of Belarus.  The Palace of Independence (Minsk) is located, as it were, on a hill, which is a neat lawn.  In front of the facade are three large pedestals with rather large stone bowls with vegetation on them.  Directly between the fence and the building are very beautiful flowerbeds. </p><h2>  How is the building decorated inside? </h2><p>  Inside the palace, many rooms are decorated in the style of classicism.  For example, the Hall of Ceremonies.  From its windows a wonderful panorama of the State Flag Square opens.  There is a unique picture gallery of the palace, most of the exhibits in which are gifts of honored guests, including heads of state, to the president of Belarus.  The main hall of the Palace of Independence (Minsk) is decorated with a copy of the <span>Slutsk belt,</span> which is one of the symbols of the state.  The hall of the building is striking in its beauty, brilliance, scale.  For interior decoration, for example, stair railings, varieties of valuable wood were used.  Lighting equipment for the palace, in particular chandeliers and lamps, was made by the best European companies. </p><h2>  Independence Palace in Minsk.  Is the tour conducted? </h2><p>  In 2015, the inauguration ceremony of the president was held at the Palace.  Negotiations of leaders of the largest countries on various issues, conferences of state and international level, and awards ceremonies for the outstanding services of citizens of the country are held here.  In order to see the interior of a luxurious palace, you must send a request for a tour.  But the mechanism of such events has not yet been adjusted, and only honored people of the republic or participants in international youth conferences, employees of the diplomatic corps of other states received visits. </p>

    <p>  Those who want to hear the story of the Independence Palace and see it with their own eyes can join any sightseeing bus tour of the city.  The cost of such an exciting trip is about thirty Belarusian rubles (about 1000 Russian).  An application for a tour can be sent over the Internet, using the services of travel agencies (for example, Softtour, Ecotour 6, Travel, and others). </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what the Palace of Independence (Minsk) is.  We have described this establishment.  Unfortunately, you can look at this palace only from the side.  After all, excursions in it are not yet carried out.  Perhaps something will change in the future.  But they can tell you about the residence of the President of the Republic of Belarus during a bus tour. </p>
