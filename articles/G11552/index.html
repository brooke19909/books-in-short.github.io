Also nearby are the Kules Sea Fortress and the Historical Museum of Crete. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But to go to a good beach for about 20 minutes.

And departure is traditionally until 12:00. </p><p>  The hotel can accommodate with children, although few go here with a child (after all, the hotel is not a resort).  If the baby is not three years old, then for him they will install a small crib in the room.  And for his accommodation will not need to pay extra.  The same applies to more adult children (up to 7 years old), only for them they will install an extra bed, not a small one.  But if guests come with a child aged 7 to 12 years, then you will need to pay extra.  The price is fixed - 18 euros per night. </p><p>  If you need any of the services, it is worth informing the administration in advance so that they can prepare everything for arrival.  By the way, you can come to the hotel with pets.  But this should also be reported, indicating the breed of the animal. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that the hotel's rooftop pool does not always work, but only in the holiday season - from mid-May to early October. </p>

They assure: this is the best and most correct hotel complex in Heraklion.  Favorable location, very modest prices, good food - what else does a traveler need? </p><p>  Of course, the hotel is not suitable for families with small children or people who are on beach holidays.  There is no entertainment, animation, and the sea is far away.  But people know about this nuance, so you can always find another option. </p><p>  The staff here is good, good-natured.  The only negative is that they do not speak Russian.  But then the cleaning is daily and high-quality, regular change of linen and towels.  And administrators are always happy to help with advice.  In general, the attitude towards the guests here is excellent. </p><p>  In general, if we conclude, then we can say: this is a great option for people who are accustomed to comfortable conditions, stylish rooms and silence.  This is exactly what you can get from the Capsis Astoria.  Lovers of walks and exploring local attractions can not find the best option at this price in Heraklion. </p>
