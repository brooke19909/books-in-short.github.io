On this day, it is customary to exchange small souvenirs, treat acquaintances with Easter cakes and painted eggs, and collect traditional treats in baskets.  In preparation for the holiday, children like to take part.  The following are some Easter crafts.  With their own hands, they can be made for both adults and children. </p><h2>  Paper bag basket </h2><p>  A handmade Easter gift will also come from an ordinary paper bag, wrapping paper, scrap paper.  In such a basket, Easter treats or colored eggs will look original.  For work, you will need a ruler, paper, scissors, PVA glue or a thermal gun, a pencil. </p><p>  If you have chosen a paper bag for work, first cut the bottom off it and cut the side.  Using a pencil and a ruler, draw strips of three centimeters wide on paper, cut them out and bend each in half along the entire length.  Start weaving the basket as shown in the photo below.  By analogy, you can make a basket of newspaper tubes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boombob.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easter basket" class="if uuid-2401017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401017.jpg"></div><p>  When finished, you need to glue a strip on top of the basket so that the edges look neat.  It remains to add a pen, put a paper or cloth napkin in a basket, put sweets or eggs there. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Newspaper eggs for decor </h2><p>  To make dummy chicken eggs for room decor, decorating a table or creating Easter wreaths, you will need plastic eggs or ordinary ones.  Fresh must first be cleared of the contents. </p><p>  To do this, rub the egg with Vaseline twice (you just need to wait until the first layer is absorbed), which will give the shell strength.  Then, with the tip of a sharp knife, make holes at the poles and carefully drill holes of two to three millimeters in diameter.  Insert a toothpick into any of the holes and pierce the yolk, and then shake the egg a little. </p><p>  Now you need to blow the contents of the egg into a container.  It can be used on dough, scrambled eggs or scrambled eggs.  It is necessary to clear the shell.  To do this, fill an empty egg with hot water through a medical syringe with a needle, chat for a while and blow out the contents.  This should be done two to three times. </p><p>  It is advisable to take eggs from domestic chicken.  At poultry farms, eggs are treated with special solutions to better store them, and calcium is limited in the chicken diet to increase egg production. </p><p>  When the eggs are ready to make crafts for Easter with their own hands, it is necessary to cut the old newspapers into strips and wrap them each, pre-lubricating the center line with glue.  Parts that remain free, just cut into strips.  Now glue the egg again and glue each strip to the egg one by one.  The craft is ready.  To obtain a glossy effect, you can varnish the product. </p><p>  Such eggs can be put in a basket and used as a decoration for the festive table.  You can fix them on some basis by collecting an Easter wreath. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hare clip </h2><p>  Such an original Easter gift with your own hands can be made for a little fashionista and her mother.  The decoration is made of felt, you will need a sheet of white and pink material.  You should also prepare sewing accessories (matching threads, scissors, needles) and invisibility.  You can make such a hairpin, or you can make a bezel with ears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bezel with rabbit ears" class="if uuid-2401025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401025.jpg"></div><p>  First, cut two identical small circles and two pairs of rabbit ears from white felt.  We need two smaller ears of pink felt.  Sew white ears with each other in two parts, while leaving the tips loose, do not sew up to the end.  Glue the pink parts to the front side. </p><p>  In one white circle, make a hole in the center.  Insert the loose ends of the ears into this hole.  Now insert the second circle into the invisibility, connect the two circles and sew them together.  Ready made DIY gift for Easter!  Such a cute decoration is quickly and easily made. </p><h2>  Easter felt bunny </h2><p>  Even a novice craftswoman can make such hares, because felt is a material that is very easy to work with, it keeps its shape, and its edges do not need to be swept.  Such <span>Easter bunnies</span> or rabbits can be of different colors, so you can choose any felt you like. </p><p>  For each such Easter gift with your own hands, you need to cut two identical figures (hare silhouette) and a strip.  You can make several toys of the same size or make different ones. </p><p>  On one part, embroider the eyes and nose with black or brown threads.  Pin a strip of felt with pins to the contours of the part and sew with neat stitches.  Pin the second part of the toy with pins and also sew it. </p><p>  Do not forget to leave a small hole through which you need to turn out the Easter gift with your own hands (photo of the manufacturing process above) and fill it with sintepon.  Ordinary cotton wool will do.  Easter Bunnies Ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.woolhearts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easter felt bunny" class="if uuid-2401034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401034.jpg"></div><h2>  DIY wreath of eggs </h2><p>  Easter wreaths are placed either on the doors of a hospitable house, or on the wall and create a festive atmosphere.  But the wreath does not have to be made of fresh flowers, leaves or materials imitating natural ones. </p><p>  You can make an Easter wreath of eggs.  In this case, it is better to take plastic eggs, since they need a lot.  Still need glue and thick threads for knitting different colors. </p><p>  The technology is very simple: you just need to wrap each egg with thread, and then form a wreath from them, sticking it on some kind of base (for example, cardboard).  You can wrap the eggs in even turns or randomly. </p><h2>  Easter surprise egg </h2><p>  A great Easter gift idea (making it very simple with your own hands) is an egg with a surprise.  It looks like an ordinary egg, but if you break it, a surprise will be found inside.  In this master class we put candies inside, but you can put a small gift there, for example, a ring or a hair clip. </p><p>  For such a handmade DIY gift for Easter, you will need ordinary eggs, multi-colored dyes, small candies, paper forms for small cupcakes or egg cups, PVA glue.  First, carefully beat off the tip from each egg and extract the contents, rinse the shell well from the inside with hot water. </p><p>  The next step is staining.  Paint empty eggs with colorful dyes.  To do this, dip the shells (they can be kept on a small wooden stick for barbecue or for sushi) in a dye solution prepared according to the recipe indicated on the package.  The dilution technology of different dyes may vary.  Wait until the eggs are completely dry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="content.photojojo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Easter surprise egg" class="if uuid-2401048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401048.jpg"></div><p>  Now place small candies or a gift inside each egg.  It remains only to trim the edges of the shell, grease them with PVA glue and glue the paper cupcake mold (or egg stand) on top.  When everything is dry, turn the eggs over.  They will look like ordinary paint on the coasters, but if broken, sweets will be found inside. </p><h2>  A basket of clothespins as a gift </h2><p>  Do it yourself gift for Easter - a basket with eggs and Easter cake or sweets - can be made from ordinary disposable plastic or paper plates, scotch tape and wooden clothespins.  You will also need cardboard and tape to decorate the entire structure. </p><p>  Scissors cut the edges of the plastic plate every three to five centimeters.  Bend the edges up and fasten with paper clips so that a plate with high edges is formed - this is the basis for the Easter basket.  For reliability, glue the sides together with ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù glue and fix it on top with a thin braid. </p><p>  Now divide each clothespin into halves.  Glue the halves to the edges of the plate outside.  You can simply attach the clothespins to the edges of the base for the basket without separating them, but make sure that in this case the bottom of the plate is not visible.  Then tape everything again. </p><p>  It remains only to cut thin strips of paper and ‚Äúcurl‚Äù them with scissors to decorate the bottom of the basket, and make a pen out of cardboard.  <span>Decorate the Easter</span> basket with a ribbon and a bow or several. </p><h2>  Knitted Chicken for Easter </h2><p>  Needlewomen who know how to knit can make Easter gifts with their own hands crocheting.  To make a cute chicken, you will need yellow yarn (preferably 100% cotton or 50 \ 50), a little orange and white yarn, a hook (number three).  Knit should start with the body.  You can see the scheme in rows below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a chicken body" class="if uuid-2401007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401007.jpg"></div><p>  When the resulting ball begins to narrow, fill it with sintepon or cotton.  It remains for do-it-yourself knit crafts for Easter to make wings (you need two wings), eyes and paws.  Sew all the details to the body.  DIY Easter gift - chicken - done! </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="other chicken details" class="if uuid-2401010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2401010.jpg"></div><h2>  Very beautiful willow wreath </h2><p>  Surprisingly beautiful crafts and DIY gifts for Easter can be made from natural materials.  For the manufacture of the following crafts, real willow twigs, secateurs, a base for a wreath, plain or floristic wire are used. </p><p>  Cut the willow into twigs of approximately equal size.  The optimal length is 8-10 cm. Gather several branches in a bundle and fix it at the base with wire.  Distribute the same bundles throughout the wreath, securing them with wire. </p><h2>  Crafts from napkins for Easter </h2><p>  The fastest little gift for Easter is ribbons and paper napkins of different colors.  It is enough to wrap a boiled egg with a colorful napkin, and tie a ribbon on top.  Napkins can be replaced with wrapping paper in different colors.  Such eggs can be stacked in a basket for Easter cake, and artificial eggs wrapped in napkins will become a decorative element, the production of which does not require a lot of labor and time. </p><h2>  DIY Easter Spider Web Eggs </h2><p>  Large Easter eggs, which can decorate the house for the holiday, are easy to make by preparing a few balloons, threads (regular or for knitting), glue.  Balloons need to be inflated a little, not completely, and tied with threads so that air does not come out. </p><p>  Now start randomly wrapping the ball with thread.  When it is enough, glue the threads well with glue and leave the craft to dry.  This will take a fairly large amount of time, otherwise the decor element can be ruined. </p><p>  After at least 12 hours, carefully pierce the ball and through one of the holes between the threads, pull it out of the craft.  Spider web eggs are ready! </p><h2>  Natural egg coloring </h2><p>  The basis of the holiday is Easter cakes and painted eggs (painted eggs, Easter eggs), other symbols of Easter are a wreath, a hare or a rabbit.  Easter eggs are painted in many ways.  Acrylic paints that can be applied to any surface are universal, they are very resistant and bright.  You can paint chicken eggs or empty shell-blanks for crafts in cold or hot, that is, with boiling.  Cold-painted eggs are called pysankas, and boiled are called pysanka. </p><p>  For coloring of edible eggs exclusively natural dyes should be used.  They can be purchased at the store or use food products.  If you squeeze carrot juice and boil the eggs in it, you get a light orange color, if you soak for three hours in beetroot - pink, boil in spinach juice - green. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.botanichka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY crafts for Easter" class="if uuid-2400982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2400982.jpg"></div><p>  For coloring eggs, coffee is used.  Grind the beans and boil eggs in 250 ml of coffee.  It will turn brown, coffee color.  A recipe known to everyone - onion peel.  The color of the eggs in this case depends on the amount of husk.  To obtain the color blue, cauliflower is used.  Two pieces should be chopped, add 500 ml of water, in this solution, soak the eggs for three hours. </p>
