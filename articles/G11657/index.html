The underwater world of the islands is unique and diverse: clown fish, parrot fish, cockerels, barracudas, black fin, finless, whale sharks, moray eels, stingrays, huge turtles and so on.  In addition to observing marine life, diving under water will allow you to see a variety of coral gardens, dazzling with all the colors of the rainbow.  In addition, guests of the island can sunbathe and enjoy the warm sun on the white beaches.  In numerous photos of the Perhentian Islands (Malaysia), you can see that the beaches here are simply magical, they are surrounded by thickets of palm trees, giving a pleasant cool, and the water is clear and turquoise.  Those who wish can take a trekking trip to the jungle or a trip on a rented lock to the uninhabited islands of Perhentian. </p><h2>  Restaurants and Cafes </h2><p>  All eateries are located at hotels or inns.  Products are imported from the "mainland", so prices are much higher than on the mainland.  But tourists who visited the Perhentian Islands, reviews about food in local institutions leave only positive.  They say that the food in the restaurants and cafes of Perhentian is not only tasty, but also varied.  Here you can taste dishes of Malaysian, Thai, Chinese, Indian and European cuisine.  Delicious branded pizza can be ordered at the Watercolors Resort Restaurant, and in some bars there is the opportunity to purchase alcohol, but the prices are simply cosmic.  Therefore, it is better to bring alcohol with you.  Due to the fact that Malaysia is a Muslim country, some establishments of the Perhentian Islands do not serve pork and alcohol at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thebutterflyeditions.com" data-author=": "><img alt="perhentian islands tourist reviews" class="if uuid-2735541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95464/2735541.jpg?1534103942"></div><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The avid shopaholics in the Perhentian Islands have nothing to do.  The resort is used for other purposes, so shopping is absent here as such.  At the resorts you can buy souvenirs in the form of magnets and sealed bottles with shells and sand inside;  tubes, flippers and masks;  slippers, sunglasses and a mat for lying on the beach;  some attributes for diving and snorkeling.  As mentioned above, alcohol is not worth buying here because of its price. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Anyone who is going to visit Perhentian for the first time should consider the following recommendations: </p><ul><li>  The influx of tourists to the islands is observed on weekends, so it is better to plan an arrival on a weekday. </li><li>  You should definitely take a first-aid kit with you where you need to put antihistamines (there are fleas on the islands, the bite of which can cause an allergic reaction), antipyretics, medications to treat stomach upsets and sunburn medicines. </li><li>  Sunblock and tanning cream must be bought on the mainland, they are not sold here. </li><li>  All planned excursions and visits to local attractions should be discussed with a tour operator in advance. </li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The main question that worries everyone who is going to relax in the Perhentian Islands is how to get from Kuala Lumpur?  The most convenient and fastest way is to fly from the capital to Kota Bara.  You can also get on the bus, but it will take more time.  Next take a taxi to Kuala Besut marina.  From here there are boats that deliver tourists to the islands.  They do not have an exact schedule, it all depends on occupancy.  There is no transport on the islands.  Exceptions are taxi bots. </p><p>  How to get to the beach and attractions in the Perhentian Islands?  On foot or by taxi.  All tourist areas are connected by trails, and if you wish, in thirty minutes you can independently reach any corner of the island.  You can take a taxi bot to a wild island or to another beach.  The price for them is not fixed, so you can always bargain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="malaysiatravel.info" data-author=": "><img alt="perhentian islands how to get from kuala lumpur" class="if uuid-2735558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95464/2735558.jpg?1534103942"></div><p>  Want to get diving for breakfast, pristine beaches and the rainforest for lunch, a bunch of stars and the splendor of the night sky for dinner?  Go to the Perhentian Islands.  Here you will find privacy and a wonderful vacation on the magnificent beaches, surrounded by delightful unspoiled nature. </p>
