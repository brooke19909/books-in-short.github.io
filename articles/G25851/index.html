  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in the heart of Thailand: Samui hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays on Koh Samui - the choice of modern tourists who seek to get as much pleasure from life as possible.  This is the choice of people who prefer not traditional relaxation, but real exoticism, which in the life of a modern person from the "stone jungle" of large cities has almost disappeared.  This island is an ideal place for spending holidays: incendiary parties or exciting diving, visiting the ‚Äúerotic‚Äù rocks or a kind of pilgrimage to the Big Buddha statue, shopping and souvenir shops or relaxing after all these adventures, which the best hotels in Samui offer. </p><p>  Yes, a vacation spent on this island will be remembered for a long time, especially if you take care in advance to book a place for yourself, because many Samui hotels are crowded long before the start of the season, which is not surprising: here you can enjoy the warmth of the sun, gentle surf and amazing in its beauty and diversity of the plant world.  This island is especially attractive for local restaurants where you can try unusual <span>Thai dishes,</span> which, however, may not be decided by everyone, since there are a lot of spices and seafood in such dishes.  Such restaurants have on their territory many Samui hotels reviews which can be read on travel sites or received from tour operators. </p><p>  Among the most upscale hotels on the island, the exquisite Muang Samui Boutique Hotel stands out on the east side of the island along the coast.  The hotel territory belongs to Chaweng Beach - one of the most beautiful places with clean white sand.  This place, like many other hotels in Samui, offers its guests to undergo a full course of spa treatments, take a sunbath on the terrace or relax in the jacuzzi.  There is a gym and Rai-Ra spa center, which will allow not only to have a wonderful rest at the resort, but also restore health and beauty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention of tourists to the fact that this hotel has the opportunity to stay in rooms of different categories - from junior suites to the Royal Chambers, which own their own garden and pool.  It is important to remember that pets are not allowed in the rooms - pets will have to be left at home. </p><p>  For our compatriots, who often claim that their vacation cannot be complete, if they constantly hear their native language nearby, the ideal option would be to stay at the Hansar Samui 5 * hotel, which, for some reason, settles in few Russian tourists.  Here you can arrange a real vacation, filled with sunlight and the splash of waves.  When you get tired of looking at the endless sea waters stretching over the horizon and languishing on hot beaches, you can take a dip in the cool pool, relax in the fitness center or go on an excursion to a tiny fishing village. </p><p>  Many Samui hotels, such as the popular Rummana Boutique Resort 4 * complex, are suitable for a short rest, for example, for a weekend.  Here, guests can stay in comfortable rooms equipped with all the necessary things for a modern tourist - a refrigerator, hairdryer, shower and Internet access.  The hotel has an excellent restaurant serving delicious dishes of original Thai cuisine, and for parents who come to Koh Samui with their children, it is possible to spend a romantic evening alone, leaving their children in the room or in the games room under the care of an experienced nanny.  In general, this hotel is fashionable, modern, providing standard rooms, quality service and access to the cleanest and most picturesque beaches of the island. </p>
