    <p>  Many hotel buildings in the central part of Sunny Beach were erected in Soviet times.  However, today they are quite modern and modernized.  Basically, their resort niche is a solid economical vacation available for the vast majority of tourists. </p><p>  It is fair to say that Sunny Beach has been developing in the direction of elite relaxation for the past two decades.  Tourists who want to pay for additional comfort, choose the northern part of the resort, built after 1991, characterized by expensive four- and five-star modern hotels. </p><p>  But back to the first group of inexpensive hotels.  These include, in particular, the subject of this article - Azuro 3 * (Sunny Beach).  Photos of this popular hotel complex are presented in this article.  It is located near the airport - at a distance of a 20-minute autotransfer.  Ordering a taxi here is quite simple, you can do it even using the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  One of Bulgaria's favorite hotels </h2><p>  Why do many tourists, having once relaxed in it, for the next holiday season again choose Azuro 3 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria)?  Their reviews indicate the excellent price / quality ratio of spa services provided by hotel staff. </p>

    <p>  The hotel complex was completely renovated in 2013.  This refers to internal design, communications, infrastructure, equipment of client rooms, furniture.  Thanks to such changes, the possibility of a good economy-rest is provided.  Here, the administration has excellently adjusted the food of guests.  A beach holiday is clearly beyond the scope of three stars. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Let's look at the map of Bulgaria.  Between the cities of Burgas (the distance to it is about 36 km) and Varna (respectively 90 km) is <span>Sunny Beach (Sunny</span> Beach).  Azuro 3 * is located in this resort.  This is a three-star, favorably built on the first line of the beach.  The hotel complex is convenient for its guests in terms of the availability of a wide selection of entertainment.  Nearby are restaurants, youth clubs, and bars.  Hotel guests as a bonus actually get a five-star beach vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, Azuro 3 <span>Sunny Beach (Sunny</span> Beach, Bulgaria), thanks to the developed infrastructure and excellent work of the staff, is convenient both for active family vacations and youth vacations.  It should be recognized that it is not suitable for lovers of meditation and absolute peace.  It's noisy, partyy, fun.  At the same time, outsiders (which is important!) Practically do not enter the hotel territory.  You can‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúpassage yard‚Äù.  Here at the hotel are only "their".  At the same time, it is adjacent to other hotels on all sides. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  In a cozy and spacious four-story building, designed for 200 guest rooms, the Azuro 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach) is located.  Reviews indicate that newly arrived tourists populate it strictly at 14 o‚Äôclock.  However, if they do not choose ‚Äúoption B‚Äù - paid settlement (the service costs 20 leva).  Also, for the convenience of guests, the hotel provides a number of additional services. </p>

    <p>  For tourists who have rented a car, the Azuro 3 * hotel has equipped a convenient guarded parking lot.  Sunny Beach is a rather sultry region, so for long walks, using a machine equipped with air conditioning will be very reasonable.  Right at the hotel complex, you can easily change the currency at a good rate in the exchange office working here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The developed modern infrastructure is complemented by the capabilities of its hotels Sunny Beach resort.  Azuro 3 *, however, like other hotels, in turn, complements the recreational capabilities of the resort.  Judging by the reviews, the hotel complex contributes to the health of guests - they have at their disposal a modern, versatile, outdoor swimming pool, an excellently equipped gym, a cozy sauna.  Those who wish can also order for themselves at fairly affordable prices a massage course or its individual sessions. </p>

    <p>  There is a separate playground for children.  At the pool there are specialized departments, designed for the smallest holidaymakers.  The beach is convenient for swimming.  There are opportunities for children's excursions.  If necessary, tourists, vacationing families, cots for babies are additionally provided in the rooms.  However, as is usual in three-star hotels, both the organizers of children's recreation and animators are their parents. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Absolutely different rooms make up the Azuro 3 (Sunny Beach) housing stock: from small families to large families (with two bedrooms and a living room).  Tourists in their reviews characterize housing conditions as a solid fourth.  This is a solid economy class: good repair, new inexpensive furniture, working appliances, decent basic amenities, a cozy balcony that does not cause discomfort in the bathroom.  The rooms on the fourth floor are more comfortable.  They belong to the category of "luxury". </p>

    <p>  The hotel rooms offer a spectacular view of the sea.  Each of them has air conditioning, TV with Russian channels, minibar.  Those who wish to use the safe receive this service at the reception.  Judging by the reviews of the guests, the hotel's room fund is kept clean and tidy thanks to an informal daily cleaning.  At the same time, towels are replaced once every two days, and bed linen once a week. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Dining at Azuro 3 (Sunny Beach) is provided by the main restaurant and lobby bar.  They do it quite worthily.  However, judging by the reviews of tourists, there is also a peculiarity: food should not be taken out of the restaurant to rooms or anywhere else.  This is here the internal order, zealously maintained by the owner, as evidenced by the ads posted in prominent places. </p><p>  Breakfast here is standardly light, typical of most three-star hotels: scrambled eggs, two kinds of fried eggs, milk porridge, yoghurts, sausages, sausages, several types of hard cheese, tea, coffee, juices.  Lunch is quite tight.  It should be noted that the restaurant chef knows how to cook.  Two types of soup are always at guests' disposal, always two meat dishes (chicken, beef, pork - everything is delicious), a fish dish daily, five to six vegetable dishes and salads.  Here, positively, they don‚Äôt save on fruits. </p><p>  Dinner is generally like lunch.  Naturally, there are fewer first courses.  The all-inclusive hotel bar offers local alcoholic drinks.  To be fair, we note that many tourists praise <span>Bulgarian wines.</span> </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Why does the hotel guarantee an inexpensive and very decent vacation in the resort of Azuro 3 * (Sunny Beach)?  Booking.com answers this question in the language of numbers.  After all, the price per night, depending on the selected room, starts here from $ 35.  Agree, this is more than affordable. </p>

    <p>  Hotel guests can easily buy the desired products and small things.  Firstly, they are inexpensive.  Secondly, trays with goods are located at almost every hotel.  In addition, judging by customer reviews, there is a Smart supermarket right next to the hotel, the services of which, in fact, are used by most guests.  However, the thriftiest of tourists prefer to shop at the Mladost supermarket, which is a bit off at a distance, because there are often promotions and discounts there. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As we already wrote, right next to the beach is the Azuro 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach).  After walking about 100 meters and choosing your favorite place on a wide sandy strip, hotel guests can rent an umbrella and a sun lounger.  They have plenty of beach.  But judging by the reviews, their cost can not be called low.  Therefore, on the beach, separate paid areas with sunbeds and umbrellas are adjacent to free ones.  Many thrifty tourists successfully use the latter, as they write in the reviews. </p><p>  Directly near the beach there are many cafes, bars, eateries.  The prices are low, and the food is good.  In the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe recreation area there are various water attractions: "bananas", water skis, jet skis, etc. Rescuers are on duty at the beach (really!).  On days when waves at sea are high (a red flag is hung on the coastal towers), they prohibit swimming.  They are equipped with special cutters and, having the appropriate powers, catch violators who have gone too far and bathed in dangerous weather.  And they are right: human life is worth more than a momentary whim. </p><h2>  Youth vacation </h2><p>  In the evenings, the resort around Azuro 3 * (Sunny Beach) is buried in neon lights.  Numerous youth clubs, bars, and dance floors open wide their doors.  Young people migrate from one vacation spot to another all night until morning.  Nearby is the most famous disco in Bulgaria, "Cocoa Beach", where night birds flock from all over Europe.  Here you can often see and hear the trendsetters of youth fashion - DJs Armen van Buren, Victor Calderone, Dj Tiesto, Roger Sanchez.  Disco Club Lazur attracts fans of crack foam parties. </p>

    <p>  Also worthy of special attention to young people are the worthy bar establishments Mexo Bar and Amigo Bar, where in the evenings famous rock groups and inexpensive restaurants in Sunny Beach play.  Their menu has a lot of seafood, and the presentation itself speaks about the qualifications of cooks.  Their visit for tourists turns into a small holiday.  Such an assessment deserves Stella Di Mare, Iris, La Bamba.  For the sake of fairness, we note that we named only some of the institutions mentioned by hotel guests.  In fact, there are dozens of them. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the hotel (not in the 2016 season) still has separate isolated cases of theft.  Therefore, it is advisable for guests to store their valuables in the reception safe. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel Azuro 3 * (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) can be called an ideal place for public excursions.  Of course, a beach holiday here is for all five stars, but if he is bored, then there is always ‚Äúoption B‚Äù.  After all, the ancient city of Nessebar, having a three-thousand-year history, is located very close.  Tourists are usually interested in its "old part", located on a small peninsula. </p><p>  This is the city of the province of Thrace, which is part of Ancient Greece.  Moreover, part of it, unfortunately, fell due to the earthquake under water.  You can get to Nessebar quite comfortably in a clean and comfortable communal bus (ticket costs 1 lev).  However, you do not overpay for a taxi. </p><p>  Outwardly, Nessebar is a cozy and neat Balkan town, built up mainly by two- and three-story cottages with elegant characteristic red roofs.  On its neat cobbled streets it is pleasant to walk.  There are many interesting souvenir shops, and there are always more tourists out of season than the locals. </p>

    <p>  Families with children prefer excursions to the best water park in Sunny Beach - ‚ÄúAction‚Äù, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 thousand m2, designed for simultaneous relaxation of 3 thousand vacationers.  There are several recreation areas.  In addition to obviously family, there is also a territory of extreme recreation, beloved by youth.  Guests at Azuro 3 (Sunny Beach) also mentioned shopping excursions in Burgas in their reviews. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Guests of the Azuro 3 (Sunny Beach) hotel most often use the opportunity to make purchases in the shops of Burgas.  The corresponding bus route, which takes only half an hour, is completely tireless.  There are two options for the road: </p><ul><li>  With a change in Nessebar (regular buses No. 1 and No. 5, respectively). </li><li>  Direct flight Sunny Beach - Burgas (shuttle bus). </li></ul><p>  The main shopping street of the city is Aleksandrovskaya.  There are many shops selling light industry products.  The product is mainly Turkish.  There are many fakes "under the company."  The Indian clothing store has earned good reviews.  The fabrics here are natural, solid.  Tourists also mention Tria shopping center, where there is a Paradox cosmetics store, clothing stores Triumph, Salsa. </p><p>  After strolling through the shops of Alexandrovskaya Street, tourists, as a rule, go for a more serious shopping in the supermarket Burgas Plaza.  It should be reached by bus.  The road takes 25 minutes.  The world's leading brands are worthily represented here: Marc &amp; Spencer, Hugo Boss, Kenvelo, New Yorker, Stefanel, Benneton, Mango, Mothecare, Esprit, LC Waikiki and others. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, the rest in Azuro 3 * (Sunny Beach) is pleasantly remembered by tourists.  Their reviews are warm and even somewhat nostalgic.  So the Bulgarians manage to unobtrusively and benevolently provide a decent economy vacation!  On the other hand, there is a small group of reviews (obviously, novice tourists), where notes of annoyance are not quite motivated.  However, when you familiarize yourself with them, you begin to realize: people naively wanted to get a five-star service at the price of a three-star.  This is a fairly common misconception.  Indeed, judging objectively, it becomes clear that a three-star hotel cannot "jump above its head" by hiring animators for tours of $ 150 and providing a menu of several hundred dishes. </p><p>  Be that as it may, but Azuro 3 (Sunny Beach) really has good basic capabilities to ensure a pleasant and healthy vacation.  This is a budget hotel for tourists, offering economy class services.  Its staff is hardworking and friendly, and the beach holiday of its guests corresponds to the level of the ‚Äúblue flag‚Äù. </p>
