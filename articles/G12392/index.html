Predicting disaster is almost impossible, so it‚Äôs best if each of us knows how to behave in a particular case and what harmful factors should beware.  Let's talk about what are the damaging factors of the explosion, consider how to behave if such an emergency occurs. </p><h2>  What is an explosion? </h2><p>  Each of us imagines what it is.  If you have never encountered a similar phenomenon in real life, then at least they saw it in the movies or in the news. </p><p>  An explosion is a chemical reaction that proceeds at a tremendous speed.  At the same time, there is still energy release and the formation of compressed gases, which are capable of exerting a damaging effect on people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explosive factors" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1387634.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In case of non-observance of safety measures or violation of technological processes, <span>emergency situations</span> may occur with explosions at industrial facilities, in buildings, in communications.  Often it is the human factor that <span>causes the explosion.</span> </p><p>  There is also a special group of substances that are explosive, and under certain conditions they can explode.  A distinctive feature of the explosion can be called its transience.  Only a split second is enough for, for example, the room to fly into the air with <span>a gas explosion.</span>  In this case, the temperature reaches several tens of thousands of degrees Celsius.  The damaging factors of the explosion can cause serious injuries to a person, they are able to exert their negative impact on people at a certain distance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not every such emergency is accompanied by the same destruction, the consequences will depend on the power of the <span>explosive device</span> and the place where this all happens. </p><h2>  Aftermath of an explosion </h2><p>  The amazing factors of the explosion are: </p><ul><li>  Jet of gaseous substances. </li><li>  Heat. </li><li>  Light emission. </li><li>  A sharp and loud sound. </li><li>  Shards. </li><li>  Air shock wave. </li></ul><p>  Such phenomena can be observed in the explosion of both warheads and domestic gas.  The former are often used for military operations, they are used only by highly skilled specialists.  But there are situations when objects capable of exploding fall into the hands of civilians, and it is especially scary if it turns out to be children.  In such cases, as a rule, explosions end in tragedy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="major explosive attack factors" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1387642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Household gas explodes mainly if the rules for its operation are not respected.  It is very important to teach children how to handle gas appliances and to place telephone numbers of rescue services in a visible place. </p><h2>  Affected areas </h2><p>  Damaging factors of the explosion can be caused to a person of varying severity of damage.  Specialists distinguish several zones: </p><ol><li>  Zone I. </li><li>  Zone II. </li><li>  Zone III. </li></ol><p>  In the first two, the consequences are most severe: the carbonization of bodies occurs under the influence of very high temperatures and explosion products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the third zone, in addition to the direct influence of explosion factors, one can also observe indirect.  The impact of a shock wave by a person is perceived as a strong blow, in which: </p><ul><li>  internal organs; </li><li>  hearing organs (rupture of the eardrum); </li><li>  brain (concussion); </li><li>  bones and tissues (fractures, various injuries). </li></ul><p>  In the most difficult situation are people who met a shock wave in a standing position outside the shelter.  In such a situation, a fatal outcome often occurs or a person receives severe injuries and severe injuries, burns. </p><h2>  Explosion damage types </h2><p>  Depending on the proximity of the focus of the explosion, a person can receive lesions of varying severity: </p><ol><li>  Lungs.  This may include a slight concussion, partial hearing loss, bruises.  Hospitalization may not even be required. </li><li>  Medium.  This is a brain injury with loss of consciousness, bleeding from the ears and nose, fractures and dislocations. </li><li>  Severe damage includes severe concussion, damage to internal organs, complicated fractures, and sometimes fatal outcomes are possible. </li><li>  Extremely severe degree.  In almost 100% of cases, it ends with the death of the victim. </li></ol><p>  You can give an example: with the complete destruction of the building, almost everyone dies, who was there at that moment, only a fluke can save a person‚Äôs life.  And with partial destruction, there may be deaths, but most will receive injuries of varying severity. </p><h2>  Nuclear explosion </h2><p>  It is the result of a nuclear charge.  This is an uncontrolled process in which a huge amount of radiant and thermal energy is released.  All this is the result of a fission chain reaction or thermonuclear fusion in a short time period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1387718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main distinguishing feature of a nuclear explosion is that it always has a center - the point where the explosion occurred, and also the epicenter - the projection of this point on the earth or water surface. </p><p>  Next, the damaging factors of the explosion and their characteristics will be examined in more detail.  Such information should be brought to the attention of the public.  As a rule, students receive it at school, and adults - at workplaces. </p><h2>  Nuclear explosion and its damaging factors </h2><p>  So, what are the <span>damaging factors of a nuclear explosion</span> can be called?  First of all, we note that these are physical processes and phenomena that arise in the process thereof and determine its damaging effect.  The power of the explosion determines not only the nature and extent of the impact, but also the duration of the damaging factors.  So, the latter include: </p><ol><li>  Shock wave. </li><li>  Light emission. </li><li>  Radioactive contamination. </li><li>  Penetrating radiation. </li><li>  Electromagnetic pulse. </li></ol><p>  Consider each factor in more detail. </p><h2>  Shock wave characteristic </h2><p>  This is the main damaging factor, which leads to numerous damage and injuries.  A wave arises due to the large pressure that forms in the center of the explosion - in the first seconds after it, the value can reach billions of atmospheres.  <span>The shock wave</span> propagates and exerts its damaging effect on all living organisms. </p><p>  The main parameters that determine its damaging effect include: </p><ul><li>  High pressure. </li><li>  Speed. </li><li>  Duration </li></ul><p>  The shocking effect of a shock wave depends on the magnitude of the overpressure.  And the degree of damage will directly depend on the strength of the explosion and on the distance at which you are from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="light emission" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1390101.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Light emission characteristic </h2><p>  After the explosion, a light flux of energy is formed, which consists of ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectra.  Light emit parts of the ammunition, which are heated to high temperatures.  The maximum temperature can exceed 7 thousand degrees. </p><p>  Light radiation can have the following damaging effects: </p><ul><li>  Burns. </li><li>  Eye damage. </li><li>  Ignition of materials and objects. </li><li>  Fires. </li></ul><p>  The degree of exposure may be different: </p><ol><li>  There are areas in which individual fires occur. </li><li>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsevere destruction, as a rule, up to 90% of buildings burn.  This is the most dangerous area. </li><li>  There is also a fire zone in the rubble, where everything has already evaporated and collapsed, only smoldering remains. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Penetrating radiation </h2><p>  When an explosion occurs, there is a stream of neutrons and gamma rays - this is penetrating radiation.  Neutrons freely pass through living tissue and disrupt the vital functions of cells, metabolic processes, negatively affect the functioning of organs and systems.  All this ends up with radiation sickness developing.  Its most severe forms are fatal. </p><p>  The most dangerous zone is a radius of 2-3 kilometers from the source of the explosion.  In addition to the negative impact on living organisms, radiation can damage optical and electronic devices. </p><p>  In order to somehow weaken the destructive effect of penetrating radiation, it is necessary to use protective materials, which we will talk about later. </p><h2>  Radioactive contamination </h2><p>  The explosion produces various products and radioactive isotopes.  They are the main source of radioactive contamination.  If the explosion occurs on the ground, a cloud is formed at a height of many kilometers with radioactive products.  It is carried by the wind, particles fall to the ground, as a result, a <span>zone of radioactive contamination is formed.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dangerous zone" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28542/1387727.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Everything is exposed to him: soil, water, air, infrastructure.  The greatest danger is observed in the first hours after the precipitation.  Since at this time the activity of all radioactive particles is maximum. </p><h2>  Nuclear explosion zones </h2><p>  To determine the nature of possible destruction and the scope of emergency rescue operations, <span>the nuclear lesion focus is</span> divided into several zones: </p><ol><li>  Zone of total destruction.  Here you can observe 100% loss among the population, if it was not protected.  The main damaging factors of the explosion have their maximum effect.  You can see the almost complete destruction of buildings, damage to utilities, the complete destruction of forests. </li><li>  The second zone is the site where severe damage is observed.  Losses among the population reach 90%.  Most of the buildings are destroyed, solid blockages are formed on the ground, but shelters and anti-radiation shelters manage to resist. </li><li>  Zone with medium destruction.  Losses among the population are small, but many injured and injured.  There is a partial or complete destruction of buildings, blockages are formed.  In shelters it is quite possible to escape. </li><li>  Zone of weak destruction.  Here, the impact of the explosion is minimal.  The damage is insignificant, there are practically no casualties among people. </li></ol>

    <h2>  How to protect yourself from the effects of an explosion </h2><p>  In almost every city and smaller settlement, protective shelters must be built without fail.  In them, the population is provided with food and water, as well as personal protective equipment, which includes: </p><ul><li>  Gloves. </li><li>  Protective glasses. </li><li>  Gas masks. </li><li>  Respirators </li><li>  Protective suits. </li></ul><p>  Protection against the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion will help minimize the harm caused by radiation, radiation and shock waves.  The most important thing is to use it in a timely manner.  Everyone should have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to behave in such a situation, what needs to be done to be as little as possible affected by damaging factors. </p><p>  The consequences of any explosion can threaten not only human health, but also life.  Therefore, it is necessary to make every effort to prevent such situations due to a negligent attitude towards observing the rules for the safe handling of explosive objects and substances. </p>
