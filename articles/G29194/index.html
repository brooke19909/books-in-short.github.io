If kits do not appeal to you, then there are drawings with instructions.  Use them when creating a product.  They can be focused not only on experienced designers, but also on beginners who are interested in the process of creating something unusual with their own hands.  Naturally, in such a situation, the process will go much easier.  Experienced designers may not like this.  But models of a sailing ship, which are formed entirely on their own, starting with the independent development of drawings, are much more interesting. </p><h2>  Realize what you want to get </h2>

    <p>  Sailboats can attract the attention of ship modelers.  For this reason, at the time of creating your own drawing, you need to understand what should be obtained as a result, which ship should be created.  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully study the internal furnishings that characterize the original models of the sailboat. </p><p>  You must be aware that all models usually have at least two masts with slanting sails.  The hull of the sailboat includes a mast (a wooden frame, which consists of a mast and a girder) and rigging (ropes for various purposes). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Check out the sailboat </h2><p>  Before you begin to create a drawing of the model of a sailboat, look at a variety of pictures, read all available information about the model, about the features of its structure and about the battles in which it participated.  Immediately you need to take care of collecting all the necessary tools.  You will need rulers, a magnifying glass, measuring protractors, angles, etc. Understand the scale at which you plan to execute the drawing.  It is necessary to calculate the size and location of the ship on paper, all its components. </p><h2>  Important Tips </h2><p>  What nuances should be taken into account if you decide to independently manufacture models of sailing ships, starting with the formation of the drawing?  It is necessary to make the scheme in several projections: in the diametrical, main and in the midsection (with the help of it the basic outlines of the future vessel are set).  Using the first plane, you can conditionally divide the vessel into parts - left and right.  The main plane is horizontal, tangent to the lowest point located on the hull of the vessel.  It's about the keel line.  The midsection, which is still known to many as the midsection frame, is a transverse, vertical plane that runs in the middle of the length of the vessel. </p>

    <p>  When designing models of sailboats, it must be understood that the drawing will need to draw lines where decks and sides, keels and pins, decks and rudders, fins and transoms will intersect.  Usually portrayed half of the ship.  In other words, one side.  The hull of the vessel must be symmetrical to the diametrical plane.  The drawing on the sheet should be arranged in the following order: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  ‚ÄúSide‚Äù should be in the upper part; </li><li>  "Half latitude" - in the lower part; </li><li>  ‚ÄúBody‚Äù - on the left (preferably at the same level with the ‚Äúside‚Äù). </li></ul><h2>  What do we need? </h2><p>  Is the drawing ready?  Now it‚Äôs time to move on to the issue of constructing <span>models of sailboats from wood</span> and other materials.  It should be understood that a ship made by one‚Äôs own hands can decorate the design of your home by adding notes of romance and sea voyages to it.  A similar ship can be assembled from ready-made kits.  This has already been mentioned above.  But it‚Äôs always more interesting to design yourself. </p>

All this has been said in more detail.  This process should not cause difficulties.  It should only be noted that one must carefully approach the choice of scale.

    <p>  The hull of the future model of the ship should be cut using a rectangular <span>wooden block.</span>  To perform all actions with high accuracy, you will need to use cardboard templates.  They must be applied in turn to the future building.  It is recommended to start from the bow, and finish accordingly.  When the case is cut, you will need to process it.  Use <span>sandpaper</span> for these purposes <span>.</span>  It must be understood that it is necessary to smooth out all the roughnesses.  If there are noticeable cracks on the body, use a putty to repair them.  To make this substance is quite simple, using <span>tooth powder</span> and nitrocellulose glue. </p><h2>  We create a bulwark and a deck </h2><p>  For the manufacture of the deck, it is worth using thick paper or cardboard.  Glossy material is best.  Finished deck should be painted.  To do this, use nitro enamel.  The color you choose yourself.  The best option is a dark red shade.  It corresponds to the real color inherent in the ship's meerk.  For coloring it is worth using a spray gun. </p>

    <p>  Using thick paper or cardboard, you will need to make a bulwark.  It must be adjusted to the dimensions characteristic of the deck.  With glue, you need to attach the made bulwark.  This must be done butt to deck.  After that, it should be painted with the body.  That <span>part of the ship,</span> which will be located under water, it is desirable to arrange in bright colors that will correspond to the painting of the prototype. </p><h2>  Production of deck superstructures </h2><p>  What other steps will need to be performed in order to obtain prefabricated models of sailboats?  All superstructures that should be located on the deck must be made using pieces of thin plywood.  Instead, you can use polystyrene.  Finished components of the ship must be pasted over with colored paper.  If the sailboat suggests the presence of hatches, then you need to imitate their covers using, for example, gauze.  Stick it on the cardboard. </p><p>  For the manufacture of masts, it is worth using wire.  You can also glue wooden sticks together.  It should only be understood that they will first need to be planed.  This must be done in order to give them the desired shape.  To create rigging, you should use strong threads or thin wire. </p><h2>  Sail making </h2>

    <p>  It remains only to create a sail.  To do this, use white paper.  The fabric on a relatively small model will look rather rough and unnatural.  On paper sails, it is necessary to depict cut lines using a sharp pencil.  When all the actions are done, you will receive a sailboat.  The assembly model is completely ready.  If there is a desire, then you can build a simple stand, using wooden blocks for these purposes.  Store the ship in an open cabinet.  Preferably in a glass.  So you can protect it from dust and from accidental damage. </p><h2>  When is a machine needed? </h2><p>  In some situations, you can‚Äôt do without a machine.  But it is best to resort to his help when there is relevant experience not only in working with him, but also in modeling ships.  So, when can you use a machine?  If the real model is equipped with guns, then they must also be depicted on the model.  And in this case, turning equipment will not work.  Also, work with the machine may be required in order to make almost all turned parts.  And there can be a lot of them. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  It must be understood that the ship we are creating will not sail.  It will be a decorative item.  Therefore, materials that can be destroyed due to exposure to water can also be used.  The most important thing in modeling is the impeccable quality of the work done.  And it can be easily seen in detail. </p>
