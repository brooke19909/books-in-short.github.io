One of the most famous resort towns on the <span>Crimean coast</span> is the well-known Theodosia.  The popularity of this city is well-founded; people come here for a quality beach holiday.  And they find him.  There is an abundance of sea, sun, and magnificent southern greenery.  But this is far from all, in this small town there is something to look at.  The sights of Feodosia deserve attention.  This city is marked in Russian history by many events and outstanding people.  Here the Russian Empire lived out its last days, the ships with refugees left from here in the direction of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, when the red cavalry was already entering the city outskirts under the roar of shots. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feodosia sights" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/217326.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Theodosius.</strong>  <strong>sights</strong> </p><p>  The history of this city goes back more than two and a half millennia.  It has been known since antiquity.  But the sights of Feodosia of that era did not reach our time in the form of any object that was preserved and suitable for visiting by tourists.  But the period of the Middle Ages was much luckier.  Everyone knows this visual image - the <span>Genoese fortress, Theodosius.</span>  Photos of the attraction, its picturesque ruins have become a kind of symbol of this Black Sea town, its hallmark.  This is a beautiful and expressive place where tourists like to be photographed.  A decoration of the city is the Stamboli Villa on the seashore.  This quaint Moorish-style building was once built by a tobacco manufacturer for himself and his family.  An undoubted attraction is the streets of the town themselves, the layout of which has been formed over the past few centuries.  To make sure of this, it is enough to visit the old Tatar-Karaite part of the city with its characteristic houses, fountains, mosques and minarets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Feodosia photo attractions" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/217327.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Museums</strong> </p><p>  The sights of Feodosia include two must-see museums.  This is the literary museum-apartment of the romantic writer <span>Alexander Green</span> , the author of the famous Scarlet Sails and many other famous works.  The house-museum is located on an old street near the <span>sea, its</span> exposition is beautifully decorated.  And, of course, the famous Aivazovsky Gallery, for its sake alone it is worth coming to Feodosia.  The collection of paintings by the great marine painter leaves a lasting impression on those who saw him.  This is the most complete collection of works by the famous master.  Listing the sights of Feodosia, it would be unfair not to mention the historical museum with its unique collection of archaeological rarities.  This is one of the best historical museums in Ukraine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Feodosia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/217329.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Nearest city surroundings</strong> </p><p>  When exploring the sights of Feodosia, it's a good idea to look beyond it.  You can get acquainted with how grapes grow on the slopes of the Crimean mountains and how pretty good Crimean wine is obtained from it, which can be tasted and appreciated here.  Wine in Feodosia is good and relatively inexpensive. </p>
