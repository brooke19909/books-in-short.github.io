Storming Vienna</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Austria and Hungary are those countries that, although they seem very similar, are in many ways different from each other.  This also applies to mentality.  So, upon arrival in Hungary, the Red Army of the Secular Union was received extremely coldly, hostilely, while the Austrians reacted neutrally and even loyally to the military. </p><p>  There is still no common opinion about the preparation and conduct of the operation.  This is due to the rivalry of Soviet ideology and Austrian neutrality, pro-fascist views and common sense.  Nevertheless, the liberation of Vienna is an interesting, exciting and awe-inspiring topic in front of the power of soldiers and unquenchable patriotism.  Especially considering the fact that the Austrian capital was liberated not only very quickly, but also with minimal human losses. </p><h2>  Preparation for surgery </h2><p>  By 1945, both warring parties were already exhausted: morally and physically - soldiers and rear units, economically - every country that took part in this bloody struggle.  A surge of new energy appeared when the German counter-offensive near Lake Balaton was failed.  The forces of the Red Army literally wedged themselves in the defense of the Nazis, which forced the Germans to quickly take measures to eliminate such a ‚Äúhole‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  The main danger for them was that if the Soviet troops were sealed off at a new frontier, they could have forgotten about the capture of Hungary for a long time.  And if this country is lost, Austria will soon also be under Russian control. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At this time, the fighters of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian fronts faced the task of defeating the Germans in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Balaton no later than March 16th. </p><p>  Then the forces of the 3rd UV were to inflict a crushing blow on the enemy and by the 15th of April reach the Tuln, Sankt Pelten, Neu-Lengbach lines. </p><h2>  Offensive resources </h2><p>  Since the liberation of Vienna had high hopes not only for command, but also for ordinary soldiers, preparations for the operation began immediately.  The main blow was to be fought by the fighters of the Third Ukrainian Front.  Depressed, with many casualties among people and technology, they found the strength to prepare for the offensive. </p><p>  The replenishment of military vehicles was not only due to the receipt of new copies, but also thanks to the soldiers who restored weapons as far as possible. </p><p>  At the time when the operation to liberate Vienna began, the arsenal of the 3rd Ukrainian Front included: </p><ul><li>  18 rifle divisions; </li><li>  about two hundred tanks and self-propelled guns (self-propelled artillery mounts); </li><li>  almost 4000 guns and mortars. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Overall assessment of the operation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, we cannot speak unequivocally about the ease or complexity of actions.  On the one hand, the liberation of Vienna in 1945 is one of the fastest and most striking operations.  On the other hand, these are significant human and material losses.  It‚Äôs easy to say that the capture of the Austrian capital was only possible at a discount on the fact that most of the other assaults were associated with significantly greater human losses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The almost instantaneous liberation of Vienna is also the result of the experience of the Soviet military, since they already had successful capture schemes. </p><p>  Do not forget about the special elation of our soldiers, which also played a significant role in the successful resolution of the struggle for the capital of Austria.  The fighters felt both victory and deadly fatigue.  But the understanding that every step forward is a direction towards a speedy return home, lifted the spirit. </p><h2>  Tasks before the onset </h2><p>  The liberation of Vienna, in fact, dates back to February, when the option of cleansing Hungary and then expelling the Nazis from Vienna began to be developed.  The exact plan was ready by mid-March, and already on the 26th of the same month, the Soviet offensive group (Russian and Romanian soldiers) was tasked with attacking and occupying the Veshi-Pozba line. </p>

    <p>  By the evening of that day, the operation was only partially completed.  In fierce battles, our army suffered many losses, but even with the onset of darkness, the fire did not stop.  The very next day, the enemy managed to force out the Nitra River. </p><h2>  Red Army Forces </h2><p>  Gradual progress continued until April 5th (it was on that day that the liberation of Vienna by Soviet troops began).  At 7.00 in the morning of this day the offensive on Bratislava started.  The 25th Rifle Corps of the Red Army, the 27th Guards Tank Brigade, as well as the 2nd Romanian Tank Regiment took part in it.  After a grueling battle, Bratislava was taken by the end of the day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In parallel, the Soviet-Romanian troops began to force the Morava River, however, unlike the capture of the city, the mission was not completed in the same time.  Until April 8th, local battles were fought on this front, which prevented a relatively calm crossing to the other side.  On April 9th, the boost was over.  At three in the afternoon, our troops were able to cross to the other side.  The military were assembled in Zwerndorf, a little later to connect with separate parts of the 4th Guards VDD. </p><p>  10 T-34 tanks, 5 <span>SU-76</span> aircraft <span>and</span> Romanian self-propelled guns and 15 tanks were transferred here. </p>

    <h2>  Forces for the defense of the capital of Austria </h2><p>  <span>The forces of the Red Army were</span> opposed by a fairly powerful German group.  So, the liberation of Vienna in 1945 would be possible subject to victory over: </p><ul><li>  8 tank and 1 infantry divisions; </li><li>  15 infantry battalions for the Volkssturm (foot attack); </li><li>  the whole composition of the capital's military school; </li><li>  by the police, from which 4 regiments were created (over 6,000 people). </li></ul><p>  In addition, do not forget about the advantage on the fascist side due to natural resources.  The west of the city was covered by mountains, the eastern and northern sides were washed by the practically insurmountable Danube, and the Germans strengthened the south with anti-tank ditches, various <span>fortifications,</span> pillboxes, trenches, and bunkers. </p><p>  Vienna itself was literally crammed with weapons hidden in the ruins, the streets were blocked by barricades, and ancient buildings served as original bastions. </p>

    <h2>  Capture plan </h2><p>  Objectively assessing the situation and realizing that the liberation of Vienna by the Soviet troops would not be the easiest, F.I. Tolbukhin plans to direct attacks from 3 sides, thereby creating a panic among the command due to surprise.  The three wings of the attack should have looked like this: </p><ol><li>  The 4th Guards Army, together with the 1st Guards Corps, was beaten in the southeast. </li><li>  The 6th Guards Army along with the 18th TC would attack the south-west side. </li><li>  The West, as the only escape route, cut off the remaining forces. </li></ol><p>  Thus, a natural defense would become a death trap. </p><p>  It is also worth noting the attitude of the Soviet military to the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the city: it was planned to minimize the destruction in the capital. </p><p>  The plan was approved instantly.  Capturing a position and clearing the city would have occurred with lightning speed, if not for the strongest resistance. </p><h2>  First half offensive </h2><p>  On the 5th, the operation started, which lasted until April 13th.  The liberation of Vienna, however, ended relatively quickly and without catastrophic human losses, but such fights can not be called a walk either. </p>

    <p>  The first day did not bring the Red Army success in operations because of the fierce resistance of German forces.  Even in spite of the active offensive of the Soviet troops, the advance remained scanty.  The Nazis understood that they had nowhere to run and fought to the last. </p><p>  April 6th is marked by fierce battles near the city, at its approaches.  On this day, the Soviet Army managed to pass more, and in the evening even get to the western and southern outskirts, then find themselves in the Vienna suburbs. </p><p>  Another wing made a detour along the Alps and went to the western approaches, and then to the Danube. </p><p>  Such actions led to the fact that the enemy group was surrounded. </p><h2>  City capture </h2><p>  The liberation of Vienna from the Nazis goes into the active phase already from the evening of April 7th, when the right wing of the 3rd UV captures Pressbaum and moves further in three directions: west, east and north. </p>

    <p>  On the 9th, the bloodiest part of the capture begins.  The Germans are especially resisting near the Imperial Bridge, since its capture would mean complete encirclement.  The end of the fifth day of the operation was marked by the success of the Red Army - the aggressor group was in the ring, although the central units were still trying to fight and oppose. </p><p>  On April 11, the crossing of the Danube Canal begins, as well as the last battles, the liberation of Vienna from the Nazis is coming to an end. </p><p>  To deal with the enemy was easier, the German garrison was divided into four parts, and then neutralized. </p><p>  The city‚Äôs mopping-up process begins, which continues until noon on April 13th.  It is on this date that Vienna's Liberation Day is celebrated. </p><h2>  Attitude to locals and the city </h2><p>  The command of the Soviet Army showed respect for the history and culture of the Austrian capital.  Confirmation of this is an appeal to the <span>inhabitants of Vienna</span> with an appeal to help the Red Army.  The essence of such help was that the townspeople were simply asked not to leave their houses, not allowing the Germans to ruin the buildings and destroy the monuments.  Such words were accepted with a bang. </p><p>  In fact, it was a tactical move, the essence of which: if you want to be helped, save a thing dear to your heart.  After such a statement, the initially neutral attitude of the Austrians changes for the better, and therefore active cooperation begins. </p><p>  The victory in this city became symbolic, because the first country captured by the Nazis was Austria.  Throughout the war, this event was the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. </p>

    <h2>  Union victory </h2><p>  The first thing worth noting when speaking about the results is the destruction of a large group of the Wehrmacht, but, in addition, we can not say that in preparation for the operation Hungary was completely liberated, which was facilitated by the fighters of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian fronts.  Each participant received a medal for the liberation of Vienna. </p><p>  Then the eastern regions of the country and the capital were occupied. </p><p>  The way to Prague was also opened, which made it possible to move on as quickly as possible. </p><p>  The cultural and historical heritage of one of the most picturesque capitals of Europe has been preserved, as well as the beginning of the restoration of Vienna. </p><p>  The Austrian people were literally poor after robbery, bombing and destruction, because in the same 1945 a firm decision was made to provide food assistance to the population. </p><h2>  Losses for Fascist Germany </h2><p>  As for the losses for Berlin, this is the loss of control over the largest industrial center of <span>Western Europe</span> - the Vienna Industrial Area, and the battle for the Nagykanizhskoye oil field was also lost.  Without it, nearby fuel plants were left without raw materials.  Thus, German technology lost mobility, and the command was forced to withdraw it deep into the conquered territories, which allowed the Soviet troops to quickly move forward.  Resistance was provided only by infantry formations, which could not give a serious rebuff to the enemy, being under artillery fire. </p><p>  There is a direct threat of the defeat of Germany, and, as a consequence, the surrender of fascist troops. </p><p>  The behavior of the German command was devoid of <span>honor and dignity.</span>  The soldiers showed themselves as a crowd of barbarians and vandals who destroyed the most beautiful and largest cathedrals of the city, and also tried to blow up the maximum number of monuments.  And leaving the city, they mined the Imperial Bridge. </p><h2>  Memory and celebration </h2><p>  Starting from 1945, Vienna annually celebrates on April 13 the Day of the liberation of the city from German invaders.  The Vienna Liberation Museum was established on one of the streets. </p><p>  And on the day that the enemy left the city, 24 volleys of three hundred guns were fired in Moscow.  After a while, it was decided to establish a new award for participants in these events - the medal "For the Liberation of Vienna". </p><p>  Today, in addition to the museum, the monument to the fallen soldiers on Schwarzenbergplatz square, which was erected in the same 1945 at the very beginning of the restoration of the city and the whole country, reminds of these fierce battles.  It is made in the form of a standing fighter.  A soldier holds a banner in one hand, and put the other on a shield in the form of the <span>coat of arms of the USSR.</span>  Modern masters painted some details in yellow. </p><p>  In commemoration of this victory, 50 combat units that distinguished themselves in the battle for Vienna were given the honorary name "Vienna". </p>
