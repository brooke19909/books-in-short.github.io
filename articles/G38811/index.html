Charles Darwin: A Short Biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Charles Darwin is one of the most versatile researchers in the history of mankind.  Naturalist, traveler, author of the theory of evolution - this is a small part of his vast achievements and merits. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  A short biography of Darwin does not describe the scientist's enormous contribution to the development of modern disyplins, but it begins in 1809. </p><p>  A scientist was born on February 12 in an English large family in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. </p><p>  According to the data that Darwin left about himself, the biography reports that the boy's father was engaged in finances.  He was also a successful doctor.  The activities of Robert Darwin allowed the family to live comfortably.  Subsequently, the father was proud that his son was C. Darwin.  A brief biography of the scientist confirms that father and son supported each other all their lives. </p><p>  The boy‚Äôs mother left our world in 1817, and very little information has been preserved about her. </p><p>  A brief biography of Darwin tells us that Charles's grandfather, Erasmus, was a doctor, philosopher, writer.  In general, all family members were people with a high level of intelligence and culture. </p><p>  What kind of education did Darwin get?  The biography tells that in 1817 he began a course at a local day school, and a year later he was transferred to Anglican. </p>

    <p>  Young Charles was a very intelligent child.  But at the same time he did not like to study at school and considered the school curriculum extremely boring. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In his free time, he preferred to collect and study insects, shells, unusual stones.  I watched the natural processes - the flowering of trees and shrubs, the course of rivers, the direction of the wind.  He was fond of hunting and fishing. </p><h2>  Charles Darwin.  Short biography.  University education </h2><p>  In 1825, the father heeded the requests of his son and sent him to study at the University of Edinburgh.  Robert wanted to see in the boy the successor of the medical dynasty. </p><p>  He devoted a lot of time to the study of biology, in particular, marine invertebrates, algae.  He was fond of taxidermy, natural history and geology.  He took an active part in the activities of the University Museum, where the largest collection of plants in Europe was collected. </p><p>  After two ‚Äúterribly boring‚Äù years of study, I abandoned my studies. </p><p>  At the insistence of an angry father, he decides to transfer to the theological faculty of Cambridge, where teachers will be able to find out the name that later thundered to the whole world - C. Darwin.  The biography mentions that the applicant thoughtfully reads church books for admission.  He is engaged individually with a teacher in his native Shrewsbury. </p><p>  Opens a new page in his life Darwin.  A biography about this period of the great scientist‚Äôs life is narrated: immediately after the end of the Christmas holidays of 1828, he successfully passes the entrance exams. </p><p>  The years of study were remembered for riding lessons, hunting, collecting beetles, studying literature, mathematics, physics, geography. </p><p>  He graduated in 1831. Despite the fact that he did not shine with particular successes during his studies, the knowledge gained allowed Darwin to be on the list of ten best graduates. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After graduation, he began to doubt even more the truth of the dogmas of Christianity. </p><h2>  Charles Darwin: A Brief Biography.  Naturalistic activities </h2><p>  In an endless search for the realization of potential, the scientist meets the famous botanist John Henslow, who accepted the graduate into the team of South American nature researchers on the Beagle ship.  Subsequently, the eminent scientist was very happy that C. Darwin went on the team.  A biography studied in detail by historians of science confirms this statement. </p>

    <p>  Charles's father was against travel, considering him a waste of time.  Only thanks to the intervention of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood II, did Robert Darwin surrender and give a parting blessing to his son. </p><p>  Over a five-year journey, the team traveled to Peru, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Europe, Australia, and Africa. </p><p>  In the <span>Galapagos Islands,</span> researchers were particularly interested in mockingbirds, which were somewhat different from those living in England.  He studied turtles, whose species differed even on neighboring islands. </p><p>  The scientist studied with interest the local territories, flora and fauna.  The result of the expedition was a huge collection of stones, minerals, herbs, stuffed animals and birds.  Descriptions of the appearance and anatomy of many invertebrates were made. </p><p>  All observations were recorded in a diary, on which Charles relied when writing scientific papers in the next twenty years.  The research was published under the title "Traveling Around the World on a Beagle Ship.  The scientist gained world fame both in the scientific community and among ordinary people. </p><p>  In addition, Charles formed a vocation and meaning in life - Darwin did not see life without science. </p><h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  On a five-year journey, he grew up as a scientist Darwin.  The biography reports that after its completion, Charles moved to Cambridge.  But very soon he moves to London, where he enters the society of scientists with whom he primarily communicates over the next five years. </p>

    <p>  This period of Charles's life was marked by a stormy, fruitful activity - fundamental works were written, many hours were spent in heated discussions.  For their love of stubborn pursuit of proof of thoughts and ideas, researchers choose the chief secretary of the society of geologists. </p><h2>  Craving for Change </h2><p>  Life in a large city puts more and more pressure on the scientist.  And the body copes with attacking diseases worse and worse. </p><p>  In 1839 he marries Emma Wedgwood and already in 1842 he moved to the acquired estate "Dawn". </p><p>  Subsequently, the wife will give birth to Darwin ten descendants. </p><p>  Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, Charles can devote himself to his favorite activities - walking, fishing, hunting, nature watching, </p><p>  A solid inheritance and income from written books allow you to plunge into your favorite things. </p><p>  In 1842, Darwin's work Zoology of Travel on the Beagle was written. </p>

    <p>  In 1859, the then revolutionary book, The Origin of Species through Natural Selection, was published. </p><p>  The author‚Äôs arguments contradicted the accepted opinion in society, backed up by the Bible‚Äôs writings on how the world was created.  The works described in detail why it is worth considering the possibility of millions of years of independent development of nature - plants, animals, humans.  Subsequently, the theory was named after the researcher - "Darwinism." </p>

    <p>  The idea was carefully supported by the material obtained during many years of observation.  ‚ÄúDarwinism‚Äù became very popular and, despite the scandalousness, brought a good profit to the scientist. </p><h2>  Further labors and merits </h2><p>  In 1862, the book Pollination of Orchids was published, followed by Climbing Plants and Insectivorous Plants. </p><p>  In 1868 - the continuation of the "Origin of species ..." - "Change in domestic animals and cultivated plants." </p><p>  In 1871, the book The Origin of Man and Sexual Selection saw the world. </p><p>  And in 1872 - "Expression of emotions in humans and animals", in which the scientist considered the origin of man from ape-like ancestors. </p><p>  Of course, they did not have such popularity, but they allowed the scientist to receive several prestigious awards, among them the Kopleyevsky <span>gold medal</span> from the Royal Society of London. </p><p>  In subsequent years, he became an honorary doctor of sciences at Breslavl, Bonn, <span>Leiden universities,</span> as well as a corresponding member of the St. Petersburg Academy. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Russian Orthodox Church did not favor the work of the scientist and tried her best to slander him.  Many representatives of the intelligentsia had to defend themselves.  Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy actively defended what the scientist believed.  The biography confirms these data. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The famous scientist left our world on April 19, 1882 at the age of seventy-three. </p><p>  Despite world fame, he was remembered by his descendants as a modest, friendly, tactful person.  Scientist Darwin, whose biography is studied in all modern universities, is buried in <span>Westminster Abbey,</span> near <span>Isaac Newton.</span> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Charles Darwin was on a par with the most prominent scientists of all time.  His work, proving the origin of living things from common ancestors, is the basis of the modern <span>synthetic theory of evolution,</span> biology, as well as genetics. </p><p>  Director John Emiel shot a short autobiography of Darwin - the 2009 film The Origin of Species. </p>
