    <p>  All these beach resorts offer a wide variety of services for vacationers: hotels, clubs, shops, restaurants.  The only, little-mastered by tourists remains the Pacific coast in the western part of the country, although the beaches there are also beautiful, as well as on the Caribbean coast.  On these shores, the lagoons are beautiful, and the islands.  The only negative is that it rains more often. </p><h2>  In conclusion - how to get to Colombia </h2><p>  Colorful and attractive resorts have Colombia (Republic).  How to get to her to see these magnificent places and to spend a good time relaxing? </p><p>  There are no direct flights to Colombia from Russia.  You can get there by plane only through transit routes, with transfers at the airports of America or Europe. </p><p>  From France there are regular direct flights to Bogota, as well as from Amsterdam and Madrid. </p><p>  Many North American (Washington, Atlanta, Houston, etc.) and South American cities (Caracas, Buenos Aires, Quito, etc.) are directly related to BogotÃ¡. </p><p>  Colombian Eldorado Airport is 15 km from the center of Bogota. </p><p>  In order to see the amazing beauties of the magnificent nature of Colombia, it is worth moving such a rather long flight. </p>
