The impeccable reputation of the institution, positive customer reviews are no less important.  Bank Vozrozhdenie holds a special position among numerous financial organizations.  It has a wide network and offers interesting lending programs, deposits.  However, this organization, like any other, has not only supporters. </p><h2>  What is this organization </h2><p>  Revival was founded in 1991.  Today, the bank is among the top 50 Russian credit organizations.  The worthy positions of the company are confirmed by high international ratings and by no means the last places in the all-Russian ratings. </p><p>  If we take the data for the current 2018, then this commercial bank is assigned 38th place in the list of the largest domestic financial institutions.  The company's assets exceed 260 billion rubles.  Judging by these indicators, there is no doubt in the reliability of Bank Vozrozhdenie. </p><p>  Reviews about this organization are mixed.  Many customers are satisfied with the cooperation with the company.  The attention of most people is attracted by a wide line of offers on loans and deposits for both individuals and legal entities.  In reviews of Vozrozhdenie Bank, they often express gratitude to its employees and recommend using advantageous services.  But you can also often find other comments in which cheated clients of the Renaissance advise not to get involved with this company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The bank was created on the basis of the capital administration of the Agroprombank of the USSR.  Vozrozhdenie was one of those institutions that managed to get a stabilization subsidy from the Central Bank in 1998 due to competitiveness and demand among the population. </p><p>  At the moment, the company‚Äôs shares are in the hands of about 7 thousand holders, most of which are owned by Russian companies and private individuals.  The largest shareholder is Chairman of the Board D. Orlov.  He owns 30% of the securities that are quoted on stock markets.  Bank Vozrozhdenie boasts numerous offices and representative offices throughout the Russian Federation.  The majority of the company‚Äôs branches are located in Moscow and the Moscow Region.  The list of banking services provided is also impressive: from the simplest settlement and cash operations and customer card servicing to mortgage and consumer lending.  According to reviews, Vozrozhdenie Bank often takes car loans at a relatively low interest rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="catracalivre.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank reviews deposit revival" class="if uuid-2719503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719503.jpg"></div><h2>  Lending directions </h2><p>  Due to the opportunity to get a bank loan, citizens solve a lot of their financial difficulties in a short time.  Vozrozhdenie lends funds to customers for any purpose, including treatment, buying a car, housing, household appliances, repairs, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Each of the lending programs of this financial institution has a number of features, so customers of any category can find the most suitable solution for themselves.  The main types of loans from Bank Vozrozhdenie: </p><ul><li>  inappropriate consumer cash loan; </li><li>  mortgage for the purchase of an apartment in the primary or secondary market, a private house, apartments, etc .; </li><li>  refinancing and servicing loans received in other organizations. </li></ul><p>  The basic conditions on which the bank is ready to provide a loan do not have fundamental differences, depending on the specific program.  An important difference between loans is the source of security guarantees, the selected currency.  So, for example, when using collateral property, money in debt can be obtained both in the national currency of the Russian Federation and in arbitrary units, however, the interest rate in this case will also be different. </p><p>  The mortgage lending programs offered by the bank are also varied.  Vozrozhdenie does not lag behind the leading credit organizations of the country and allows for the possibility of obtaining a loan for the purchase of various real estate objects.  In addition to a loan for residential premises, you can get funds for the purchase of land and parking lots, as well as participate in shared construction on suitable conditions. </p><p>  According to customer reviews of Bank Vozrozhdenie, obtaining approval for refinancing a loan is not easy.  This service is resorted to by customers who would like to soften the conditions for paying off existing debt.  Making a decision depends on the balance of unpaid interest, the purity of the credit history and the consent of the client to join the collective insurance agreement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Consumer loan procedure </h2><p>  To choose a convenient loan program, now you do not need to come to a bank branch for a manager‚Äôs consultation.  You can get acquainted with the available banking products on the official website of the company.  A special online calculator for calculating a loan functions here.  In reviews of Vozrozhdenie Bank, customers often praise the site‚Äôs successful and accessible interface, as well as the absence of difficulties when using the calculator.  With it, you can make a preliminary calculation and find out the size of the monthly payment, depending on the source data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rankia.com.ar" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank loan revival reviews" class="if uuid-2719495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719495.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing the suitable loan conditions for yourself, you must submit an electronic application for a particular banking product.  Each of the clients can evaluate their chances of approval in advance, having familiarized themselves with the list of requirements for borrowers by the bank.  Citizens of the Russian Federation aged not older than 65 years and not younger than 21 years old can apply for a cash loan.  The chances of approving the application are minimal with a bad credit history.  Of great importance to the bank is the solvency of the borrower, therefore, Vozrozhdenie does not accept applications from persons who do not have official employment.  For employees, six months of continuous experience at the last place of work is enough, and for those customers who also receive salaries on the bank card, three months is enough. </p><p>  As you know, there is an exception to any rule.  In this case, it is worth giving an example of a pension program for pensioners.  The feedback on Vozrozhdenie Bank confirms the information available on the organization‚Äôs website: a loan is issued to pensioners with a positive credit history and permanent registration in the region of circulation. </p><p>  A preliminary application for a loan is considered within a few minutes, but this does not guarantee that upon presentation of a full package of documents at a bank branch, a loan will be issued to the applicant.  If you believe the reviews about the Bank "Renaissance", there are many cases of failure due to the inaccuracy of the information provided.  From 2 to 15 working days are required to consider the application and make a decision on approval or refusal to issue a loan. </p><h2>  How to repay a debt </h2><p>  All existing programs of the bank provide for the repayment of debt by the borrower according to the annuity scheme, which involves making monthly payments in equal amounts throughout the entire term of the loan.  Paying interest on the use of the loan and returning money for the loan body is necessary according to the schedule approved at the time of signing the contract.  The required amount can be paid in various ways: </p><ul><li>  transfer from a card of another bank through an ATM or terminal; </li><li>  cash at the bank office; </li><li>  by direct transfer from the employer of the borrower by deduction of the required amount from the salary of the latter. </li></ul><p>  In case of late payment of the next payment, the bank shall calculate a penalty in the amount of 20% of the monthly debt.  In addition, the bank provides for the possibility of recovering funds in the amount of 2% of the total loan debt in case of loss of the guarantor.  As with any other credit institution, you can also pay off the debt ahead of schedule - there is no penalty or commission for this. </p><h2>  What people say about loans of the Bank "Renaissance" </h2><p>  Judging by customer reviews of Vozrozhdenie Bank loans, not everyone is satisfied after working with this financial institution.  Since it is inappropriate consumer lending that is most in demand among Russian citizens, most of the responses are devoted to this particular issue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.debtsyndrome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank revival deposit customer reviews" class="if uuid-2719505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719505.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, people say that bank employees are too intrusively offering to insure life, health, and collateral against personal risks.  Moreover, when you refuse insurance, managers automatically increase the interest rate.  By such actions, employees of a banking organization violate the requirements of the law, since the decision on insurance should be taken solely by the individual borrower. </p><p>  The second reason for the negative feedback on the loan at Vozrozhdenie Bank is the delay by employees of the company about the repayment of debt.  In fact, this is a serious and very important point, in case of non-observance of which the borrower's credit history can be damaged.  It turns out that each bank transmits information about loans issued to the credit bureau, including the data related to the current repayment of the debt.  In the event of delay in updating the information on the payment of debt, another bank will be forced to refuse to issue a loan or mortgage to the client. </p><p>  Based on other user comments, it is not difficult to conclude that bank employees do not always cope with their duties, allow themselves irresponsibility, rudeness and audacity in relation to borrowers.  It is not uncommon for a bank in the event of a refusal to issue a loan to not even notify the client of the decision. </p><p>  There are also positive reviews of Vozrozhdenie bank employees.  Most of them are letters of appreciation with words of gratitude to the specialists who helped clients solve various problems.  Also, many users note a large selection of loan products, favorable annual rates, comfortable payment methods. </p><h2>  Deposits for the population: conditions, rates </h2><p>  Today, Bank Vozrozhdenie can offer more than ten types of deposits for individuals.  You can open an account for savings and capitalization in national or foreign currency.  For the convenience of users, a special form is presented on the company's official website, filling out which allows you to see a list of products that meet the specified criteria.  Note the main types of deposits in the Bank "Renaissance". </p><p>  The ‚ÄúMy Opportunities‚Äù program involves opening a dollar or ruble deposit account.  Depending on the chosen currency, deposit conditions are established.  To open an account you will need 10 thousand rubles, 300 $ or 300 ‚Ç¨.  In this case, the maximum annual rate in the first case may be 5.55%, in the second - 2% and in the third - no more than 0.3%.  A deposit is issued for a minimum of 6 months, and the client will be able to get their interest only after this period.  The ‚ÄúMy Opportunities‚Äù program allows both partial withdrawal of funds and account replenishment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kommersant.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank revival reviews of legal entities" class="if uuid-2719457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719457.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚ÄúMaximum income‚Äù deposit can be opened in any of the three currencies.  Clients who invest in Russian rubles can apply for the maximum rate (up to 7.45%).  A minimum of 50 thousand rubles is required.  To open an account in dollar terms, you need $ 1,500, while the client can count on an annual rate that does not exceed 2.8%.  And in that, and in that case, the deposit is opened for one calendar year, and interest on it can be received only at the end of the deposit term. </p><p>  "My piggy bank" is a standard solution of customers.  In reviews of deposits from Bank Vozrozhdenie, one can often find mention of this deposit program.  It allows opening a deposit in both domestic and foreign currencies.  The minimum deposit is 10 thousand rubles, 300 $ or 300 ‚Ç¨.  Interest at the request of the client can be charged to any account opened with the bank, or capitalized.  The maximum annual rate is 6.3%. </p><h2>  Documents for making a deposit </h2><p>  In the customer reviews on deposits of Vozrozhdenie Bank, many joyfully share the loyal conditions and the minimum requirements for opening a depositary account.  In comparison with the process of processing credit products, to conclude an agreement on servicing a deposit, a client needs: </p><ul><li>  be a resident of the Russian Federation or any other state; </li><li>  write a request to open a depositary account; </li><li>  submit identification documents. </li></ul><p>  Foreigners who also have the right to be investors will be required to submit documents confirming the fact of legal stay on the territory of Russia.  Each owner of a deposit account has the opportunity to withdraw money ahead of schedule, but for this you will have to file an application for termination of the contract in advance and pay a penalty. </p><p>  As for the list of documents required to open a deposit account, it looks like this: </p><ul><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation or a foreign citizen; </li><li>  the second document confirming the person‚Äôs identity (SNILS, driver‚Äôs license, military ID, etc.); </li><li>  pension certificate (if any). </li></ul><h2>  What nuances will have to face </h2><p>  A wide selection of deposit programs will help each client, regardless of the amount available, to choose the most profitable solution.  In reviews of the Bank Vozrozhdenie in Voronezh, users note the responsiveness of employees.  Experts explain everything in an accessible manner and help to choose a contribution that best meets the expectations of the interest rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="systell.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank revival customer reviews about loans" class="if uuid-2719491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719491.jpg"></div><p>  To get the greatest profit, it is not worth withdrawing interest money from a deposit account.  Instead, it‚Äôs better to activate the interest capitalization service.  In addition, you should be careful if you plan to periodically replenish the deposit - some programs do not provide for the possibility of making additional funds. </p><p>  To open a depositary account, the client will have to come personally to Vozrozhdenie Bank.  You can find reviews of branches of a credit organization on the company's website.  Those involved in the processing of various documents in electronic form note: this is a great opportunity to carefully study each proposal, to understand the nuances and choose the most beneficial for yourself.  If you need clarification, you can visit the bank branch and seek advice from specialists. </p><h2>  Customer opinion on deposits </h2><p>  A lot of responses about the deposit programs of Bank Vozrozhdenie are negative.  Mostly negative comments of people are caused by the fact that in some cases the profit on a bank deposit is much less than expected.  When concluding a contract, it is necessary to carefully study its terms.  Of particular importance are the terms of the deposit and the amount of investment.  Often, the provisions governing the conditions of depository savings are specified in the agreement in small print. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easy to find positive reviews about Vozrozhdenie Bank in Moscow and other Russian cities.  They are associated with expressing gratitude to the bank employees.  Most of the customers are satisfied with the quality of the services provided, consulting support and satisfactory conditions for servicing depository accounts.  Despite the fact that Bank Vozrozhdenie does not offer the highest interest rates, customers express a significant degree of trust in it by contacting here again. </p><h2>  Features of the mortgage </h2><p>  Having analyzed all the mortgage lending programs operating in this financial organization, one can identify the main conditions and requirements for potential borrowers.  Most of the applicants manage to obtain approval for a loan from Vozrozhdenie Bank, according to customer reviews of the mortgage.  The thing is that the interest rates at which the institution issues loans to the population slightly exceed the average indicators.  In this case, the main conditions for obtaining a home loan are considered very loyal.      . </p><p>  ¬´¬ª    .   ,   : </p><ul><li>    ‚Äì  1  30 ; </li><li>    ‚Äì  30  .,  ‚Äì  300 . .; </li><li>   -  10 %; </li><li>   ; </li><li>     . </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="petponder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if uuid-2719463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719463.jpg"></div><p>        ,    ,    ,  ,     .          10,4 %.   ¬´¬ª               .        : </p><ul><li>   21  65  (         65 ); </li><li>        ,        ; </li><li>           ; </li><li>    . </li></ul><p>          : </p><ul><li>   ; </li><li>     ; </li><li>  , , , ; </li><li> . </li></ul><p> Despite the lack of state participation, Bank Vozrozhdenie offers a social mortgage, for which a potential borrower needs to obtain relevant documents from the municipal authorities.  Military personnel, young families, socially vulnerable categories of citizens can count on the provision of subsidies from the state. </p><h2>  Mortgage Feedback </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews about the bank "Renaissance", in Krasnodar, this institution is the least popular among the population.  Those who nevertheless made a choice in favor of this company leave ambiguous comments.  On the one hand, there are many more positive reviews than negative ones.  Customers like that: </p><ul><li>  applications for mortgage loans are considered in a short time; </li><li>  the bank administration promptly responds to requests from borrowers; </li><li>  employees advise at any stage and accompany the transaction until the seller transfers the loan to the buyer. </li></ul><p>  As for the negative reviews about Vozrozhdenie Bank, here a common reason is the imposition of insurance products, if you refuse them, the annual rate will be significantly increased, and the mortgage itself becomes unprofitable.  In addition, customer complaints about calls from collectors regarding already paid or nonexistent debt are often found.  Thus, errors in the technical work of Vozrozhdenie Bank employees become clear.  In reviews of the work of this institution, people also complain about the insufficient number of ATMs in the cities and the low level of their functionality. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to get a job at Vozrozhdenie Bank </h2><p>  If legal entities consider this credit institution solely as a financial partner, then ordinary citizens often think about working in the Bank Vozrozhdenie.  There are plenty of reviews about work in this company.  Moreover, the employees of this organization leave negative and approving comments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stav.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank revival customer reviews" class="if uuid-2719469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2719469.jpg"></div><p>  In general, reviews of Vozrozhdenie employer-bank show that the majority of consultants and managers consider employment in the company to be the right decision.  Among the main points that make it possible to make a choice in favor of this bank, they note: </p><ul><li>  high and stable wages; </li><li>  friendly team and corporate spirit development; </li><li>  the prospect of an increase in the career ladder; </li><li>  bonus system for employees in the implementation of the plan. </li></ul><p>  Also, bank employees note that their leadership is strict, but at the same time always makes fair decisions.  Judging by the comments, ‚ÄúRenaissance‚Äù as an employer fully meets the expectations of employees, provides the most comfortable and decent working conditions.  But in order to get a position in Moscow, according to the reviews of Vozrozhdenie bank employees, they had to go through a difficult interview.  The rigorous selection of personnel is aimed at forming a truly professional and effective work team.  The personal qualities of the potential subordinate, the level of his education, experience and actual work experience are also taken into account. </p><p>  At the same time, there are negative responses, which should also be listened to by those who would like to join the team of bank managers.  What some workers consider a strict and fair attitude of management, others call it ‚Äútyranny‚Äù and ‚Äúneglect of the interests of ordinary employees‚Äù.  Many write that the bank has too strict disciplinary requirements for each employee, non-compliance with which is fraught with a reduction in salary and lack of bonuses.  In case of violation of labor discipline, penalties are applied to employees: part of the salary is charged from the employee for the violation committed. </p><p>  Dissatisfaction is also expressed because of the lengthy probationary period.  The salary of an intern at Vozrozhdenie Bank is usually 1.5-2 times less than that of an employee who has some experience working at that bank. </p>
