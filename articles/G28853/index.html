Indeed, in any organization of the banking sector, reliable protection of objects of value and stored in it should be ensured.  In addition, informational information relating to the bank itself, transactions conducted by it, its customers is subject to protection. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  The function described above is assigned to the bank security service.  It is a special structure, the work of which often goes unnoticed by customers.  Despite this, its activities are complex and multifaceted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gps-securitygroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank security service" class="if uuid-3138987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138987.jpg"></div><h2>  SBB device </h2><p>  During loan processing, all questions are decided by the loan manager.  On it lies the acceptance of applications, the signing of loan agreements.  At the same time, the activities of the SSS often go unnoticed. </p><p>  The main principle of the financial security service of the bank is the adoption of timely preventive measures.  Which are necessary to rule out or reduce fraud situations. </p><h2>  The main tasks and functions of the SSS </h2><p>  The main problems that employees of the structure have to work with every day are attempts to commit fraudulent activities, providing customers with false information and documents, inaccurate payment documents, as well as attempts to acquire secret information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank security service loan" class="if uuid-3138997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138997.jpg"></div><p>  The diversity of activities is also manifested in the performance of various functions (control, security), the implementation of certain tasks: </p><ol><li><p>  The security service works with clients who contacted a banking organization.  Moreover, clients, as a rule, do not know that all procedures and requirements are carried out under the full control of the structure‚Äôs employees.  Direct contact with the client is possible if the latter violates the rules for using the loan, does not make payments on it, refuses to cooperate with the bank after receiving the loan. </p></li><li><p>  The security service also checks the documents of the borrower that he provides at the time of execution of the loan agreement, the sources of information about the client using a variety of resources, for example, the Internet. </p></li><li><p>  If necessary, employees of the service contact directly with bank customers.  They have the right to make calls to the borrower's place of work, to his place of residence.  To confirm and verify the information that the borrower has deposited. </p></li><li><p>  The bank‚Äôs security service, VTB, for example, cooperates with law enforcement agencies.  An interesting fact is that many SSS employees are former law enforcement officers.  This, usually, is one of the basic requirements of the bank to potential employees when they are employed in the specified structure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  The security service also checks the credit histories of the client, not only at his bank, but also at others (if there is one).  For this purpose, requests are made to the credit history bureau, information from its own databases is used, which reflects data on all unscrupulous payers. </p></li><li><p>  The most complete picture of the financial solvency of the borrower is made through cooperation with third-party organizations, for example, tax and other banks.  This means that the security service, Alfa Bank, for example, can cooperate with a similar Sberbank or VTB Bank. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pao bank vtb security service" class="if uuid-3139005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3139005.jpg"></div><h2>  Monitoring </h2><p>  After the structure makes a decision regarding a specific client (negative or positive), its employees proceed with the monitoring function, ensuring the safety of the property, which acts as a collateral object. </p><p>  The final stage of the bank‚Äôs security service is to collect debt from the client, if any.  To this end, the SBB officers prepare documents that were collected during the audit, and the evidence base for the appeal to the judicial authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank security service" class="if uuid-3138999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138999.jpg"></div><h2>  Objects inspected by the bank security service </h2><p>  One of the main responsibilities of employees of the structure is a thorough and thorough examination of the documentation provided by borrowers when trying to get a loan.  Why it is needed, no need to explain.  This helps to avoid fraud.  This check occurs in a certain way. </p><p>  The security service analyzes and checks the following types of documents that can confirm the solvency of a bank borrower: </p><ol><li><p>  Certificate confirming the amount of income.  It indicates the details (TIN, PSRN), using which employees of the structure can, using specialized databases, clarify the information of interest to them about the organization in which the borrower is employed.  To be more precise, the base is used to check the organization‚Äôs employees, managers, structure, employer contact information, location.  That is, a security officer can immediately find out if the organization is in the process of declaring it bankrupt, if its property has been seized, if it is on stop lists and black lists.  Quite often, SBB representatives make control calls to the place of employment of a potential client.  What does the bank security service check yet? </p></li><li><p>  The presence of a criminal record with the client.  Check in this case, not only the borrower, but also his immediate family.  In addition, the service will need to check what fines, administrative penalties, and other sanctions have actually been applied to their future borrower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesnownews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB Bank Security Service" class="if uuid-3139011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3139011.jpg"></div></li><li><p>  Credit history.  This stage of the audit involves a thorough analysis of the borrower's credit history: has it ever violated credit obligations, how it happened.  Also, employees of the structure as a whole evaluate the quality of cooperation between the borrower and the bank in the past. </p></li><li><p>  Reputation.  To check the reputation of a potential borrower, representatives of the security service of VTB Bank can make simple calls to neighbors, relatives, colleagues for the purpose of interviewing.  In addition, data can be collected using the business community, the Internet, and the media.  Currently, verification using pages of online blogs and social networks is gaining immense popularity.  In addition, such a method of collecting data about a potential client as mutually beneficial communication and unofficial exchange of information between the security structures of different banking organizations is not ruled out.  Such a technique allows to identify insolvency and dishonesty of customers.  That is, if a borrower is blacklisted by one bank, then it is likely that it will be blacklisted by another bank that cooperates with the first. </p></li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="security Service" class="if uuid-3139018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3139018.jpg"></div><h2>  Law Enforcement Cooperation </h2><p>  Considerable assistance in gathering the necessary information is provided by the presence of security officials or a bank of established relations of an informal nature in such structures as law enforcement agencies, tax inspectorates, pension funds, etc.  The structure can also receive detailed information about a potential client by contacting special bureaus. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  As a result of such verification, a verdict on customer trustworthiness is issued.  If the answer is yes, the loan application is transferred to the manager for further consideration.  In opposite cases, its further analysis stops, that is, the client receives a refusal to provide a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.radial.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what the bank security service checks" class="if uuid-3139015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3139015.jpg"></div><h2>  Direct loss </h2><p>  Any error in obtaining a loan from a bank security service may result in a direct loss in the form of an outstanding loan.  In this regard, workers in this structure are selected very carefully, presenting rather high requirements to them.  As a rule, lawyers, analysts, former law enforcement officers with certain knowledge and skills, well-established contacts, extensive experience working with databases, prone to analysis, and notice any little things that can affect the final decision work in such banking structures. </p>
