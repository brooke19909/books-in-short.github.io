Some of them are quite convenient, but require the preliminary connection of additional services, others are completely free, but they do not differ in special convenience. </p><h2>  Checking a card account using a mobile bank </h2><p>  A mobile bank service is a set of specific services that a financial institution provides using mobile communication devices.  By using short commands, it is possible for a small fee or completely free of charge (it all depends on bank conditions) to request almost any data on the card.  In response to such commands, SMS with the necessary information comes.  This service is available to subscribers of all major mobile operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="account number on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3193057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3193057.jpg"></div><p>  To find out the rest of the account on the card of Sberbank, a client with a mobile phone can  To which the mobile bank service is connected, and its number is attached to the card in question.  Many people are interested in how to check the balance of a Sberbank card after 900.  To do this, send a short message from the phone to the appropriate number.  In this case, the command "BALANCE XXXX" should be indicated in the message, where XXXX is the last 4 digits of the card number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the word "BALANCE", you can also use the following commands: "01", "OSTATOK", "RESIDUE", "BALANCE", "BALANS". </p><p>  Bank customers can use such commands to perform operations such as: check the account on the Sberbank card, receive a mini statement, which will show the balance of available funds, put money on the phone and much more.  You can get a mini statement by sending any of the commands: "02", "HISTORY", "EXTRACT", "HISTORY", "ISTORIA", "VYPISKA".  After each of the teams, the last 4 digits of the card on which the request is made must be indicated.  The command should also be sent to 900. </p><h2>  Advantages of a mobile bank </h2><p>  Using a mobile bank has several advantages: </p><ol><li>  Getting information about actions that are performed with a card account. </li><li>  Checking the data on the limit of available funds and recent transactions. </li><li>  Making transfers and payments online. </li><li>  Repayment of credit obligations from the card account, card blocking. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.yoursmartmoneymoves.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check the balance of the card of Sberbank through 900" class="if uuid-3193060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3193060.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing the information about the method of requesting a card balance using SMS allows bank customers to significantly simplify their own lives.  By sending just one team to a special number, you can get all the necessary data without breaking away from important matters and without leaving the room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To use this opportunity, the client should activate the mobile bank service.  The cost of this service is determined by the banking version and tariffs of mobile operators for using SMS. </p><h2>  Check balance through support </h2><p>  You can find out the balance of available funds by calling the customer support service number of the bank customers and informing the operator of the card number and some control information.  The latter is indicated in the contract.  A call to the Sberbank telephone hotline is free of charge, and it doesn‚Äôt matter which device the customer is calling from or where in the country it is. </p><p>  Support service is a very convenient customer service.  Operators help to obtain the necessary information and solve any problem related to banking services at any time of the day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.midwestbankcentre.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="checking an account on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-3193063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3193063.jpg"></div><h2>  The disadvantages of this method </h2><p>  The disadvantage of this method is that the support line is often overloaded.  But in this case, you can use the answering machine: you can find out the balance by going to a specific section using numerical commands.  If you know in advance what combination of numbers you need to dial to determine the balance on the card, you can not listen to all the texts of the answering machine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The client may need to check the balance at any time.  Sometimes it happens that there is no opportunity to visit a branch, an ATM is far away, and there is no Internet access.  In such cases, a convenient option is to call the customer service to check the account on the Sberbank card.  However, choose the customer. </p><h2>  Checking the balance in the bank branch.  How to implement? </h2><p>  Checking an account on a Sberbank card is free.  In order to do this, you must contact the bank branch.  This method of finding out information is the most inconvenient and time consuming.  To find out the balance with a bank employee, you must have a passport with you, and only the account holder can request data.  Otherwise, the bank representative will not give an answer to this question. </p><p>  But when contacting the branch, the client has the opportunity to receive official bank paper, which will reflect the number and validity of the card, card account number, statement for the required period of time.  That is all the necessary information.  It should be noted that the account number on the card of Sberbank is not displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="litbang.kemendagri.go.id" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Checking the balance on a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-3193062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3193062.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking card balance via ATM </h2><p>  You can request the available balance on the card through an ATM.
