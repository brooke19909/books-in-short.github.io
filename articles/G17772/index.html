Even Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky said that an increase in the quantity and quality of knowledge will contribute to blurring the boundaries between different areas of science.  And people in the future will specialize in specific problems.  The technology of integration in education provides for the unification of individual parts of science into an integrated complex.  Moreover, this is not just a mechanical combination of various knowledge, but the application of an approach in which they are interconnected, and in solving certain problems a person can act systematically.  The concept of integration in education is rather vague.  This is due to the diversity of species.  So, integration can be classified according to directions, methods, methods, levels and techniques.

Integration in education is a mechanism that is aimed at developing creative thinking in people.  It is aimed at accelerating intensification, systematizing <span>educational and cognitive activities</span> and mastering cultural literacy.  <span>Social integration</span> in education is aimed not only at uniting various areas of science and showing common ground, but also at giving people an idea that the world around us is integral.  This is also facilitated by the fact that a similar approach is applied to various disciplines.  In this way, students learn to see the whole environment as a whole.  If we deviate from this direction of development, then integration turns into a superficial statement of the presence of intersubject communications.

So, if we consider the example of the structure, it should be noted that such a layout can only be horizontal.  That is, initially similar material from several academic subjects is combined.  Then it is transferred to the teacher, who sets out the information.  At the same time, care should be taken to ensure that the available data are provided under various conditions.  This will make it possible to judge the effectiveness of the structure used.  The second most important effect after gaining a full understanding of the modern world is the acceleration of the learning process.  This gives a significant gain in time. </p><h2>  Structure </h2>

Various authors can meet small differences, but we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the following method of division:

    <ol><li>  Thematic integration.  In this case, two or three academic subjects are engaged in revealing one topic.  One can find an alternative description that claims to be an illustrative-descriptive level.  But you need to understand that these are simply synonymous concepts. </li><li>  Problem integration.  In this case, it is understood that different subjects deal with the same problem. </li><li>  Conceptual integration.  In this case, it is understood that consideration is carried out by several subjects using all their methods and means. </li><li>  Theoretical integration.  In this case, the interpenetration of different theories is considered. </li><li>  Dialectical integration.  In this case, the use of principles and concepts that apply to various fields of knowledge is understood.  Alternatively, one can come across an interpretation of the provision of peace as a holistic picture. </li></ol><h2>  Diversity </h2>

There are various sciences that have different subjects, they look at the world from distinct positions and use many means.  Therefore, integration in education is not an easy task.  Experienced people should do all this.  Good professionals should also provide knowledge to students.  And here the main problem of integration in education arises - the lack of necessary personnel.  It is not worth saying that young generations of teachers do not always have a sufficiently high level of education.  A person who integrates various objects must take into account existing contradictions.  So far, integration in vocational education cannot boast of something substantial.  But still a few examples can be given.

A significant role in this is the ability to look at something from an unusual angle.

We will consider several options for organizing integration in education.  Moreover, attention will be paid to both domestic and foreign developments.  It should be noted that visions dynamically developed and took different forms and contents.  Therefore, they are quite different from each other.  Integration in this case is implied as a unity of goals, content and principles.  The end result of these changes is to form in people new integral systems of skills and knowledge.  The issue of integration in education, by the way, was first raised at a time when separate disciplines began to stand out from philosophy.  Due to differentiation, the problem of combining to obtain knowledge arose.  Indeed, when divided into separate disciplines, the natural connection between phenomena and objects is broken.  This is what integration in education decides.

They were offered the enrichment of human consciousness and his familiarity with phenomena and objects in such a way that he could perceive the world sensually.  This is all worked out in the theory of Comenius evolution.  She defends the position according to which, leaps are not peculiar to man, and he develops gradually.  According to Comenius, a promising education is one in which the mutual connections of everything in the world are indicated.

    <p>  You can also bring the achievements of <span>K.D.</span>  <span>Ushinsky.</span>  It is impossible not to note the role of this person in the psychological and pedagogical substantiation of the didactic significance of the connections between the studied phenomena and objects.  He contributed to a significant transformation of the organization in matters of education and training of people.  You can familiarize yourself with his achievements by reading the book "Man as a subject of education."  In it, the presence of intersubject communications is considered as part of a single problem of the entire training system.  It discusses the features of bringing knowledge into the worldview system as they accumulate, the relationship between concepts, actions and their outcome, as well as recommendations for expanding and deepening the student‚Äôs knowledge.  All this is aimed at ultimately forming a worldview system. </p><h2>  Practical implementation </h2><p>  Something remotely similar was first applied in Britain at the beginning of the 20th century.  Then special cooperative courses were created, the task of which was to integrate professional knowledge and practical activities.  The first experience in Russia was obtained in the 20s of the last century.  In domestic pedagogy, great attention was paid to such scientists as N.V.  Bunakov, V.Ya.  Stoyunin, B.G.  Ananyev, V.I.  Water carriers and many others.  It is at this point in time that the formation of the pedagogy of the Soviet Union falls.  The foundations of the school were laid: an understanding of the system and <span>logic of the subject</span> along with connections.  Knowledge should be mutually used, duplicate material should be eliminated, an integral system of views should be formed - all this was laid down precisely then.  The progressive views of teachers were reflected in the new approach regarding the construction of curricula and plans.  Its important component was the establishment of the relationship between life and school.  Due to its wide scope, this method of action has been given the name of an integrated approach.  It should also be noted the importance for pedagogy of both the 30s and 50s of the last century.  But this is already beyond the scope of the article, so we will not consider it. </p><h2>  Modern stage </h2>

Although the issue of integration is still given quite a lot of attention.  True, this applies only to secondary and higher educational institutions.  So, according to the accepted standards, a unity of general, professional and polytechnic education is achieved.  Integration approaches allow you to combine professional and personal aspirations of students to help them in the formation and preparation of specialists.  Summing up all of the above, it can be noted that although the current state of affairs is not ideal, it still allows us to provide training for people who are ready to live and work in society and for its benefit.  The most important is the creation of an integrated system of knowledge and outlook on the world, so that a person can determine his own interests, seek their implementation and at the same time work for the good of society.  This is where integration plays an important role in education.
