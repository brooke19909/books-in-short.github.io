Still not received old rare books cause emotional awe and a keen desire to receive such an exhibit.  To buy an expensive old book means to take possession of a piece of the historical past, to touch a bygone era.  Buying antique books and common commercial sense is not without its purpose: foreign and Russian old publications are becoming more expensive every year, that is, they can be a legitimate investment.  Russian and foreign antique classics will never lose their value and charm. </p>

    <p>  The beginning of book printing in Russia is considered to be the year 1564, associated with the advent of the first printing presses and the release of the first books.  In Europe, this happened much earlier - in 1460.  Of course, books of the 14-16th century are an ultra-rare exclusive, it is difficult to get them, and they are very expensive, but prints and antique collections of works of the 17-19th centuries are more common among collectors and in stores.  Such old books also have high historical and aesthetic value, and the material question depends on several parameters.  Books with a year of release until 1890 are especially valued. </p><h2>  How to find out the value of an old book </h2><p>  Evaluating an antique book yourself is quite difficult.  Its cost depends on a number of factors: </p><ul><li>  the year of publishing; </li><li>  publisher of the book; </li><li>  state of the book itself and binding; </li><li>  number of pages, text, illustrations; </li><li>  rarity, the number of copies; </li><li>  release region; </li><li>  ‚ÄúGenre‚Äù and category of the book (religious, scientific, historical, fiction, etc.). </li></ul>

    <p>  At the same time, the value of books indicated in various stores, catalogs, auctions and even historical museums does not at all have to be the ultimate truth.  Enthusiastic collectors are often willing to pay much more than market value, and at the same time, you can <noindex>  <span>buy a rare old book</span> </noindex>  at a very reasonable price.  It is believed that old Russian books are easier and cheaper to buy, but this is not always the case. </p><h2>  Antique books in Moscow stores and via the Internet </h2><p>  Second-hand book business is a rather developed niche today.  You can now buy old books in Moscow not only at random ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù or by announcement, but also in specialized stores, as well as order delivery from an online store. </p>

The style originated in the 16th century, in France, and was designed by Nicola Ev.  At the time of the appearance of technology, it was called "a la fanfare" (a la fanfare).  Books in French binding are famous not only for their beauty, but also for their durability.  The time-consuming process is to fix the book block on the cords manually, followed by alignment and fastening of the edges, rounding the spine and smearing it with bone glue.  The binding material can be solid or semi-leather.  Of course, there are other features and secrets in the technology of French book binding that deserve a separate topic for the story.
