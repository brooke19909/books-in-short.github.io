    <p>  In the <span>Italian kingdom</span> in the 1850s, the ruling circles of Piedmont did everything possible to prevent the convening of a general Italian Constituent Assembly.  Thus, they opposed the accession of Sardinia to Piedmont. </p><p>  A plebiscite (popular vote) in the south of the state in 1860, on October 21, approved the merger of Sicily and Naples with the Sardinian kingdom, and Marche and Umbria also joined in the November plebiscites.  Thus, at the end of 1860, the unification of Italy actually took place.  Rome was not annexed with the region of Lazio and Venice. </p><p>  An all-Italian parliament was convened in Turin.  On March 17, 1861, the formation of the Italian kingdom was announced, the head of which was Piedmont King Victor Emmanuel II.  The constitutional order of Piedmont spread throughout the country. </p><p>  The unification of Italy was accompanied by the creation of a single legislation, customs, monetary and judicial structure, a system of weights, measures, taxation.  All these phenomena contributed to the economic rapprochement of previously divided lands. </p><p>  The main areas of the united country linked new railways.  Their construction was carried out very intensively - from 2500 kilometers in 1861, their length grew to 6200 kilometers in 1871.  Thus, prerequisites were formed for the accelerated formation of a nationwide single market. </p><p>  Among the main affairs of the new government of the united state was the definition of relations with the Holy See.  In 1871, in May, guarantee laws were passed.  They helped create special conditions for the church.  In addition to the appointment of annual maintenance, the pope was returned the money found in the treasury of Rome.  At the same time, the united country assumed the public debt of the Papal region.  In addition, the Lutheran and Vatican palaces with all the buildings remained with the Pope.  King <span>Victor Emmanuel II,</span> settled in the Quirinal Palace.  Since that time, the Vatican denotes the holy throne, and the Quirinal - the government of Italy.  However, the Pope was unhappy and took a militant position. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1873, in May, in the Chamber of Deputies (despite the fierce resistance of the clerics), a law was almost unanimously passed that closed monasteries throughout the country.  At the same time, a cultural struggle began in Germany (kulturkampf), which was one of the reasons that provoked further unification of Italy and Germany. </p><p>  At the same time, pope was supported by France, which was dominated by clerics at that time.  A French ship was cruising near Rome (in case the Pope decided to escape from his "imprisonment"). </p><p>  The unification of Italy in the 19th century (political) provoked a combination of public debt.  The total debt of the country began to be about 8 billion lire, for which it was necessary to pay interest annually in the amount of 460 million. </p><p>  Unification of Italy demanded improvement.  This required a radical reform of the tax system and a reduction in the cost of maintaining the army.  But, fearing to lose the support of wealthy sections of the population, not a single ministry was ready to carry out such changes.  Preference was given to the adoption of new taxes and insignificant savings. </p><p>  In 2011, on March 17, a celebration of a memorable event took place on the Apennine Peninsula - 150 years ago, the unification of Italy took place.  In this regard, the government announced the day off. </p><p>  The streets of Rome and other <span>cities of Italy</span> were decorated with the colors of the national flag, the holiday lasted until the morning.  In "The Night of the Tricolor" in Rome alone, about a hundred different events took place.  Museums could be accessed for free almost until morning.  And at midnight, the sky above the capital was lit up by a festive fireworks display. </p>
