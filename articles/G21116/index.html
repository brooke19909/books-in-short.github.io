It is often called the "capital of ten dynasties."  Like most major <span>Chinese cities,</span> Nanjing has changed and prettier in recent years.  I must say that the architects managed to harmoniously combine modern trends and the most valuable cultural and historical traditions. </p><p>  It takes at least two days to get to know the main attractions of Nanjing in China.  The city is the capital of the coastal <span>province of Jiangsu</span> and is located on the banks of the Yangtze.  In this area, the river is already becoming very wide.  The name of the city, received by him in 1421, translates as "southern capital". </p><h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  This Chinese city, in which more than 9 million people live today, undoubtedly left its mark on the country's history.  It was founded in 427 BC.  Over its long history, Nanjing has become the capital of China several times, including in the 20th century.  The inhabitants of this particular city suffered the most from the atrocities of the Japanese invaders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gonanjingchina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Nanjing" class="if uuid-2571151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571151.jpg"></div><p>  For more than 2.5 thousand years, the city under various names is mentioned in official documents.  In the III century.  n  e.  Jianye was the capital of the kingdom of Wu, and a little later, the residence of many Chinese dynasties.  He acquired his greatest importance for the country in 1368.  Then the city was called Intian. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first emperor of <span>the Ming dynasty, by</span> his decree, made the city the capital of the empire.  Until 1421, when the government courtyard moved to Beijing, such large-scale structures as the tomb of the emperor, the imperial palace (later destroyed) and the city wall were built. </p><p>  During the Taiping rebel movement in the mid-19th century, half of China was subordinated to them.  In 1853, the rebels captured Nanjing, which for 11 years was their capital.  The uprising was crushed in 1864.  The city at that time was severely destroyed.  In 1911, after the fall of the last imperial dynasty, Nanjing was briefly the temporary capital of the young republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city" class="if uuid-2571162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571162.jpg"></div><p>  The famous Nanchang rebellion, when the Communists rebelled against the Kuomintang, occurred on August 1, 1927.  This date is now celebrated as the Day of the Red Army of the country.  Almost all the leaders of the uprising received the rank of Marshal of China.  Once again, Nanjing became the capital of the country in 1928, and in 1937 it was captured by Japanese troops.  The last time in the 20th century, Nanjing had the status of the capital from 1945 to 1949, when the government fled to Taiwan. </p><p>  Since 1949, the city of Nanjing in China has been developing rapidly.  Today it is a large economic and industrial center of Jiangxi province, a large transportation hub, a center of science and technology. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  What to see in Nanjing?  This city has many interesting and memorable places that are associated not only with ancient history, but also with a more modern period.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Zijinshan Mountains; </li><li>  the tomb of Emperor Ming; </li><li>  Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum; </li><li>  Lingus Monastery; </li><li>  Nanjing Museum; </li><li>  the ruins of Ming Palace; </li><li>  Temple of Confucius; </li><li>  examination cells; </li><li>  Museum of the Taiping Rebellion. </li></ul><h2>  Zijinshan Mountains </h2><p>  On the southern slope of the Zizzypinpan hills, in the east of the city, there are several important sights of Nanjing.  From east to west are the mausoleums of the emperor of the Ming dynasty, as well as the founder of the republic, Sun Yat-sen.  Here you can see the temple of the Valley of the Soul.  You can get here by scheduled minibuses from the city center or by taxi. </p><h2>  Tomb of Emperor Ming </h2><p>  This Nanjing attraction is especially significant and revered in China.  The first ruler from the Ming dynasty - Zhu Yuanzhang - became the only emperor of China who ordered to be buried in this city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomb of Emperor Ming" class="if uuid-2571681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571681.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the tomb, which is recognized as one of the largest in the country, was completed during the lifetime of the ruler (1383).  It is located under an artificial hill with a diameter of almost 400 meters.  She never opened.  Further south is the Soul Valley, 800 meters long.  She is guarded by an honor guard of eight sculptures of officials and 24 animal statues. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen </h2><p>  When exploring the sights of Nanjing, be sure to visit this grand building.  Sun Yat-sen was honored with a truly imperial burial.  Soon after his death, the construction of a huge complex on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã80 hectares began. </p><p>  In 1929, Sun's body was brought here.  Everyone who approaches the mausoleum is struck by the view of the giant front staircase, which has 392 steps.  In its lower part there are gates on which Wo Ai is inscribed, which translates as "universal love."  Here is also the main portal with the inscription Tianxia Wei Gong, which translates as "community of the state."  This is a reminder of the political precepts of the founder of the Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kennychung.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen" class="if uuid-2571188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571188.jpg"></div><p>  At the top is a memorial hall covered with a bright blue roof.  A huge statue of Sun made of marble looks at her from the country.  The grave is located inside the hall, at a depth of five meters under another statue of Sun. </p><h2>  Lingus Monastery </h2><p>  The history of this Nanjing monastery in China (we posted a photo in this article) began in the VI century.  In those days, he was on the territory of the imperial tomb, and then was transferred to its current place.  It should highlight a huge hall that does not have beams.  This is a brick structure with cylindrical arches, built in 1381.  Today, the wax figures of the Chinese revolutionaries are represented here, a little to the north is the 60-meter Lingus pagoda, which was created in memory of those killed during the military Northern campaign. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chrisinbrnocr.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lingus Monastery" class="if uuid-2571225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571225.jpg"></div><h2>  Nanjing Museum </h2><p>  Attractions are located in all areas of Nanjing (China).  What to see in the city center?  The museum, built in the classical style, is located in front of the eastern city gate.  Its history originates in 1933.  Magnificent statues made of bronze, funeral robes from jade plates of the Han era are among the main treasures of the unique collection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museums in Nanjing" class="if uuid-2571695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571695.jpg"></div><h2>  The ruins of Ming Palace </h2><p>  At a distance of 100 meters from the museum you can see the ruins of the former palace of the emperor.  Only five marble bridges and several individual relics today remind of the former luxury of the building. </p><h2>  Temple of Confucius </h2><p>  The oldest attraction of Nanjing is the temple of Confucius.  The very first building on this site was erected in 1034 and, like most Confucian temples, was a school for local children.  The wooden structure suffered severe fires several times, but the locals restored it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="au.chinatour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Confucius" class="if uuid-2571236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2571236.jpg"></div><h2>  Examination Cells </h2><p>  In the imperial era, the most brilliant careers of officials began here and numerous hopes and plans collapsed.  Job seekers in the public service had to prove their suitability for fulfilling their duties.  For a day or more applicants were locked in tiny cramped cells, where they were to create literary essays.  It was almost unbearable psychological pressure, enormous physical stress.  Forty cells out of several thousand were reconstructed and today remind us of the examination of ancient Chinese hell and the attempts of cheating inevitable in this situation. </p><h2>  Taiping Uprising Museum </h2><p>  The small palace dating back to the Ming era, west of the Confucius Temple, was the headquarters of Yang Xiuqing, who was captured by Nanjing in 1853 at the head of the Taiping.  Three years later (1856), he was killed in a conflict with the leadership of the rebels.  In addition to the historical exposition, tourists are interested in the garden of Contemplation located in the neighborhood. </p><h2>  Tips from experienced travelers </h2><ul><li>  It is best to visit the city in autumn, winter or spring. </li><li>  Be sure to visit the tombs of the Ming Dynasty, the performance of one of the opera companies, the international Plum Blossom Festival, the Monument to the Victims of the Nanking Massacre, the Danshan Thermal Spring. </li><li>  Once in Nanjing, get a subscription to visit the main parks of the city. </li></ul><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Most travelers who have already visited this Chinese city note that they enjoyed their unusual architecture, the most valuable historical and cultural sights, and the friendly and friendly locals.  Many people pay attention to the fact that, despite the advanced age of this city, it looks very modern and stylish.  And tourists are struck by a huge number of cyclists, of different ages, on the streets of the city. </p>
