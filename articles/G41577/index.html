  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Characteristics of the personality of Nicholas 1</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Emperor Nicholas 1 - the personality is largely complex and controversial.  If earlier in the lessons of history he was presented as a rude paramilitary man, a lover of strict punishment and a fan of discipline, now his character has been rethought.  Facts are becoming known that characterize the king as a decent and honest man, an officer in the best sense of the word, each action of which was aimed at the good of the country.  We will get acquainted with the personality and activities of Nicholas 1. </p><h2>  General information about the monarch </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personality nicholas 1" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2135306.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Nicholas I was born in Tsarskoye Selo in 1796.  Not being the first and even second son of Emperor Paul I, he was not the heir to the throne, but fate decreed otherwise. </p><p>  When the future emperor was less than five years old, his father died as a result of an insidious conspiracy, so the elder brother, Alexander I, took up the boy‚Äôs upbringing. , which could not but affect the personality of Nicholas 1. Later, he himself was horrified to realize his lack of education, but state and family affairs did not make it possible to catch up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  He ruled the country for 30 years, while he tried his best to maintain unlimited power.  In these years, the secret police were founded (Third Division), the purpose of which was to monitor the ideas prevailing in society.  Under Nikolai Pavlovich, autocracy reached its zenith; the tsar resisted any freethinking coming from the West.  Little has been done to improve the life of serfs: now they could not be sent to hard labor, and the farmers themselves were given the opportunity to buy land.  It is clear that only a very small part of the serfs could afford such a thing. </p><h2>  Country in those years </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nicholas 1 person briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2135315.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Features of the personality of Nicholas 1 should be described against the background of those historical events that took place in Russia during the years of his life and reign. </p><p>  The emperor‚Äôs rise to power occurred during the bloody events, which could not but affect his character.  Perhaps that is why, fearing to become a victim of another coup and repeat the fate of his father, he acted very hesitantly and could not cancel serfdom.  The elder brother, Alexander I, suddenly died, the second son of Paul, Constantine, voluntarily renounced the throne.  Therefore, Nicholas 1, being not mentally prepared for this, was forced to become the Russian emperor, making a colossal leap from a strict and disciplined military official to the ruler of the whole country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The personality of Nicholas 1 could not but be reflected in a surprising combination of events (the death of an older brother and the abdication of the middle one), in connection with which he, the third child, received unlimited power.  He believed that God himself had chosen him for great accomplishments and with his policies did his best to maintain order in the country. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Sources that have reached us describe the appearance of Emperor Nicholas 1 as follows: </p><ul><li>  High growth. </li><li>  Static dressing. </li><li>  The face is slightly elongated, with a Roman nose and open forehead. </li><li>  Healthy complexion. </li><li>  Blue eyes. </li></ul><p>  He looked very noble, giving the impression of a real Russian Tsar.  As clothes, according to the tradition of those years, he wore military uniforms, richly decorated with gold embroidery.  In her memoirs, Nikolai's daughter recalled that the uniform was for him his favorite home clothes - old, shabby and without an epaulet, but convenient for work. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The educator of the king was the German Lamsdorf, a very strict and even tough man, it was under his influence that the character of the future monarch was formed.  From childhood, the king‚Äôs personality was rude.  He did not pay attention to getting an education, but succeeded in drawing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikolay 1 personality profile" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58830/2133116.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The mentor applied strict measures against the king, up to corporal punishment, and even once very badly beat his pupil, wanting to break his will.  But Nikolai Pavlovich did not obey, already at an early age showing his stubbornness and self-will. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hobbies </h2><p>  The description of the personality of Emperor Nicholas 1 will be incomplete, without mentioning his hobbies: </p><ul><li>  The monarch was very fond of various machines, mechanisms, the development of which had only just begun in his time.  Therefore, he was keenly interested in the appearance of a particular technical novelty.  It was during his reign that the first railway in Russia was opened.  By the beginning of the reign of Nicholas, the industry was completely undeveloped, by the end of his reign - the country came to the forefront in the production of metal, leather, glass, began to make their own machines and locomotives. </li><li>  From early childhood, the future autocrat was first fascinated by the war games, after - by the military.  He received the post of brigadier general, conscientiously fulfilled his duties and was far from the royal court, which completely suited him.  Warfare became his true passion, he enjoyed studying tactics, artillery. </li><li>  Another hobby of the king was also associated with military affairs.  Contemporaries recalled that Nikolai Pavlovich loved to draw sketches of uniforms, while he was well versed in tailoring. </li></ul><h2>  Character traits </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inconsistency of the personality of nicholas 1" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58830/2133117.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Since childhood, the personality that Nicholas 1 identified was a trait that he retained throughout his life - an incredible accuracy, bordering on pedantry.  He was strict with his subordinates and demanded from them the impeccable implementation of laws and regulations. </p><p>  Also, from an early age, the future emperor was distinguished by perseverance and perseverance.  It is known that the king never smoked or drank alcohol, he hated bad habits in his subjects. </p><p>  Giving a characterization of the personality of Nicholas 1, one cannot fail to mention the secrecy of the autocratic character, which his contemporaries have always emphasized.  Faced with the problem of free-thinking of the nobility, which resulted in the uprising of the Decembrists, he ceased to trust even his surroundings.  However, inherent discipline forced the emperor to completely concentrate all state affairs in his hands. </p><p>  For many years of military service, they could not but reflect on the personality traits of Nicholas 1, which is why he was best ranked for military ranks.  The emperor is also known for his amazing performance, he worked 18 hours a day. </p><p>  The ruthlessness of the tsar as a whole was not inherent in the tsar, but as a strong and strict man, he often against his will could severely punish those who represented a danger to the political system and Russia as a whole.  Each of his actions was weighed and in his own way justified. </p><h2>  Board Features </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="as Tyutchev explains the inconsistency of the personality of nicholas" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2135316.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In short, the personality of Nicholas 1 is best manifested in the way he ruled the country.  The emperor was absolutely sure that a solid monarchical power is what Russia needs, so he was very strict with everyone who tried to somehow change the oldest form of government. </p><p>  And if his older brother, Alexander I, was fond of the ideas of socialism and even wanted to try on European theories with Russian reality, then Nikolai was convinced that the country needed an autocratic monarch, strong and decisive.  He ascended the throne at the age of 29, already a mature personality, with formed views and convictions and at the same time not at all expecting that one day he would become emperor.  It is this fact that explains the inconsistency of the nature and politics of the king.  He was not ready for the responsibilities that had fallen on him, but considered it his duty to help Russia solve the problems that were tearing it apart from the inside. </p><h2>  Relationship with spouse and children </h2><p>  Assessment of the personality of Nicholas 1 would be incomplete without mentioning his relationship with his wife, Alexandra Fedorovna, and children.  He sincerely loved and protected his wife, he was strict with children, but fair.  In the marriage, seven children were born: four daughters and three sons. </p><p>  In an effort to teach his second son Constantine wisdom, he gave him instructions.  Here are its main points: </p><ul><li>  Listen carefully and analyze everything.  But leave your opinion to yourself. </li><li>  Do not allow yourself familiar behavior. </li><li>  Do not use your position as a Grand Duke and refuse all sorts of honors. </li></ul><p>  That says a lot.  Being a direct and decent man, he wanted to educate these qualities in his children. </p><h2>  Personality assessment </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor Nicholas 1" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24955/2135318.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Of particular interest is how Tyutchev explains the inconsistency of the personality of Nicholas 1. The maid of honor of the Empress describes the Tsar as an honest man, sincerely convinced that his every act is for the good of Russia.  He considered himself the chosen one of God and did not doubt at all his purpose: to protect Russia from the influence of liberalism.  Nikolai took his duty very seriously and tried his best to justify the trust placed in him.  The emperor expressed his skepticism about his accession, emphasizing that he did not take the throne himself, this place was granted to him by God's will.  And, although it is almost worse than the galley, he will honestly fulfill his duty. </p><p>  Lack of education and complete unpreparedness for the royal throne made it largely limited.  He did not recognize the new trends in politics, but it cannot be called completely conservative, since he was very supportive of the development of technology. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  To understand the personality of Emperor Nicholas 1, consider a few interesting facts: </p><ul><li>  The emperor had an explosive character and was poorly able to hide his emotions.  Such a case is known.  Once, Nikolai Pavlovich very strongly scolded one of the generals during the exercises, and he did not skimp in expressions.  However, the next day he publicly apologized and fraternally embraced his ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. </li><li>  Nikolai Pavlovich knew that the whole country was mired in bribery and embezzlement, once he told his son and heir that he thinks that all of Russia do not steal, they alone. </li><li>  He considered serfdom to be evil for Russia, but the abolition of it in this troubled situation was even more destructive. </li><li>  He perfectly understood that he was not loved by the people, he knew that he was considered an ‚Äúenemy of enlightenment,‚Äù ‚Äúan executioner,‚Äù ‚Äúa lover of sticks,‚Äù but he could not go against his own conscience.  All his actions were aimed at protecting the autocracy. </li></ul><p>  These facts indicate the inconsistency of the personality of Nicholas 1. He tried to maintain peace and tranquility in Russia, was strict with those who violated the law and discipline, but the country needed something completely different, so his rule did not leave any tangible results. </p>
