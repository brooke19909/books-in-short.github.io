Surprisingly, toponyms, who seem to know the answers to all questions, until the forties did not think about the meaning of this word.  And only M. Makarov, commenting on the dictionary of Mr. Linda, noted: the word probably consists of two ‚ÄúRussified‚Äù derivatives: colo (about) and Lithuania. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov region White Kalitva" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/286858.jpg" width="500"></div>  Indeed, in a city with such a name, words bearing a clear Lithuanian origin are still caught.  In the south of Russia there is even the city of Belaya Kalitva.  The Rostov region, the map of which reflects the diversity of the nationalities living here, is proud of this small city with a glorious history.

    <p>  <strong>A bit of history</strong> </p><p>  More than a million people live in the territory called the Rostov Region.  Belaya Kalitva, which received city status only in 1958, is far from the first in terms of population.  But there are unique monuments, one of which is known throughout Russia.  This is the only monument in the world to the heroes of the Word about Igor's regiment.  Established in 1970, it has become one of the pearls of an urban settlement.  The whole Rostov region is proud of this monument.  Belaya Kalitva is also known for other literary compositions.  Since ancient times, the Sholokhov‚Äôs Aksinya and grandfather Schukar, three Bears from a Russian fairy tale, and other small sculptural forms ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the city.  Sculptures are one of the main attractions of Belaya Kalitva.  Smaller ones adorn lawns and flower beds.  The larger ones are installed in gardens and parks.  Near them make appointments, make offers of hands and hearts.  Sculptures are an important part of urban life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the city of Belaya Kalitva, Rostov Region," class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/286859.jpg" width="500"></div>  However, Rostov Region is famous not only for literary monuments.  Belaya Kalitva is also a Russian battle with the Polovtsians in 1185, which was celebrated by Boyan.  This is the history of the Cossacks, directly related to the formation of the city.  This is a revolution and civil war (it was here that Voroshilov‚Äôs headquarters was located).  This is the Great Patriotic War.  For half a year the city was occupied by the Nazis, but managed to fully recover and heal the wounds.  However, the city of Belaya Kalitva of the Rostov region is famous not only for its history.

    <p>  <strong>Kalitva today</strong> </p><p>  The first thing that attracts visitors today is the forests of new buildings.  The city is gradually moving deeper into the steppe, turning the green expanses into cozy residential areas.  Like the entire Rostov region, Belaya Kalitva is involved in several housing programs.  However, the growing modern areas are in good harmony with the "old city". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White Kalitva Rostov region map" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/286860.jpg" width="500"></div>  Belokalitvintsy love their park, founded back in the 19th century at the <span>mouth of the river.</span>  Today it bears the name of V. Mayakovsky, and its architecture reflects the entire history of the city.  The park has themed corners and attractions, a beach on the banks of the Donets River and a modern promenade.  With the same love, residents relate to the Karaul Mountain, which is the highest place in the city, Maidan, on which the revived Vvedensky temple stands, a monument to the victims of repression, tearing into the ‚ÄúHorses‚Äù steppe (sculpture by S. P. Kalchenko).  You can talk about the city for a long time.  It is one of the most beautiful places that the Rostov region is so famous for.  Belaya Kalitva ... It‚Äôs worth it to come here once and then again and again with pleasure to return to the hospitable city.
