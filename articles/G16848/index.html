One of the places where you can spend an unforgettable vacation is the Titanic Palace Spa &amp; AquaPark 5 * hotel (Egypt, Hurghada).

The distance to the nearest airport is ten kilometers, to the center of Hurghada - sixteen kilometers.  Nearby is the Titanic Beach Spa &amp; AquaPark 5 * hotel, the infrastructure of which guests of the Titanic Palace AquaPark &amp; <span>Spa 5 *</span> can use <span>,</span> since both institutions are part of the same complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="titanic palace aquapark spa 5" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/991475.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach availability </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sandy beach with a length of 350 meters.  Near the coast, the sea is very shallow, and for the convenience of guests, a pier was built, on which it is easy to get to deeper places.  Vacationers can choose deeper or shallower areas for swimming.  In some places in the water there are many marine life and corals.  But there are also sections of the sea where the fauna is practically absent and you can swim for your pleasure.  Nearby is a coral reef, which tourists often admire. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Difficult bathing often becomes the main cause of indignation of guests.  But for people with young children, this is a real paradise where you can not worry about the safety of their kids.  There are shells at the bottom of the sea, so it is better to use special bathing shoes to avoid troubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="titanic palace spa aquapark 5" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/991477.jpg" width="600"></div>
