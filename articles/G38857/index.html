His father, Abdulfatta Giandali, was a native of Syria, and his mother, Joan Schible, was a German from a Catholic family.  Both of them studied at the University of Wisconsin.  When father Joan found out that she was pregnant from a Muslim, he threatened her with inheritance.  The girl went to give birth to a private obstetrician in San Francisco, and then <span>abandoned the child,</span> giving him for adoption to Paul Jobs and his wife, Clara Agobyan, an American of Armenian descent.  So begins the biography of Steve Jobs - one of the most successful people of our time.  So, a boy born out of wedlock and abandoned by his biological parents ended up in a foster family.  However, his mother, Joan, dreamed that her child would graduate, and took a written commitment from the adoptive parents that they would not spare the money for her son's education at the university.  I wonder how Steve Jobs‚Äôs biography would have developed if Joan hadn‚Äôt taken care of his education beforehand. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Steve Jobs childhood</strong> </p><p>  Clara turned out to be Steve's wonderful mother, kind and caring, and Paul patronized him in every way.  Steve was even offended when they called them foster parents.  2 years after the adoption of Steve, the couple Jobs took the family of the same child - the girl Patty.  Despite the fact that Clara was not able to get a higher education, she was prone to knowledge and did her best with children.  Even as a preschool child, Steve learned to count and read.  Despite the fact that he was known as a prankster at school, teachers were able to see extraordinary abilities in him, and he immediately moved from fourth grade to 7. Then, Jobs's parents moved to another district in order to transfer him to a more prestigious school, where Steve began to communicate with the engineer neighbor Larry Lang, who also spotted a powerful mind in the boy and brought him once to the Helvette-Packard Corporation research club.  This was a turning point in his life.  Steve Jobs's biography from this minute went in a completely different direction.  Here he saw the first computer in his life, which made a strong impression on him.  Steve began to master in the scientific community and decided to keep up with the other members of the club, each of whom worked on an invention.  The thirteen-year-old boy possessed not only extraordinary thinking, but also a punchy character.  To achieve his plan, he asked for help from the head of the company, and he, appreciating the courage and smartness of the teenager, began to contribute to the disclosure of his bold ideas and even took him to his work.  Already at the age of 15, Steve earned his own car, of course, his adoptive father helped him in everything. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The quest path</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Steve Jobs, Short Biography" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12194/221320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For a while, Steve was passionate about the hippies: he began to listen to the Beatles, smoke marijuana, and use drugs.  However, he quickly passed.  Towards the end of the 60s of the last century, he met his namesake, <span>Stephen Wozniak,</span> as well as Bill Fernandez.  Together with them, he began to develop computers.  He had a special relationship with Wozniak, they understood each other perfectly and became real friends.  Initially, through their inventions, they organized raffles, but later realized that it could be used for commercial purposes.  Wozniak invented brilliant things, and Jobs designed them and presented them to humanity.  After leaving school, Jobs went to the most expensive college in Portland, and poor parents were forced to annually pay a huge amount for his education.  However, studying at Reed College greatly contributed to his continued prosperity.  Steve Jobs‚Äôs biography is rich in many bright meetings, and one of them is acquaintance with the born leader Robert </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Steve Jobs, biography in English" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/220622.jpg" width="480"></div>  Friedland, who, with his parting words, steered Jobs' train of thought in the right direction.  However, Steve was not destined to graduate from this college, he was expelled due to passes.  It was just that Steve was not interested in boring lectures, he only wanted to practice.  Then followed a long journey of searching, a trip to India for enlightenment, a passion for Zen Buddhism, work in various companies, scientific research, work in a homemade computer club, etc.  Here he invited his friend Wozniak, and they began to work on computers, and the company that was founded by them in 1976 was called Apple Computer.  This was the beginning of the Apple era.  This is how a great empire was created, the founder of which is Steve Jobs.  The short biography that we presented in this article, of course, does not contain all the facts of the life of a great genius, nevertheless, it describes the path that he had to go before entering the finish line.  Today, the name of Steve Jobs is known throughout the world.  Despite the fact that he is no longer with us, millions of people in all parts of the world use his inventions every day.  He can be safely called the hero of our time.  The book ‚ÄúSteve Jobs‚Äù, a biography in English, was written by journalist and biographer of the great entrepreneur Walter Isaacson.  This book has been translated into many languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.
