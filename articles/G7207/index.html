    <h2>  Anatomy: general concept, subject of study </h2><p>  What is anatomy as a science?  This is a discipline that studies the external and internal structure of organisms.  Various methods of anatomy make it possible to understand the following. </p><ol><li>  How are organs located in the body of an organism. </li><li>  How are they interconnected, what unites them and what is their significance for the whole being as a whole. </li><li>  What is their internal and external structure, up to micro-infrastructures. </li><li>  What organs should be normal, and how they change with diseases, from bad habits, external and internal influences of various kinds. </li><li>  What processes are the basis of life, and thanks to which systems and organs are living systems. </li></ol><p>  Of course, not only one anatomy is studying all of the above.  There is a whole range of related sciences, which together provide complete information.  The tasks of anatomy and physiology just come down to embracing the whole complex of knowledge about the living, about its structure and functioning, as well as understanding the mental and psychosomatic processes that occur in the human central nervous system. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The object of study of anatomy is a specific representative of wildlife.  It could be: </p><ul><li>  human; </li><li>  animal; </li><li>  plant; </li><li>  bacteria </li><li>  mushrooms. </li></ul><p>  We will dwell in more detail on the consideration of such a creature as a person from the point of view of designated discipline. </p><h2>  The tasks of anatomy as a science </h2><p>  There are several main tasks that this discipline performs. </p><ol><li>  It studies not only the internal and external structure of each organism, but also correlates the processes occurring in it with age-related and historical changes in time. </li><li>  He studies the phylogenesis, ontogenesis and anthropogenesis of his object. </li><li>  It considers the relationship between the structure and functioning of organs and organ systems among themselves. </li><li>  It assesses the general condition of the body, its constitution, body parts and organs. </li></ol><p>  Thus, the tasks of human anatomy cover the whole complex of necessary knowledge.  To solve the above problems, like any other sciences, the discipline we are considering also has its secrets.  <span>The methods for studying</span> anatomy are quite diverse, and they have been formed for a long time.  The choice was dictated by the need for knowledge of the deep mechanisms of the human body. </p>

    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  There are several main sections that are part of this science. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Normal anatomy. </li><li>  Pathological. </li><li>  Comparative. </li><li>  Topographic. </li></ol><p>  Each of them has its own methods of studying anatomy, as well as general, with the help of which various parameters are studied.  Together, these disciplines give a complete description of the structure of the object of study, as well as its functioning and development over time. </p><h2>  Anatomy Study Methods </h2><p>  There is a wide variety of different research options in the field of anatomy, physiology, and related sciences.  After all, a person managed to look into the deepest essence, to see and study the microstructure of his body.

    <h2>  Corrosion Injection Method </h2><p>  This method makes extensive use of anatomy.  Human research methods, based on the introduction of even the thinnest capillary formations of special solidifying or stained substances, which allow the naked eye to consider the system of blood and lymph vessels.  In this case, the substances can be of a different nature, for example: </p><ul><li>  gypsum; </li><li>  gelatin; </li><li>  wax; </li><li>  rosin; </li><li>  celluloid and others. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the masses are stained with different colors and get an accurate image of the organ from the inside.  Thanks to this, a picture becomes available to scientists, reflecting the order of interaction between each other vessels and capillaries. </p><p>  Also, if necessary, methods of anatomy, such as injections, can provide material for drawing up an accurate imitation of an organ.  To do this, the colored hardening mass is introduced into the vessel and waiting for hardening.  After that, they act with a specific substance that can destroy living tissues around, but does not affect the mass of the introduced substance (for example, strong alkalis or acids).  This is the dissolution of the organ, and only its cast remains, which has a high degree of accuracy in the reflection of its internal structure. </p><p>  In addition to corrosion damage caused by strong oxidizing agents, other substances are often used that can cause enlightenment of various organs.  Such substances include: </p><ul><li>  glycerol; </li><li>  benzene; </li><li>  Cedar oil; </li><li>  benzyl benzoate; </li><li>  isosafrol and others. </li></ul><p>  That is, the tissues around the injected mass simply become transparent, brighten very much.  It also provides information on the structure and functioning of the vessel. </p><p>  Injection is considered to be one of the most accurate methods of anatomy.  It is used most often in combination with subsequent treatments.  So, with the introduction of a mass that does not transmit gamma radiation, the body is subsequently subject to investigation using x-ray.  So a high-quality image of an organ is obtained, its integrity, interconnection with other structures is established. </p><p>  After injection, there comes a time when you want to enter a potent substance that can destroy, cause corrosion of living tissue around the frozen mass of the drug.  This is done to obtain a qualitative model of the structure of the organ.  In this way, you can extract from the body an exact copy of the former part of the body, and the image will be as realistic as possible and transmitted with the smallest details. </p><p>  Injection-corrosion methods of human anatomy were first used by the scientist F. Ruysch.  In Russia, anatomists began to use this method a little later.  Among the most famous domestic names that gave the course and development to this direction, the following sound: </p><ul><li>  P.F. Lesgaft; </li><li>  V. M. Shumlyansky; </li><li>  I.V.Buyalsky. </li></ul><p>  The preparations created by their efforts are still used as educational and scientific aids and are stored in the <span>anatomical museum.</span> </p><p>  The tasks and methods of anatomy are closely dependent on each other.  After all, exactly what you need to know determines how to achieve this.  To look inside all the organs, to find out what their morphological and topographic characteristics are, to identify the features of interaction with other parts of the body - this is one of the tasks of the science in question. </p><p>  The corrosion method allows you to solve it quite successfully.  You can get accurate models that reflect the structure: </p><ul><li>  hollow organs (heart, ventricles of the brain); </li><li>  parenchymal organs (kidneys, liver); </li><li>  vessels of the macro and microvasculature; </li><li>  prostate gland. </li></ul><p>  Of particular importance is the penetration into the vessels and capillaries, because with the help of other methods this is impossible.  Currently, silicone has become the most popular material for injection, which hardens for a long time, but is less toxic than others and does not shrink.  Thus, not only the structure is reflected, but also the actual dimensions of the organ under investigation. </p>

    <h2>  Enlightenment method </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting ways to study anatomy.  Its essence is as follows.  An organ or part of the body is impregnated with special acid solutions that allow it to bind water and swell, turning into a jelly-like mass.  In this case, <span>the refractive index of the</span> light of the solvent and the organ become equal to each other, part of the body acquires transparency. </p><p>  Thus, a high-quality image of the internal environment of the body through transparent tissues is obtained without their destruction, as, for example, with the corrosion method.  Most often, this method is used in the study of the nervous system, its parts and organs. </p><p>  What allows you to see and determine a similar method of research? </p><ol><li>  Topography of the location of organs in the body. </li><li>  Anatomical features of the whole organism or its individual parts. </li><li>  The relationship of organs in the body. </li></ol><p>  Obviously, this method has its advantages over the previously considered corrosion method. </p><h2>  Ice anatomy </h2><p>  The tasks of <span>human</span> anatomy and <span>physiology are</span> reduced to a detailed study of not only the structure, location, but also the functioning of a particular organ and organism as a whole.  And this requires obtaining such an image or creating a model that would fully reflect the true behavior of a part of the body in a living organism. </p><p>  But to subject a living person to complete anatomical research is impossible.  At all times I had to work with corpses.  Atmospheric pressure, mechanical deformation, and other factors led to a change in the location of the organ after <span>opening the corpse,</span> to its morphological and physiological changes.  Therefore, for a long time it was not possible to get a reliable picture. </p>

    <p>  This problem was solved by Academician N.I. Pirogov.  He proposed a method for cutting frozen corpses.  For this, the human corpse is pre-fixed, processed and severely frozen.  Moreover, this is done as soon as possible after death, so that the body does not lose its intravital topography of organs. </p><p>  After this procedure, an ice corpse is an ideal material for work.  You can make cuts in different directions of any parts of the body and get completely accurate real images.  This research method has far advanced surgery. </p><p>  The same scientists proposed the so-called ice sculpture.  Its creation consists in removing layers of cover and underlying tissues layer by layer from a strongly frozen body up to the necessary organ.  Thus, realistic three-dimensional images are obtained, on the basis of which it is completely possible to judge the topography, the relative position and the relationship of all parts of the body with each other. </p><h2>  X-ray and tomography </h2><p>  The most modern methods for the study of anatomy are associated with the use of computer and electronic technologies, and are also closely based on the use of electromagnetic radiation.  The most important of them are: </p><ul><li>  tomography (magnetic resonance imaging, computed); </li><li>  radiography. </li></ul><p>  Tomography is a modern method, completely replacing the Pirogov method.  Due to magnetic resonance or x-rays, it is possible to obtain a three-dimensional image of any organ of a person in a living state.  That is, thanks to this modern method, there is no need to conduct research on corpses. </p><p>  Computed tomography is the use of x-rays.  The method was invented in 1972 by American scientists, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize.  The bottom line is the transmittance of tissues to x-rays.  Since they themselves differ in density, absorption also proceeds to a different extent.  Thus, a detailed layered study of the internal part of the organ becomes possible. </p><p>  The data obtained are downloaded to a computer, where they are very complex processed, calculated based on measurements, and the result is displayed.  Such studies are necessary for the following medical conditions: </p><ul><li>  before operations; </li><li>  with severe injuries; </li><li>  <span>cerebral hemorrhage</span> ; </li><li>  lungs' cancer; </li><li>  fainting </li><li>  causeless dizziness; </li><li>  damage to blood vessels and organs; </li><li>  puncture procedure and others. </li></ul><p>  Magnetic resonance imaging is based on the emission of certain electromagnetic waves in a constant magnetic field.  In this case, the excitation of atomic nuclei is caused, their electromagnetic response is measured, and conclusions are drawn based on the indicators.  Using this method, the brain, spine, blood vessels and other structures are examined. </p>

    <p>  Radiographic methods of anatomy are based on the use of gamma radiation having unequal permeability for different tissues.  In this case, the reflection of the rays is fixed on a special paper or film, therefore, an image of the desired organ is obtained on it.  In these ways, investigate: </p><ul><li>  spine; </li><li>  abdominal organs; </li><li>  lungs; </li><li>  blood vessels; </li><li>  skeleton; </li><li>  tumor diseases; </li><li>  teeth; </li><li>  mammary glands and other organs and parts of the body. </li></ul><p>  The considered modern methods of human anatomy are universal for all living creatures and are also used in veterinary medicine.  However, each of them has a number of contraindications, which are explained by the individual characteristics of each creature, its diseases and general health. </p><h2>  Pathological anatomy </h2><p>  The subject and methods of anatomy must be correlated with each other very harmoniously so that people can get the most reliable result.  Therefore, almost every section of anatomy has its own set of specific methods for studying a person. </p><p>  So, pathological anatomy is such a discipline that is able to identify and study, find methods to combat pathologies, diseases at the micro level, that is, at the stage of their cellular development.  The same science is establishing the cause of death.  For research in the field of microstructures - cells, tissues, intracellular changes, various methods of pathological anatomy are used. </p><p>  These include the following varieties. </p><ol><li>  Autopsy - in other words, it is an autopsy of a person‚Äôs body after his death to establish its cause.  It is produced by a pathologist.  He takes samples from the body for research, which is carried out in the laboratory.  Based on the data received, the doctor writes a conclusion about the causes of death and morphophysiological changes that were recorded.  Most often, this verdict coincides with the clinical one that the attending physician puts.  However, disagreements do occur that are considered at general anatomical medical conferences. </li><li>  Biopsy.  These methods include visual studies of living samples taken from a person, as well as sampling of material from internal organs (puncture).  The difference from the previous method lies precisely in the fact that studies are conducted on the basis of a living organism. </li><li>  Immunohistochemical methods are a study of the underlying processes inside the cell, its protein composition, belonging to one or another type of tissue.  These methods are very important for modern cancer diagnostics. </li><li>  Electron microscopy - the use of very high resolution equipment, which allows you to study even the ultramicrostructure of any organ and cell. </li><li>  Hybridization in place.  This method is based on work with the detection of nucleic acids.  In this way, information is obtained about pathological processes that are latent or hidden.  Diagnosed with hepatitis, AIDS, herpes virus and other ailments. </li></ol><p>  In general, the data of pathological anatomy are very important for the development of medical knowledge about the structure and development of man. </p>

    <h2>  CNS anatomy </h2><p>  The tasks of the central nervous system anatomy are reduced to a complete and deep study of the structure of nerve cells, tissues, organs and the system as a whole.  Also studied is not only the historical, but also the individual development of the nervous system with age.  The brain is considered as a substrate for the implementation of all mental functions. </p><p>  Since all issues related to the structure and functioning of the system under consideration are very important and need to be examined in detail, the methods of the central nervous system anatomy are also quite complex and specific.  There are two research options in this area. </p><ol><li>  Microscopic.  They are based on the use of special equipment that allows you to get a multiply enlarged image of a particular organ (part).  So, they distinguish optical microscopy - the study of sections of the nervous tissue, electronic - the study of cellular structures, molecules, substances that form the external sphere of the object. </li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Macroscopic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, several intravital and post-mortem research options are distinguished. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intravital include:</font></font></li></ol><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> radiography; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> CT scan; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> magnetic resonance; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> positron emission; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> electroencephalography. </font></font></li></ul><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Post-mortem methods include: </font></font></p><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> anatomy; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> injection and corrosion; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> radiography. </font></font></li></ul><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All of the above methods for studying the anatomy of the central nervous system were discussed above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of the highly specific ones for this system, EEG (electroencephalography) and positron emission tomography can be called. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first is based on registration with the help of an encephalograph of special biorhythms of brain cells (alpha and beta rhythms), on the basis of which a conclusion is made about the functioning and number of living cells. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A study is conducted through intact integuments of the brain on a living person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the procedure is completely safe, however, there are some contraindications.</font></font></p>
