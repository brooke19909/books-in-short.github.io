  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How beautifully photographed: ideas, poses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each person knows how to correctly hold a spoon and a fork in his hands, knows how to eat, drive a car, and knows that he needs to cross the road to a green light.  By this we acquire skills rather quickly, but only those for whom photography is a part of professional activity know how to take pictures beautifully. </p><p>  In nature, there is no such thing as a ‚Äúnon-photogenic‚Äù person - this is either a model that does not know how to choose the right posture, or a photographer‚Äôs hands ‚Äúno where needed‚Äù. </p><h2>  Three whales </h2><p>  So, the first thing you need to pay attention to is the components of a successful photo.  To understand how you can beautifully take a picture, you need to know the basics of creating a successful picture. </p><p>  Firstly, there are three main components to a good photo: </p><ol><li>  A place. </li><li>  Model. </li><li>  Clothing. </li></ol><p>  Secondly, these three whales are supplemented by indicators such as accessories, light and the photographer‚Äôs ability to work in Photoshop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iso.500px.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="great idea for photography" class="if uuid-2271883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271883.jpg"></div><h2>  Place, Model, Clothing </h2><p>  So, how beautiful is the picture taken?  The first thing to do is decide on a place.  The background on which the photograph will be taken is one of the keys to success.  There should not be any aggressive colors, ridiculous patterns or stripes in the background.  The more uniform the place, the better. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second thing to think about is clothing.  Like the background, it must be carefully selected.  Clothing is an indispensable attribute of a good image.  If you do not have a professional stylist who can create a cute and innocent look from colorful fabric, then it is better to avoid experiments.  It is worth choosing clothes in neutral tones, without bright spots.  It should be uniform, without a ridiculous print.  No matter how you look, the viewer will first see bright spots in the photo, and only then the model and the general concept. </p><p>  Also, do not forget about the correspondence of the background and the image.  A lady in a vintage dress will look ridiculously enough against the background of a high-tech room. </p><p>  The final final component is the model.  There are people who confidently keep themselves in front of the camera, and there are those who do not like the gaze of the lens.  Therefore, if the model is clamped in front of the camera, then the picture will not be very successful.  In addition, the appearance of the model can give a great idea for a photo shoot, you do not need to ignore the features of the appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mymodernmet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully you can take a picture" class="if uuid-2271889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271889.jpg"></div><h2>  Accessories, lights and other tricks </h2><p>  But that is not all that is needed for a good job.  What else do you need to know to take a beautiful picture?  The photo will not be complete without the availability of accessories.  This is a very powerful tool.  Recently, accessories are very popular in wedding photo shoots.  Soap bubbles, masks, flowers, etc. can play their role. If you wisely approach this issue, then the presence of only one additional element can completely change the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãphotography. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One more idea for a great photo can be given by light.  All kinds of lighting schemes or additional lighting can be used both in the studio and on the street.  Perhaps this is one of the most powerful tools in the hands of the photographer.  After lighting, the second important factor is the ability to use Photoshop.  With it, you can completely convert the picture. </p><h2>  Top positions </h2><p>  So, how beautiful is the picture taken?  The first and most important thing is to learn the positions through which you can emphasize your strengths and hide weaknesses.  Here are the most profitable options that have been tested by experience: </p><ul><li>  Become a demi-side to the photographer and turn a little in his direction, while leaving your legs in the same position.  This pose will make the figure slimmer. </li><li>  Become your back to the photographer, turn your shoulders or head a little, align your back and keep your shoulders level. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.joyofmarketing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="take beautiful photo" class="if uuid-2271887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271887.jpg"></div><h2>  Other recommendations </h2><p>  Not many people wonder how beautifully photographed, but definitely every second is dissatisfied with their photos.  To minimize your indignation, you should use some recommendations: </p><ul><li>  A full face (like on a passport) can be afforded only by people with perfect facial features. </li><li>  No need to take a profile picture for a person who has a long nose. </li><li>  If a girl has a round face, she needs to be photographed a little from above. </li><li>  To visually lengthen the leg, you need to take a picture from below. </li><li>  If the model is lying, she needs to stretch her socks, so the position will come out more elegant. </li><li>  You can reduce the waist by placing your palms on this area, and the palms can hide the folds on the stomach. </li><li>  And do not forget about the smile, a light half-smile will be more than enough. </li></ul><h2>  Most popular poses </h2><p>  Mostly these poses use professional models, but this does not mean that they are not intended for mere mortals.  A little practice, and you're done. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.basicinvite.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully photographed poses" class="if uuid-2271888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271888.jpg"></div><p>  So, how beautifully photographed (poses): </p><ol><li>  The most successful angle of portraiture for girls of any physique is a look from behind a shoulder.  Then the model looks relaxed and easy, as if it were accidentally caught in the frame. </li><li>  If the model is not afraid of close-ups, it can advantageously use fingers to emphasize lips or eyes. </li><li>  Many successful photos can be obtained from a lying pose, however, you will first need to experiment in front of the mirror. </li><li>  A good solution is to practice a simple pose - lying on your back when the model is looking into the lens, slightly turning his head toward the photographer.  The main thing is to figure out where to put your hands, they should not lie along the body. </li><li>  To demonstrate yourself in full growth, you need to sit sideways to the photographer, lean on your hands, bend one leg at the knee, and stretch the other forward with an elongated toe, lean your head back and bend at the waist.  Bends - this is what makes this perspective successful. </li><li>  For those who like dynamic poses, you need to take your shoulder back and go to the photographer easily and from your hip.  No need to look at the camera, then the frame will be very natural. </li><li>  Very relaxed pose with support.  On this subject, you can come up with many variations, the main thing is not to see how hard the model is trying.  Everything should be careless and elegant. </li><li>  Although the pose is "arms up" and beaten by time, it is very popular in the arsenal of experienced models.  Correct hair, accidentally twist a strand of hair, etc. The main thing is not to lock motionless during shooting. </li><li>  Also very popular is a pose called "did not know that they were shooting me."  A thoughtful and detached look to the side looks very advantageous in the pictures. </li></ol><h2>  How beautifully photographed in winter? </h2><p>  For photo shoots, you can find many ideas.  One of them is to use the landscape, in particular the change of seasons.  As it turned out, winter is very popular, obviously, because of the holidays.  What can you think of for winter shooting? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully photographed in winter" class="if uuid-2271882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271882.jpg"></div><p>  Here are some common ideas: </p><ol><li>  Snowy forest.  This is an ideal place where all the grandeur and luxury of winter landscapes are reflected.  Snow-covered trees, sparkling overflows of snow under the bright sun - what could be better than such scenery?  Alternatively, you can play snowballs, make a snowman, make an angel or snow fireworks.  A cold background will emphasize the sincerity of feelings. </li><li>  New Year's atmosphere.  Snow is the best component to help create the New Year‚Äôs atmosphere.  Several Christmas tree decorations in the snow, rain, garlands, crackers.  Perfectly complement the photograph of a basket with sweets and floral arrangements. </li><li>  Rink.  Another great place for a winter photo shoot is the skating rink.  Even if the model does not know how to ride, the frames will still turn out to be very lively and positive, and you can also pose by simply sitting on the fence or casually throwing skates over your shoulder. </li></ol><h2>  Street </h2><p>  The hardest part is taking pictures on the street.  How beautiful is the picture taken in this case?  In advance, you need to take care of the appropriate makeup, styling, which is not afraid of the wind, rehearse several poses for the photo shoot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pexels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully photographed on the street" class="if uuid-2271885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271885.jpg"></div><p>  To take a beautiful picture with an architectural landmark, you need to move away from it as far as possible.  Then both the model and the building will fall into the frame.  The photographer should not stand in front of the light.  Maybe the lonely dark silhouette in the picture will seem to someone a work of art, but it's a bad tone.  As a props, you can use benches, swings, bridges and scaffolds, stairs, etc. Taking pictures on the street is difficult due to possible interference, but in terms of the variety of photographs this is the best place. </p><h2>  House </h2><p>  And finally, how beautifully photographed at home?  Of course, studio photos will turn out much better, but not everyone has the time and opportunity to organize this.  Therefore, you have to take photos at home.  Selfies can be ruled out right away - this is not a high art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vanityfair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully photographed at home" class="if uuid-2271886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45861/2271886.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing an image for a home photo shoot, you need to stop attention on concise things.  It is better to avoid something spectacular and extravagant.  The choice can be stopped on a dress in pastel colors and high-heeled shoes.  It‚Äôs best to leave your hair loose and your makeup smoky eyes.  As for the poses, they can be selected already along the way, using what comes to hand (only not a wall-mounted carpet).  Entertaining photos are obtained near the window.  Near the door you can portray a leaving girl, and in the kitchen do baking. </p><p>  Beautifully photographed - simple.  The main thing is to cover up flaws, focus on advantages and pay attention to trifles. </p>
