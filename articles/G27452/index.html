    <p>  The most important question for those traveling to the Crimea (sanatorium "Slavutich") is the price of accommodation in a boarding house.  Everything will depend on how long you are traveling and what time of year.  In winter, holiday prices are slightly cheaper than in summer.  So, in December 2015, the cost of living will vary from 1295 to 2700 rubles, depending on the selected room category.  You can also purchase additional seats, they cost from 790 to 920 rubles. </p><p>  In January 2016, a price increase is planned.  The cost of living will vary from 1,425 to 3,600 rubles, depending on the selected set of services.  You will have to pay from 870 to 1000 rubles for an extra seat.  The price includes accommodation and three meals a day in the dining room, the opportunity to use the local beach, as well as basic treatment, which is prescribed by the patient depending on the condition. </p><h2>  Where is? </h2>

    <p>  It will also be useful to clarify the address of the sanatorium.  ‚ÄúSlavutich‚Äù is located in the south-eastern part of Alushta, on Krasnoarmeyskaya Street, 20. This location is very convenient, from here you can walk to the city center in just five minutes, and the central promenade of the city is also nearby.  If you have never been to Crimea, you can use the services of local guides who will be happy to tell you how to get to the sanatorium. </p><p>  It is best to book a ticket to ‚ÄúSlavutich‚Äù in advance, approximately in a month, otherwise there is a chance that you will have to rest in another sanatorium of Alushta.  You can make a reservation on the boarding house's own website, or you can also call +7 (988) 145-95-69.  By this number you will receive a full consultation on all issues.  Do not forget to clarify the current cost of living for the period you are interested in, since it changes periodically. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The most important thing that will help you to form an opinion on whether Alushta, the sanatorium ‚ÄúSlavutich‚Äù is worthy of your attention is reviews of vacationers.  Among the advantages of the boarding house, its guests highlight high-quality treatment, which is selected individually for each patient.  Also, visitors to the sanatorium note the high qualification of staff who are ready to assist at any time. </p><p>  There are also negative aspects that patients of the boarding house could not keep silent about.  The most important of them is that rest in the sanatorium "Slavutich" is not always available due to the large number of patients.  It is difficult and inconvenient for some people to book a ticket for several months, so they would like the institution to expand and be able to receive much more guests than now.  It is still unknown whether the leadership of the sanatorium has plans for expansion, however, if this happens, then not earlier than 2016. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Rest in the sanatorium should be such that after it you feel better, healthier and ready for accomplishments.  Going to Alushta, you can be sure that you will receive a range of high-quality services at relatively low prices.  Among other things, you can spend your free time remaining after treatment on walks around the city and its environs. </p><p>  Remember that if you experience any difficulties (allergies to medications, poor health, etc.), you should immediately inform your doctor about them.  Not far from the sanatorium is the city hospital, where you will also be provided with high-quality medical care if necessary. </p>
