  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lactic acid bacteria - invisible defenders of the body</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As a rule, the word "bacterium" is associated with various diseases and other troubles.  However, this is not quite true.  After all, our body is the habitat of a wide variety of microorganisms.  Among them there are even bacteria without which normal functioning is impossible.  This group includes lactic acid bacteria that live in the intestines of a healthy person.  In general, they are a group of gram-positive microaerophilic microorganisms that promote the fermentation of carbohydrates, while forming lactic acid.  Such fermentation is often used both in the industrial production of products for the preservation and processing of drinks and food, and at home. </p><p>  In the body, bacteria perform many useful functions.  First of all, sour-milk bacteria maintain an optimal balance of acidity in the intestine due to their ability to produce acetic and lactic acid. </p><p>  In addition, they contribute to the normalization of the protective function of the intestine, which helps a person cope with various <span>pathogenic bacteria</span> and other microorganisms.  Lactic acid bacteria beneficially affect the liver through the suppression of increased metabolite activity. </p><p>  In addition to acetic and <span>lactic acids,</span> these beneficial microorganisms are capable of producing volatile compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide, which effectively suppress various intestinal infections. </p><p>  Many studies have shown that acid-resistant bacteria, which include lactic acid microorganisms, produce many trace elements and vitamins that contribute to the healing of the body as a whole.  When interacting with other substances and with each other, they secrete enzymes necessary for a normal metabolic process and digestion, as well as better absorption of nutrients. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of particular interest among the whole variety of lactic acid bacteria are microorganisms of the family Lactobacillaccae and family Slreptocuccaccae.  The latter are widely used in the manufacture of various dairy products: sour cream, yogurt with fruit fillers, as well as cottage cheese.  Such lactic acid bacteria as acidophilus bacillus, easily take root on the walls of the intestine and prevent the division of putrefactive <span>bacteria that are harmful</span> to human health. </p><p>  In order for your body to be able to independently maintain the necessary conditions for the reproduction of these microorganisms, special efforts are not required.  It is enough to adhere to a healthy diet.  Unfortunately, the modern world is designed in such a way that it is not easy to fulfill this condition.  The whole problem is that, despite good nutrition, not all products from the daily diet meet quality standards. </p><p>  In addition to malnutrition, factors such as persistent stress, alcohol abuse and smoking, and long-term antibiotic treatment adversely affect the intestinal microflora. </p><p>  You can restore healthy microflora in the intestines by eating homemade milk, yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese or kefir.  You can use store-bought lactic acid products, but their benefits will be much less. </p><p>  Depending on the species, lactic acid bacteria can affect the state of the immune system in different ways.  For example, bifidobacteria, unlike lactobacilli, inhibit the immune response.  Therefore, before buying <span>sour-milk products,</span> pay attention to which sour-milk bacteria they contain in their composition. </p><p>  Using lactic acid microorganisms, many drugs are produced that are prescribed for such disorders of the digestive system as dysbiosis, <span>food poisoning,</span> diarrhea and others. </p>
