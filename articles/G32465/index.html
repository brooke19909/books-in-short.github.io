  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Humanism is ...</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Humanism is a special worldview.  According to the theoretical concept, man is the highest value.  In practice, humanism is a careful attitude to people. </p><p>  The worldview originated in the Renaissance, in the 15-16 centuries.  At this time in Italy, and subsequently in England, France, Holland, Germany, a large-scale movement was formed against church despotism. </p><p>  Opposing the demands of religion to spend their entire earthly life in atonement for sins, humanists carried a person to the top of the universe, asserting his right to happiness.  They believed that people naturally aspire to enjoyment, and also have the ability to moral self-improvement, being spiritually free. </p><p>  In response to the critical statements of religious fundamentalists, <span>secular humanism</span> stood out from the humanist movement <span>.</span>  This trend rejects faith, considering it a fundamentally illusory way of orienting people in the world.  Thus, the ability to live according to <span>ethical standards,</span> without the use of religious hypotheses, was affirmed. </p><p>  Humanism is (initially) a recognition of the <span>value of the human</span> personality, its right to unlimited development and the manifestation of existing abilities.  A later interpretation of the term indicates the affirmation of the human good as a measure by which social relations are evaluated. </p><p>  Trying to express the <span>principle of humanism</span> in one sentence, the authors receive the following phrase: "Any person has the right to strive for happiness and freedom."  According to the theory of worldview, people cannot be used.  Humanism is the care of man. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In accordance with the views of this worldview, people's lives are priceless, special care should be taken in relation to the weak: children, disabled people, women.  In the pedagogical sphere, humanism is represented by the assertion that every child has a positive core - he just needs to help develop. </p><p>  It is believed that all children are born free.  Humanism opposes the imposition of one or another worldview on the child, believing that he (the child) can determine his own path.  Education should exclude manipulation and coercion.  Ideally, you should get a harmoniously developed personality, a happy and free person. </p><p>  It should be noted, however, that humanism has always been criticized.  Often this criticism was justified.  Overly caring for people (both children and adults) has a flip side.  So, for example, those who were protected from drafts in childhood were sick more often, and those who were protected from difficulties more often experienced them.  Undoubtedly, any forward movement is unthinkable without errors.  At the same time, the humanistic principle ‚ÄúDo no harm‚Äù in relation to a person prohibits making mistakes. </p><p>  It should be noted the curious fact that until the 17th century, surgery was the business of barbers, not doctors.  Doctors had to observe the humanistic principle - they were forbidden to violate the integrity of the skin of patients.  The operation was carried out by the barber, and the scientific doctor was sitting at the department and supervised the operation, reading out directions loudly.  Today, of course, the principle is not understood so literally.  Modern surgeons have the right and obligation to damage the patient‚Äôs skin in the name of preserving his life. </p><p>  Nowadays, the development of worldview also undergoes some difficulties.  Some authors point to certain excesses in the humanistic perception of the world.  So, for example, people with disabilities who recognize themselves as an oppressed minority are protesting today against <span>prenatal diagnosis,</span> which allows women to abort future children with disabilities.  Thus, when humanism unduly protects the weak and the sick, their number in society begins to increase. </p>
