But in fact, a game or activity can be invented from absolutely any subject that is in your home.  The main thing is to show imagination and join in a magical occupation.  Then the children are happy, and the parents are glad that they managed to calm the little bullies. </p><p>  Great activity for children and adults - origami or modeling from plasticine.

Cut your eyes from another sheet of paper and glue to your tiger.  Done! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paper tiger face </h2><p>  Another interesting version of a tiger made of paper is a craft made in the form of its muzzle.  Following the detailed instructions, you will get a cute tiger cub. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.supercoloring.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper tiger cub" class="if uuid-2398699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2398699.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make his eyes and color his coat, cut out triangles from black paper and glue them on a craft.  Make eyes and nose the same way.  Draw the missing parts with a black felt-tip pen.  And if you take a bright candy wrapper left from the candy and tie it in half with a thread, you get a charming bow, which can also be glued to the head of a tiger. </p><h2>  Plasticine tiger cub </h2><p>  In addition to colored paper, in the house where children live, as a rule, there is also multi-colored plasticine.  We offer another option for creating a tiger - an article made from this material.  Plasticine has a beneficial effect on both the nervous system and develops creative inclinations.  To make the same cute tiger cub, follow the instructions in the picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="plasticine tiger" class="if uuid-2398730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2398730.jpg"></div><p>  You can also make a palm tree with bananas from clay and a small lake nearby.  Thus, the child develops fantasy.  You can come up with various stories with the beast made, adding more and more objects, along the course of the storyline invented. </p><p>  Or you can try to make the Tigger from Winnie the Pooh beloved by many children.  To make the same figure, in addition to plasticine, you will need special tools for it, namely, a knife and a spatula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself tigger" class="if uuid-2398768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2398768.jpg"></div><p>  With their help, it is more convenient to work out small details.  Such as black stripes, eyes, eyebrows and mouth.  By the way, it is more convenient to work with plasticine intended for small children.  It has a much softer texture, unlike the classic one.  It is easier to knead and shape it.  Since children's pens are not always able to stretch hard sticks of ordinary plasticine, their lightweight version will undoubtedly appeal to them. </p>
