    <h2>  Why do people choose Dolce Gusto? </h2><p>  You may not have liked coffee too much before.  That was, apparently, because you only had to drink a soluble drink from sachets.  Everything will change after the Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee machine appears in your home.  Feedback from users who have previously purchased such an aggregate is different.  Many consumers share their opinions. </p><p>  Fans of coffee drinks praise or scold this device.  However, most buyers are captivated by an assortment of different capsules - from espresso and cappuccino to <span>hot chocolate.</span>  They are very convenient to use, you can even make hot milk.  The device itself is also very comfortable and easy to operate.  Pleasing to the eyes and elegant design.  The coffee machine is especially popular in black and white, reminiscent of a cute penguin, comfortably sitting on the kitchen table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Most often you have to go to the necessary accessories in hypermarkets.  The good news is that there are more and more stores selling capsules for coffee machines.

    <h2>  pros </h2><p>  For many, a morning begins with a cup of coffee; many drink it often throughout the day.  Professionals may prefer to make a drink in a Turk or in a professional machine. </p><p>  An excellent replacement will be the Dolce Gusto coffee machine.  You don‚Äôt have to hard study the operating instructions for such a device - everything is very simple and clear.  Of course, this machine does not produce drinks exactly like those obtained in professional machines, but the coffee made by small coffee machines comes out quite high-quality and tasty. </p><p>  Pros: </p><p>  1. Ease and convenience of maintenance - poured water, inserted a capsule, pressed a button. </p><p>  2. Pretty tasty. </p><p>  3. Various types of drinks. </p><p>  4. Stylish design. </p><p>  5. Adequate prices. </p><p>  6. Compactness. </p><p>  7. Convenience in leaving. </p><h2>  Cons and results <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolce coffee machine thickly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11001/357896.jpg?1396280549253" width="273"></div></h2><p>  1. Coffee from a professional machine is much tastier. </p><p>  2. Attachment to the outlet due to the short cord. </p><p>  3. The manufacturer produces a limited number of drinks.  You can not use coffee from other companies. </p><p>  4. In some drinks, such as latte, technology is disrupted. </p><p>  5. For one gulf of water, two cups of 100 ml are obtained.  If you increase the volume of water, coffee will come out very diluted, and some like to drink from large mugs.  If the prescription relies on milk, the taste of a diluted drink becomes simply impossible. </p><p>  However, although this unit has some disadvantages, we advise you to purchase it because of its ease of use, low cost, and also because of the ability to drink drinks at home, which otherwise you can only try in a cafe.  Owners of such an aggregate as the Dolce Gusto coffee machine rarely notice malfunctions and breakdowns.  However, if finances allow, it is better to purchase a more expensive professional coffee machine. </p><h2>  A few words about mini-coffee machines </h2><p>  "It's just a fairy tale of some kind! I want to scream again: I adore her, I love and adore her again! She is charming - so stylish, pretty, small! And the main thing is that this miniature beauty gets luxurious coffee! A huge variety of capsules in many hypermarkets "It‚Äôs a pleasure to make coffee, and to wash, by the way, then nothing is needed!"  - Similar eulogies about devices - "babies" can be heard often. </p>

The price of capsules is somewhat high from the point of view of some users, but excellent drinks are obtained.  And Intenso coffee is enough for two preparations, since it comes out strong enough.

    <p>  Separately, you can purchase beautiful accessories, such as special irish glasses.  Then you can enjoy not only the taste, but also the beauty of the prepared drinks.  And when in the morning a fresh aroma of coffee spreads in the air, it becomes really kind! </p><h2>  Subtleties </h2><p>  You can say to yourself: "I love coffee very much! My morning always starts with this aromatic drink"?  All coffee lovers will probably agree that a can drink is not bad, but the one produced by the coffee machine is bliss.  Are you ready to wake up from one of his fragrances?  What about the foam?  She is divinely delicious! </p><p>  1. There are about 20 different tastes - this is espresso, and cappuccino, and lat, etc. There is even tea.  Capsules are sold in supermarkets such as Lenta, Perekrestok, and others. You can buy coffee in stores selling household appliances, such as Eldorado, Center, etc. </p><p>  2. Easy to handle: </p><p>  - plug into a power outlet; </p><p>  - insert the capsule into the capsule holder; </p><p>  - just press the "On" button  and wait until the red light changes to green; </p><p>  - turn the lever in the right direction - a blue circle for cold, red for hot water; </p>

    <p>  - you can only enjoy coffee! </p><h2>  Even a child can handle </h2><p>  Has a beauty from the Dolce Gusto brand already appeared in your house?  A mini coffee machine that produces coffee like a pro? </p><p>  Its obvious advantages are clear - it is inexpensive, takes up little space on the kitchen table, many different tastes.  Know that such a device is especially appreciated by younger family members.  Children love Nesquik the most.  By the way, even a ten-year-old can handle the device.  It is enough to make coffee or Nesquik several times with your child, explaining in detail how the machine works, how much water needs to be filled, the sequence of capsule insertion.  You will not need to wash the device either before or after use, so it will be very easy for a child to prepare a tasty drink for himself or his friends, flashing culinary talents in front of them. </p><p>  And for younger children, it takes only a couple of minutes of your time to give them a tasty and healthy drink in front of the kindergarten or school. </p><h2>  Not a single coffee man full </h2><p>  Many advantages of the coffee machine have already been considered.  In this section, I would like to say a few words about other capabilities of devices manufactured under the Dolce Gusto brand. </p><p>  Boxes with capsules have instructions that indicate how much water is needed, and the order in which capsules are inserted.  You can collect codes and receive bonuses in return. </p><p>  A separate topic is the variety of capsules.  Teas like Chai <span>Tea Latte are</span> especially admired <span>!</span>  Prices for it are slightly higher than for analogues of other brands.  However, the taste and quality are on top!  The drink is prepared not only simply, but also very quickly. </p><p>  Excellent time saving, a beautiful thing in the kitchen that allows you to enjoy excellent coffee, the envy of girlfriends - that‚Äôs what a Dolce Gusto coffee machine is. </p>

Such a device is suitable for people who love coffee, but are not going to invest tens of thousands in kitchen accessories.  Impressive is the speed of water preparation, as well as the preparation of coffee itself, which is unexpected for such a small apparatus.  It is known that professional coffee machines occupy quite a lot of space.  However, Dolce Gusto devices will conveniently fit on a table without disturbing the owner.  I was pleased with the versatility of the machine - it is able to prepare a wide range of drinks: chocolate, aromatic coffee, cocoa, etc. The disadvantage is the difficulty of finding capsules.  An inaccessible needle for supplying water is also occasionally clogged.
