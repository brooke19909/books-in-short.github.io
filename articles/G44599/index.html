Yes, over the past two decades, real estate prices have increased significantly, which significantly reduced the demand for residential premises.  Naturally, the most expensive city in the country is Moscow, and among the European states, our capital takes fourth place in the list of the most expensive cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most expensive apartment in Moscow" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/47637.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <p>  Interestingly, how much does a <span>one-room apartment</span> in Moscow cost?  The prices are amazing!  For example, the usual "Khrushchev", one-room, on the ground floor, located far from the city center, costs about four million rubles.  If you are interested in a more attractive option, that is, the location in the house of a more recent construction and a floor higher, then you will have to part with the amount of 5-6 million rubles.  However, it is worth considering that "odnushka" is the most popular, which means, in terms of square meters, the most expensive option.  So, a three-room apartment in Moscow will cost at least ten million rubles. </p><p>  If the price category of one-room apartments starts with a figure of 4 million, then how much then is the most expensive apartment in Moscow?  Not so long ago, an apartment was sold at the most record price in the history of home sales in Russia.  Luxury housing has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã780 square meters, includes 3 bathrooms, 2 kitchens, 2 large living rooms, several bedrooms and dressing rooms.  Together with the apartments, the new owner got seven parking spaces in the underground garage of the house.  The most expensive apartment in Moscow cost 1.14 billion rubles! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="two bedroom apartment in Moscow" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/47638.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The apartment is sold, now you can be happy for its owner.  But last week the really most expensive apartment in Moscow was put up for sale.  This is a nine-story town house of urban type, seven floors of which are occupied by residential premises, and the first two are technical.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a building is 1.3 thousand square meters.  The pool occupies the first floor, the living room is located on the second, the ‚Äúrelaxation room" is on the third, the fourth floor is for children, naturally the fifth is for the bedroom, the sixth floor is also occupied by the seventh floor, the cabinet is located, the winter garden is located on the eighth floor, the ninth It is a terrace.  Plus, there is still a huge underground parking.  All this magnificence is estimated at one hundred million dollars, sixty-seven million euros, or 2.5 billion rubles!  There was a rumor that the town house on Chistye Prudy was bought by some businessman, but real estate agencies deny this fact.  Nevertheless, the entire residence is a building with six entranceways, so we can assume that the most expensive apartment in Moscow exists in six versions! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a one-room apartment in Moscow cost?" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/47644.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Another interesting fact, which is also worth noting: such apartments are often rented out because it is difficult to find a buyer.  If the cost is fabulous, then we must assume that the <span>rent</span> is an impressive amount.  Last year, the most expensive rental apartment in the capital was housing located near the Tsvetnoy Boulevard metro station.  Apartments of 450 square meters include two dining rooms, five bedrooms, an office and other premises.  A month of living in an elite apartment is estimated at 70 thousand dollars!  I do not think <span>that such a luxury</span> is available to every citizen of our country, especially who came to the capital from the outback.  But Moscow is a very expensive city, so there is simply nothing to do here insecure in its strengths .... </p>
