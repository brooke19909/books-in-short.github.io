Today, this direction has become one of the most popular in Asia.  Vietnam is quite a bit behind India or Thailand, and even more so because of the biases of some Russian tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swiss Village Resort 4 Vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1053150.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours </h2><p>  In Vietnam, the prices for vacations in which it is difficult to call low, you can travel all year round.  The high cost of packages is explained simply: expensive air travel.  For example, for seven days with tickets, transfer and accommodation in a double standard room with breakfast, one person will have to pay about thirty thousand rubles.  You can reduce the cost if you should look for last-minute <span>tours to Vietnam, the</span> prices of which, especially during the period of discounts at some air carriers, are much more affordable: a similar trip for one person can cost fifteen, and sometimes even ten thousand rubles. </p><p>  This Asian country, despite the decent remoteness from ours, as well as the difficulties associated with a long flight, tour operators are positioned as an ideal place for eating with children.  There are several reasons for this.  Firstly, in Vietnam, in no season is it too hot or humid, the weather is always very mild, suitable not only for weather-sensitive elderly people, but also for children.  Secondly, in this country there is practically no pronounced noisy nightlife.  Of course, for those who wish, there are several discos and numerous night bars in each resort, but you can‚Äôt say that Vietnam never sleeps.  This is a place in which life proceeds measuredly, as ancient traditions require, and therefore it is ideal for a relaxing family vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Swiss Village Resort Spa 4" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1053140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Swiss Village Resort, they said, is just wonderful.  All rooms are well furnished.  There are balconies.  There were no complaints about the cleaning.  Many Russians strongly recommend that you do not bring any hygiene items, bathrobes and slippers with you, as they are provided at the hotel free of charge. </p><p>  Breakfast is delicious and fresh.  Nobody remained hungry.  As for the beach, our compatriots gave him the highest score: clean sand, an abundance of sunbeds and umbrellas, protection ... The only drawback is some tourists call the large amount of algae that the sea brings, but judging by the reviews, this problem has a seasonal character. </p>
