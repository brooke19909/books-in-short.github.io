It is located in the extreme east of the state, on the banks of the border river of the same name.  This article will discuss the history and sights of the Estonian city. </p><h2>  Estonia and its largest cities </h2><p>  Estonia is a small Baltic state located in Northern Europe.  Only 1.3 million people live in it.  Therefore, it is very difficult to compare Estonian cities (in size and area) with Russian, Ukrainian, etc. </p><p>  Today, 47 settlements in this country are considered to be cities.  Almost a third of the population of Estonia lives in the largest of them - Tallinn.  Only in fifteen cities of the country the population exceeds 10,000 people, and in some of them it does not reach thousands of inhabitants! </p><p>  The largest cities in Estonia are Tallinn, Tartu, Narva, P√§rnu and Kohtla-J√§rve.  Further, it will be about Narva. </p><h2>  Narva on the map of Estonia: geographic features </h2><p>  The city, due to its geographical location, has always had important geopolitical significance.  Today, his role is great primarily in the development of constructive Russian-Estonian interstate relations. </p><p>  Narva (Estonia) is located in the extreme east of the country, on the left bank of the Narva River.  On the opposite bank is already the Russian Ivangorod.  Two states are connected here by the so-called Friendship Bridge.  And from the opposite banks of the river two medieval fortresses look at each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Narva Estonia" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1112759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In modern Narva, about 60 thousand people live.  In the vicinity of the city, a complex of slate power plants was built, which are the main industrial enterprises of Narva. </p><h2>  The history of the border city </h2><p>  In what year was Narva founded?  Estonia, as a state with that name, arose much later.  But the history of Narva began in the distant 1223, on the day of foundation on the banks of the fortress river.  At first, the city belonged to Denmark, and then - to Livonia.  At the end of the XIV century, Russian Prince Ivan III built a powerful <span>Ivangorod fortress</span> opposite Narva <span>.</span>  And in May 1558, Moscow troops captured the city. </p><p>  However, the Russians did not like the access to the Baltic Sea by the Swedes, who had already captured Narva in 1581.  A new attempt to recapture the city was made only by Peter the Great, having begun the Northern War in 1700.  After 4 years, Russian troops again occupied the city on Narva. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Estonian cities" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1113281.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over time, Narva loses its once-important strategic importance.  In the middle of the 19th century, the Krenholm manufactory appeared here, which turned the city into a large textile center of the Russian Empire.  During the revolutionary events of 1917, the inhabitants of Narva achieved the accession of their city to the Estland province.  At the end of World War I, the settlement was already part of Estonia. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the city was badly damaged by the bombing of Soviet aircraft.  In July 1944, Narva was occupied by the Red Army.  After the collapse of the USSR, it again became part of independent Estonia, although there were initiatives in the region to create the so-called Narva Autonomous Republic here. </p><h2>  Narva (Estonia): the main attractions of the city </h2><p>  In small Narva, several dozens of historical and architectural monuments have been preserved.  Among them, the most interesting and significant are: </p><ul><li>  <span>Narva Castle</span> and city fortifications (bastions). </li><li>  City Hall. </li><li>  Alexander Church. </li><li>  Resurrection Cathedral. </li><li>  The complex of constructions of the Krenholm manufactory. </li><li>  Apartment buildings of the 17th century on Koidula street. </li><li>  Krenholm hospital in the neo-Gothic style. </li><li>  Monument "Swedish Lion" and others. </li></ul><p>  What else is interesting in Narva?  The most valuable attraction is the medieval castle of Herman, founded in the 13th century.  It is located on the banks of the river, proudly rising above the ancient city.  Today, the castle is thoroughly restored, and it houses a historical museum.  The city defenses of Narva have survived to our days - eight stone bastions have survived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Narva on the map" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1112760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The second most popular monument is <span>the town hall,</span> built back in 1669.  The building in the style of Dutch classicism with an elegant tower in the center looks very colorful in the Estonian town. </p><p>  In Narva, you can also see two ancient religious buildings.  <span>This is a Lutheran</span> church, built in 1884 in memory of Emperor Alexander II, as well as the Orthodox Resurrection Cathedral.  The decoration of the latter is a huge carved gilded iconostasis that perfectly harmonizes with the interior of the temple. </p><h2>  Life on the edge of the EU: interesting facts about Narva </h2><p>  Some interesting facts about the bordering Estonian city: </p><ul><li>  80% of the urban population are Russians; </li><li>  only 4-5% of the population speaks Estonian in Narva; </li><li>  the distance from Narva to St. Petersburg is less than from Narva to Tallinn; </li><li>  Soviet troops in 1944 met only two native inhabitants of Narva; </li><li>  there is not a single battle or war in Estonian national history that is not related to this city; </li><li>  about 9% of the inhabitants of Narva are carriers of the HIV virus; </li><li>  Krenholm Island, which is located in the channel of the Narva River, is the easternmost point of Estonia. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Finally... </h2><p>  The third most populated city in its country is Narva.  Estonia is one of the most sparsely populated countries in Europe, so this fact is not at all surprising.  It is located in its extreme east, on the left bank of the river of the same name.  The city has a rich and eventful history, as well as a number of interesting architectural attractions. </p>
