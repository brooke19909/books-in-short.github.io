Even just reading about it in the media, you will want to buy a tour and urgently go for a visa. </p><h2>  Geographic location </h2>

    <p>  Miniature Denmark is located partly on <span>the Jutland peninsula</span> and several islands such as Zealand, Funen, Falster and others.  Denmark is washed by the cold waters of the North and <span>Baltic Seas.</span>  It has a land border only with Germany.  The <span>Skagerrak,</span> Kattegat and √ñresund <span>straits</span> separate the state from Norway and Sweden. </p><h2>  How to get into the country </h2><p>  Denmark, whose attractions annually attract more and more tourists from all over the world, is worth it in advance to get a visa.  True, this should not be a problem.  On the territory of Russia there are several visa centers in major cities, such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Kazan, Samara, Krasnoyarsk, Krasnodar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Public transport </h2>

    <p>  The movement of public transport is organized as follows: buses and the metro start moving on weekdays from 5.00 in the morning (Sunday from 6.00) and work until midnight. </p><p>  Everyone who visits the country will agree that the features of Denmark are to make the life of any person easier and more comfortable.  And here is another example: even at night, special buses run at intervals of half an hour.  They can be reached in any district of the city and suburbs.  We should be like that, right?  By the way, it‚Äôs very convenient that the same tickets are valid in all types of transport.  Although, of course, you can take a taxi if you wish.  It is in every city.  The prices are European, so if you do not have a sufficiently large amount of money, you should still try to use public transport services. </p><h2>  Denmark ... Sights you must not miss </h2>

Small towns with gingerbread houses and cobblestone pavements;  medieval castles and paradise gardens - all this is more like illustrations for fairy tales read in childhood.  It is not surprising that it was on this island in the city of Odense that one of the most beloved storytellers in the world, Hans Christian Andersen, was born.  By the way, fans of his talent can visit the museum, open in the writer's house. </p><p>  New Harbor, or Nyhavn, - by the name itself it is clear that this is a marina.  But not ordinary: old ships are collected here.  Such a sight will impress both adults and children who love stories about sea adventures and pirates.  And on the promenade are cafes, bars, restaurants, where it is so nice to sit and enjoy the surrounding beauty. </p><p>  Denmark on the world map is a very modest state.  However <span>, Kronborg Castle is</span> known all over the world thanks to the immortal work of Shakespeare "Hamlet".  It seems that time has stopped here, and if you look closely, in the halls you will see the silhouettes of the inhabitants of the castle.  You cannot remain indifferent to this place, here you can see with your own eyes what is often shown in the cinema.  Tall walls, a folding bridge, a moat, huge halls, royal chambers, luxurious furniture ... It is worth coming to Denmark just to get to Kronborg. </p><h2>  Country through the eyes of children </h2>

We can say with confidence that a trip here will impress the most fastidious child.  In this country, it is difficult for an adult to remain calm and not exclaim endlessly: ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù </p><p>  A curious and all-knowing young tourist will be interested in visiting the Danfoss Universe experimental science park.  As conceived by the authors, more than a hundred exhibits have been collected here that help children in the form of a game recognize and study the complex chemical and physical laws of the world around them.  To get answers to the most tricky questions, it is not necessary to look into the textbooks - it is more efficient to learn them from your own experience.  Denmark, the sights of which will not leave anyone indifferent, even knows how to make a loser love science! </p><p>  Which kid or even a teenager does not like an amusement park?  The largest in Jutland park Sommerland Syd is located in this country.  This is not even a park, but a whole country with endless attractions, entertainments and games.  Live King Kong, pirates and ships await small tourists.  Riding on a moon rover is simply breathtaking.  Spending time is better with the whole family - no one will be bored.  If desired, you can visit the local water park with breathtaking slides and pools.  The doors of numerous cafes and bars are always open for hungry and tired park visitors. </p><p>  The Zoo in Copenhagen is the place where you must bring your child.  It presents several thousand species of animals and birds from around the world.  The most sociable and non-aggressive of them, such as flamingos, can be admired in open-air cages.  Colorful tropical birds occupy the whole pavilion, and this is a fantastic sight.  Here you can see charming penguins who are not averse to chatting with visitors.  But what Copenhagen Zoo is proud of is a huge <span>collection of butterflies.</span>  <span>Butterflies of</span> all colors and sizes fly around the pavilion, drink nectar from flowers and rest on leaves, to the indescribable delight of the audience. </p><p>  It will be no less interesting to wander around the huge aquarium and get acquainted with the life of the inhabitants of the river and sea depths. </p>

    <p>  Denmark ... Copenhagen ... Sights ... All this, of course, is great, but acquaintance with the country will not take place if you do not try local delicacies.  Danes are well-known gourmets, they prefer hearty, healthy and environmentally friendly food.  A variety of spices are used in cooking.  Even the wine that is traditionally served at Christmas is generously seasoned with spices.  But a special delight in Denmark awaits the sweet tooth.  Baking in this country has an amazing taste.  Every native has favorite pastries and buns. </p><h2>  Features of local shopping </h2><p>  In Denmark, shops are open on weekdays from 9.00 to 17.00, on Saturdays from 9.00 to 14.00.  Sunday at almost all retail outlets is a day off, with the exception of specialized shops for tourists. </p><p>  As souvenirs from this country, you can bring magnificent handmade silver jewelry, exclusive glass and porcelain items.  Prices, of course, cannot be called low, because value- <span>added tax</span> (25%) is included in the price of goods.  But for tourists from countries outside the European Union, there is an opportunity to return 20% of the purchase price when leaving Denmark.  This is possible provided that the products were purchased at least DKK 300 and upon presentation of a passport and sales receipt. </p><h2>  The history of the Danish flag </h2><p>  In fact, this is an amazing country - Denmark ... Photos, sights and rave reviews from experienced travelers can help to make an overview of it.  But a close acquaintance begins exactly when you begin to delve into the details.  For example, few people know about the flag of the state.  Residents of the country call their flag Dannebrog ("painted canvas"), it traces its history to 1219.  And about how the main symbol of the state appeared in Denmark, there is a whole legend.  She says that he fell from the sky onto the battlefield, during the battle of the Danes with the pagans who attacked them.  The red background of the flag symbolizes the battle itself, and the white cross should remind of the sky as the source of its appearance. </p><h2>  Little-known but interesting facts </h2>
