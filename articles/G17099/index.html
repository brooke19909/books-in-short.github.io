    <p>  The first release of the application took place in 2013.  This cross-platform messenger was launched initially on iOS devices.  When the "apple" owners began to tell others about this software, it became clear that a version for Android would soon appear. </p><p>  The author of the messenger was the notorious <span>Pavel Durov, the</span> founder of the social network "Vkontakte". </p><h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  Interestingly, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such software appeared in 2011.  Then Durov had problems.  The commandos have repeatedly come to him.  After one such visit, Paul wrote to his brother.  It was then that he realized that there was no security in his correspondence. </p><p>  As a result, the encryption of Nicholas, brother Paul, came in handy for a new project.  "Telegram", which was previously only an experiment, received special coding, which does not allow anyone to obtain personal user data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Technology </h2><p>  To understand how to find the right channel in the "Telegram", it is important to know the technology by which messaging works.  The MTProto protocol has several types of encryption.  In the process of authorization and authentication, several algorithms are activated.  When a message is sent, it is encrypted with a special key that is known only to the server client.  For reliability, cryptographic hash algorithms are used. </p>

    <p>  If you use secret chat, the message key is known to the sender and recipient.  The text in this case is not decrypted by the server, but remains on the devices of the addressee and addressee. </p><h2>  Channels </h2><p>  This is one of the features of this messenger.  Many are trying to figure out how to find a channel in Telegram.  Why is this feature so attractive to users? </p><p>  The fact is that the introduction of channels in this software was an opening for many.  Previously, such a function has not been seen anywhere.  <span>This Telegram</span> was able to stand out among competitors and attract a large audience. </p><p>  A channel is a public communication tool.  This is a kind of monologue, which is observed by a large number of subscribers.  An author or group of authors can share information with the audience, minimizing the distance between the addressee and the addressee.  In addition, channel owners are free to remain anonymous. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Unlike all available public channels on other social networks, Telegram posts are sorted by publication time, not by user engagement. </p>

    <p>  Or, as an option, you can simply send a name so that a friend by name finds the right channel. </p><h2>  Search </h2><p>  Well, finally, "Google to help us."  Here you can enter various queries of interest.  So you will definitely learn how to find the channel in the "Telegram".  The only thing is that this method is not convenient for everyone. </p><p>  If you are looking for chat from a PC, you will have to consider some features.  Having found the desired channel, you will be prompted to click on the link.  After that, a notification appears about the transition to the computer version of Telegram.  But not everyone installs this program on a PC. </p><p>  To open this link on your phone, you can send it to your personal messages on a social network or send it to a notebook over the cloud.  After you need to open it through your smartphone.  You will be automatically transferred to the desired chat. </p><h2>  Social network </h2><p>  Although the catalog has already been mentioned, it is worth mentioning separately about the public pages of Vkontakte.  There are already a lot of them.  Look for the most ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù.  You can find hundreds of links to different channels in them.  Owners of such chats are specially thrown off.  That is, it is a kind of online platform for free ads. </p>
