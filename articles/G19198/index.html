Methanol poisoning: symptoms and treatment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely more than once, each of us has heard about mass poisoning by <span>counterfeit alcohol products</span> (up to death), in which methanol was found.  What is it and why is its effect on the body so detrimental?  Why is it added to alcohol?  What could be the consequences of taking such products?  To answer these questions, it is necessary to turn to the history of alcohol production, to its distribution in the fields of human activity, and to clinical research. </p><h2>  Methanol </h2><p>  Methanol, a colorless poisonous liquid, is the simplest monohydric alcohol and the first representative of the homologous series of monohydric alcohols.  Also in scientific circles, it is referred to as wood or methyl alcohol, carbinol or methyl hydroxide.  The liquid is obtained by distillation of wood or lignin - a complex substance, the remains of the stiffened walls of plant cells.  In laboratory conditions, the synthesis of methanol consists in the incomplete oxidation of methane, as well as by replication of methane through methyl chloride. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methanol what is it" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695966.jpg" width="600"></div>  This monohydric alcohol was first discovered in 1661 by Boyle during the distillation of dry wood.  Two centuries later, the scientists J.B.  Dumas and E. M. Peligo were able to obtain methanol in its pure form.  Synthesis of alcohol on an industrial scale began in 1923 in Germany.  In everyday life, methanol is used as a solvent, the basis for antifreeze, fuel and octane additives to gasoline.

The ingestion of only 10 ml of this substance into the human body can lead to irreversible pathological changes: blindness, impaired functioning of internal organs (kidneys, liver), damage to brain regions.  Death occurs if methanol enters the body in an amount of 1-2 grams per 1 kilogram of weight.  What is it and why is such a small amount of substance capable of killing a person? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acid methanol" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695962.jpg" width="600"></div>  The thing is that when it enters the body, monohydric alcohol oxidizes to formaldehyde - a potent poison that affects the nervous system and reacts with proteins.  In addition, the toxic effect does not occur immediately after the substance enters the bloodstream, but several hours later.  Therefore, before the first symptoms of poisoning appear, a person usually manages to drink a lethal dose.

    <h2>  Methanol hazard </h2><p>  The main danger of the substance is that methanol and ethanol (the main component of alcohol production) cannot be distinguished: they have the same taste and smell, both represent a colorless liquid.  However, the cost of methanol is much lower ( <span>from 15500 rubles per ton</span> ).  For these reasons, they are often diluted with alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methanol poisoning" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695964.jpg" width="600"></div>  Another hazard of the substance is that poisoning can occur as a result of the use of products containing methanol.  What is it and how is it going?  Vapors of <span>antifreeze,</span> glass washing <span>liquids</span> , paints and varnishes contain alcohol atoms, which, entering the body, accumulate and cause pathological changes.  Therefore, it can be poisoned not only by an alcoholic, as is commonly believed in our country, but also by a user of poor-quality goods.

First of all, the central nervous system suffers: excessive sensitivity to light (photophobia), dilated pupils, headache, dizziness and poor general well-being, decreased sensitivity, blurred consciousness. </p><p>  <span>Methanol poisoning is</span> especially dangerous due to hyperemia, or an increase in the amount of blood in tissues and organs, which occurs due to a sharp increase in the level of red blood cells and hemoglobin.  As a result, the body swells, acquires a bluish tint.  The growth of the pathological process introduces the patient into a coma due to cerebral edema. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methanol at home" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695975.jpg" width="600"></div>  Hyperemia leads to disruption of the respiratory system - breathing becomes deep and ineffective, the victim has a feeling of lack of air.  Along with this, the pulse decreases, the heart does not cope with the "distillation" of a large amount of blood throughout the body and as a result fails.  Death is coming.

    <h2>  First aid for poisoning </h2><p>  If the first signs of poisoning are detected, an ambulance should be called immediately.  If this is not possible, then the amount of fluid consumed should be increased.  It is advisable to drink beverages containing alkali: mineral water, a solution of citric acid, as well as consume tomatoes, bananas, raisins, grapes, asparagus, honey and other products. </p><p>  In clinical conditions, methanol poisoning is treated by introducing ethanol into the body.  If you are not sure that methanol is the main poisonous substance, you should refuse to use vodka as an antidote.  Abundant gastric lavage, artificially induced vomiting, can save a person's life. </p><h2>  Horrific statistics </h2><p>  In recent history, humanity has recorded seven cases of mass methanol poisoning.  The largest number of people suffered in July 1981 in India - 308 people died from poisoning.  In 2000, the El Salvador authorities suspected a terrorist attack, because 122 people died as a result of drinking alcohol from methanol poisoning.  It is noteworthy that this substance was not found in any of the manufacturers of alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methanol synthesis" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695977.jpg" width="500"></div>  In Russia, mass poisoning was recorded in December 2016 as a result of the use of ‚ÄúHawthorn‚Äù - bath liquid, in which methanol was later discovered.  What it is and how the authorities allowed this to happen is unknown.  But as a result of the poisoning, 123 people were injured, of whom 76 died.  December 20 was declared a day of mourning in the Irkutsk region.

    <h2>  Methanol use </h2><p>  The greatest amount of methanol is used to obtain paints and varnishes.  It is used as a solvent due to its high volatility and ability to <span>dissolve organic</span> and polymeric substances.  In European countries, a mixture of methyl and ethyl alcohols is used in perfumes.  But in Russia, such products are banned, like any other consumer product with methanol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methanol and ethanol" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1695965.jpg" width="425"></div>  Due to the high octane rating, some ‚Äúmasters‚Äù use methanol at home to produce high-octane fuel.  On an industrial scale, alcohol is used to produce biofuels.

    <p>  In nature, methyl alcohol is extremely rare and in small quantities.  These are mainly jasmine and gaulteria essential oils.  The composition of these oils includes anthranilic and salicylic acid.  Methanol in their composition is not dangerous to humans.  However, it can cause an allergic reaction.  Therefore, excessive enthusiasm for oils can adversely affect well-being. </p>
