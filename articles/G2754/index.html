    <h2>  Treatment center </h2><p>  The medical building is one of the pearls for which the Crimean Dawns hotel, Alushta, is famous for.  Reviews about him on the Internet are enthusiastic, and for good reason: travelers from all over the country and neighboring republics come here to strengthen immunity. </p><p>  The center specializes in the treatment of respiratory organs, as well as in the healing of people living in disadvantaged areas.  In the Crimean health resort there are four types of programs: "Lungs-bronchi", "Antistress", "Beauty and Health" and help to restore the body after diseases of the peripheral veins, arteries and lymphatic system.  Each program is selected taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient. </p><p>  Doctors who work in a boarding house use both traditional and non-traditional methods of treatment.  The rooms are equipped with the latest medical equipment, which allows to achieve the maximum effect.  There is a physiotherapy room, inhalation, phytobar, aromatherapy.  The hydrotherapy cabinet is also very popular, where there are different types of showers (hydrolaser, circular, massage, Charcot's shower) and hydromassage baths.  Vacationers can improve their health in the salt cave. </p><p>  Particular attention is required to the golden section pyramid, already mentioned earlier.  It is believed that it concentrates the energy of space, which contributes to the creation of an ion column.  According to doctors, its effect extends to the entire territory of the medical center and helps to strengthen the immunity of patients, as well as remove toxins from the body.  Believe it or not, it's up to you to decide, but in any case it‚Äôs hard to conclude without having experienced it for yourself. </p><p>  Notice!  In order to become a patient in a boarding house treatment center, you need to bring a spa card with you.  If you are traveling with a child and plan to carry out procedures for him, you will also need a card for your child.  If you don‚Äôt have it or if you stayed at home, but you really need it or just want it, you can arrange it in the boarding house itself, but at an additional cost. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  The pool with the purest mountain water, baths - Roman and Finnish with a font - a solarium, a gym, billiards, two two-level conference rooms, an excursion bureau, parking, the Seventh Heaven restaurant with magnificent views of the sea and mountains, the Miller's Bar - All this will be provided for you by the Crimean Dawns boarding house located on the Crimea (Alushta) peninsula.  Reviews about it fix the European quality and a decent level of services provided. </p>
