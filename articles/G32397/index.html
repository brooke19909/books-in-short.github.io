Tablet Repair</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Damage to your favorite gadget, whether it‚Äôs a smartphone, tablet or phablet, is one of the most unpleasant tests for a modern person.  It is not so important whether the warranty covers a specific malfunction - the time spent waiting for the device to return to life is sometimes a pity almost more than money for repairs.  However, such an insidious type of failure, such as screen cracks, is not subject to warranty repair. </p><p>  One inaccurate movement - and now the unlucky user in a panic runs around the repair shops, and when he finds out how much it costs to replace the screen on the tablet, he becomes discouraged.  Each workshop can evaluate the amount of work in different ways, or even wind up the cost of repairs, so before you give money thoughtlessly, it is worth exploring the issue as carefully as possible.  What to do if the tablet screen does not work?  Replacement and repair - how much will the forced procedures cost?  The answers to these questions depend on the type of breakdown. </p><h2>  Warranty Failures </h2><p>  Each <span>warranty card</span> on the tablet has a note that, if mechanical damage is found, such as impact marks, cracks, chips and backlash, free repair is not possible.  If the wizard does not detect such damage, replacing the tablet‚Äôs display screen will be free of charge.  For example, high screen sensitivity, display problems or display failure, which appeared for no apparent reason, are the basis for warranty repairs.  Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that the repair time may stretch for a month, or even one and a half - often spare parts for tablets are ordered from abroad.  The average warranty repair period is 2-3 weeks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a screen replacement on a tablet cost" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39511/1097943.jpg" width="400"></div>

Having seen cracks or chips on the screen, the engineer of the manufacturer‚Äôs company or his representative office will write out the denial of service.  Replacing the screen and touchscreen of the touch glass of the tablet in this case becomes a paid procedure.  Masters are far from always able to name the price offhand - it depends not only on the make and model of the device, but also on the complexity of the work, as well as on the need to order parts in local markets, in the capital or abroad.  Provided that the necessary parts are available in the workshop, the repair of cracked glass can reach 4000 rubles, and if necessary, a separate order will have to be paid out from 7000 rubles.  Also, in almost any repair service, the diagnostic procedure is also paid - at least 500 rubles are usually asked for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the glass on the tablet cracked" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1098307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Terms of repair </h2><p>  When the glass on the <span>tablet</span> cracked <span>, how much the</span> replacement <span>costs</span> is not the only question that the master should ask.  Be sure to clarify the timing of repairs.  The above amounts mainly relate to urgent repair (within two to three days after treatment, including diagnosis), while periods of a week or longer suggest a significant reduction in price.  True, this does not apply to cases where parts need to be ordered abroad.  The master should warn about this need immediately after the diagnosis. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet display screen replacement" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1098308.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is necessary to interview the master in detail for what reason he called this or that figure. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the masters promise to call and report the results of diagnostics or repair, the call will most likely have to be carried out independently.  Also, if repairs last for a week, it is recommended to control the process - the customer has every right to do so. </li><li>  A careful reading of the contract or other document confirming the delivery of the tablet for diagnosis or repair will help in some cases save the time and money of the customer - the repairman at the first opportunity will refer to the contract, the contents of which often do not meet the approximate expectations of the client. </li><li>  The cost of repair should not increase after the master voiced the answer to the question of how much it costs to replace a screen on a tablet.  All <span>unforeseen expenses</span> should remain under his responsibility.  If you have any doubts about the decency of the wizard, you can take a receipt from him that the amount has been set and will remain unchanged until the device is issued to the customer. </li></ol><h2>  Is it worth saving on repairs? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that there is a high probability of overpaying for fixing the tablet, this issue has a downside - excessive savings can also lead to sad consequences.  Often, how much it costs to replace a screen on a tablet, device owners do not ask professionals, but friends who have ever mentioned in a conversation that they have the skills to fix such a technique.  Such friends in a friendly way offer to repair the tablet at an incredibly low price, which, of course, sounds very attractive.  However, if in fact a friend turned out to be a wizard, the device cannot be repaired even for money in any service.  When taking such a risk, you should be aware that the avaricious pays twice, or even three times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Replacing the screen and touchscreen of the touch glass of the tablet" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39511/1097979.jpg" width="558"></div>

    <h2>  How to protect yourself from the consequences of handicraft repairs </h2><p>  Even if a friend is really officially engaged in the repair of gadgets, it is worthwhile to conclude an agreement with him or take a receipt, which will indicate the brand and model of the tablet, the date the device was received for repair and its condition during transfer.  It will also be useful to photograph the gadget from all angles.  In the event of a final damage to the device, if all the evidence is available from the master, you can recover the cost of repair or even the device itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does it cost to replace the glass in the tablet" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1098321.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  Repair of budget tablets </h2><p>  Budget tablets, that is, devices priced below 10 thousand rubles, can be divided into three types - tablets from mobile operators, surrogate Chinese ‚Äútablets‚Äù and officially recognized <span>budget tablets.</span>  Only the last type of gadget, if you do not want to buy a new one, makes sense to carry in repair.  When buying surrogates, you should remember that it will be impossible to resell such a tablet through online platforms, as well as to repair it.  In order not to fall into such a situation, it is worthwhile to make sure before buying that the claimed brand has an official representative office in the city of the buyer's residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if the tablet screen does not work replacement and repair" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39511/1097981.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  Tablets from mobile operators generally cost no more than five thousand rubles;  the amount of repair of such a device will ultimately be higher than its own cost.  They rarely amaze with quality - the tablet needs repair already in the third or fourth month of use, but most often the waste of money is inappropriate.  How much does it cost to replace glass in a tablet with an officially recognized brand of a budget class, you should ask a consultant before buying or contact the representative office of the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Important to remember! </h2><p>  Summarizing all of the above, it is worth emphasizing that blind trust in gadget sellers and repair service employees can play a trick on the buyer.  Do not be shy to ask questions - the answers received will save large amounts of money, kilometers of nerve cells and an uncountable amount of time.  However, do not forget about care and caution when using the device - this approach best helps to avoid unforeseen expenses.  Saving on a case and protective film is the first step to much more serious costs.  Responsible attitude to the necessary and beloved things is the key to their longevity and smooth operation. </p>
