This is a common question.  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  33% of adult Russians give out pocket money to children regularly, and 29% - only occasionally.  These are the data of a survey conducted by the analytical center in the spring of 2015. The data is based on information received from 1,600 parents.  81% of children receive cash in cash.  The survey involved children from 7 to 17 years old. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card for baby" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136081.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Children do not know about cards </h2><p>  Considering the statistics obtained, it is not surprising that the children are completely unaware of what a bank card is and what to do with it.  Children under the age of 12, according to the analytical center, quite often confuse debit cards with discount and gift cards.  In adolescence, children already understand the purpose of the cards, but they do not distinguish between their types, payment systems and the banks that issued them.  The study also showed that children quite often inherit their parents' distrustful attitude to "plastic." </p><h2>  Own plastic cards </h2><p>  Many parents think about what to teach their child some financial independence from school.  To this end, many banks offer to open their own plastic cards for children.  One of the most popular such offers is a card for a child from Sberbank.  You can open it in any department after filling out the application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A children's card is issued to a child from 7 years old to 14. In adolescence, a person has the right to open the card on his own.  In this regard, the cards are divided into primary and secondary.  Children's or additional cards are tied to the account of one of the parents, regardless of whether it is debit or credit. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail <span>what a card is</span> for a child in Sberbank. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card for a child" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136050.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits of Baby Cards </h2><p>  If it is reasonable to approach the issue of its design, then we can conclude that more need for it is present in parents than in children. </p><p>  The main advantages of a bank card for a child are: </p><p>  1. Having cash in your pocket is quite dangerous even for adults, not to mention children.  It is in adolescents that pocket money is most often stolen.  If the child has a card instead of cash, even with the loss of plastic, he will not lose money. </p><p>  2. If you give cash to a child for pocket expenses, it is not possible to control where he spends it.  A Sberbank plastic card for a child will help in this matter, as it can be used to track all operations performed on it.  An additional children's card is always attached to the parent primary.  Thus, when a child makes purchases using a card, an SMS alert is sent to the parent's phone.  At the same time, you can find out not only the amount spent, but also the specific purchases that were made by the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  3. If, for certain circumstances, the youngest member of the family is far from home, parents can replenish their card at any time.  This can be done both through a bank branch and through online banking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bank card for children under 14 years old" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136051.jpg"></div>

    <p>  4. A Sberbank card for a child is a sign of adulthood.  Thus, you can gradually accustom your daughter or son to manage your own finances. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The disadvantages of a children's bank card are: </p><p>  1. The child loses the perception of real cash, because they are not in front of his eyes, but lie on the bank account.  For this reason, it can be difficult for him to manage and spend finances wisely. </p><p>  2. Children tend to share information with outsiders due to inexperience and young age.  The transfer of data on the card can lead to loss of funds not only of the additional card, but also the main one. </p>

    <p>  3. Due to carelessness and mobility, children often lose or damage their cards. </p><p>  For these reasons, before you give a bank card for a child, you should teach him how to use it correctly.  This will make it possible to avoid the troubles associated with excessive and unreasonable expenses, as well as the handling of plastic. </p><h2>  Description of a children's card from Sberbank </h2><p>  It was mentioned above that a children's card is issued as an additional to the parent.  The card is presented in two versions of payment systems, it can be "Visa" or "MasterCard".  The validity period of the child card is identical to the term of the parent.  A feature of a bank card for children under 14 years old is the ability to store not only rubles, but also other currencies, namely, euros and dollars. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the fact that the fee for its maintenance will be deducted from the account of the child, and not the parent.  How big this amount will be depends on the conditions of the main "plastic".  A feature of the children's card is the ability to set a limit on spending, and the card itself is equipped with a chip for protection. </p><p>  Not only Russian citizens, but also stateless children can get a children's card.  The main condition is considered to be older than 7 years.  The registration necessarily requires the consent of one of the parents or legal representatives of the child.  This will require a personal application of the parent with a passport and birth certificate to the bank branch.  Then, an application for a card for a child from Sberbank is filled out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plastic card for a child Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136053.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Children's card features </h2><p>  In addition to the card being serviced around the clock through the Sberbank contact center, the holder is provided with the following options: </p><p>  1. Emergency cash withdrawal in case of loss of a card during a stay abroad. </p><p>  2. Participation in the “Thanks from Sberbank” bonus program of the main card allows you to accrue and use points on the additional one. </p><p>  3. Payment for purchases by card can be made through online services. </p><p>  4. Modern 3D-secure payment protection technology makes online card transactions secure. </p><p>  This is the answer to the question of whether it is possible to make a Sberbank card for a child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to make a Sberbank card for a child" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59178/2136054.jpg"></div>
