  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interest rates on deposits in Sberbank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the great variety of banks in the financial market, it is Sberbank that is most often chosen to store their savings.  It is valued for reliability, because all deposits made by individuals are insured by the state.  However, interest <span>rates on deposits</span> do not lead among higher offers of other banks.  This does not prevent him from year to year to remain competitive and stay on the first lines in the financial market.  What conditions does Sberbank offer now? </p><h2>  Save Deposit </h2><p>  This deposit currently has an annual rate of up to 4.45%.  It is possible to open this deposit with Sberbank for a period of one to thirty-six months.  The table below shows how interest varies depending on the duration and amount of the placement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="keep interest on the deposit" class="if uuid-2447120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447120.jpg"></div><p>  The amount can be any at your discretion, but not less than 1000 rubles or 100 US dollars.  It should be noted that the deposit does not provide for the withdrawal of part of the funds or replenishment.  Interest on Sberbank deposits is credited to your account on a monthly basis, and you can choose the way of their transfer yourself.  Thus, they can remain on deposit or transferred, for example, to your card for their further use. </p><h2>  "Replenish" </h2><p>  The percentage for this type of financial product is already slightly less - up to 4.1%.  The term of the deposit can also be selected individually, but it can not be less than three months and not more than three years.  The smallest investment amount is 1000 rubles or 100 US dollars.  This deposit in Sberbank, unlike “Save”, is possible to replenish.  If you make a cash deposit, then the minimum replenishment equivalent will be one thousand rubles or one hundred dollars.  It is more convenient to make such an operation by bank transfer, so you can deposit even one ruble into your account.  The number of replenishment is not limited.  The deposit is also automatically renewed, and interest is credited to the account monthly with the possibility of capitalization.  The table shows the dependence of interest on the amount and term of the deposit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="replenish deposit" class="if uuid-2447135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447135.jpg"></div><h2>  "Manage" </h2><p>  The maximum rate on this deposit at Sberbank is currently 3.8% per annum.  This deposit is convenient in that you can safely manage your finances yourself, while receiving additional income, but with the condition that you should always have 30,000 rubles or 1,000 US dollars in your account.  The term of the deposit is from three months to three years.  Withdrawal of funds and replenishment is provided for: cash in the bank's offices from 1000 rubles and $ 100, non-cash contributions are not limited.  When you withdraw funds to the minimum threshold, that is, up to 30,000 rubles, you do not lose previously accrued interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contribute manage" class="if uuid-2447142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447142.jpg"></div><h2>  Online deposits </h2><p>  To get the maximum interest rates on deposits with Sberbank, you just need to open your deposit via the Internet.  However, this option is suitable only for holders of deposit cards of this bank.  The scale of the organization is so huge that almost everyone has a Sberbank plastic card for receiving a salary or pension, so you can perform this operation at home in a relaxed atmosphere from a computer or smartphone without imposing unnecessary services from office managers on you.  Moreover, you are always aware of what is happening on your account, and you can easily manage it.  The same deposits were offered for registration in your personal online account: “Save”, “Replenish” and “Manage”, but with a slightly higher interest rate - up to 0.35% than when opening in the bank office. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Deposits for big finances </h2><p>  For a separate category of its customers with the Premier and Pervy financial services package, the bank offers a higher percentage on deposits.  For depositors who want to guarantee a steady income, the “Special Save” product is suitable with a rate of up to 4.9% (up to 2% in dollars), in the amount of 700,000 rubles or 50,000 US dollars, for a period of one month to three years, without the possibility adding funds and their partial withdrawal.  For customers who prefer to save money, there is a “Special Replenish” deposit with a replenishment function and income up to 4.45% per annum (up to 1.8% in dollars).  The deposit amount is from 700,000 rubles, the storage period is from 3 months to 3 years.  The same conditions apply for the “Special Manage” deposit, but with the ability to freely manage your funds and an annual rate of up to 4.15% (up to 1.45% in dollars).  Deposits can be opened both in the personal account of Sberbank Online, and with your personal manager in special offices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="graetnewsnetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Prime" class="if uuid-2447146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447146.jpg"></div><h2>  "Gift a life" </h2><p>  This species is a special product.  Sberbank created these deposits of individuals in rubles to help children with cancer and other serious illnesses.  0.3% per annum of the deposit amount is donated every three months to the Give Life charity fund.  This organization was created back in 2006 by actresses Chulpan Khamatova and Dina Korzun.  Having invested your money in this way, you will not only make a profit, but also, importantly, help seriously ill children.  The interest rate for today is 4.15%.  You can open it only in rubles for the amount of 10,000 and for a period of one year.  This deposit at Sberbank is not intended for partial withdrawal of funds or replenishment. </p><h2>  "Social" </h2><p>  Such an account is issued only for children in care.  This deposit in Sberbank in the name of the child can be drawn up by his legal representative.  It is necessary for this to provide an act from the guardianship authority.  The interest rate is set at 3.35% per annum, the deposit term is 3 years.  The number of renewals is not limited, but it will be renewed up to 18 years at 3.35%, and after a child reaches this age - at the deposit rate “Demand”, that is, at 0.01%.  Partial withdrawal and replenishment is provided for any amount, the minimum account balance should not fall below one ruble.  In foreign currency, such a deposit cannot be opened.  Interest is accrued on a quarterly basis, they can be withdrawn or left for capitalization, which is also provided for this deposit. </p><h2>  Retirement deposits </h2><p>  Sberbank <span>deposits for pensioners</span> have the following conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iamexpat.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pension contribution" class="if uuid-2447152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447152.jpg"></div><p>  These are the same “Save” and “Replenish” deposits, the only difference is that for citizens of retirement age the maximum interest rate is set for the period they choose, regardless of the amount of the account opened.  In this case, no additional supporting documents are needed, just a passport is enough.  The program automatically offers an increased percentage for deposits of individuals of pensioners in Sberbank.  Moreover, for this category of citizens, the bank proposes to open a special account or a social card to receive pension payments with interest on the remaining cash funds.  The annual percentage is 3.5%, accrual occurs every three months, while there are no restrictive conditions for the use of funds.  It is also convenient that, without resorting to a notary public, you can draw up a power of attorney or draw up a testament directly in the office. </p><h2>  Holiday offer </h2><p>  Each year, on the eve of the Great Victory Day, by May 9, the bank develops a deposit with special conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jungleworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contribution by may 9" class="if uuid-2447159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447159.jpg"></div><p>  This year, until the end of May, you can open a deposit “I Remember.  I help. "  0.5% of the amount of interest received in your account will be transferred to the charity fund for support of veterans “Memory of generations”.  The proposed term is 6 or 10 months, the minimum amount for opening a deposit is 100,000 rubles.  Withdrawal and replenishment of the account are not provided.  When opening a deposit from 100 to 500 thousand Russian rubles, the interest rate will be 5.50% per annum, from 500 thousand to 1 million rubles - 5.75%, with a deposit amount of 1 million rubles - 6%.  Interest is accrued at the end of the term. </p><h2>  Prolongation </h2><p>  Deposits are automatically prolonged for the selected term at the rate valid at that moment in the bank.  Many people sometimes have a misunderstanding of what this means, so let's look at an example.  Suppose, on January 5, 2017, you opened a Save deposit for a year at 5% and did not close it after the allotted time.  But for the year, the rate, for example, fell to 4%.  What will happen to your deposit?  Your funds also lie at 5% per annum, but on January 5, 2018, the deposit is renewed automatically and already at the current 4% rate.  The number of prolongations on the above deposits is not limited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneysense.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accumulation of funds" class="if uuid-2447153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73868/2447153.jpg"></div><h2>  Early termination of the contract </h2><p>  A situation can always arise when you suddenly need your money before the contract expires.  It’s not worth worrying in this case, you can always pick up your originally invested amount.  As for interest on deposits, Sberbank created the following conditions for such cases.  For deposits up to 6 months in case of early termination, 0.01% per annum is charged. </p><p>  For deposits with a storage condition of more than six months: if you withdraw funds within the first 6 months, 0.01% is also charged. </p><p>  If the amount has been tracked already for half a year or more, then upon termination 2/3 of the rate established on the date of opening of the deposit you have selected is charged. </p><p>  It should be noted that in case of early closure of individuals' deposits, Sberbank recounts interest without taking into account their capitalization. </p>
