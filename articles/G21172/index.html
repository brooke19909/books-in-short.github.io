The population is only about eight thousand people.  This city has always attracted a large number of tourists, as it is famous for its castle, built by the Templars in the late XIII - early XIV centuries.  For some time there lived the antipope Benedict XIII, who ruled during the years of the Great Western schism in Avignon.  It was in this city, where he fled after the Constantine Council of 1415, that he had his own court, which not a single state recognized.  So in ancient Peniscola there is always something to see. </p><h2>  About city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peniscola city in Spain" class="if uuid-2951786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951786.jpg"></div><p>  Peniscola in Spain, according to the locals themselves, is one of the mainstays of classic Valencian cuisine.

Hotels located in close proximity to both the sea and the city center cost from about a hundred euros per night. </p><p>  You can rent a chalet or a private cottage in the coastal area for 220-250 euros (16,500-18,700 rubles).

The fishing past of this town was directly reflected in the list of dishes that visitors offer to taste here.  They are especially proud of local fish and other seafood, which are always abundant in local establishments.  As a rule, they are prepared with vegetables and rice, which are collected from local gardens, so that all products are natural, environmentally friendly. </p><p>  Experienced travelers are advised to definitely try a dish of sea eel and potatoes with spices and a variety of vegetables, called ‚Äúai and pebra,‚Äù as well as fish stew with a light fragrant sauce, known as Valencian noodles. </p><p>  Fans of sweets should pay special attention to desserts.

First of all, this one he is famous for his castle of the Pope of the Moon.  This is an impressive fortress, which stands on the very shore of the sea.  It can be seen, perhaps, in all photos from Peniscola. </p><p>  The decision to build it was made by the Templars, they laid the fortress back in 1294.  It received its current name in honor of the worldly name of the antipope Benedict XIII.  This is a very odious religious and historical figure, who in this city was known by the name Pedro de Luna. </p><p>  When the church split took place, he fought for the right to sit on the papal throne until his death.  Most of this struggle took place right within the walls of this castle, which today has become the main attraction of Peniscola in Spain. </p><p>  You can get into it today for only 2.5 euros (180 rubles).  Tours are organized in several languages.  In summer, the castle is open to visitors from 9:30 to 21:30, and in winter it is open from 10:30 to 17:30. </p><h2>  Benedict XIII </h2><p>  Antipope Benedict is the most famous historical figure associated with this city.  This was the second and last of the Avignon popes that appeared after the Great Western schism, when two applicants to the papal throne declared themselves its owners. </p><h2>  Sightseeing tour </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peniscola Photos" class="if uuid-2951781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951781.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of Peniscola in Spain, a standard city sightseeing tour deserves attention in this medieval city.  It is organized here on a small train. </p><p>  The train runs along four routes, passing all the main attractions of Peniscola.  For example, on the coastal street the Museum of the Sea operates year-round, which contains a unique collection of exhibits on fishing, the history of the region, and marine fauna.  In the train itself you will find an audio guide in Russian.  You can buy a ticket at the bus stop by joining the tour at any time. </p><p>  If you want to get acquainted with natural attractions, then go for a rafting on the underground river flowing in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe caves of San Jose, or to the islands of Columbretes, located nearby. </p><p>  There is an amazing natural anomaly near the fishing port, which is definitely worth seeing if you are in this city.  This is Grotto Grotto or Bufador.  This is a natural fault through which distorted sounds of surging waves are heard.  If you believe the stories of local residents, with its help the sea communicates directly with them. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveldelmar.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Peniscola" class="if uuid-2951784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951784.jpg"></div><p>  You can relax on the coast on two public beaches.  They are called Playa Sur and Playa Norte.  Located in the city, in close proximity to the historic center. </p><p>  The length of the Playa Norte beach is about five and a half kilometers.  It begins in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe castle of the Pope of the Moon, and then stretches along the main walking street to the neighboring town called Benicarlo.

Its length is only about 850 meters.  It has significantly fewer tourists.  But here is the Maritime School, in which everyone can learn kayaking, rowing, windsurfing. </p><p>  Part of the beach is surrounded by the walls of the famous fortress, which gives it a particularly romantic and amazing look, and also protects from a piercing sea breeze.  There are also several small beaches that fans of snorkeling have chosen.  This is Playa del Russo, Playa de las Viudas, Playa de la Petksina. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.catalonia-valencia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peniscola Attractions" class="if uuid-2951782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951782.jpg"></div><p>  It is most convenient to travel around the city by bus.  In Peniscola, there is only one route line, so when landing it is enough to carefully read the destination written on the windshield to understand which direction the bus is moving to or from the city center. </p><p>  Interestingly, these buses run not only in the city itself, but also in two towns located nearby - Vinaros and Benicarlo.  So for just a few hundred rubles, you can explore the surrounding area. </p><p>  Please note that buses do not stop in the historic city center.  Therefore, you will have to walk or take a taxi.
