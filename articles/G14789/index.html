This word excites the ear of any fan of relaxation on the azure coast in the middle of a sandy beach. </p><p>  The sea itself is a very beautiful creation of nature.  A reservoir of this type is available in absolutely all corners of the planet.  In total, 81 such creations of nature can be found on the world map.  Knowing such diversity, it is very difficult to determine one, the most beautiful sea in the world.  However, nothing prevents to consider some of the best and most interesting reservoirs. </p><p>  Currently, there is a rating of the most beautiful seas in the world, in the first places in which are Bali, Coral, Arabian, and Andaman.  So, let us consider in more detail the features of some seas, recognized as the best in the whole world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful sea in the world" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865412.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bali </h2><p>  <span>The Bali Sea</span> is located in the Pacific Ocean.  On a geographical map it can easily be found between the islands of Java, Madura, Sumbawa and Sulawesi.  Bali often tops the lists of the most beautiful seas in the world. </p><p>  This pond is a rather unusual phenomenon of nature.  At its bottom, everything is covered not with sand, as in ordinary seas, but with volcanic sediments, which were here due to the proximity to the sea of ​​large volcanoes.  The beaches on the coast of this sea are sandy and incredibly beautiful.  Tropical vegetation characteristic of the equatorial belt grows on them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look at the sea surface of Bali from above, you get the impression that it is simply indented by numerous small islands. </p><p>  Due to the tropical climate inherent in these places, the water in the sea throughout the year remains invariably warm, and even at great depths - about 28 degrees. </p><h2>  Coral </h2><p>  Often in the ratings of wonderful places in the world, the Coral Sea occupies a leading position.  It is considered the most <span>beautiful place in the world</span> thanks to the unusual coral reefs that are at its bottom.  Undoubtedly, this fact distinguishes it from other water bodies of nature. </p><p>  You can find the Coral Sea in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Australia.  The waters of the Coral Sea are also washed by islands such as New Caledonia and New Guinea.  There are two well-known geographical features in this sea: the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. </p><p>  In the Coral Sea, there are many small islands on which a human foot has not yet set foot.  On them you can meet unusual representatives of flora and fauna. </p><p>  Local resorts organize scuba diving in the waters of the Coral Sea.  Tourists love this activity very much, as it is really fascinating: swimming between the reefs, you can admire the outlandish beauty of fish and other representatives of the underwater world that live here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful sea in the world rating" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865415.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is unusual, primarily due to its geological structure.  Under water, it is divided into two large halves using the Carlsberg Range.  It is located in the Indian Ocean, in its northern waters. </p><p>  The Arabian Sea ranks first in the ranking of the most productive seas in the world.  This is due to the great diversity of inhabitants in its depths: there are about a thousand species of fish and crustaceans. </p><p>  It is in the waters of the Arabian Sea that there are islands that attract tourists with their beauty.  One of them is the island of Astola, which is currently uninhabited.  Also here is the popular <span>island of the Maldives.</span> </p><h2>  Mediterranean </h2><p>  The Mediterranean is the only sea that includes several smaller bodies of water.  It is the most famous and is often included in the lists of the most beautiful seas in the world.  Photos of the Mediterranean Sea easily convey the purity of its waters and the <span>beauty of the underwater world.</span>  Its waters are washed by the islands of Crete and Cyprus. </p><p>  In the modern world, tourism is especially well developed near the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  Vacationers from all over the world go to the shores of this huge and warm body of water in order to spend their holidays here. </p><p>  In the abyss of water you can find a large number of unusual representatives of flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful girls in the world at sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865418.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the subtropical climate zone created a large number of recreational areas for tourists. </p><p>  In the waters of the Black Sea you can find a large number of representatives of marine flora and fauna.  However, in addition to the peace-loving marine inhabitants, there are also those that are dangerous to human life - stingrays and Sea dragons, but they can be found only at great depths. </p><h2>  White </h2><p>  The most beautiful and cleanest sea in the world is the White Sea, which is inland and located on the territory of modern Russia.  Its waters are very clean, but the climate is quite cold, which is why there are no resort areas on the coast of this sea. </p><p>  The peculiarity of the White Sea is that it has long been often mentioned in the legends of Scandinavia, where it is known as Serako Yam. </p><p>  In the waters of the sea there are a considerable number of small islands, in the territory of which northern plants grow and animals are found that are adapted to survive in cold climatic conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful sea in the world photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865413.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Caribbean </h2><p>  When asked what the most beautiful sea in the world, many can answer that the Caribbean.  And they will be right.  This pond is not only included in the rating of the most beautiful and unusual seas of the world, but also fully justifies its presence in it. </p><p>  In history, this sea is better known as the pirate one, since ships flying black flags cruised in its waters.  On the seabed and the islands that wash its waters, many treasures are still hidden. </p><p>  In the Caribbean, the largest seismic activity has been observed recently - earthquakes and volcanic eruptions most often occur here.  However, despite this, on the shores washed by the Caribbean Sea, many tourist and recreational areas have been created, where tourists and the most beautiful girls in the world like to come. </p><p>  The sea has a tropical climate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful places in the world the sea" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865414.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Red </h2><p>  The waters of the Red Sea are washed by the shores of several countries that are located on the territory of the Arabian Peninsula and in northeastern Africa.  From the waters of the Red Sea originates the artificially created Suez Canal, which leads to the Mediterranean. </p><p>  The Red Sea is rightfully recognized as the most beautiful sea in the world, which is reflected in the relevant world ratings.

    <h2>  Dead </h2><p>  The Dead Sea is a body of water that washed the shores of Jordan and Israel.  It is a unique creation on the planet for two reasons.  Firstly, the Dead Sea is recognized as the most saline body of water on the whole planet - tourists who come to swim here have the opportunity to sunbathe literally on the salt blocks that float on its surface.  Secondly, this body of water is located at the lowest point on the planet, as it is located significantly below sea level (430 meters). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful and cleanest sea in the world" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/1865417.jpg" width="600"></div>
