Gradually, among small <span>appanage principalities</span> , a struggle for primacy and the creation of a new centralized state around their estates.  Only by common efforts could the Russian lands throw off the yoke of the nomads and take their place among the European powers.  Among the old cities, completely destroyed by the Tatar raids, there was neither power, nor political elites, nor influence, therefore neither Kiev, nor Vladimir and Suzdal could claim the place of the future center of reign.  Russia in the 14th century introduced new favorites in this race.  This is the <span>Novgorod Republic, the</span> Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Principality of Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="14th century" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163176.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Novgorod land.  a brief description of </h2><p>  In the old days, the Mongol cavalry did not reach Novgorod.  This city flourished and retained its influence due to its advantageous location between the Baltic states, eastern Russian lands and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  A sharp cooling of the 13-14 centuries (Small Ice Age) significantly reduced yields on Novgorod lands, but Novgorod resisted and became even richer due to increased demand for rye and wheat in the Baltic markets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Political structure of Novgorod </h2><p>  The political structure of the city is close to the Slavic traditions of the veche.  This form of internal affairs management existed in other Russian lands, but after the enslavement of Russia, it quickly came to naught.  Officially, the authority in the principality performed the veche - the standard form of Old Russian self-government.  But in fact, the history of Russia of the 14th century in Novgorod was made by the hands of wealthy citizens.  The resale of grain and active trade in all directions created in Novgorod a wide layer of wealthy people - the "golden belts" who actually made politics in the principality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="14th century history" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163178.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <p>  Until the final accession to the Moscow <span>Principality, Novgorod</span> lands were the most extensive among all that united Russia in the 14th century. </p><h2>  Why Novgorod did not become a center </h2><p>  Novgorod territories were not densely populated, even during the heyday of the princedom, the population of Novgorod did not exceed 30 thousand people - such an amount could neither conquer neighboring lands nor retain their power in them.  Although the history of the 14th century calls Novgorod one of the largest Christian centers, the church in the principality did not have much power.  Another serious problem was the low fertility of Novgorod lands and a strong dependence on more southern territories.  Novgorod gradually became increasingly dependent on Moscow and in the end became one of the cities of the Moscow principality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The second challenger.  Grand Duchy of Lithuania </h2><p>  <span>The history of Russia of the</span> 14th century would not be complete without a description of the influence that the Principality of Lithuania had on the western lands (ON).  Formed on the fragments of the possessions of the great Kiev, it gathered under its flags Lithuanians, Balts and Slavs.  Against the backdrop of the constant raids of the Horde, Western Russians saw in Lithuania their natural defender from the warriors of the Golden Horde. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia in the 14th century" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163191.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Power and religion on </h2><p>  The supreme power in the state belonged to the prince - he was also called gospodar.  The smaller vassals, the lords, obeyed him.  Soon, an independent legislative body, the Rada, appears in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which is a council of influential members and strengthens their position in many areas of domestic politics.  The big problem was the lack of a clear succession ladder - the demise of the previous prince provoked contention between potential heirs, and often the throne was not the most legitimate, but the most unprincipled of them. </p><h2>  Religion in Lithuania </h2><p>  As for religion, the 14th century did not designate in the Principality of Lithuania a certain vector of religious views and sympathies.  For a long time, Lithuanians successfully maneuvered between Catholicism and Orthodoxy, remaining pagans in their hearts.  The prince could be baptized in the Catholic faith, while the bishop at the same time professed Orthodoxy.  The broad masses of the peasantry and townspeople mainly adhered to Orthodox principles, the 14th century dictated the choice of faith as a list of possible allies and opponents.  A powerful Europe stood behind Catholicism, Orthodoxy remained behind the eastern lands, which were regularly paid to give to Gentiles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia in the 14-15 centuries" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163192.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Why not Lithuania </h2><p>  <span>Western Russia</span> in the 14-15 centuries skillfully maneuvered between the Golden Horde and the European invaders.  Such a situation suited, by and large, all the participants in the politics of those years.  But after the death of Algerd, power in the principality passed into the hands of Jagiello.  Under the terms of the Union of Krev, he married the heiress of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and in fact became the lord of both vast lands.  Catholicism gradually penetrated into all spheres of the country's life.  The strong influence of a hostile religion made it impossible to unite the northeastern lands around Lithuania, so Vilnius did not become Moscow. </p><h2>  Muscovy </h2><p>  One of the many small fortresses built by Dolgoruky around his native Vladimir Principality was notable for its advantageous location at the crossroads of trade routes.  Little Moscow received merchants from the east and west, had access to the Volga and the northern shores.  The 14th century brought Moscow many battles and destruction, but after each invasion the city was rebuilt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia in the 14th century history" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163194.jpg" width="495"></div>  Moscow gradually acquired its own ruler - the prince - and successfully pursued a policy of encouraging immigrants, who for various indulgences firmly settled in new limits.  The constant expansion of the territory contributed to the strengthening of the forces and positions of the principality.  The state was ruled by an absolute monarchy, and the succession order was respected.  The power of the eldest son was not disputed, and in his jurisdiction were the big and best lands of the principality.  The authority of Moscow increased markedly after the principality's victory over Mamai in 1380 - one of the most significant victories that Russia gained in the 14th century.  History has helped Moscow rise above its eternal rival - Tver.  After the next Mongol invasion, the city could not recover from the ruin and became a vassal of Moscow.

    <h2>  Strengthening Power </h2><p>  <span>The history of Russia of the</span> 14th century gradually puts Moscow at the head of a single state.  The Horde is still strong in oppression, claims to the northeastern lands of its northern and western neighbors are still strong.  But the first stone Orthodox churches in Moscow have already flown up, the role of the church, which was very interested in creating a single state, has intensified.  In addition, the 14th century was a milestone for two great victories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Russia of the 14th century" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1163195.jpg" width="400"></div>  The Battle of <span>Kulikovo Field</span> showed that the Golden Horde can be expelled from Russian lands.  A long war with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ended in the defeat of the Lithuanians, and Vilnius forever abandoned attempts to colonize the northwest.  So Moscow took the first steps towards the establishment of its statehood.
