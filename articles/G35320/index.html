What is monk's hair loss</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the works of the past, in the pages of the Bible, and in modern writings, the word "hair shirt" is quite common.  What is a ‚Äúhair shirt‚Äù, what does this item of clothing mean, what direct and figurative meaning of the word do we learn from this article. </p><h2>  The first mention of hairline </h2><p>  In the biblical texts of the Old Testament, the word "hair shirt" is mentioned several times.  The meaning of the word ‚Äúhair loss‚Äù can be found in this ancient book.  Poor vegetation and an acute shortage of <span>fresh water from the</span> Sinai desert did not allow many families to keep cattle.  Therefore, goats have become the most common pet in the arid area.  The goat herd fed the Jews milk and meat, tools and the first household items were cut from their bones, and the skin and wool allowed the ancient inhabitants of Asia to dress and shoe.  The ancient Jews were called a thick, stiff fabric made from goat hair or wool.  Initially, a rough and strong cloth was intended for the manufacture of bags. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a hair shirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/735757.jpg" width="481"></div>  Later, the inhabitants of Judea and Israel began to put on a burlap as a sign of sadness and memory of the dead - the word "hair shirt" appeared.  What is the garment intended for mourning, confirm the pages of the Old Testament.  A little verse was put on a naked body, belted with a belt made of the same material.  All <span>close relatives of the</span> deceased should wear a hair shirt.  In special cases, these clothes were not removed from hard hair even at night.

Along with Jewish traditions, a vervich came to Christianity.  In the Middle Ages, these clothes were still sewn from coarse goat or <span>horse hair.</span>  In contrast to pre-Christian times, this garment has now ceased to be a sign of mourning.  In the Middle Ages, a hair shirt is a mandatory attribute of monasticism.  The monks and communion put on these clothes as a sign of humility and mortality of the flesh.  Men and women wore a rope, many heretics led to bonfires in these clothes.  People in the Middle Ages understood how hairworm harms health, that such constant wearing causes itching and irritates the skin, that wounds from wearing coarse tissue can turn into ulcers.  But wearing a mug was considered an integral part of serving God, and the wounds on the body were perceived as evidence of suffering for Christ and the Christian faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word hairline" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/735749.jpg" width="283"></div>

    <h2>  Cuddle in the new time </h2><p>  Starting from the Renaissance, the hair shirt gradually disappears from the everyday life of believers who have chosen more tolerant and not burdensome forms of worship of God.  In return, she appears in literary allegories, plot biblical paintings, and in everyday speech. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hair shirt is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/735756.jpg" width="581"></div>

    <p>  A symbol of sadness, remorse, deep mental anguish - a hair shirt.  What is a gross semblance of clothing has little to do with religious feelings, it can be seen from the figurative meaning of the word that has appeared.  The expression "put on a hair shirt" has become synonymous with the words "grieve", "sadness."  As a piece of clothing, the hair shirt is now an indispensable accessory of Christian monks, righteous and schemers. </p>
