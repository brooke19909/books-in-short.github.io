There is another option: download beautiful backgrounds from the Internet and print everything pleasant that you want to convey to your loved one or friend.  You can think of words yourself.  And you can use ready-made templates and just print them, and then cut them.  This, of course, is worse than coming up with it yourself.  But if there is absolutely no imagination, then better than nothing. </p><h2>  Gift for newlyweds </h2><p>  Newlyweds can issue two such containers.  They will be pleasantly surprised that the gift was not bought at the store, but jars with wishes were made with their own hands.  Photos of the decor for the bride and groom can be seen on the Internet.  For example, draw two pigeons, horses, swans on the tank.  All of them are a symbol of marital fidelity.  Put notes with wishes from you and your family inside.  The second option: guests throw a note with wishes in a festively decorated capacity during the celebration itself. </p><p>  And, of course, such a gift can give the bride to the groom.  Subsequently, it will become a family value, since a jar with wishes is made with your own hands.  ‚Äú100 Reasons Why I Love You‚Äù is a spiritual gift that a newly-made husband will re-read in moments of joy or small disagreements. </p>

    <p>  Manipulations are performed in the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  First of all, the bank needs to be degreased.  For this, alcohol or acetone is suitable.  You can also use an alcohol wipe. </li><li>  Take a napkin.  Separate the top ball with a picture.  We smear part of the container with PVA glue.  We apply the top layer of the napkin with the pattern inward. </li><li>  We turn to creating the effect of the seabed.  To do this, we select small pebbles, shells, sand.  To create a flicker effect, you can mix it with white sparkles.  Everything on our seabed needs to be fixed.  To do this, fill all objects with transparent varnish. </li><li>  In the place where the napkin is, you need to prime the jar with white paint.  Half of the container will remain transparent, the second part will remain white.  Wait for it to dry. </li><li>  When the paint hardens, apply a thick layer of putty on it.  Before it has dried, lay out the decor on it: pebbles, shells, rhinestones. </li><li>  Coarse large decor should be combined with a transparent part of the can.  To create a smooth transition, we use sand, small and broken shells. </li></ol><p>  A boy who dreams of sea adventures will like this gift - a jar of wishes.  With her own hands, her mother, sister, girlfriend can do it.  Let each member of your family write and throw notes in her with memories of past vacations.  This capacity can be used as a piggy bank.  It will be easier to part with money looking at sea landscapes, because this is a kind of visualization of a dream. </p><h2>  For beloved girlfriend </h2><p>  Have you been in touch for many years and know everything about each other?  Want to surprise your girlfriend with an unusual present?  Hand made is now in fashion.  Such a present is priceless, as a jar with your own wishes is made.  Girlfriend will like this gift.  If you have been friends since childhood, you can describe joint pranks in small scrolls.  Perhaps she no longer remembers them.  Therefore, the present will cause her tears of tenderness. </p>

    <h2>  Letter to the future </h2><p>  Would you be interested to receive a letter from yourself after 10-20, or maybe thirty years?  The class teacher at graduation may recommend that students write such a message.  Invite yesterday's schoolchildren to give advice to themselves 25-30 year old.  The honorable mission of storing the container is taken over by the ‚Äúcool mother‚Äù.  The lid of the can can be symbolically filled with wax and put a <span>wax seal.</span>  It will be possible to uncork the container after 20 years at a graduate meeting.  Former classmates will have a choice: read their messages out loud or leave it to themselves as something very personal.  Naturally, for letters you have to pick up a large capacity.  The best decor will be a pre-ordered sticker with a general photo of the class. </p>
