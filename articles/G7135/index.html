However, a new concept has recently appeared - online cash desks.  Changes from 2017 in the Federal Law oblige all trading enterprises to replace a regular device with an online cash register.  In this regard, businessmen have a lot of questions, the answers to them especially concern representatives of small and medium-sized businesses.  Can I do without an online cashier?  Does everyone need to move to new standards?  What happens if a company ignores the new requirements?  Anyway, <span>what is an online ticket office?</span>  Let's try to understand this difficult topic and answer all questions. </p><h2>  Legislative changes </h2><p>  As mentioned above, all entrepreneurs who conduct retail trade must have a cash register.  Until recently, this requirement was mandatory, but many ignored it and were in no hurry to work according to the law.  It was impossible to verify everyone, so many transactions and sales were carried out through ‚Äúgray‚Äù accounting, that is, without due control by the state and, in fact, outside the law. In this regard, lawmakers decided to tighten control and make some changes. So, now everyone who conducts trade and sells something (goods or services) is required to have an online cashier, which will help government services more closely and more accurately monitor revenue tracking, replenish the country's budget, and restore order in the field of online trading and online mage  zinov and, of course, this will protect consumers (buyers) from fraud by sellers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Such good intentions brought chaos and sowed panic among entrepreneurs.  Of course, if you did everything and do it by law, then you have nothing to fear.  The main thing is to understand all the innovations and understand what the essence of online cash registers is.  Below we consider the types of business for which its use is mandatory or alternative. </p><h2>  What is an online ticket office </h2><p>  An online ticket office is practically no different from a regular one - it might seem so at first glance.  In fact, there is one fundamental difference for which everything was started.  Such cash desks are connected to the World Wide Web and can transmit information and information about transactions to regulatory authorities via the Internet.  Internet access opens up other possibilities.  For example, now you can automatically inform the buyer via e-mail or via SMS message that he has bought goods from you (in fact, give an electronic version of the check).  The question ‚ÄúWhat is an online ticket office?‚Äù  He perplexed many businessmen, despite the fact that there is nothing particularly new in this concept. </p><p>  Some thought it was a special box office that is being created at a state portal or something like that.  In fact, this is far from the case.  All you have to do is to study the new online cash desks and connect in the same way as you did with a regular cash register.  Here, of course, there are nuances that are not difficult to figure out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How does an online ticket office work? </h2><p>  We will not go into technical details and details, but only answer the main questions that haunt entrepreneurs who are forced to upgrade their devices.  By the way, this need not be done 100% by businessmen, but only by some of them, but we will talk about this a little later. </p><p>  The online cash desk works via the Internet.  In this regard, there is a need to connect to the global web, because without it the meaning of using the new box office is completely lost.  The Internet for the online ticket office is a necessary thing, and, fortunately, it‚Äôs not difficult to get your own network.  Each outlet owner has the right to choose a provider.  For online cash desks, both wireless Internet and 2G or 3G cellular networks are suitable. </p><p>  And now the good news: the work of the new online box office is almost no different from the work of your good old machine, if you had it, of course.  All the main processes remain unchanged, returns at online cash desks are carried out quickly enough and without unnecessary paperwork.  Only the fiscal drive is new here.  This is a device that makes online data transmission possible.  That's all.  Connecting an online cashier is a separate issue that needs further clarification, so we will get to it right after we find out whether you need an online cashier or not. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Who needs her </h2><p>  It is impossible to do without an online cash desk for those who today have (or must be legally required) an old-style cash register.  If you are the owner of a hairdressing salon, studio, transport company, if you sell travel packages or tickets to concerts, excursions or other events, if you accept online payment for your goods or services, you must have a new ticket office. </p>

The same category of lucky ones includes those who sell newspapers and magazines, ice cream, soft drinks, vegetables and fruits.

    <p>  <span>Individual entrepreneurs (IP)</span> temporarily (until July 1, 2018) may take the time to switch to online cash desks.  Owners of various payment systems and individual entrepreneurs who work under the simplified taxation system (UTII or PSN), or are engaged in the sale of goods using vending machines, may also not yet establish an online cash register. </p><h2>  Where to get it </h2><p>  So, what is an online ticket office, we figured it out, now we need to answer another important question: where to get it?  Here again, there is nothing complicated.  The process of acquiring a new cash desk is no different from how entrepreneurs did it a year or five years ago.  As mentioned above, the technical equipment of the upgraded KKT is almost no different from the old devices, with the exception of one device.  Therefore, the only way to get a new online cashier is simply to buy it. </p><p>  We will not advertise individual services and companies involved in this, but just in case, we recall that in this matter you need to remain vigilant and not fall for the scammers.  Buy from trusted sellers and study them carefully before paying.  It is important that in the documents for the cash register there should be a note ‚ÄúMeets 54-‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Connection </h2><p>  Another important issue that can not be ignored is the connection of the online ticket office.  The instruction for this process is also spelled out in normative acts and regulated by law, therefore there can be no exceptions or ambiguous interpretations.  It is enough to follow a simple algorithm to do everything right. </p><p>  So, the first step will be to conclude a formal agreement with the fiscal data operator (abbreviated CRF).  This is a new participant in your relations with regulatory authorities, thanks to which they will receive information about transactions in real time.  CRFs store, transmit and process information in accordance with the 54th Federal Law and guarantee complete confidentiality of data.  A lot of attention is paid to security; operators work on special software that encrypts information.  This practically nullifies the chances of kidnapping her. </p><p>  There are a number of difficulties that a company or individual entrepreneur may encounter when choosing a fiscal data operator.  The fact is that this role is assigned not to some single special body, but to various companies that have all the necessary licenses (including from Roskomnadzor) and possess the equipment required by law.  Therefore, you need to pay special attention to the choice of CRF and follow simple recommendations: you need to find out from a potential partner about its technical capabilities, functionality, the ability to receive notifications, and control the information sent.  Specify the competencies of the contractor, do not forget to specify what exactly will be included in the cost of the services.  The requirement to present all the necessary documents and licenses allowing to carry out this type of activity will be quite out of place. </p><p>  After the OFD is selected, you need to connect to it.  It is very simple to do this: just go to the company‚Äôs website and leave a request there in a special form.  After simple manipulations, you will be contacted by a manager who will answer all your questions and draw up an agreement for signing.  In some cases, the organization uses an offer instead of a contract, which also complies with the requirements of the law and to some extent facilitates the process of signing the agreement. </p><p>  From this moment, all processes occur automatically: the collection, storage, processing and transmission of data is carried out by your chosen operator.  You do not need to carry out or control the above processes - professionals do this under state supervision. </p><h2>  registration </h2><p>  After you have purchased a new CCP or upgraded an old one, entered into an agreement with the fiscal data operator, you need to go to the last important step, which you can‚Äôt do without - register an online cash register.  What is it for?  Since all data on completed sales must be registered by the state and be completely transparent, you must submit them to the tax service.  If earlier any operations could be hidden, now it becomes almost impossible.  Within a second after the sale of a product or service and the issuance of a check at online cash registers, the tax office will have this information in full. </p>

    <p>  So, to register your online cashier in the tax, you can use two ways.  The first is familiar, paper, bureaucratic.  You need to go to the nearest branch of the Federal Tax Service with the usual statement.  Service staff will review it within three business days and register the device.  A sample application can be found on the Internet or in the Federal Tax Service itself.  However, in order to save time and nerves, it is better to use the second method - register a cash register via the Internet.  To do this, you need to register on the official website of the Federal Tax Service, enter your personal account and fill out an electronic application, which should indicate the serial number of your cash register and fiscal drive. </p><p>  After the tax inspector verifies these numbers and makes sure they exist, she will give you a special registration number that cannot be shared with anyone.  It will need to be entered into the online cashier.  This is done everywhere differently, so carefully read the instructions from the manufacturer of the CCP before trying to randomly enter numbers in the fields.  If you figured it all out and did it as it should, then your device will print the registration report itself.  It will contain special data that you will need to enter in your personal account on the tax service website in a separate field.  After you click on the ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù button, the process of <span>registering a cash register</span> will be behind - you can safely work. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  After the State Duma deputies introduced amendments to the legislation that changed the approach to the operation and use of all cash registers, a lot of businessmen showed their discontent.  At first, no one could really understand what these innovations mean, and what an online ticket office is.  After time passed and it became clear that no radical changes were foreseen, the fervor subsided a bit, and many entrepreneurs even came to the conclusion that the online ticket office is rather good than bad. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new online booking offices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58579/2049070.jpg"></div>  Among the advantages of the new CCP from a business point of view, for example, there is no need for servicing equipment, since the same ‚Äúmagic‚Äù fiscal drive will be changed directly by sellers.

    <p>  Another undoubted plus is the simplicity of registering a cash desk: you do not have to wait in line and wait a week to connect, just fill out a simple form on the website of the Federal Tax Service and, following the instructions, independently connect the device in just a few steps.  Thirdly, employees of the tax inspectorate will no longer go to check-ups, because they themselves receive all the information automatically in the Internet.  This is a definite plus, because such an approach almost completely eliminates the corruption component (tax authorities will not be able to put pressure on you and demand money, attributing non-existent violations to your business). </p><p>  For others, these benefits are not.  This applies to those who are used to working under illegal schemes, bribing civil servants and hiding their real incomes.  Everything should be honest, and the requirement to acquire online cash desks is another step towards the withdrawal of small and medium-sized businesses from the shadow. </p><h2>  What will happen if you don‚Äôt go to the online cashier? </h2><p>  From February to July 2017, the number of online cash desks in Russia increased tenfold, but not all entrepreneurs managed to switch to new equipment at the appointed time.  Moreover, many of them did not want to do this, and some businessmen who still have time until 2018 are even thinking about not switching to online booking offices.  For this they will face punishment and penalties.  If the offense is committed for the first time, then the business owner will face a fine.  For an individual entrepreneur, its size will be up to 50% of the profit, but not less than 10,000 rubles, for an LLC - from 75 to 100% of revenue, but not less than 30,000 rubles.  In case of a repeated violation (if the proceeds exceeded one million rubles), you will be deprived of the right to engage in entrepreneurial activity for a period of 90 days.  If the revenue is less than 1,000,000 rubles.  - fine again. </p><p>  As for the use of CCP with violations (for example, your cash register is not registered in accordance with the law, you do not have a fiscal drive, there are artificial malfunctions in online payment, the cash desk does not print checks of the established sample), a fine from 1,500 to 10 000 rubles. </p><p>  In order not to get caught and not create problems for yourself, the best solution is to do everything according to the law and get an online cash register as soon as possible if you have not done so already. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, online booking offices are a really useful tool for any business.  They make operations transparent and understandable, nip corruption schemes, and help the state conduct more precise control over trade activities.  We examined the very concept and instructions of the online box office and realized that it is practically no different from a regular device.  You should not have any special difficulties in acquiring the device, since the instructions for connecting and registering it are pretty clear.  Switch to the new CCP so as not to have problems with the law in the future and not to pay high fines for the lack of a cash register or its incorrect operation. </p>
