    <h2>  The calling of the Varangians to Novgorod </h2><p>  In the IX century, numerous tribal unions of Slavs and Finns were dependent on the Varangians - Germanic pagans who lived on the Scandinavian peninsula.  For a short period, they managed to expel the interventionists and stop paying tribute.  However, local tribes immediately began to fight among themselves.  Peace could begin only with the advent of legitimate authority. </p><p>  The most important source for the Rurik era is the <span>"Tale of Bygone Years."</span>  It is she who contains information that the union of the Ilmen Slovenes, Meri and Krivichy suggested that he reign in Novgorod.  It happened in 862. </p><p>  <span>Rurik's biography</span> suited everyone.  This man was a compromise figure.  The prince from across the sea was not a protege or supporter of some kind of grouping.  Some sources indicate that the Novgorodians and their neighbors considered a variety of candidates: from the Khazars to the glades.  Nevertheless, the choice fell on the Varangian (that is, the Viking). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rurik and his brothers </h2><p>  The delegation of the Slavs went overseas.  Rurik also took two of his brothers with him: Sineus (reigned on Beloozero) and Truvor (went to Izborsk).  When they died, their allotments again passed to the Novgorod prince.  The biography of Rurik before its appearance in Russia is almost unknown and for the most part based on guesses.  Nevertheless, there is accurate information that he had his own squad.  It was she who became the pillar of the new government and ensured order in Novgorod land.  In exchange for protecting the population, the prince received the right to collect taxes. </p><p>  Interestingly, some sources contradict each other in where exactly Rurik really rules.  For example, the <span>Laurentian Chronicle</span> suggests that Ladoga was his first residence.  In Novgorod, the prince appeared only after the death of his two younger brothers.  In addition, under his authority were the lands of the Krivichy, whose main city was Polotsk.  In the east of this state were Finnish tribes.  They lived in Rostov, Murom and neighboring lands. </p>

    <h2>  Governing body </h2><p>  Biography of Rurik as prince of Novgorod did not differ in bright events.  The only exception can be considered unrest in the capital, when residents, dissatisfied with the rule of the Varangian, rebelled against it in 864.  Their leader was <span>Vadim the Brave.</span>  He and his main associates were killed by Rurik.  Due to the fragmentation and incompleteness of information about these unrests, some historians either consider them to be fiction, or connect with later events.  <span>The Nikon Chronicle,</span> which tells of the revolts of Novgorod against the Varangian rule, was compiled in the 16th century and, of course, could be unreliable.  This episode is a vivid example of how vague and little studied Rurik's biography is. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He died in 879, leaving his only son Igor.  The power in Novgorod passed to Oleg, either a relative or Rurik‚Äôs ally.  The new prince was regent with a growing heir.  Three years later, Oleg captured Kiev, where he transferred his capital.  Later, Igor and his descendants ruled there.  So the Old Russian state arose, the princes of which were representatives of <span>the Rurikovich dynasty.</span>  Her last representative - Fedor - died in 1598, being the Tsar of Moscow. </p>

    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Prince Rurik, whose brief biography is caused by fierce debate, was not recorded in the annals and other documents until his calling by the Slavs.  Researchers often associate it with the Vikings.  Most often, Danes or Swedes are mentioned in the scientific literature, to which Novgorod prince Rurik (862-879) could belong.  The biography of this king is foggy, which gives rise to numerous hypotheses about its origin. </p><h2>  Norman theory </h2><p>  In ancient Russian sources in the description of Rurik the word "Varangian" is used, which indicates its Scandinavian or Norman origin.  In the IX century, the inhabitants of these regions excited the whole of Christian Europe with their merciless raids.  Some of them seized land on the continent and built into the common feudal system, simultaneously adopting Christianity. </p><p>  Many historians believe that Rurik is Rurik of Jutland.  It was a famous Danish king.  He fought with the Carolingians for Frisia.  Perhaps he was also a vassal of the Frankish sovereign for some time, since coins with the image of Lothar were minted under him.  In the late 50s, he tried to take possession of Jutland, but unsuccessfully.  A little later, he fought with the Western Slavs-Wends, who lived on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea.  Supporters of the idea that Rurik is Rorik cite the fact that in the Western annals mention of this kingge disappears from about the date when the Varangian began to rule in Novgorod.  This hypothesis remains unproven and often becomes the subject of controversy.  Rurik, whose brief biography is almost unknown, does not even have a documented grave. </p>

    <h2>  Slavic and Baltic theories </h2><p>  There are theories that the Vikings, called up to Russia, were named representatives of the West Slavic tribe of Vagra.  If this is so, then Prince Rurik, whose biography does not refute or prove this version, may have been a distant tribe of the inhabitants of Novgorod. </p><p>  Another close assumption to this theory was made by the great Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov.  He considered Rurik a native of the Prussians - the Baltic people who lived in the territories of present-day Poland and Lithuania.  In the traditions of the Germanized Slavs from the same lands, there are legends about three brothers called to distant Novgorod.  These were encouraged, the representative of which could be Prince Rurik.  A brief biography of this person does not allow to accurately determine his ethnicity.  In addition, it is difficult to calculate the year of his birth. </p>
