Nature and sights of Kaunas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kaunas is the second largest city in Lithuania.  By the way, from 1919 to 1940 it was the provisional capital of the republic. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The first mention of the village is in the annals of 1361.  The name of the city has Baltic roots and means “swampy or marshy place”.  The city received its status as a city only in 1408. </p><p>  In the XV century, Kaunas, or rather the castle, was part of the Hanseatic League.  The city at that time played a huge role in the state of Lithuania.  It was here that the first school and public hospital appeared.  War wrecked the city; in 1795, it became part of the Russian Empire.  The economic and social component began to improve again.  But a new war has come.  Napoleon in this place, through the <span>Neman, the river</span> in Kaunas, decided to invade Russia.  As a result, the city was seriously damaged. </p><p>  Later, in 1842, the village became the center of the Coven (Kaunas) province. </p><p>  From 1920 to 1940, the temporary capital of the Republic of Lithuania is located here.  The dawn of an independent state begins.  The city is growing, the number of citizens is increasing, new buildings and bridges are appearing.  Already in 1924, buses run here, and after 4 years a central water supply appeared. </p><p>  But war comes again, in June 1941 the Germans enter the city, but not through the bridge, it was already blown up, and they are rafting on a ship across the river in Kaunas-Neman, thanks to the Lithuanian military units. </p><p>  The Red Army entered the city only in 1944.  However, the guerrilla war lasted until 1953. The confrontation of Soviet power continues.  In 1956, on November 2, demonstrations were held with the participation of young people of Kaunas and, as a result, led to clashes with law enforcement agencies.  Many are under arrest, others are expelled from educational institutions.  In 1972, a young 19-year-old guy named Romas Kalanta committed an act of self-immolation in protest against the Soviet Union.  The riots begin, but then it is possible to quickly suppress the demonstration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the end of the 80s of the last century, the movement against the Communists has intensified, nationalist organizations are being formed.  In 1990, March 11, the Lithuanian Soviet Republic virtually ceased to exist.  The period from the 40s to the 90s is recognized as occupation. </p>

This settlement is multinational, however, like the whole of Lithuania.  Data for the republic at the beginning of 2017: </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Latvians </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  84.15% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Poles </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  6.58% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Russians </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  5.81% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Belarusians </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  1.19% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p>  Ukrainians and other nationalities </p></td><td valign="top"><p>  0.54 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vilia river" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2187544.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Traditions </h2><p>  Almost all residents of Kaunas, like all Lithuanians, love to sing.

    <h2>  City beaches </h2><p>  Travelers who plan not only sightseeing, but also the adoption of solar procedures, it is best to come to the city from mid-May to August.  During this period, the weather in Kaunas is already comfortable, the hottest sun in August, the temperature reaches +25 degrees, but just then the rainy season begins.  But, in general, the climate here is mild, although windy. </p><p>  Many are interested in the question, on which river does Kaunas stand?  On two rivers: Neman and Vilia.  There is also a reservoir. </p><p>  In the western part of the city is the beach "Lampedžiai Lake Beach", on the lake.  You can get to the shore by taxi or public bus that runs on routes No. 9 and 48. You need to get out at the Kaunas Castle stop. </p><p>  The cleanest beach is Kaunas Reservoir Beach, which is located on the shore of the reservoir.  Trolleybuses number 9 and 12 go here, but only in the summer season.  The coastal zone is located near the temple and monastery complex. </p><p>  On the Neman River in Kaunas is the beach "Panemunes Park Beach", it is located in the park of the same name.  You can get to the shore on foot, from the Molas shopping center.  By the way, the <span>river Viliya is</span> often called Nyaris, and the Neman - Nemunas. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaunas city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2187552.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Historical sights </h2><p>  The princely castle, erected XIII-XIV centuries.  This is the first construction of the city and is actually the "core" of the village.  It is located at the confluence of the Viliya and Neman rivers, in the territory of Santaka Park.  Although today it is not a castle, but ordinary ruins, in the southwestern tower of which the museum is located. </p><p>  Nearby is the Church of St. George, which was built in the 16th century.  Compared to the castle, the building was well preserved, although it “survived” many fires and wars.  This is a church made in the Gothic style, it burned three times, under Napoleon it was used as a warehouse, and with the advent of Soviet power in general, as a building of a medical school.  In 1993, the building was returned to the monks who are engaged in restoration to this day. </p><p>  Perkunas House was built in the 15th century.  The building was erected from red brick in the style of "fiery" Gothic.  Even tourists are allowed inside.  After numerous reconstructions, the house was nevertheless returned to the Jesuits, in whose possession it was before the First World War. </p><h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  You should definitely visit the Town Hall Square and the Town Hall itself, which the locals call the White Swan.  Built back in 1542.  It is located in the very center of the old part of the city, not far from the confluence of rivers in Kaunas.  Inside there is a wedding hall and a ceramics museum.  At the very top of the building there is an observation deck, 52 meters high, from where a magnificent view of almost the entire city opens.  For several centuries, the most important and significant events have been taking place on the square, from executions to fairs.  There are many medieval buildings in the district, two churches: </p><ul><li>  St. Francis Xavier; </li><li>  Saints Peter and Paul. </li></ul><p>  There is also the Holy Trinity Church and theological seminary, which are erected in the same architectural style.  Here stands a pedestal to Bishop Moteyus Valančius, who became famous for his good deeds. </p><p>  There is a flowerbed in the square with bicycles and flowerpots.  Here are the telephone boxes where the phones still work. </p>

    <h2>  Nature of the city </h2><p>  Not only the rivers in Kaunas are surprising.  There are many cultural and natural attractions, including a botanical garden.  It was laid in 1923 on the site of a small estate, which in the XIX century was owned by the Godlevsky family, and then passed into the possession of the University of Lithuania.  Today it is 60 hectares with representatives of the plant nature of Kaunas, the country and exotic species.  The whole territory is divided into thematic zones.  The garden can be reached by public transport, routes number 20 and 35. For visitors by personal transport, parking is available. </p><p>  Along C. Petrausco Street is the žuolinas Park.  The name he received in honor of the old oak park.  In the eastern part of the park area there is an entrance to the zoo.  You can get from the center to Ažuolinas by stairs or by buses No. 10, 38, 6, 37, 21. It is also recommended to visit the Devil’s Museum, art gallery, catacombs near the entrance to the Church of St. Michael the Archangel, the architectural ensemble of Pajaislis and other interesting places. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to Kaunas is by air.  The city airport can accept any type of aircraft, but there are no scheduled flights from Moscow and back, only charter flights.  The airport itself is located 14 kilometers from the central part of the city.  The easiest way to get to the city, except for a taxi, is bus number 29, the schedule of which is clearly synchronized with the arrival of the aircraft. </p><p>  The railway station in Kaunas is small, very similar to the station, but comfortable.
