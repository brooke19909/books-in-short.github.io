However, their goal, like many modern institutions, was the desire to satisfy curiosity in learning new information, and simply the need to have your favorite pets. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The zoo (Yaroslavl) differs from other Russian organizations in its conceptual component.  The fundamental factor in its construction was the awareness of the need to create animal conditions similar to the natural environment.  Unlike cell-type organizations, the landscape version of the institution allows all pets to feel comfortable and meets their needs as much as possible. </p>
