Head doctors salaries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The salary of a doctor is a very interesting figure for many residents of our country.  She may be interested in applicants of medical higher educational institutions in order to decide on the future direction in the medical field or to understand whether it is worth going there.  It is interesting to patients, it is interesting to current doctors, it is important for statistics and so on.  Let's look at all the options. </p><h2>  Work in medicine </h2><p>  Work in the medical field is a very broad concept.  The medical staff includes the junior staff of hospitals and clinics (nurses, nurses), employees of private and state clinics, doctors of various categories and specializations, pharmaceutical workers and many other people who are somehow related to health care. </p><p>  Such a variety of professions and specialties implies a wide range of fluctuations in salaries.  This amount, as you know, depends on many factors.  And the salary of a doctor is no exception.  Although, of course, in our country this figure is very low compared to European states. </p>

    <h2>  Salary expectations </h2><p>  In the current situation in Russia, salary expectations in the medical sector are quite low.  Of course, the profession, which implies such an amount of responsibility, education and work, should be adequately paid.  But often it develops completely differently.  It is worth looking into the district state polyclinic, and it becomes clear that the budget is clearly not enough allocated for this area of ‚Äã‚Äãpublic life.  Cracked walls of hospitals, furniture from the century before last, terrifying dignity.  nodes - what can you think about the monetary allowance of doctors?  The situation is the same.  One of the most necessary industries for the people is in a deplorable state.  However, there is another side - paid medicine.  Here are completely different numbers.  And the working conditions are completely different.  But taking a place in a paid clinic for a newly-made doctor is not so simple.  Commercial activity also implies the presence of a manager‚Äôs vein for the employee.  In addition to medical education, one will have to learn how to sell their services. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Health Careers </h2><p>  Any graduate of the school, a young applicant is full of ambition and desire to move up the career ladder, to occupy a prestigious position, to be successful in understanding society as a whole, and, of course, to receive good wages for their work.  Often in our time, the choice of a university and a profile of education is based precisely on the needs of the market, on the news about salary levels in various sectors of social activity.  The demand for doctors in our country is quite large, but the average salary of a doctor in the country leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, not every person will connect his life with this occupation.  Those who sincerely wanted to benefit people by getting rid of diseases and conducting research, and those who have some prospects in this direction thanks to friends and so on will turn their eyes to this sphere. </p>

    <h2>  What you need to know the applicant honey.  universities </h2><p>  When entering a university, most students are not fully aware of what they would really want from a future profession.  Often the choice is dictated by the impressions of films, art books, inspired by romanticism and the desire for beauty, for nobility.  The modern <span>medical profession is</span> very far from romanticism.  This is hard work requiring huge reserves of erudition.  Students will have to face many difficulties that they did not expect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First you need to make sure that this profession is for you.  Watch videos of operations and procedures.  For many, they cause shock; not everyone can contemplate such paintings. </p><p>  A student of a medical university will have to study very carefully and scrupulously.  Then residency.  Then internships, workshops and so on.  And at the end of the university and all practical preparations, the salaries of the chief doctors will be in the distant future, if at all.  One impulse is not enough to achieve anything worthwhile.  This is not just about medicine. </p>

    <h2>  About paid medicine </h2><p>  The salary of a doctor in Russia ranges around fifteen thousand.  This applies to state clinics and hospitals.  This figure is given for cities with a population of over one million.  That is, a sufficiently large city, a high standard of living and income, far from rural areas, and at the same time, the salary of such a valuable shot is less than that of a loader at the station.  Amazing country.  Work in a paid medical center is much more profitable.  In such centers, it ranges from 30,000 to 50,000. But the requirements for such vacancies are higher than in municipal structures.  Certifications, decent work experience, residency documents and much more are needed.  In addition, the doctor of the commercial clinic must fulfill the plan for prescribed tests, treatments, and the average size of the check.  Private clinics do not work to improve public health, but to increase the profits of their organization. </p>

    <h2>  Corruption of the medical system </h2><p>  Corruption in Russia is an eternally relevant issue.  In order to achieve the necessary extract, help, speed up progress in turn and organize a quick solution to other routines, people make symbolic ‚Äúgifts‚Äù, give bribes, ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.  It is not surprising that a doctor with a salary of 15,000 will prefer to give the necessary certificate for a souvenir, rather than according to the prescribed rules.  The solution of corruption problems in the country should begin with the solution of the problems of the families of professors and honored doctors who exist beyond the poverty line due to the low cost of their tremendous work. </p><p>  On the other hand, people so often complain about the quality of medical services in our country, cite social guarantees and the salary of a doctor in Western countries as an example.  But people in those countries have a habit, in addition to compulsory insurance, to acquire additional life and health insurance.  And taxes in many countries withheld from the working population reach almost half of <span>wages.</span> </p>

    <h2>  <span>How to help people</span> and adequately support themselves </h2><p>  There is hope to raise a generation of honest medicine, friendly and competent doctors, comfortable clinics.  There is, but so far the device of our power does not allow this miracle to be realized.  In fact, the reasons are not only in the authorities, the reasons are in the upbringing, and in the situation in the markets and the economy as a whole.  Crises pass and come, not to hide from them, but they end.  And the main thing that remains in the work is professionalism.  The salary of a doctor can be decent.  It all depends on his professional qualities and ambitions.  A person must grow and develop throughout his life, and not just in his youth.  The desire, knowledge and ability to survive difficult situations are very helpful in finding a worthy place of application for your talents. </p><h2>  The most paid areas in medicine </h2><p>  The salary of a doctor in different regions ranges from 12-15 thousand.  The salary of a doctor in Moscow has not gone so far from these figures.  These amounts are both among therapists, pediatricians, and even surgeons.  There are surcharges, overtime, daily shifts, bonuses and so on.  Only to get them you need to work very hard.  Indeed, medicine has become impoverished, as many workers in this field say. </p><p>  The average salary is still summed up from the high salaries of the managerial staff and the crumbs earned by nurses and nurses.  Therefore, the amount comes out in the amount called "good doctor's salary."  And the most paid places are still private clinics and dentistry. </p>
