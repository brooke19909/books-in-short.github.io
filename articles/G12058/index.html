Olgovo is rightfully considered one of the <span>most beautiful places in the Moscow region.</span>  About two hundred people live here.  They all know the history of this place well.  People (mainly the older generation) still live in the past.  New construction is practically not carried out here, the village is gradually degenerating.  But this place still remains interesting for many travelers, since there has been a special atmosphere since the time of local landowners. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The Apraksins' estate in Olgovo has a rich history that began back in 1619, when the village was granted the governor of Dmitri Fyodor Chaplin for merits during the siege of Moscow by the Polish troops of Prince Vladislav. </p><p>  For a hundred years, Olgovo belonged to the Chaplin family.  Then, as a result of marital unions between representatives of various noble families, in 1740 the estate passed into the possession of the famous Apraksin family, whose representatives did many things for the glory of the Fatherland.  It was used as a summer residence. </p>

    <p>  The palace and park complex of the estate was formed in 1786.  The architect Francesco Camporezi played an important role in the fate of the estate.  It was he who was invited by the then owner of the estate Stepan Stepanovich Apraksin to participate in the construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At that time, a front yard and utility yard were built and a park with a cascade of ponds was built, each of which has its own name: "Rural", "Pink", "White Sparrow", "Black Sparrow", "Raspberry Sparrow". </p><h2>  The original view of the estate </h2><p>  An integral part of the landlord life in the 18th century was active economic activity in the estates, which brought considerable income to the owners of estates that used the labor of serfs.  In this regard, the Apraksin estate in Olgovo was no exception.  The estate was engaged in intensive economic activity (a paper mill was operating, horses of the Oryol breed were bred).  The presence of a large staff of domestic servants necessitated the construction of residential and kitchen facilities.  Over time, the estate began to represent a <span>complex of residential</span> and farm buildings. </p><p>  They were located on two perpendicular axes ("east-west" and "north-south"). </p>

    <p>  Housing was built from east to west, and a utility yard was located from north to south.  The entrances to the estate go along the <span>linden alleys</span> and are indicated by paired red brick obelisks that have survived to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the main courtyard the master's house, wings, rooms for domestic workers are symmetrically located.  The exit gates were indicated by two Gothic towers, of which only one has survived.  On the territory of the estate in 1715, according to the project of architect K. L. Druzhinin, the Vvedensky church with empire style elements was built.  Near the church was a parish school. </p><p>  The manor house, rebuilt by the architect Camporese, is a real two-story palace, the facades of which are decorated with pediments and terraces.  In 1880, the building was rebuilt again, the pediments increased.  The facade from the side of the park is decorated with a portico with a loggia and six columns. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  The interior of the house included two rooms overlooking the front yard and the side of the park.  Both rooms are decorated in a classic style.  The walls are decorated with pilasters.  The choirs were supported by Corinthian columns.  All decoration and columns are made of marble-painted wood.  Between the pilasters on the walls there are plaster bas-reliefs of representatives of the Apraksin clan.  The interior of the halls was decorated with family portraits by Russian and foreign masters of painting, as well as furniture made by serf masters.  This building is currently in ruins. </p>

    <p>  The earlier the Apraksins estate in Olgovo breathed?  The story tells quite a bit about her vibrant life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How the landowners had fun </h2><p>  Under Stepan Stepanovich Apraksin, the estate hosted noisy holidays with fireworks.  Life was in full swing.  Famous statesmen and military figures and writers of that time often visited the estate.  The theater, located on the estate, hosted opera performances with the participation of invited <span>Italian singers.</span>  Also, the troupe of the serf theater gave their ideas.  The economic basis of the Apraksins' welfare was the breeding of the Oryol trotters in the stables of the estate.  After the death in 1827 of Stepan Stepanovich, the noisy festivities in the estate stopped. </p><h2>  New story of the estate </h2><p>  In 1880, the reconstruction of manor buildings began (an outbuilding and two residential buildings for servants, as well as kitchen buildings) were erected.  The Apraksin estate in Olgovo changed its appearance a little.  Restoration then affected almost all the premises.  A southern outbuilding was built on the site of the greenhouse.  Subsequently, two residential buildings for yard people appeared at the main entrance.  Kitchen buildings were added to the house.  Both wings - North and South - have survived to this day.  The second was built by the architect N.V. Nabokov from brick.  The wings are interconnected by open arched passages, the balustrades of which were decorated with vases.  Housings for servants included buildings for family and separately for single persons.  Kitchen buildings attached to the house do not have decorative details and are covered with plaster. </p>

    <p>  The buildings that were part of the estate‚Äôs economic complex have survived to this day and include office outbuildings, weaving houses, horse and farm yards.  For dressage of the horses of the famous Oryol breed there was an arena.  The premises of the owner's building are made of brick.  They form a small town with arched gates. </p><h2>  Park zone </h2><p>  The manor park is spread over forty hectares and currently represents chaotically growing coniferous and deciduous trees.  The features of the park‚Äôs initial regularity can be traced in the arrangement of age-old spruce and larch groups.  On them you can judge the composition of the park ensemble.  The circle for the U-turn of the crews is bordered by seven huge old oaks. </p><p>  The park ensemble included numerous arbors, obelisks.  On its territory there was a triumphal arch, "Temple of Virtue", "Turkish Mosque", which were decorative buildings.  There are also three ponds in the park. </p>

    <h2>  From the estate to the spa center </h2><p>  By 1917, the Apraksins estate in Olgovo was one of the richest landowner estates near Moscow.  After the revolution, in the first years of Soviet power, a museum was opened in the estate, which was disbanded a few years later.  Some of the furniture and exhibits of artistic and historical value were transferred to other museums.  Many items were lost.  After World War II, the Raduga sanatorium was created in the former estate for the working people of the capital and the Moscow Region.  It was located in former residential buildings for servants.  The estate is currently privately owned.  On its territory there is a resort center with an equestrian club. </p><h2>  Homestead today </h2><p>  Currently, the Apraksin estate in Olgovo is a territory owned by Apraksin Center LLC.  The limited liability company owns a boarding house and ponds.  The surviving red brick stables now contain sheep.  The church building and the gatehouse belong to the parish of the existing Vvedensky church.  The building of the parish school next to the church is in municipal ownership. </p>

    <p>  In 2008, the owners of the estate developed a plan for its restoration.  To date, roofing works and ponds have been cleaned.  The water supply system was also improved and a water treatment plant was put into operation.  The plans of the estate owners include clearing the ruins of the manor house and its reconstruction in accordance with the historical appearance. </p><p>  Restoration work on buildings is carried out using materials similar to those used in the 18th century for their construction.  The restoration of the historical appearance is ensured thanks to the terms of the contract concluded when the territory was sold to new owners.  In accordance with this document, a complex of restoration work should be carried out, as well as unhindered access to the territory of tourists. </p><h2>  Manor of the Apraksins in Olgovo.  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the estate from the capital by driving along Dmitrovskoye Shosse to turn to Lobnya, following the north through Ozeretskoye, Udino, Khrabrovo to Fedorovka.  Then you need to get to the turn to Podyachevo, from where there is a direct road to Olgovo. </p><p>  Dmitrovsky district of the Moscow region is associated precisely with Olgino.  After all, the Apraksin estate is an object of historical heritage at the federal level and is a unique example of the architecture of the XVIII century.  Picturesque places and clean air around are an additional incentive for tourists to visit the estate. </p>

    <p>  Having examined the architectural and park ensemble, you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe landlord life of pre-revolutionary Russia.  Of particular note is the pond in the estate.  Olgovo is often visited by fishing enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, the tourist infrastructure of the estate is still in its infancy.  By visiting a private equestrian club, you can <span>ride horses</span> and take part in caring for them.  Hotel accommodation in comfortable rooms is also available.  There is a fishing and hunting club in the estate, visitors of which are given the opportunity to pay fishing in the surrounding ponds.  In the future, as the historical appearance of the estate is recreated, the leisure industry will also develop.  Perhaps soon the village of Olgovo will become a popular tourist attraction. </p>
