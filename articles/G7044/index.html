Electric units operating from a network are convenient in operation, economical, and have typical dimensions.  But given the relatively low cost of natural gas, a gas refrigerator can be a very attractive alternative to electric appliances.  This equipment is capable of working autonomously for a long time.  This is a good solution for a summer residence, a car, cafes, restaurants on highways and other facilities. </p><h2>  Dimensions and volumes, supported temperatures </h2><p>  The gas refrigerator, depending on the model, can have different sizes - compact products with a volume of up to 33 liters are available on the market, as well as standard floor samples with a useful volume of up to 100 liters.  There are also larger models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gas fridge" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506217.jpg" width="385"></div>  As for the difference in temperature indicators, it reaches 30 degrees.  So, a gas refrigerator even in summer is able to maintain the inside temperature below 0 degrees.  These solutions can be used to freeze products - many devices are equipped with a freezer.  This equipment is referred more to household appliances.  They can be purchased at any stores that sell household appliances.

The great advantage of such equipment is the complete absence of any moving parts.  This practically reduces the risk of breakdowns to zero.  Due to this feature, prices for devices of this class are slightly higher than for electric refrigerators.  But such an acquisition is very profitable and is sure to pay off due to high reliability and a long service life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gas fridge" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506218.jpg" width="400"></div>  The operation of this equipment is no different from the operation of ordinary household units.  They also support temperatures from 2 to 4 degrees, but the propane tank provides energy to the device.

    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The algorithm of work is that the refrigerant evaporates due to the low boiling point.  A special thick substance, like a carrier of this composition, is heated in a container to a certain temperature.  Then the vapors enter the condenser, where they are sent in the form of liquid to the evaporating unit.  In this block, they again boil, but only at freezing temperatures.  Then they take away excess heat from the refrigerator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="propane tank" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506219.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is how the <span>absorption refrigerator</span> works <span>.</span>  The principle of operation of this unit is based on the connection or association of carriers and the movement of matter in a special generator.  Then the whole process is repeated.

    <h2>  Car gas fridge </h2><p>  The equipment of this class is very convenient not only in the conditions of a country house or outdoor recreation away from electricity.  This solution is relevant for truckers.  They are on the road long enough, and they need to keep food fresh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="absorption refrigerator working principle" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506221.jpg" width="482"></div>  It is for truckers and other drivers created an automobile version.  Among the advantages of such a mobile solution is the complete lack of need for electricity.  This helps conserve battery power.  Only a propane tank is needed for operation.  <span>Gas consumption is</span> very low, the operation of the refrigerator itself is completely silent.  This allows you to operate the equipment not only in cars, but also in other places where silence is needed.  You can even take such a refrigerator on a camping trip.  There is only one drawback for this class of units - they cannot deliver the same power as their older brothers.  They are characterized by lower performance.  Compact dimensions and mobility affect it - this is a hiking option.  For the first time, absorption refrigerators appeared only at the end of the last century, but they immediately provoked positive reviews from all those who used them.  Despite the fact that some people find it unsafe to operate such gas equipment, many are happy to take full advantage of the units. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car gas fridge" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506222.jpg" width="600"></div>  There are a large number of <span>refrigerators for cars,</span> but some work on electricity, others are noisy, and others are not very efficient.  A gas fridge is devoid of all these disadvantages.

    <h2>  Disadvantages of gas refrigeration equipment </h2><p>  With all the many advantages and advantages, this equipment has significant disadvantages.  When choosing them, you definitely need to pay attention.  It affects lower efficiency - to get deep freeze in these units will not work.  The fact is that the refrigerants for propane refrigerators are characterized by a high boiling point under atmospheric pressure.  An average refrigerator of this type can generate temperatures up to -6 degrees.  The most popular refrigerant is ammonia, and ordinary water is used as a diluent.  Inside the channels of the device is a strong solution of ammonia.  Sometimes it leaks during breakdowns.  This does not have the best effect on the environment.  But such damage is a rarity. </p><h2>  When and how to repair? </h2><p>  Nothing can last forever without failures and various troubles.  It is not worth repairing a gas refrigerator yourself - it can be dangerous to life and health.  Propane is a <span>combustible gas.</span>  As for repairs in specialized services, it is quite expensive.  It is best to carry out any repair work in ventilated rooms, as often the cause of the malfunction lies in gas leaks or problems with the cylinder.  Such a diagnosis can be made by simply connecting the device to the electrical network - if the device is working, then it is necessary to look for problems with gas.  Malfunctions in the burner often occur.  You can fix this problem yourself or replace the burner with a new one.  There are situations when even repair does not save.  Typically, these problems are associated with the heating system - it is practically impossible to repair it.  In this case, a complete replacement of the element will help.  If the thermosiphon breaks, repair is also useless. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exmork refrigerator" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1506223.jpg" width="600"></div>  Another popular problem is low-quality refrigerant.  Owners discover this defect very late and rarely.  This trouble is manifested in a slight increase in temperature.  This effect is easy to attribute to summer heat and elevated temperatures.  A complete replacement is needed here.  Most often, the hermetic system fails.  This is due to wear on the joints.  Leaks appear in them, which affects the efficiency of the refrigerant.  When it comes to the pipes themselves, complete leaks are possible, which will make the refrigerator work inefficient.

    <h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  There are not so many manufacturers of this equipment.  Only two are known in Russia.  These are Exmork and Vitrifrigo. </p><h2>  Exmork </h2><p>  The company is engaged in the production of absorption refrigerators capable of working without electricity.  The equipment is connected to the gas in the same way as the oven.  Depending on the model, a 50-liter bottle will last for 30 to 60 days.  As for temperatures, they range from +3 to +5 degrees in the refrigerator compartment and from -15 in the freezer.  Gas consumption is from 12 grams per hour.  An important advantage that Exmork experts are talking about is that the refrigerator will automatically turn off the gas if the flame goes out.  Also, the unit can operate on electricity.  There is lighting inside - LED lamps operate on batteries.  One set is enough for 6 months or more. </p><h2>  Vitrifrigo </h2><p>  This gas equipment is not yet very popular in Russia.  The company produces models from 40 to 150 liters.  This equipment allows you to easily equip the kitchen in the country or in the house.  There are models for cars.  The equipment can operate on propane, from a network of 12 or 220 V. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A propane refrigerator is a good choice as a mobile equipment.  In an apartment or house where people live constantly, such a device will not be advisable - there are drawbacks that compression refrigerators overlap.  But for lovers of tourism, motorists, truckers, this unit is indispensable. </p>
