    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Okurcalar, which is located Sui Resort Hotel 5 *, is 90 kilometers from Antalya Airport.  And about 30 minutes drive from Alanya - a major local resort and seaport. </p><p>  There are practically no entertainments, and attractions too.  Is that the ancient defensive fortress of Alarahan, located 6 kilometers from the hotel complex.  Here it is worth a trip.

It is not only a popular resort, but also a place where interesting cultural and historical sights are concentrated - the ancient theater, the Manavgata fountain, the basilica at the Roman Theater, the ancient city of Lirbe and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Of course, the staff does not show initiative, but it does its job fully. </li><li>  Beach.  It is located in a very beautiful and picturesque bay, and the sea itself is warm and clean, even at the height of the swimming season.  And there are always free sunbeds, which, by the way, are under a dense wide awning. </li><li>  The location.  You can get to Alanya quickly and without problems - there is a bus stop near the hotel where buses leave regularly.  On the way back, by the way, they make a stop for those who want to buy souvenirs and sweets. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sui resort hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2080932.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  A few words are also worth mentioning about it, because in Turkey, at the Sui Resort Hotel 5 *, many go with children, who should not be bored.

Having ordered a SPA-program, the guest goes to the world of pleasures for several hours, where he is hovering, scrubbing, massaging, doing all kinds of peeling with masks, and, of course, drinking delicious herbal tea. </p><p>  And the pools here are good - clean, with a minimal smell of bleach.  There are slides, by the way.  For children, it‚Äôs true - but they have fun there all day.  In the meantime, kids frolic in the water - adults relax on sun loungers with cold or strong cocktails. </p>

    <h2>  Tips from experienced tourists </h2><p>  Travelers who have already been to Alanya at Sui Resort Hotel 5 * love to share recommendations that can help other people who are just going here.  Here's what they say: </p><ul><li>  It is better not to book apartments located on the minus floors.  Since they have a view of the concrete wall from the outside, and from the other, the pool, where it is always noisy, because the animation takes place there. </li><li>  If possible, it is better to plan a vacation in mid-late spring or early fall.  But at least - not in July-August.  At this time, the hotel has a lot of vacationers with children, and you can only dream of silence, especially during breakfast / lunch / dinner. </li><li>  If you suddenly needed to replace a towel, linen or something to remove - just find a maid in the hallway and ask her about it. </li></ul><p>  So in general <span>, the Sui Resort Hotel 5 *</span> leaves a positive impression.  If you want to relax somewhere in Turkey on an all-inclusive basis, then you can consider it as one of the main options. </p>
