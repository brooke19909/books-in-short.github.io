They allow us to effectively combine sustainable development and financial stability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Car loan </h2><p>  Judging by the customer reviews of Rusfinance Bank, its activities are primarily focused on three areas.  These are car loans, consumer loans and cash loans.  We will tell about each of them in the most detail. </p><p>  The company is a partner of a large number of car dealerships and car dealers throughout the country, it is actively developing a car loan program.  Here you can get a loan to purchase a new car of any make and any model, as well as a used one, even if you make a purchase from a private person. </p><p>  In each of these cases, a loan can be provided in an amount equal to 90% of the value of the car.

It includes immediately the life and health insurance of the borrower, as well as CASCO.  When you include it in the loan amount, the interest rate is reduced. </p><h2>  Consumer loan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gtreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract signing" class="if uuid-2934827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2934827.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most popular banking products is consumer credit.

Everything can be done right in the store. </p><h2>  Cash loan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="emerging-europe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan processing" class="if uuid-2934828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2934828.jpg"></div><p>  In any branch of the bank you can get a cash loan for any purpose.  Amount - from 5 to 50 thousand rubles.  Moreover, for loyal customers, the loan amount can be increased to 450 thousand rubles.  It is worth noting that the amount of the monthly repayment is fixed immediately, and then does not change throughout the repayment term. </p><p>  To obtain a loan, you must fill out the appropriate application at the bank office, submit the necessary documents.

Permanent registration is required, as well as that the actual place of work and residence are in the same region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After making a positive decision, the bank transfers the funds to the account of the borrower. </p><h2>  Cards </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cochange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit cards" class="if uuid-2934826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2934826.jpg"></div><p>  In this financial institution it is possible to get a credit card.  The credit limit for such a card is from 40 to 150 thousand rubles.  It is worth paying attention to users that a fee is charged for servicing and providing a card.  This amount can be up to 500 rubles. </p><p>  The interest rate on the debt of excess limits is from 31 to 35%.  Moreover, there is a revolving credit limit on the card up to 150 thousand rubles, as well as a grace period of 50 days.

True, in fact, they are not placed on the accounts of Rusfinance Bank itself, but of Rosbank. </p><p>  The basic contribution is "150 years of reliability."  Its amount should be from 15 thousand rubles, and the minimum period is three months.  Interest rate from 5 to 5.7% (if you decide to withdraw money after three years).  Interest is accrued at the end of the term, and then they are paid. </p><p>  The ATM deposit can be opened with 3 thousand rubles in the account.  The minimum term is three months.

Interest is calculated monthly; there is the possibility of auto-prolongation, replenishment and partial withdrawal. </p><h2>  Impressions of cooperation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pfgfx.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Employees of Rusfinance Bank" class="if uuid-2933276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2933276.jpg"></div><p>  Positive feedback from Rusfinance Bank customers is mainly related to the high quality of service and services that they are ready to offer in the branches of a financial institution. </p><p>  For example, customers note that employees express a willingness to fulfill their requests, even if they arrive at the very end of the working day before closing.  Many are imbued with the professionalism of bank employees who correctly and quickly carry out all operations, provide all the necessary assistance. </p><p>  In the customer reviews of LLC Rusfinance Bank you can find a large number of positive ratings when registering an institution with car loans.  Users admit that they use such services regularly after they successfully manage to arrange one of the loans.  It is possible to repay loans ahead of schedule, without delay and commissions.  Separately, reviews of Rusfinance Bank in Moscow and other cities emphasize the corporate ethics of employees who always greet each client with a smile, communicate politely, and are ready to give competent answers to any question.  Indeed, it is for ordinary employees that the visitor has the impression as a whole of a financial institution. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cheb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Rusfinance Bank" class="if uuid-2933281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2933281.jpg"></div><p>  It should be recognized that there are much more negative reviews about the work of Rusfinance Bank.  Often you have to deal with overt unprofessionalism.  For example, when bank employees start calling citizens regularly, claiming that they have a loan debt to their financial institution.  Although in reality they were never even his clients.  All this leads to a large number of negative customer reviews about Rusfinance Bank in Tula and other cities of our country.  Moreover, it becomes obvious that in the future these people will never use the services of this bank.  Moreover, questions arise from where the employees of the credit institution received personal data and the phone number of a citizen who had never even been their client. </p><p>  There are dissatisfied customer reviews of loans at Rusfinance Bank, which were issued in stores when purchasing large-sized household appliances.  For example, many are outraged that it is impossible to make a monthly payment in installments, you can only pay it off in full.  Appeal to the administrator and management does not help in any way, the result is still zero.  In such situations, clients not only write a negative review about Rusfinance Bank, but also strive to close the entire loan at once, although it may be inconvenient for them.  People do this in order not to face similar problems every month.  As a result, such an attitude towards their customers has a bad effect on the bank‚Äôs reputation; moreover, it loses the additional profit from the interest that the user would contribute for several months.  Moreover, one gets the feeling that the financial institution saves on cashiers, since payment can only be made through a slowly working and inconvenient terminal.  All this leads to the publication of a large number of bad customer reviews about Rusfinance Bank in Moscow and other cities. </p><h2>  Cheating and incompetence </h2><p>  Such whacky epithets are often characterized by the work of the bank by visitors who had the misfortune to use one or another of its products.  For example, negative customer reviews of cash loans at Rusfinance Bank simply discourage other users from contacting this financial institution. </p><p>  Regular claims are related to the fact that if you want to early pay off the entire balance of the debt, the client asks the employee to calculate the amount of the balance of the debt, and he gives him incorrect information.  It must be emphasized that he himself cannot know her, the prerogative of her presentation belongs to the bank, which is prescribed in the loan agreement.  If the operator makes a mistake by setting the wrong amount for the client, for example, less than thousands or several hundred rubles, then after some time the visitor begins to pester the requirements to pay off the remaining debt. </p><p>  Some visitors after experiencing this situation left a bad review about the cash loan at Rusfinance Bank and even suspected a whole scheme of cheating customers in this way. </p><p>  Often, when you try to pay the next loan payment, it simply does not work.  Moreover, the user learns about this only after a few days, which immediately leads to negative customer feedback about the loan at Rusfinance Bank.  Moreover, when clarifying all the information, it turns out that the company does not even have a free hotline.  On the phone, none of the employees is able to help with anything, just recommend writing about their problem to the post office or the website of a financial institution. </p><p>  Judging by customer reviews of loans at LLC Rusfinance Bank, problems arise even when applying for loans for cars, although some praise the work of a financial institution in this area.  It immediately raises doubts when the services of this particular bank are actively imposed by managers at the car dealership, although they should be disinterested people who do not care where you get the loan.  Faced with this organization, certain customers are even advised to take out a loan at a higher percentage than to contact this institution. </p><p>  Problems begin with paperwork when the originally promised rate rises by almost 2%.  In addition, the client is refused a loan without life and health insurance, even though the person agreed to a higher percentage. </p><p>  After completing all the necessary documents, the client‚Äôs attempts to return the imposed insurance are unsuccessful.  The bank itself does not issue an insurance contract, which is an obvious violation.  They refuse to issue it even at the insurance company, sending the client to study the general provisions on the site, emphasizing that he may not even count on the return of his money.  Borrowers have to submit written complaints to the prosecutor's office and to the regional branch of the Central Bank, which negatively affects the reputation of the financial institution. </p><h2>  Imposed Services </h2><p>  A large number of reviews of cash loans in Rusfinance Bank can be found due to the imposed services, some of which the client may simply not be informed about.  For example, this refers to writing off a commission of 999 rubles when applying for a loan, which the client is not even informed about. </p><p>  Moreover, they have the peculiarity of connecting the SMS-informing service, about which they also notify anyone.  Information about this can be found in customer reviews of credit cards at Rusfinance Bank and in the design of other products.  As it turns out later, this service is not cheap - its cost is 4 800 rubles. </p><p>  It is worth being careful when bank employees promise to apply by installments when buying expensive things, but in reality it turns out to be a full-fledged loan.  For example, in some situations, an employee of a financial institution personally comes to the store to draw up all the necessary documents, assures that this will be an installment plan, for which the client does not have to pay any interest.  At the same time, when agreeing on a payment schedule, it turns out that a monthly loan servicing rate of 24% is included. </p><p>  Further, often bank employees begin to openly be rude and unflattering about customers, accusing them of illiteracy and incompetence, and they are engaged in frankly imposing services, trying to earn as much as possible on each visitor, without worrying about observing his rights. </p><p>  All these cases clearly indicate that in most situations, bank employees do not give a damn about customers and their immediate responsibilities.  They practice imposing unnecessary services on anyone, even debiting funds from the accounts of borrowers without notifying them of an additional service that no one is using.  An example is the connection of SMS informing unilaterally.  It is worth recognizing that after complaints to the support service and relevant appeals, this service is canceled, and the deducted money is returned to the client in full.  All this once again proves how important it is to carefully study the loan agreement for additional fees and services that you really do not need. </p>
