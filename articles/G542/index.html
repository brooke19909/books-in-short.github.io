    <p>  This entertaining story is about how to make a million on human problems.  During the repair process in the bathroom, an ordinary average American David Reynolds <span>broke his arm.</span>  Having discharged from the hospital, he faced an urgent problem - gypsum did not give the opportunity to fully take a bath and even a shower.  After all, as you know, it is impossible to wet it.  What poor David did not invent to find a way out of this unpleasant situation!  He wrapped his hand in waterproof film, put garbage bags on it and even a camera from the car, but the gypsum got wet anyway.  Having run around all the pharmacies in search of a special cover for his hand, he realized that such a device simply does not exist in nature.  And then he came up with a brilliant business idea - to create it with his own hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make your first million" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10496/87730.jpg" width="200"></div>

Together with his colleague and <span>old friend,</span> he created a company for the production of these devices and began selling from small pharmacies in his city.  At first, the goods were purchased reluctantly, breaking into the market was far from easy.  But, turning a blind eye to temporary difficulties, friends stubbornly walked toward their goal.  And, two years later, they signed a contract with a large pharmacy chain and a dozen smaller pharmacies.  To date, the company successfully implements many different models of waterproof covers through wholesale distributors and its own website.  And David, who previously worked as a simple dealer, now earns about two million dollars a year. </p><p>  <strong>The History of Fraser Doherty</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a million from scratch" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10496/87729.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <p>  This guy started his business at the age of 14 and already then knew very well how to earn his first million.  At that time, he was actively fond of cooking and was happy to cook a variety of jams according to his grandmother‚Äôs recipe.  Numerous friends, neighbors and even parishioners of the church constantly turned to the boy with a request to prepare a delicious jam for them.  Soon, the rumor about this amazing delicacy spread far beyond the borders of Fraser's hometown.  The abundance of incoming orders forced the boy to rent a room in which about 200 people began to work.  At 16, Fraser decided to devote himself entirely to business and dropped out of school.  Then he signed a contract with a chain of supermarkets for the supply of jam.  So at age 21, the guy earned his first million dollars. </p><p>  Today, his working day is devoted mainly to the search for new <span>distribution channels for</span> products and managerial work.  Doherty became the author of two books, one of which is devoted to the organization of his own business.  Perhaps by reading this publication, you will also understand how to make a million. </p>
