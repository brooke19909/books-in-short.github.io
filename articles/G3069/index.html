Prior to the above transactions, the boundaries of the plot should be determined, and the land should have clear coordinates.

    <h2>  Site coordinates </h2><p>  When making a purchase and sale transaction, a situation very often arises when the buyer wants to know the coordinates at the site address.  Those people who have already experienced land acquisition know how important it is to know its exact location (borders).  This largely determines the value of the allotment.  If the boundaries before the transaction were not determined, then it is necessary to invite a cadastral engineer who will conduct the demarcation and issue a boundary plan. </p>

    <h2>  Boundary definition </h2><p>  How to find out your coordinates, prompt in the appropriate land authority.  It is enough to apply there with civil and cadastral passports.  The staff of the body will provide all the information they have.  But this is only if, in relation to land, the registration procedure was previously passed. </p><p>  With the previous registration, it becomes clear how to find out the coordinates of the site by cadastral number.  It should only be remembered that obtaining the above information is a paid procedure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost all lands of any categories are subject to mandatory state registration.  There are three types of land (in military countries, water resources and reserves) that do not need to be registered.  The legislation does not provide for this.  This is due to the impossibility of making any transactions with alienation. </p><p>  All others belonging to citizens or organizations must have assigned individual numbers, that is, entered in the inventory. </p><h2>  Land surveying </h2><p>  Land surveying is necessary for those who are interested in how to find out their coordinates.  The <span>cadastral engineer is</span> engaged in this <span>.</span>  The procedure is paid and very expensive.  But it is necessary to survey the site, so that subsequently it is possible to conduct any transactions with it (sell, give).  This is also done if you wish to increase your ownership by joining neighboring land for ransom.  The procedure is quite legal, but it is carried out and fixed by the same cadastral engineer.  If unauthorized land is arbitrarily attached, then this act will be considered self-capture.  And this entails <span>penalties.</span> </p><p>  In any case, disputes regarding land plots do not violate the laws.  Acquiring the status of the legal owner of the site is easy.  It is enough to perform certain procedures and get the appropriate documents on hand that will solve the problem with how to find out your coordinates.  It is best to carry out the procedure for determining the boundaries of the site as soon as the opportunity arises.  Because it is not carried out in a few minutes.  Its implementation may take days, or even months. </p><p>  It is much worse when the plot needs to be urgently sold, and its borders have not yet been determined and the deal cannot be concluded.  After all, the buyer must be sure for what and to what extent he pays his own money. </p><p>  In ancient times, sites were issued and measured out "by eye" or in steps.  Only relatively recently have they begun to lie exactly in their coordinates and register with a government agency.  At present, many difficulties and controversial situations arise if one neighbor has carried out a survey, and the other has not yet.  Who will be right?  This can only be solved by carrying out the <span>land surveying</span> procedure described above <span>.</span> </p><p>  Knowing the coordinates of your site, or rather, having the documents where they are indicated, is very important.  The papers confirm that the plot actually exists, that it has a legal owner who does not violate the borders of other adjacent plots. </p><p>  In addition, after assigning the cadastral number to the land, it is entered in the register and cadastral map.  By it you can find out not only the place where the site is located, but also who its owner is and what is the value of this position.  This can be done through the Internet, where the public cadastral map is located online. </p>
