On the fronts and in the rear, millions of people defended their homeland from invaders.  One of the brave defenders was the Russian hero Ivan Muzychenko.  During the war, he participated in the battle of Uman, during which he was injured and was captured by the enemy. </p><p>  The bloody battle near Uman is one of the most poorly studied episodes of the war of 1941-1945.  Archival documents reveal the details of the battle and shed light on the fate of its participants.  The following is a biography of Muzychenko Ivan Nikolaevich. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  Ivan Muzychenko was born on October 29, 1901 in the city of Rostov-on-Don.  His father was a sailor.  Subsequently, the veteran shared his childhood memories and nostalgically recalled the times when his father returned from swimming and the children joyfully greeted him.  Nikolai Muzychenko brought presents to the children and told them about his travels. </p><p>  Ivan graduated from a three-year school and two classes of teacher seminary.  He started working early to help his family.  At 13, he worked as a bookbinder, and two years later he got a job as a loader in the Vyborg port.  He was hardworking, not afraid of hard work and diligently performed his duties. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Civil War" class="if uuid-2871708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871708.jpg"></div><p>  Ivan Nikolaevich joined the ranks of the Red Army as a volunteer in June 1918.  He added one year to his age to be accepted.  The comrades-in-arms noted their courage and courage in battle.  During the Civil War, he received five injuries, but did not leave the army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For Muzychenko, 1918 was marked by participation in hostilities against Ukrainian rebels under the leadership of Nestor Makhno.  In 1918 - 1920, he fought against Estonian forces;  in 1920 he took part in hostilities on the Western Front;  in 1921 he participated in the suppression of the Tambov uprising. </p><p>  From 1921 to 1926, Muzychenko served as commissar of the cavalry regiment. </p><p>  For military successes and courage shown in battles, Ivan Nikolaevich was awarded a rare award in those years - the Order of the Red Banner. </p><h2>  Winter War of 1939 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="linkrandom.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet-Finnish War" class="if uuid-2871621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871621.jpg"></div><p>  In 1927, Ivan Nikolaevich was trained in advanced training courses for command personnel.  In 1932-1937 he held the post of commander of the 21st Cavalry Don-Stavropol Regiment, then took command of the 4th Cavalry Division.  February 17, 1938 became a brigade commander.  As a brigade commander of the 4th Infantry Division, he participated in the Winter War (conflict between the USSR and Finland).  Since March 21, 1940 he became the commander of the division. </p><p>  For military distinction in breaking the Mannerheim Line, Ivan Muzychenko was awarded the Order of Lenin and was awarded the high rank of Lieutenant General.  It should be noted that Ivan Nikolaevich was in good standing with the command, so he quickly promoted and enjoyed authority among his military comrades.  In July 1940, for high military merits, he was appointed commander of the sixth army. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  An important stage in the biography of Ivan Konstantinovich Muzychenko, which had a strong influence on his entire future life, was his participation in the war against fascist Germany.  In the Soviet Union there was not a single family that would not be affected by this terrible tragedy.  The Muzychenko family was no exception. </p><p>  By the beginning of the war, Ivan Nikolaevich was a battle-hardened and experienced commander.  The Sixth Army under his command was part of the Southwestern Front.  And at the initial stage of the war, she participated in border battles.  The decisive battle for the 6th Army began in July 1941.  The battle of Uman is one of the hardest pages in the history of the Soviet state. </p><h2>  Battle of Uman </h2><p>  Chronicle of events: </p><ul><li>  July 10 - the general command of the units operating in the South-West direction was transferred to S. M. Budyonny. </li><li>  Mid-July - Kleist‚Äôs army turned south into the rear of the 6th and 12th armies, which from July 15 were forced to fight in a semi-environment. </li><li>  On July 16, the offensive of the 48th motorized corps of the German army resumed.  Having broken the stubborn resistance of the Soviet troops, the 16th Panzer Division captured the city of Kazatin.  By July 17, she managed to take possession of the station Ros, which the next day was recaptured by the Red Army. </li><li>  On July 18, Budyonny reported in a report that the enemy had finally broken through the front of the 12th army, which created a threat to the rear of the 6th army.  Budyonny realized that further resistance of the 6th and 12th armies could lead to their encirclement and complete destruction.  The headquarters agreed on the retreat of the armies, but the plans of the Soviet army became known to the enemy. </li><li>  July 18 - 22 - fierce battles were fought between opponents, which led to heavy losses in the Soviet troops.  Significant progress was not achieved. </li><li>  July 21 - the troops of the 6th and 12th armies inflicted a strong blow on the enemy‚Äôs division, as a result of which they managed to make a breakthrough 15 kilometers wide.  The troops of Ivan Muzychenko in difficult conditions in the light of day fought rear-guard battles, restraining the advance of the enemy troops from the north, west and south, and at night retreated to the east. </li><li>  On August 1, the leadership of the 6th and 12th armies realized the impossibility of carrying out a rush in the northeast and east directions.  It took no more than a week for the remnants of the two armies to be fettered by twenty-two enemy divisions. </li><li>  On the night of August 6, the troops in the encirclement planned to make a breakthrough and moved south. </li></ul><h2>  Battle results </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pomnivoinu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uman Pit" class="if uuid-2871606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871606.jpg"></div><p>  The deaths of the troops of the 6th and 12th armies of the South-Western Front followed.  Many talented commanders were captured, including Ivan Muzychenko.  The battle of Uman ended in an environment from which about 10 thousand fighters managed to get out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  About 60 thousand soldiers were placed in the <span>"Uman pit"</span> - an unofficial name for the concentration camp created by the Nazis near the city of Uman.  The prisoners were held in harsh conditions, daily killed more than a hundred people. </p><p>  At the cost of their lives, the brave soldiers who fought in this terrible battle were able to delay the advance of the armed forces of the enemy.  As a result, valuable time was won, during which part of the industry was evacuated to the east of the country. </p><h2>  German captivity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet generals" class="if uuid-2871614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871614.jpg"></div><p>  On August 6, 1941, Ivan Muzychenko was injured and was captured.  He was sent to a German hospital in Rivne, and then to a hospital in Vladimir-Volynsky.  After a short treatment, he ended up in the Hammelburg prisoner of war camp.  Muzychenko answered the Germans' offers to go to their service with a sharp refusal, categorically rejecting the humiliating proposals of the enemies of his Motherland for cooperation. </p><p>  The commander of the Russian Liberation Army (ROA) Andrei Vlasov suggested Muzychenko to join the ROA, but received a categorical refusal.  Subsequently, Vlasov was convicted of high treason and executed by hanging on August 1, 1946. </p><p>  In punishment for refusing to go over to the enemy‚Äôs side, it was decided to transfer Muzychenko to a prison in the Weissenburg fortress, in which prisoners were held in difficult conditions.  In prison, he became the head of an underground organization of generals who were captured. </p><p>  In captivity, Ivan Nikolaevich met with the former commanders of the armies of the Southwestern Front - Mikhail Ivanovich Potapov and Pavel Grigoryevich Ponedelin.  After returning from captivity, M.I. Potapov was reinstated in the service and continued his military career.  Another fate overtook P. G. Ponedelin.  He was convicted of treason and sentenced to death.  On March 13, 1956, he was rehabilitated posthumously. </p><p>  Ivan Nikolaevich was in the camp of Mossburg, from which he, along with other prisoners of war, was released by the forces of the American army on April 29, 1945.  The prisoner was physically and morally difficult for the general. </p><h2>  Post-war time </h2><p>  After being released from German captivity, Soviet generals were sent for treatment to a hospital on the banks of the Danube.  A month later, they were taken to the representative office of the Soviet military mission in Paris.  In the capital of the Soviet military were invited to various receptions and meetings, arranged tours for them at museums, art galleries and medieval French palaces. </p><p>  June 21, the generals arrived in Moscow.  Until December, Ivan Muzychenko underwent a state audit, as a result of which he was reinstated in the rank and in the party, he was returned the awards that he was awarded for participating in World War II.  Soon, Ivan Nikolaevich was appointed to the post of deputy commander of the Volga Military District. </p><p>  At the end of 1946, Muzychenko was sent to courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff.  The activities of the Military Academy of the General Staff in the post-war period were aimed at improving the training system for command and control of the Armed Forces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General Staff Military Academy" class="if uuid-2871726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871726.jpg"></div><p>  A year later, he successfully completed his studies.  Injuries, concussion and deprivation during his stay in the prisoner of war camp undermined the general‚Äôs health, so he could not return to public service and in December 1947 resigned. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  After his resignation, Ivan Nikolayevich Muzychenko lived in Moscow and participated in the military scientific society, which was the country's largest cultural and educational army center. </p><p>  December 8, 1970 Ivan Nikolaevich passed away.  At the time of his death, he was 69 years old.  The urn with the ashes of the general is stored in the columbarium of the Novodevichy cemetery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gravestone in the cemetery" class="if uuid-2871607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871607.jpg"></div><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  General Muzychenko Ivan Nikolaevich was awarded four orders of the Red Banner, which were awarded for the special courage and courage shown in the defense of the Fatherland.  Awards were presented to him in 1938, 1940, 1946, and 1957. </p><p>  In 1946, the Order of Lenin was awarded to the Russian hero.  The award wording contains the following wording: "For participation in the Great Patriotic War and received heavy concussion in battles, he is worthy of being awarded the Order of Lenin." </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The order of Lenin" class="if uuid-2871743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104318/2871743.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the above awards, Ivan Nikolayevich was awarded medals that his descendants are currently taking care of and demonstrate as a heirloom to people who are interested in the life of the brave participant of the Great Patriotic War, Muzychenko Ivan Nikolaevich. </p>
