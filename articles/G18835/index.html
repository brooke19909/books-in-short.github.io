  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much does a pilot earn? Civil Aviation Pilot Salary</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It seems to many that the work of a pilot does not require special knowledge and efforts.  Modern aircraft have an excellent complete set, an electronic and safety system.  The pilot can only gain the desired height, select the desired course, and you can safely transfer control of the aircraft to the autopilot.  In fact, the prestigious position of a pilot must be earned through long-term training, internships and medical examinations.  Constant checks and medical examinations accompany pilots throughout their career.  And they have a huge responsibility for the lives of numerous passengers.  The article tells how much the pilot earns, as well as what his salary depends on. </p><h2>  Air gradation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="epicflightacademy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do pilots earn per flight" class="if uuid-2905766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2905766.jpg"></div><p>  Aviation education is expensive.  And there is no guarantee that the money invested in training will pay off properly in the future.  But if the pilot manages to climb the career ladder, his income will be worthy.  Before answering the question: ‚ÄúHow much does a pilot earn?‚Äù, It is worth clarifying what air gradation exists. </p><p>  Pilots are: </p><ul><li>  military; </li><li>  civil aviation controllers. </li></ul><p>  These are two different categories of pilots, therefore their salaries are different.  The most severe selection for pilots occurs already at the stage of admission to the university.  Candidates are checked not only the level of knowledge, but also their psychological, moral qualities.  At any stage of training, the future pilot can be expelled for non-compliance with certain requirements.  The path to altitude is thorny and difficult, but it‚Äôs worth it, because the pilot‚Äôs salary is really high. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Military pilots </h2><div class="photo" data-original="work.chron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese pilot" class="if uuid-2905751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2905751.jpg"></div><p>  Their remuneration directly depends on the available military rank and position.  Their salary is fixed, but bonuses for the complexity of the flight are added to it.  Sometimes they make up 100% of the main cash payments.  The salary of a pilot with the appropriate rank and piloting on military aircraft is about 100,000 rubles per month.  This figure includes the salary of the pilot and surcharges for flights of varying complexity. </p><h2>  Civil Aircraft </h2><p>  The salary of a civil aviation pilot depends on several factors: </p><ol><li>  The place of work is the prestige of the airline. </li><li>  Type of aircraft. </li><li>  Experience. </li><li>  Flight schedule. </li></ol><p>  In reputable large airlines, aircraft have high-tech equipment that meets all modern requirements.
