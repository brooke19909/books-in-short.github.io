    <h2>  Depending on hobbies </h2><p>  Before you go directly to the choice, you need to know <span>what</span> people are <span>fond of</span> .  Someone loves extreme relaxation, someone just actively spend time.  Others prefer to spend leisure time, immersed in virtual reality, or something else.  In any case, the future gift must be selected based on these data. </p><p>  So, for a man who never plays computer games and consoles, it is foolish to give a game console.  It is for this simple reason that you first need to think about what kind of gift will be really useful, and not just a gesture of attention. </p><h2>  Useful gadgets as a gift to a man </h2><p>  Currently, there are a huge number of electronic devices that greatly facilitate our daily lives: <span>smart watches,</span> alarms, tablets, fitness bracelets and sports watches.  This is not the whole list of what helps to make our life easier and more comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An excellent gift for an active young man will be a ‚Äúsmart bracelet‚Äù or watch.  Such a device allows you to correctly change the phases of sleep, so that the body rests as efficiently as possible.  The bracelet assists in the preparation of a training program and daily routine.  All this is extremely useful.  In addition, such a device, if it is not Chinese, is reliably protected from moisture and dust, and is also shockproof.  This is a great gift for a man who values ‚Äã‚Äãhis time and wants to be always in shape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gadgets as a gift to a man" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/1670049.jpg" width="600"></div>
