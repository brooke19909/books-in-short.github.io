Sights of the Military Sukhumi road are numerous and diverse. </p><h2>  Original building </h2><p>  An interesting temple is located on the southeastern edge of Merheul.  Unlike others located in Abkhazia, it does not have an altar semicircle.  It consists of one hall and two aisles.  The hall has a narrowing on the east side.

One of them is the Voronovskaya estate, located on the 17th kilometer.  Voronov was a major scientist, publisher of the Kavkaz newspaper, a like-minded person of Herzen, Chernyshevsky, Ogarev.  From 1903 to 1918, a connection between the Transcaucasian and Petrograd revolutionaries was carried out through his house.  Currently, only one house from the end of the 19th century is left from the estate.  Inside it are a library and furniture of the time.  In the old days, the estate consisted of several buildings, and among them, in addition to the master's house, there was a dining room, a kitchen, and a pantry.  The estate was surrounded by a magnificent garden with fruit trees, as well as alleys of poplars and plane trees. </p>

    <p>  Many more interesting things can be seen when traveling along the Military Sukhumi road.  This is a cave in which ancient people lived 10 thousand years ago, dolmens near Lake Amtkel, an iron bridge that spans across Jampal, the ruins of medieval buildings, and other ancient monuments.  Along the way, natural beauties, rivers, mountains, waterfalls, boxwood thickets open. </p><p>  But the Military-Sukhumi road, the restoration of which is in the plans of our country, has several problems.  It is partially littered with boulders, washed out by showers.  However, the funds spent on clearing and asphalting should pay off.  After all, this route to the Black Sea coast is 300 km shorter than the existing ones. </p>
