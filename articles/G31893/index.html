  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The dynamic range of cameras: a description of the concept, a review of manufacturers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world of photography, there is much that is interesting and incomprehensible to the average user.  However, professional photographers who are specially trained in this craft are able to understand all this and produce superb pictures in beauty.  One of these features is the dynamic range of cameras.  To the average user, this phrase does not mean anything.  And a professional photographer can choose a good camera for this parameter.  And now we will analyze the interpretation of this concept and what is affected by the dynamic range.  First, some general information. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.diyphotography.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dynamic range of cameras" class="if uuid-3026494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026494.jpg"></div><h2>  What is dynamic range? </h2><p>  In simple words, the dynamic range of the camera is the amount of detail that the device can ‚Äúpull‚Äù out of light and dark objects without light or dimming.  The fact is that modern cameras actually have a very small dynamic range.  And if the image has a sharp transition from light to shadow, then with an absolute guarantee something will be highlighted or darkened.  And it makes no difference whether the exposure is correct or not.  Modern professional cameras have a dynamic range of 8-10 feet (a special measure for DD).  While the human eye easily perceives 12-15 feet.  And ordinary digital soap dishes barely stretch 6 feet.  Naturally, in such conditions there can be no talk of any dynamic range.  That is why it is worth buying a DSLR (at least at the initial level).  They have the widest dynamic range at the moment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out what range the device has? </h2><p>  How to find out the dynamic range of the camera?  Typically, manufacturers write this information in the characteristics of the device.  But some neglect these numbers.  Although even if it is there, you should not rely on these numbers.  What could be written?  Better to check in practice.  You need to find a site with a contrasting transition from light to shadow and try to photograph it at different exposure parameters.  If the device manages to ‚Äúpull out‚Äù the details from the shadow, then everything is in order with the dynamic range.  By the way, many SLRs are capable of this.  And here is a list of cameras with the best dynamic range. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dynamic range of the canon camera" class="if uuid-3026500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026500.jpg"></div><h2>  Canon EOS 1D X Mark II </h2><p>  Cool camera for professionals.  Applies to cameras with a large dynamic range.  This handsome man is able to "stretch" almost any frame.  The remaining technical specifications are also excellent.  "Mark 2" has a full-sized DSLR matrix with a resolution of 21.5 megapixels.  Excellent result.  Also, this camera belongs to the category of wide format cameras.  That is why professionals love it so much.  This unit has the ability to shoot video in 4K resolution at a speed of 60 frames per second.  The ISO range is from 100 to 51,200. This camera delivers stunning quality pictures thanks to its advanced matrix and incredibly wide dynamic range.  At the same time, this camera is too expensive for the average user.  Its price exceeds 400 thousand rubles.  It is far from affordable for many.  However, there are other models with a wide dynamic range of cameras. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dynamic range of camera matrices" class="if uuid-3026504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026504.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D750 </h2><p>  Nikon's ‚ÄúDSLR‚Äù is one of the best in its class.  Specifically, this model has a wide dynamic range.  But here it is not the main thing.  And most importantly, the camera has a full-sized matrix.  With all the ensuing consequences.  This means that the device will be able to produce amazing beauty and quality photographs under almost any shooting conditions.  The dynamic range of the Nikon d750 camera‚Äôs matrix allows you to ‚Äústretch‚Äù even the most hopeless shots.  Many semi-professional "DSLRs" are far from the "Nikons" in this regard.  The camera has a 24.9 megapixel sensor.  The device can shoot video in 4K at a speed of 60 frames per second and has incredibly fast autofocus.  It makes it easy to shoot even fast-moving objects.  Another advantage of this camera is the price.  It is cheaper than the previous instance.  And the difference is very significant.  This camera is already available to many.  Therefore, it is in very steady demand.  However, we move on to other instances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amateurphotographer.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to compare the dynamic range of cameras" class="if uuid-3026507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026507.jpg"></div><h2>  Canon EOS 5D Mark IV </h2><p>  The dynamic range of the Canon camera is its undeniable advantage over models from other manufacturers.  And ‚ÄúMark 4‚Äù also has very impressive technical characteristics for a camera of this class.  Here, a DSLR-type matrix with a resolution of 31.7 megapixels is installed.  There is fast autofocus, an optical lens and a decent ISO range.  And of course, there is optical image stabilization.  Without it, a camera of this level simply can not do.  This camera can shoot video in 4K at a speed of 30 frames per second.  However, the video quality is poor.  It is understandable.  This camera is designed for photos, not for video at all.  But the photos are very beautiful and high quality.  And the dynamic range of the camera just influences this.  The cost of this model is 230 thousand rubles.  This is the average price.  Many models of this class are significantly more expensive.  But this one is aimed at amateurs and enthusiasts.  Therefore, the price is that.  Now move on to the next model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="camera dynamic range comparison" class="if uuid-3026511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026511.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D500 </h2><p>  This camera is best suited for sports photographers and wildlife enthusiasts.  Why?  Because it has lightning fast and almost always accurate auto focus.  The autofocus system migrated here from the flagship (and very expensive) models from Nikon.  This model was released back in 2016, but still has not lost its relevance.  The camera has a full-fledged DSLR sensor with a resolution of 21.5 megapixels.  There is a decent ISO range and a very impressive dynamic range (which is much more important).  Also, the camera boasts the presence of optical stabilization and the ability to record video in 4K at a speed of 30 frames per second.  At the same time, the camera has an optical viewfinder.  This camera is perfect for beginners, as it has a very advanced (and well-tuned) automatic shooting mode.  And users will appreciate the price.  She is much less than 200 thousand rubles, which they ask for the previous model.  Let's move on to the next instance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high dynamic range cameras" class="if uuid-3026515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026515.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D7200 </h2><p>  And again, Nikon.  This time the model of 2015 release.  It has a very wide dynamic range for cameras of this class.  It boasts other technical specifications.  For example, the device has a full-frame DSLR-matrix with a resolution of 24.5 megapixels.  This means that the camera is capable of producing high-quality photographs under any lighting conditions.  At the same time, a very advanced autofocus and optical viewfinder appear at the user's disposal.  Another key feature of this camera is the ability to shoot video in 4K resolution at a speed of 30 frames per second.  But the main thing is the dynamic range of the camera.  Comparison with other models (even from the same manufacturer) showed that with this camera, things with the range are much better than others.  And this should be the main incentive for the acquisition of this particular ‚ÄúNikon‚Äù.  If you still have doubts, here is the final chord: the price of the device does not exceed 70 thousand rubles.  This is almost for nothing, given the class of the camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the dynamic range in digital cameras" class="if uuid-3026520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3026520.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikon D3300 </h2><p>  Ultra-budget model from Nikon.  Perfect for beginners.  But professionals will not be satisfied.  The fact is that the characteristics of the camera are quite modest.  Even despite the wide dynamic range.  This camera has an APS-C type sensor with a resolution of 24.7 megapixels.  There is a decent level of auto focus and an optical viewfinder.  The video device shoots only in Full HD resolution at a speed of 30 frames per second.  Unfortunately, he is not capable of more.  But this camera boasts a very affordable price.  It costs only 25 thousand rubles.  This is the cheapest DSLR camera in our review.  Therefore, many can afford it.  In any case, this device will provide better photos than a standard digital soap dish.  And it is perfect for those who are just starting to become a photographer. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  So, we learned what the dynamic range is in digital cameras.  This is exactly what affects the quality of the display of details in the shadow on the image.  It is worth noting that many manufacturers offer very good cameras with a wide dynamic range.  But the trouble is that only SLR cameras have it.  And they are much more expensive than conventional digital soap dishes.  But it‚Äôs customary to pay for quality.  If you want to get high-quality photos, you will have to go broke on a high-quality camera and learn how to work with it.  This is an axiom. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At the moment, things with the dynamic range are not very good even in high-end cameras.  He cannot come close to the indicator that the human eye is able to distinguish.  Therefore, there is nothing more stupid than comparing the dynamic range of the camera and the human eye.  This is just an imperfection of technology.  However, when photographing, this aspect should be taken into account in order to select the correct exposure, competently ‚Äúpull out‚Äù details from darkened areas and not ‚Äúbrighten‚Äù bright ones.  But this requires practice.  And a good camera.  At least one of those described above.  Then everything will work out for sure. </p>
