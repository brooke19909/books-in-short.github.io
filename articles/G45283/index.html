And a new science arose - sociology, which aims to study society in all its aspects in order to solve global human problems.  How to determine sociology?  What is the structure and functions of sociology as a science? </p><p>  Sociology as a science is a doctrine of society, social relations and social communities. </p><p>  The object and subject of sociology is the <span>function of sociology.</span>  The structure and functions of sociology as a science.  The subject is the structure and functions of sociology. </p><p>  The object of any science is understood as what the research is aimed at.  And the subject of study is the relationships, sides and relationships that make up the object of study.  <span>The object of sociology</span> in particular is social reality.  <span>The subject of</span> sociology <span>research</span> is the activity of individuals, groups and <span>social communities.</span> </p><p>  The structure and functions of sociology. </p><p>  Functions: descriptive, informational, prognostic, cognitive, transformative, worldview. </p><ol><li>  Descriptive function.  The knowledge gained is systematized documented in the form of various kinds, books, scientific reports, articles.  On their basis, practical conclusions are formed and managerial decisions are made. </li><li>  Information function. </li></ol><p>  It is a collection, accumulation and systematization of information resulting from research.  Information is stored in computer memory in sociological centers and is provided for use in practical activities as necessary. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  <span>Predictive function.</span>  The result of a <span>sociological study</span> is a social long-term or short-term forecast.  The forecast is based on the autopsy of the factor affecting the object and the development trends of the social phenomenon. </li><li>  Cognitive Theory.  Assessment of the cognitive world is carried out from the position of the interests of the individual.  Sociology seeks to obtain and systematize new knowledge aimed at obtaining a general picture of the processes taking place in the world.  This allows you to determine what problems exist in society, what requires transformation and what does not. </li><li>  Conversion function. </li></ol><p>  At the end of the social research, conclusions, suggestions and recommendations are made on the basis of which managerial decisions are made.  That is, the theoretical calculations are embodied in practical activities. </p><ol><li>  Worldview function. </li></ol><p>  Sociology is actively influencing the socio-political life in society, contributing with its research to the progress of society. </p>

    <p>  The structure and functions of sociology. </p><p>  One of the most common is the division into theoretical and empirical sociology.  The division is based on the division of sociological knowledge into empirical and theoretical. </p><p>  There is a division, depending on the object of study, into metasociology and the theory of sociology.  The object of metasociology is sociology itself, namely its laws and cognitive capabilities.  And the theory of sociology studies social reality. </p><p>  Depending on the tasks and functions, fundamental sociology is distinguished, as well as theoretical and <span>applied sociology.</span>  The first solves the problems associated with the formation of knowledge about ongoing processes in social reality, the development of techniques and methods of sociological research, the derivation of sociological concepts.  The second is aimed at studying and solving problems arising in connection with the need to transform social reality. </p><p>  Sociology is very important, as its research is aimed at obtaining </p><p>  necessary experience.  Conclusions and the result is recorded on various media and subsequently used in practice.  This solves the most important and <span>global problems of</span> all mankind. </p>
