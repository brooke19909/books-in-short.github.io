It is very difficult to briefly and fully describe it, because neither Europe nor the rest of the planet has known such a conflict in the entire history of its existence.  This war revealed peculiar innovations of a completely different nature to the world: the first tanks, the use of chemical gases, the trench warfare tactics, the massacre of large-scale redistribution of territories around the world, and, finally, the unprecedented number of parties that took part in it. </p><p>  <span>World War I: A</span> Brief on the Prerequisites </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World War I briefly" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/263086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the beginning of the century, Europe developed very serious contradictions between the most influential states of that time.  The backbone of the Entente countries consisted of states that had survived the <span>industrial revolution</span> quite early and by that time had taken a very advantageous position in the world economic, naval and <span>colonial system.</span>  It is, first of all, about France and England.  In contrast to them, Germany reached its maximum development, having barely completed the industrial revolution, but still not having time to the table of separation of colonial possessions.  A discrepancy was established between the potential and the real role of Germany, in which several decades before the war, aggressive pan-Germanist sentiments grew.  Opponents of England and France, as well as, secondarily, Russia, became its natural allies.  For example, Austria-Hungary and Turkey had their interest in the Balkans, where during this period it was actively </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World War I briefly" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/261734.jpg" width="400"></div>  affirmed Russia.  The First World War, in short, was an inevitable consequence of growing contradictions.  Thus, conflict was inevitable sooner or later.

In fact, the Habsburg ball needed only an excuse to start a war, and they declared it on July 28, giving rise to bloody events. </p><p>  World War I: the course of (briefly) hostilities </p><p>  The fighting lasted more than four years and ended only in November 1918.  At the first stage of the war, the states of the Triple </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="World War I move briefly" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/261735.jpg" width="552"></div>  Union: the Germans in August were almost under Paris, but the entry into the conflict of Japan and several other states led to a protracted clash.  Gradually, the war took on a debilitating trench character, where none of the sides of the Western Front (French - Germans) could get an advantage.  The latter did have to fight on two fronts, dispersing their forces in the east in the struggle against the Romanov armies.  The forces of the Habsburg empire quickly enough demonstrated their archaism both technically, administratively and morally.  In March 1918, US troops came to the French front to help the French, after which German forces gradually began to retreat from their neighbors.  In early October, the situation for the Hohenzollern (German rulers) was so complicated that William II was forced to admit he was defeated on November 11, when it was 1918.

    <p>  World War I: results (briefly) </p><p>  This conflict was at that time the most widespread in the <span>history of mankind.</span>  It was attended by 38 states and more than 74 million people, of which about 10 million were killed and even more crippled.  But the main outcome of the war was the Versailles accords system, which put the defeated countries in a humiliating position, primarily Germany, and led to the next world war.  As a result of these agreements, the last empires were destroyed, and the triumph of nation-states was finally approved in Europe.  Another major result of the worldwide massacre was the people's revolution in the same Germany and especially in Russia. </p>
