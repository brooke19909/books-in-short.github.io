They are located on the front panel.  The size of the phone is 104x49x13 mm and weighs 107 grams.  The model is pleasantly in the hand.  This is due to the relatively small screen size.  All buttons of the front panel are touch type.  This solution can be called convenient.  A separate key launches the multimedia bar and is located above the screen.  On the side there is a paired key that provides volume control.  There is also a control for locking the screen.  The memory card slot is located on the left, and it is covered with a hinged lid.  There is also a SIM card slot.  At the top is the power button.  At the bottom there is a headset jack - 3.5 mm - and a charger, as well as microUSB.

Moreover, in this case, the developers managed to avoid the design based on the screw, thereby the device gained additional strength.  Plastic is inexpensive.  There is a glossy back panel.  The chrome edging placed around the screen gives the device a certain charm.  Among the minuses, we note that the rear panel is not very firmly attached, there is a certain backlash.  It is necessary to put on the panel carefully, and to click until the very end.  5 colors are available.  Conventionally, they can be divided into 2 groups.
