For the end consumer, this was a real gift, because healthy competition always leads to improved functionality and a significant reduction in market prices. </p>

    <p>  The focus of this article is the SJ4000 SJCAM WiFi Extreme Vacation Camera.  The characteristics, review and owner reviews will introduce the reader more closely to the wonderful product created by Chinese craftsmen.  A potential buyer will get acquainted not only with the original device, but also with a fake, which is very common in the domestic market and is slightly different from a certified product. </p><h2>  Market features </h2><p>  It is worth noting immediately that there are two modifications of the action camera on sale, which, having the same marking, differ significantly in price.  The fact is that there is an original version of the SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi product, the price of which is within 7000 rubles, and there is also a fake, which has a cost of about three thousand rubles.  In fact, these are two different devices, since there are significant differences between them both in quality and in functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Both versions of action cameras are in demand among potential buyers, and the point here is not at all the price.  In their reviews, many owners assure others that the non-original modification is more advanced in terms of functionality, albeit in damage to security.  But first things first. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  It is quite difficult to satisfy potential customers, especially when it comes to bundling.  So, fans of the Hero GoPro gadget complained that there were too many mounts in the box, which many remained unclaimed.  But as soon as the Xiaomi Yi camera appeared on the market without installation tools, users pounced on the manufacturer with accusations. </p>

    <p>  The Chinese manufacturer did not disappoint future owners and provided all the accessories necessary for shooting.  For SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi, this is a nice addition, since the installation kit, including the underwater box, costs more than one thousand rubles.  Accordingly, the user has a chance to save a lot. </p><h2>  Original equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the camera itself, the owner‚Äôs box will find a lot of interesting things in a seemingly plain box: a charger, a little instruction and a large assortment of all kinds of fasteners.  Plastic box for underwater shooting, clamps, mounts, straps - all for the convenience of working in extreme conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Confuses only the bundled device SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi instruction.  It is written in Chinese.  Yes, the manual has color pictures and various schemes, having studied which, you can easily perform the necessary actions, but the lack of translation raises many questions.  The fact is that in the American market action cameras are equipped with a manual in English, so why provide the Russian market with Chinese instructions? </p><h2>  Interesting fake </h2><p>  Nobody calls for purchasing non-original products on the domestic market, but it's still worth getting acquainted with the equipment.  In the box, the owner will find the same mounts that are present in the original version.  The manufacturer did not save on this, providing the user with a full range of accessories for the SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi.  Fakes are supplied with an additional battery, which pleases all customers. </p>

    <p>  There are modifications with 32 gigabyte memory cards - this is also considered a pleasant gift from the manufacturer.  But the Chinese here also fail the Russian-speaking users with instructions, which looks very strange from the outside. </p><h2>  Certified device build quality </h2><p>  The original SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi looks like a monolithic plastic brick that does not have any build defects.  Without a magnifying glass, even the joints of the faces cannot be detected, and this really pleases all users, judging by their reviews.  You can find fault with the battery compartment, which is significantly larger than the battery.  The charge, of course, is not lost when shaking, but the rumble itself is disturbing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But accessories can cause dissatisfaction with the owner.  For example, the charger is impulse and during operation it seems that it is about to crumble.  Plastic mounts are also embarrassing - it is not easy to break them, but when they are deformed, they emit strange creaks.  Only a plastic box for underwater shooting is made soundly and does not cause a negative. </p><h2>  Camera Specifications </h2><p>  While reviewing the SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi camera, I would like to note the excellent functionality of the installed components.  The 12-megapixel Aptina AR0330 CMOS 1/3 "is equipped with a <span>fast lens</span> (F = 2.8) with a viewing angle of 170 degrees. Such indicators already guarantee excellent quality in low light. </p>

    <p>  But the exposure mode failed a little - ISO in the range of 100-400 units looks very poor.  At least you can forget about night shooting forever.  A 1.5-inch liquid crystal display also looks very strange, but its presence causes positive emotions for users. </p><p>  As for the shooting itself, there are no questions: customizable self-timer, continuous shooting, the ability to change resolution - everything is like in a digital camera from an expensive class.  Even autofocus can detect faces and copes with a large number of objects in the frame. </p><h2>  Work with video </h2><p>  Most buyers are interested in the video capabilities of the SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi device.  The performance of the camera is respected even by demanding users.  Video can be shot in three modes: </p><ul><li>  FullHD (1920 x 1080 dpi), 30 frames per second. </li><li>  HD (1280 x 720 dpi) with a choice of recording speed of 30 or 60 FPS. </li><li>  Easy (848 x 480) at a speed of 60 frames per second. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that these indicators are quite enough for most types of shooting.  Yes, in the reviews there is a negative regarding the lack of 120 FPS mode, as it is implemented by competitors, however, there are not so many videos with such characteristics in the media.  Users prefer to shoot in good resolution in speed loss.  And you can‚Äôt forget about saving space on a removable drive, because the higher the recording speed and resolution, the more footage you take up space. </p><h2>  Device functionality </h2><p>  The action camera in its marking is not in vain that has the symbols ‚ÄúWiFi‚Äù.  This is a clear hint that the device has an integrated wireless module.  Naturally, the owner opens up many opportunities that you should definitely talk about.  Better to start with the <span>built-in motion sensor,</span> which you can configure as you wish.  Some users prefer to turn on the camera independently while driving, while other owners use the device as a surveillance camera. </p>

    <p>  The captured material can not only be recorded on removable media, but also transferred to a mobile device via Wi-Fi.  Present USB and HDMI connectors on the device‚Äôs case perfectly complement the camera‚Äôs functionality.  When connected to a computer, the gadget turns into a WEB-camera, and a TV connected via HDMI becomes a full-fledged monitor for a miniature device.  In general, the manufacturer guessed with the device‚Äôs functionality - many useful functions open up new opportunities for the owner to use an action camera. </p><h2>  When it comes to quality </h2><p>  Having studied the technical characteristics of the device, many users imagine the unsurpassed quality of shooting with such interesting equipment.  What is their disappointment when on the first day of video recording, weirdnesses in the operation of the SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi are detected.  1080p (FullHD) format looks unnatural on a huge TV screen.  Moreover, with different lighting, the color gamut of the image completely changes.  Photography is also subject to the same problem, regardless of the resolution selected. </p><p>  The fault is the <span>white balance</span> , which automatically tries to give the image natural tones.  In fact, this is a factory defect that was ignored by the manufacturer.  Manual mode will help to fix the problem - the user must select the desired lighting in the camera settings (day, cloudy, incandescent lamp).  The device comes with a special cloth for wiping the lens.  In their reviews, many users recommend using it constantly, eliminating the pollution of the optical device. </p><h2>  Not stopping there </h2><p>  The problem with the quality of shooting can be eliminated by the firmware of the original SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi device.  Owner reviews present in the media recommend that all users without exception get acquainted with the possibilities of software updates closer.  The fact is that the firmware produced by the manufacturer is a real designer - the owner can assemble the modules he needs and fill them into the device in the form of standard firmware. </p>

    <p>  The assortment of modules is large.  Every day, users create and post new solutions on forums for owners of action cameras.  Thus, many enthusiasts have expanded the capabilities of the camera in working with white balance - additional settings are available in the menu (tungsten, twilight, and similar types of lighting).  Thanks to the programmers, the problem with the range of Wi-Fi was solved - the signal power increased significantly (though, in proportion to the battery consumption). </p><h2>  Manual revision of the camcorder </h2><p>  It doesn't happen that everything is fine.  The original SJCAM SJ4000 WiFi camera has problems with microphone sensitivity.  It is not necessary to say that in underwater boxing it does not work at all as it should.  The problem is known, and many users will learn about fixing it even before purchasing an action camera.  However, to upgrade the microphone, the owner will have to completely disassemble the miniature device. </p><p>  Enthusiasts propose to bring the built-in sound sensor out, providing it with a directional mechanism.  From the side it looks more like a plastic tube, which covers the microphone with one end on the chip, and the second edge is displayed on the front of the device.  Yes, you will need to drill a hole in the lid.  From moisture inside the tube, the hole must be closed with plexiglass, which is easily glued to the plastic case. </p><p>  It is easy to remove the protective cover, but getting to the controller itself is problematic.  Chasing compactness, the Chinese fit in a small box of the circuit mixed with cables and cables.  Therefore, it is better to accompany the entire disassembly process with photography, otherwise it will be problematic to assemble the device. </p><h2>  Problems and their solution </h2><p>  One of the reasons why users prefer to purchase the non-original version of the SJ4000 SJCAM WiFi camera is the lack of support for large memory cards.  The original device has a limit of 32 gigabytes.  Today it is a very small volume.  But the fake, in addition to a spare battery, makes a gift to the user in the form of a modern card reader that supports working in microSD 128 Gb memory cards. </p><p>  Only many potential buyers lose sight of the possibility of flashing the original action camera.  Enthusiasts have long found a solution to this problem.  By installing the necessary module in the firmware, you can make the device work with 64 gigabyte drives.  Yes, this is two times less than that of a fake, but also 2 times more than the factory version of the certified device.  There is a possibility that the manufacturer himself will fix the problem by releasing a new firmware, because this is not an error at the hardware level, but at the software level. </p><h2>  The Pursuit of Happyness </h2><p>  No need to think that the non-original SJ4000 SJCAM WiFi camera has no problems.  In the media, users often discuss the solution to the problem of flaking the LCD screen in the body of a miniature device.  Apparently, the problem is not in the quality of the assembly, but in the component itself, which is responsible for the image output.  With improvised means, the problem can be eliminated, but this will be a temporary solution, since the air that has got inside the matrix will continue to delaminate the screen. </p>

    <p>  And you can leave everything as it is.  Indeed, in fact, the image on the screen does not disappear, but only the color rendering changes and the brightness deteriorates.  To configure the device, the quality is quite acceptable.  You should not count on a replacement screen under warranty, since the manufacturer of non-original products is not certified in the CIS countries. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  In most reviews, the action camera is referred to as a completely new device, without comparison with other competitors in the market.  This alarms many potential buyers, judging by their reviews.  Indeed, in the world of electronics, it is customary to compare a new gadget with a legend. </p><p>  The advantages to all users include primarily low cost (7,000 rubles) and rich equipment.  Judging by the numerous reviews in the media and the reviews of the owners, even Hero GoPro can‚Äôt boast such an abundant number of accessories (we are talking about cables, scotch tape and other elements to strengthen the mounts).  The advantages were also attributed to users and the ease of setup - the menu is really small, but its functionality is enough to perform all tasks in the shooting process. </p><p>  But the negative relates more to non-original devices - stratification of the monitor, weak batteries (primary and secondary), difficulties in operation and poor quality of the microphone.  Therefore, it is not always clear where the buyer won, who decided to save on the purchase of a fake. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  An inexpensive action camera with a decent set of mounts and simple functionality - this is how you can briefly describe the SJ4000 SJCAM WiFi device.  And then it all depends directly on the buyer, who decides what is more important to him - the price or ease of use, functionality or the ability to modify the software part of the gadget.  An ideal device in the camera segment for extreme conditions does not currently exist.  The user has to choose, constantly being in search of criteria important to him. </p>
