  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New buildings in Yalta: overview, features, developers and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want not only to have a summer vacation on the Black Sea coast of Crimea, but also to finally move to this fertile region, you can buy an apartment in one of the new buildings in Yalta.  Developers offer a wide selection of both elite housing, and quite budget options for buying. </p><p>  Below will be an overview of residential complexes in which you can buy an apartment, and reviews of those who have already made their choice. </p><h2>  LCD "Sails" </h2><p>  This <span>residential complex</span> is located on the street.  Krasina and consists of five 4-storey houses.  One of them is fully operational, the rest are 96% ready.  If you want to buy housing in a new building in Yalta from the developer "Jalita-98", then there is still the opportunity to choose a 1-, 2-room apartment.  The developer also offers apartments with a free layout.  Approximate prices: </p><ul><li>  1-room (from 34.20 m <sup>2</sup> ) - from 3.62 to 6.42 million rubles; </li><li>  2-room (from 24.40 m2) - from 3.99 to 5.70 million rubles; </li><li>  free planning (from 34.30 m <sup>2</sup> ) - from 2.84 to 12.75 million rubles. </li></ul><p>  The new building is located in a mountainous area and is surrounded on all sides by trees.  Nearby is the local dolphinarium and the famous Glade of Fairy Tales. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rk-novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sails" class="if uuid-2574083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574083.jpg"></div><p>  It is difficult to say anything definite about the reputation of the developer, since the Parusa residential complex is the only object that the company is building.  However, it can be argued that the developer fully respects all its promises and deadlines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This new building in Yalta offers apartments with a fine finish, all the necessary communications are connected to the houses.  Inside each hot water, independent heating, ventilation system.  Parking for residents is provided by the project, but it is located outside the residential complex. </p><p>  A very rich infrastructure is also planned.  A gym and fitness club are already built.  In addition, the developer promises to equip a playground, a wellness center and a swimming pool. </p><h2>  What customers say about Parusa LCD </h2><p>  Positive feedback from residents concerns convenient layouts of apartments, high-quality modern sanitary ware, equipped kitchens and clean mountain air.  However, there are those who did not really like the rather isolated location of the complex.  Without own transport, it is problematic to get to the city center and other infrastructure facilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rk-novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Layout of apartments in LCD Sails" class="if uuid-2574086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574086.jpg"></div><h2>  LCD Yalta Plaza </h2><p>  One of the most worthy new buildings in Yalta by the sea is the LCD Yalta Plaza.  The developer is the company "Sweet LTD", founded in 2014.  The expected completion of the facility is the 4th quarter of 2018. </p><p>  The residential complex consists of one 9-storey building, which is located within walking distance from the sea coast in the very center of Yalta on the street.  Ignatenko, 9. This is a building constructed according to the latest graphic standards of architecture and taking into account high seismicity.  According to the builder, the house must withstand an earthquake of up to 9 points. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  LCD belongs to the category of elite real estate and has excellent infrastructure.  On its territory a restaurant, a sports hall, a swimming pool, an underground parking and a children's playground should be built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bazis-yalta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Yalta Plaza" class="if uuid-2574089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574089.jpg"></div><p>  The buyer can choose an open-plan apartment or 1- and 2-bedroom.  There are also 2-floor penthouses with stunning sea views.  Price for 1 square.  meter of housing varies from 93 099 to 136 585 rubles.  The most expensive apartment will cost 11 365 320 rubles. </p><p>  Until the end of 2018, the developer offers to take advantage of the promotion for some apartments.  The price of them is reduced by 18%. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Customers' opinions about this new building in Yalta are mostly positive.  People note the successful location of the complex, the beautiful exterior of the building and thoughtful infrastructure.  They also talk about the good quality of materials and spacious apartments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrov82.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure LCD Yalta Plaza" class="if uuid-2574092" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574092.jpg"></div><p>  There are fewer negative opinions, and they mainly concern the too high cost of housing, which, according to buyers, is not justified. </p><h2>  LCD on Oslovsky street </h2><p>  Buying an apartment in new buildings in Yalta is unlikely to succeed.  After all, the city is located on the Black Sea coast and has a fairly developed infrastructure.  However, you can pay attention to the LCD, which is only 5 minutes walk from the sea and at the same time offers relatively affordable housing options. </p><p>  The developer "Yaltahorstroy" promises to put the facility into operation in December 2018.  This is a monolithic 8-storey building, where it is possible to purchase an apartment for 55,000 rubles per 1 sq. Km.  meter.  The building is located in an area with developed infrastructure: nearby there are shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, entertainment venues.  Also, the house is equipped with an underground parking lot, places on which are still for sale. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rk-novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD on Oslovsky street" class="if uuid-2574094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574094.jpg"></div><h2>  Opinion of future residents </h2><p>  Today we can say that about 50% of apartments are sold in the building, and those who have already managed to appreciate the pros and cons of such an acquisition do not regret the money spent.  In the reviews of this new building in Yalta, they indicate a relatively low cost of apartments and a good location. </p><p>  They also like the fact that from here you can quickly get to anywhere in the city without even having your own transport.  The absence of a large courtyard and the still unsettled playground are somewhat frustrating for people.  It is hoped that the developer will fully fulfill his obligations to buyers, and all the promised objects will be delivered on time. </p><h2>  LCD "Through the Looking Glass" </h2><p>  For lovers of comfort, the developer Sorang offers apartments in a new building in Yalta, which is called "Through the Looking Glass".  The estimated completion date is the 2-3rd quarter of 2018.  Housing belongs to the elite class, so apartments here are expensive.  The most expensive option will cost 38 million rubles, and 1 square.  meter - from 90 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Considering that the residential complex ‚ÄúThrough the Looking Glass‚Äù is located in the recreation area and only 150 meters from the sea on Gagarinsky Descent, we can assume that the stay here will be really comfortable.  The complex consists of one 18-storey building and infrastructure.  Underground parking is built on 4 levels, a restaurant, a fitness room and a pool.  Each apartment has not only an individual heating system, but is also equipped with a fire protection system and ventilation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krym.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;" class="if uuid-2574100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2574100.jpg"></div><h2>  What are buyers waiting for </h2><p>  It is logical to assume that for the money the future tenants plan to get a truly modern and comfortable housing.  They really like the project of the complex and the clean air of this area.  The only thing that worries buyers so far is whether the developer will meet the promised deadlines and whether they can get the keys to the long-awaited apartment on time. </p>
