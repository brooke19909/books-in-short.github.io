    <h2>  Arkhangelsk (estate) </h2><p>  The map of the suburbs of the capital is replete with signs indicating that at one time in the vicinity there were quite a lot of landowner estates.  Some of them have been preserved to date.  Part of the estates was destroyed either during the revolution, or during World War II, when Moscow took the brunt of the attack.  Arkhangelskoye is a manor located in the Krasnogorsk district.  It is an outstanding <span>architectural and artistic ensemble,</span> created at the end of the 18th century.  This masterpiece was the result of the work of several generations of talented craftsmen.  The halls of the museum store a rich collection of faience and porcelain.  During opening hours, the Arkhangelskoye estate is open to visitors.  Here you can see a collection of Western European painting from the 17-19th centuries.  <span>Alexander Benois, a</span> Russian artist, critic and art historian, described the illusion of foreign estates, achieved thanks to the extremely successful embodiment of the Western style of those times.  In his opinion, Arkhangelskoe surpasses many of the noble cottages and palaces built during the reign of Elizabeth, and then Catherine II.  He said that the estate was not like a Russian house, but rather like an Italian villa or a French castle with countless marble columns, terraces and trimmed alleys. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="opening hours estate Arkhangelsk" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477264.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of the estate Arkhangelsk </h2><p>  The village where the estate is located has existed since 1584.  And even earlier, it was called Propoleza.  The current name was given after the construction of the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in 1667 by order of Y. N. Odoevsky.  The one-domed church with aisles decorated with rows of kokoshniks testifies to the medieval past of the entire estate.  The courtyard, as a consecrated territory, has been fenced in 1826 by a brick wall of the monastery type, with a pair of side wooden towers and a large arch.  An amazingly beautiful place was chosen for construction: the edge of a hill above the old channel of the Moscow River.  The local area is still untouched by civilization: the temple is surrounded by majestic pines creaking under the pressure of river winds and showering with needles the domes and tombstone of T. N. Yusupova, who was buried at the age of 22.  Before the grave stood a <span>sculpture of the Angel of</span> Prayer with wings, sponsored by M. M. Antokolsky and N. V. Sultanov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Arkhangelsk estate" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477250.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  central part </h2><p>  During business hours, the Arkhangelskoye estate is open both for group excursions and for individual visits.  The guardians of the monument will tell guests about the fate of the estate.  The foundation of the architectural ensemble was laid by N. A. Golitsyn in 1780. After his death, after 30 years, the estate was bought by N. B. Yusupov for 100 thousand rubles.  He completed the construction started.  Talented Moscow architects E.D. Tyurin, S.P. Melnikov, O.I. Bove, as well as prominent serf architects, including Bredikhin, Borunov, Shestakov, Strizhakov and Rabutovsky, took part in the beautification.  Arkhangelsk (estate), the photo of which is presented in the article, with its longitudinal-axial composition, which is different in scale, is designed for the prospect of distant species.  The palace, occupying the main planning axis, was erected on the upper terrace of the French park, as if on a podium.  The art critic L. A. Perfiliev believes that it was built according to the project of the architect de Guerne, which was commissioned by Golitsyn to him.  Moreover, <span>the architect,</span> most likely, was never in Russia, and accordingly, Moscow itself was not familiar to him.  Arkhangelsk (estate) - the only work of the architect in the capital and the country as a whole.  This is also evidenced by the fact that the architect‚Äôs surname does not appear in any records. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of the estate Arkhangelsk" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477251.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Palace interior </h2><p>  The fate of the exterior design of the building, as well as of himself, is rather sad.  In the period after the perestroika, officials of the military department, to which the Arkhangelskoye sanatorium belongs, deprived the building of power supply and heating by one decree.  The predictable consequences of such a rash decision were not long in coming: the typeset parquet covering the floors were swollen, the unique stucco molding instantly damp, the walls were covered first with drips and then with mold.  Before the visitors of the museum an unpleasant picture of neglected facades and broken glass was presented, behind which the unique decoration of the halls perished.  In this state, the palace stood for several years, and only in mid-2009, some repairs were carried out.  Thanks to them, the Arkhangelskoye estate is open to visitors during work hours, who can walk through several restored rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhangelsk manor map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477252.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Terraces of Giacomo Trombaro </h2><p>  The style of the two sites created in the 90s of the 18th century by the Italian architect is closely connected with the house and outbuildings.  They connect the stairs on the sides of the central grotto structure.  Walkways, balustrades and stalls are decorated with sculptures of ancient gods and heroes, scientists and Roman emperors, allegorical compositions, as well as sculptures of dogs and lions.  Some busts and figures partially repeat the famous examples of classical art, while some of them are unique decorative statues of those times. </p><h2>  Square </h2><p>  The regular park has preserved a pink arbor-fountain, a monument erected under Catherine II with an architectural frame, as well as an alley with various marble figures leading to the sculpture of A. S. Pushkin.  The most characteristic feature is the ruin gate of the lower terrace, made in the style of Hubert Robert.  On the opposite side of the garden, behind the buildings of the military sanatorium, built in the 30s of the 20th century according to the project of the architect V.P. Apyshkov, a columned arbor was recreated.  She took her place on a small loose hill in the 60s.  <span>An English park</span> following the road hides a separate building of the manor theater.  This is one of the most interesting buildings, although visitors often do not notice it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhangelsk estate photo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477253.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural ensemble </h2><p>  During its existence, the estate was constantly decorated, today it is difficult to imagine the many lost buildings.  It is known that although their style was sometimes different, the common features inherent in the buildings of the West European Middle Ages were still present in all.  To date, the following have survived from the economic complex: </p><p>  - Office two-story outbuilding, designed in the years 1822-1823.  architect Tyurin E. D. and having gothic features; </p><p>  - a two-story service wing with a mezzanine, built at the end of the 18th century, and made in the tradition of classicism; </p><p>  - a wooden guest house where visitors have stayed since 1810. </p><p>  One of the last structures is the Yusupovs tomb church, built in 1909-1916.  Klein, G. B. Barkhin and A. D. Chichagov participated in the creation.  The three-dimensional composition impresses visitors.  In the center on a high base there is a cruciform temple with a rotunda blocked by a dome.  A far-reaching Corinthian portico with two rows of columns of the Doric order converging to it, made of artificial marble, forms a semi-oval. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Arkhangelsk how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/477254.jpg" width="375"></div>
