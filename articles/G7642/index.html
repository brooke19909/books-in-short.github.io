  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Memory of water</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During many studies, it was found that water has a memory, that is, it has the ability to memorize information, as well as store and transmit it.  How does this happen? </p><p>  <strong>Water secrets</strong> </p><p>  Various kinds of noise can exert external effects on the water (for example, traffic on the street, abuse of neighbors, etc.), lighting, heat or cold from a battery or refrigerator, <span>radiation from a computer</span> or TV, radio waves, and many other factors.  As a result of the influence of all these stimuli, a change in its structure occurs.  The memory of water, therefore, reflects the influence of external factors on it. </p><p>  When conducting more than 500 experiments in Russia, it was found that people's thoughts also affect the structure of water, which can change its properties depending on whether the thoughts are negative or positive. </p><p>  It is established that the water cell contains 44 thousand different formations, called information panels.  Each of them is arranged in its own way and responds to external influences like a receptor in a living cell.  Subsequently, the information panels begin to interact with each other, and water comes into a new state. </p><p>  The memory of water is preserved even when boiling.  And when freezing, the crystallization of molecules that turn into structured ice occurs.  In water crystals, motion continuously occurs.  Circulation is carried out by thin "tubes", where the liquid has not yet frozen. </p><p>  Water is not homogeneous; it consists of many microscopic crystals in the form of diamond-shaped polygons.  The size of one is 20x20x30 angstroms, it contains 912 molecules.  These polygons are combined into half-micron cells. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>About holy water</strong> </p><p>  During biological and physical analyzes of the consecrated water, it was found that it has biologically active and antimicrobial properties.  Also, a small amount of holy water was diluted with ordinary tap.  As a result, the ordinary after a while turned into a saint, that is, had the same structure and biological properties.  The memory of water bore a positive effect, having a beneficial effect on health. </p><p>  <strong>Human body</strong> </p><p>  It should be remembered that the body of an adult consists of approximately 70% water.  With aging, this percentage becomes less, since cells lose moisture and depletion of <span>water resources</span> occurs <span>.</span>  The processes occurring in life affect the memory of water in our body, so it is advisable to try to reduce the negative external impact, have good friends and be optimistic.  It is also advisable to drink good water and completely eliminate carbonated, which has an extremely negative effect on our body. </p><p>  <strong>What is <span>structured water?</span></strong> </p><p>  This is the highest quality fresh natural water.  It has a strong energy, allows you to increase the effectiveness of the work of all cells of the human body, has a beneficial complex effect, prolongs life. </p><p>  You can make <span>structured water</span> yourself <span>at home.</span>  To do this, you need to freeze and then unfreeze ordinary water or collect vapors with boiling water. </p><p>  A study of the cells of infants and <span>young animals revealed</span> that they contain structured water, which in its structure resembles snowflakes.  We found out that it slows down the aging of cells and removes toxins from them. </p><p>  <strong>Human exposure</strong> </p><p>  The memory of water, therefore, has a significant impact on the condition of a person and his health.  By using structured water, you can achieve a positive effect and even extend your life. </p>
