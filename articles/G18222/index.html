    <h2>  Overlock, carpet and flat sewing machine </h2><p>  Before you deal with the threads, it is worth refreshing your knowledge about <span>what an overlock is, how</span> it differs from a standard sewing machine.  She basically makes two types of stitches: straight stitch and zigzag.  While the first view allows you to connect two or more pieces of fabric, the second is often used to overcast edges.  However, in the case of thin or stretching tissues, the zigzag is ineffective because it stretches and deforms the material.  Unlike the sewing machine, the ovrelok accurately allows to process edges.  He does not stretch the fabric, trimming the excess.  It uses from two to five threads to form a seam.  The more they are in a particular model, the more types of seams it is able to make. </p><p>  Overlocks are domestic and industrial.  As a rule, the cases of the first models consist of plastic.  Such devices are less demanding on threads and resources.  However, they can usually perform several <span>types of seams.</span>  Industrial overlocks are designed for hours of work.  Therefore, their design is simpler and more reliable.  However, they are usually able to perform only 1-2 types of seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes the overlock is confused with a sewing machine (opener).  She is able to make <span>flat seams.</span>  Designed for the manufacture of knitwear, elastane and other fabrics of a similar property.  There are hybrid devices - carpet covers.  They are able to make flat seams and grind the edge.  All of the above devices are quite capricious for sewing threads and often cause their owners a lot of problems in this matter. </p>

    <h2>  Why is it important to choose the right thread? </h2><p>  Overlock threads, like needles, are one of those factors that directly affects not only the quality of the future product, but also the service life of the sewing machine itself.  Incorrectly selected, they can damage the shuttle of the device.  In addition, the sewing process itself depends on the quality of this type of accessories.  After all, unsuitable threads will be confused, torn or simply slow down the device. </p><h2>  What threads for overlock should not be used? </h2><p>  First of all, <span>cotton threads</span> are unsuitable for overlock, carpet and flat sewing machines <span>.</span>  They have insufficient elasticity and strength, because of this they often break during operation and deform plastic parts.  Also, you should not use the very popular dacron and <span>reinforced threads.</span>  Despite their strength, they can also cause breakdown of overlocks, as they are not able to create the necessary tension. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Types of threads for overlocks </h2><p>  There are a huge number of manufacturers of accessories for overlocks: Ideal, Gamma, AMANN Group Mettler, Gutermann, Alterfil and others. Each of them produces several types of its products.  Despite this, there are three main types of threads for overlocks: </p><ol><li>  Universal.  This type can be used on all types of sewing machines.  Such threads are 100% made of synthetic fibers.  They have extra strength and elasticity. </li><li>  Translucent or transparent (monofilament) threads for overlock.  They are as strong and reliable as the previous look.  Their feature is color.  They are available in light colors.  They have the ability to merge with the color of the fabric. </li><li>  Threads textured for overlock.  They have an unusual air structure, but they are incredibly durable.  Ideal for sewing underwear and processing delicate fabrics, since the seam gets very delicate and almost imperceptible.  At the same time, textured threads should not be used in a two-thread overlock seam.  Indeed, in the process of working on it, they tend to split and get confused. </li></ol><p>  When choosing threads for an overlock, you should first look at their composition.  Fibers must be 100% synthetic.  Threads of this type are much stronger than natural, as well as mixed. </p>

    <h2>  Thread requirement </h2><p>  It is also worth remembering that the type of fabric must match the type of thread used.  Otherwise, unpleasant incidents can occur when washing and ironing the finished product.  Thickness also plays a very important role.  Overlock seam is the interweaving of two or more threads.  And if they are fat, he will look rude.  It is best to use the threads of the following numbers: from 50 to 120. And among textured ones, models No. 100, 120 and 250 are best suited for overlocks. When buying accessories from an unknown manufacturer, it is worth evaluating the quality of the thread.  It should be smooth, without knots, thickenings and noticeable defects.  As for the length, the best option is to buy 1000-meter coils.  They are not very expensive.  They will be enough for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the selection of threads for industrial overlocks </h2><p>  The household overlock, in comparison with the sewing machine, costs more.  Therefore, some lovers of sewing, in order to save money, buy household <span>overlocks of 51 classes.</span>  Despite the fact that they are unacceptable for the processing of very thin fabrics and in many ways inferior to modern models, the rest of the devices can become an indispensable assistant in sewing.  As for the selection of threads, in this aspect the overlock of class 51 is universal.  You can buy any, including Soviet cotton.  It is important that all industrial overlock threads are of the same thickness.  In addition, for each option used, it is necessary to individually adjust their tension. </p>

    <h2>  Overlock for carpets and threads to it </h2><p>  In the CIS, due to the climate, it is customary to cover floors in homes.  Due to the fact that the situation in each house is unique, you have to cut them when you buy carpet, carpet and similar products.  So that the edges look neat and do not crumble, they are overlaid on specialized devices.  Such sewing machines require a separate type of polypropylene thread.  These threads for overlock carpets are not only durable and flexible, but also do not crumble, do not break with time.  In addition, they easily tolerate subzero temperatures.  The disadvantages of this type of thread include the fact that they burn out a little in the sun. </p>

    <h2>  How to thread the overlock? </h2><p>  Unlike a conventional sewing machine, in which only one thread is threaded (in rare cases, two), several must be tucked into the overlock - from two to five.  And in some cases, this is a rather time-consuming task.  To facilitate their work, many professional seamstresses use one technique.  They simply tie new threads to scraps of old at the base of the spool, pulling them to the needle itself.  And then cut the knot and tuck into the needle.  This method can be used by everyone.  But it is worth remembering that such a dressing should only be done with the foot raised.  The first time you thread the overlock, you can ask the seller when buying or use the instructions for the device. </p><p>  The correct selection of threads for an overlock is very important for its further work and the quality of finished products.  In this case, each woman must figure out herself which threads are best suited for her typewriter.  In this case, this amazingly useful device will serve her faithfully for many years, helping to realize all creative ideas. </p>
