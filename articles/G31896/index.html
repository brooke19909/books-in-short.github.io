It is one of the structural divisions of the Tomsk Regional Museum of Local Lore named after Mikhail Bonifatievich Shatilov.  Most often this museum is visited by politicians, journalists and representatives of public life.  Therefore, he gained popularity only in certain circles.  It is interesting that this museum complex is one of a kind, which has no analogues around the world.  The fame of this institution has long gone beyond the borders of the Russian state. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

From 1923 to 1944, it was in this room that the prison of the Tomsk city department of the OGPU ‚Äì NKVD was located.  The adjoining territory was used as a courtyard, where prisoners breathed fresh air from time to time.  Currently, this area is occupied by the Square of Memory.  During 1992-2004, monuments dedicated to the victims of repression were erected in this square.  Today, the NKVD Museum-Prison (Tomsk) looks like a finished architectural ensemble, which, moreover, is a memorial.  This place is of great importance for the historical memory of the city of Tomsk.

    <p>  Initially, many tourists are skeptical of visiting such establishments.  After all, going around cultural attractions should be fun and positive.  And what could be pleasant about visiting a prison? </p><p>  But you just have to take a step to the Museum of the NKVD (Tomsk), as all generally accepted stereotypes are completely destroyed.  This place is fascinating from the first second.  Many people claim that they have not yet visited a more interesting and exciting tour. </p><p>  The museum is very easy to get from anywhere in Tomsk, because it is located in the heart of the city. </p><p>  The prison cells, which today are the main exhibits of the museum, have been preserved almost in their original form.  This plunges even more into the special atmosphere of the terrible time of repression.  There is a corridor between the chamber rooms, which also presents many interesting exhibits. </p><p>  The first room is the office in which the investigator worked.  A standard set of furniture, a window under the bars, cigarettes and a decanter.  When you enter this cell, many feel an eerie feeling.  The investigator's mannequin also does not cause positive emotions, but still from such a spectacle is breathtaking. </p><p>  Pictures immediately pop up before my eyes, as the unfortunate prisoners were left alone with the representative of justice, and what emotions they experienced, knowing exactly their future fate. </p><p>  On the table are stored the most real criminal cases.  Those who are even a little versed in the investigative examination can conclude that in those days, full-fledged investigations were not carried out. </p><p>  There were no reasons for the arrests, they were not motivated, but almost all prisoners received one sentence - to shoot. </p><p>  Among the prisoners there were poets, writers and other public figures.  Many documents, photographs and even personal belongings of the famous poet <span>Nikolai Klyuyev are</span> presented at a separate stand.  The poet was shot for propaganda against the Soviet regime, as well as for writing anti-revolutionary works. </p><p>  The walls of the prison saw many tragic events.  From them blows cold and horror.  The whole atmosphere plunges into gloom, shock and even causes a feeling of anxiety. </p><p>  In another cell, you can see a cross laid out from photographs of prisoners.  More than 23,000 innocent people met their death here.  Among them are teachers, and writers, and poets, scientists, doctors, and the military. </p><p>  The most difficult for perception is the third hall.  The prisoners were here directly. </p>

    <p>  You can relieve stress from what you saw in a cozy park located right next to the museum.  There are many benches and walkways for walks.  But some monuments in the park still remind of the terrible time of persecution and repression. </p>
