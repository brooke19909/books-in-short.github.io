And even the one who was not lucky enough to visit it is well informed about where Odessa is located.  Of course, on the Black Sea. </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  This city was founded in 1794 by the will of the Empress Catherine the Second.  Its laying on the site of the ancient Turkish village of Hadzhibey marked the consolidation of the borders of the empire on the Black Sea coast.  Shortly after its founding, the city became the administrative center of New Russia.  And during the nineteenth century it turned into the largest Russian port and the fourth most populated city in the country.  Odessa has become a kind of facade of Russia, deployed in a southerly direction.  Through it, trade routes went to countries located on the Mediterranean coast.  The city quickly gained a prominent role in the economic, political, cultural and social life of the country.  It was difficult to believe that there was a deserted shore a few decades ago where the city of Odessa was. <strong> </strong>  Among other things, Odessa quickly became popular as one of the summer vacation destinations of the wealthy public.  Throughout the nineteenth century, railroads were intensively built in the south of Russia, which ensured reliable port communication with all major cities, not only Russia, but also Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Odessa" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/406186.jpg" width="502"></div>

In ancient times, a Greek colony was located in this place.  It was to her that Odessa owes its name, which was assigned to her in St. Petersburg with the approval of Catherine II.  The favorable geographical position of the city makes it not only the largest trading port, but also the center of the Black Sea resort area, which every season attracts many tourists.  Many people do not need to explain where Odessa is located.  They have been here repeatedly and are happy to return to this shore every summer.  Here are great beaches, affordable prices and the legendary city, which is always happy for guests.  By its geographical location, the Odessa region remains the closest tourist zone for beach holidays for Russia and Ukraine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Odessa on the map" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/406187.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Major Attractions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the <span>history of Odessa</span> dates back a little over two centuries, the city is very expressive in its appearance and has many historical and architectural sights.  And this is not surprising - the best architects and artists of their time had a hand in its construction.  In the historical center of the city, a number of buildings made in the style of classicism and modernity, without exaggeration, can be classified as unique.  It is well known where Odessa is located, and in such an authoritative international organization as UNESCO.  Now we are considering the inclusion in the List of World Cultural Heritage of a number of architectural ensembles of the city.  First of all, it is about Primorsky Boulevard, Piazza Duc de Richelieu, the Opera House and the <span>Potemkin Stairs.</span>  By the way, in 1925, a series of key episodes of such a masterpiece of world cinematography as <span>The Battleship Potemkin by the</span> famous Soviet film director <span>Sergei Eisenstein</span> was shot on this famous staircase <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of Odessa" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/406185.jpg" width="496"></div>

Since the founding of the city, Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Greeks and Tatars have been living here peacefully next door to each other.  And from such multi-ethnicity, a unique <span>cultural environment has</span> formed in the city <span>.</span>  The indescribable Odessa aura and the unique sense of humor of Odessa residents are widely known in all countries of the world where they understand the Russian language.  There is even such an international organization as the "World Club of Odessa", in which many prominent figures of the whole world are proud of their honorary membership.  To appreciate the <span>sense of humor of the</span> inhabitants of this city, just ask in the street: "Where is Privoz in Odessa?"  The variety of answers to this simple question is always pleasantly surprising.  Many giants of Russian culture lived and worked in this city for a long time - from Pushkin to Vysotsky inclusive.  And without Odessa, their work would have been a little different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the delivery in Odessa" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/406184.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Travel service </h2><p>  Every year there are many who want to fill the gap in their education and go to practice to find out where Odessa is.  And she is always glad to see the guests and is very interested in having as many of them as possible.  Reception of tourists in Odessa is one of the most important sectors of the local economy.  The infrastructure, as well as ordinary inhabitants of Odessa, is widely oriented along the entire coast.  They willingly rent out their visitors for the summer season.  For many, especially people of retirement age, this is a very significant source of income.  But the housing supply on the market often exceeds the demand for it, and it is precisely this fact that a relatively low level of prices is ensured. </p>
