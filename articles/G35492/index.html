They also note the magnificent view from the panoramic window, the authors of the reviews advise future hotel guests to take the floor higher. </p><p>  The rooms have large full-wall windows that offer magnificent views of Nha Trang.  The windows do not open, but this is more likely to be called a plus by residents, since this fact creates additional noise isolation, no roaring bikes can be heard from the street.  The room has working air conditioning, kettle fridge, large TV, safe and Wi-Fi (free). </p><p>  The beach is across the street from the hotel.  It provides free sunbeds.  Sunset at sea, as vacationers say, is nice, sloping, but there are a large number of small shells.  Therefore, the authors of the reviews recommend that for the descent into the sea to move a little to the left of the hotel (20-30 m), there are no seashells at this distance.  The place here is quiet, unlike in the center.  Nearby are cafes and shops.  To get a taxi to the center, as tourists say, is inexpensive.  You can also use the bus for this, the stop is located 300 meters from the hotel.  You can rent a bike directly at the hotel: $ 9 / day. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the northern area of ​​Nha Trang, where there are practically no European cafes and entertainment.  An evening walk can be done exclusively along the promenade.  Calm Seas is considered a hotel for tourists who prefer a quiet, measured family vacation. </p><p>  The guests note the friendliness and helpfulness of the hotel staff and thank the employees and the administration for the excellent conditions created by them for a comfortable stay. </p>
