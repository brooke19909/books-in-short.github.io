    <p>  <strong>Main materials</strong> </p><p>  Any <span>crafts from newspaper tubes,</span> photos of which can be seen not only in manuals on paper weaving, but also in fashion magazines, are always an economical and environmentally friendly interior item.  Why?  Yes, first of all, because they are a great way to protect nature from pollution.  Indeed, in the process of creativity, not only newspapers are used, but also all possible catalogs, advertising sheets, and demonstration posters.  The main thing is that they, in their density and texture, are similar to newsprint.  Why economical?  Because it is enough to collect a binder of printed materials that is read daily in the family - and there is already material for creativity. </p><p>  But, in addition, you will also need to stock up on additional tools.  So, if it was already decided that a <span>basket of newspaper tubes</span> should be present in the interior, then in addition to printed materials, it is also necessary to prepare glue (PVA or pencil), a knitting needle, acrylic varnish and paints, as well as the form with which it will be subsequently transferred basket design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper tube laundry basket" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/195592.jpg" width="371"></div>

This is quite simple to do, but the process will take quite a while.  So, a newspaper spread is cut into strips with a width of at least seven centimeters.  Then, using a knitting needle, each workpiece is twisted, and the tip is fixed with glue.  You can do this without the help of knitting needles, only with your fingers.  Then get a denser and thinner "vine".  By the way, just such a technology should be applied if the master’s plans include a <span>laundry basket</span> made of newspaper tubes.  Thanks to its special density, it will hold volume for a long time. </p><p>  It is impossible to determine exactly how many such blanks a basket of newspaper tubes will require, and therefore the principle applies: "The more the better." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from newspaper tubes photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/195593.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Painting</strong> </p><p>  Of course, the tubes can also be painted after the product is finished.  But it is better to do this in advance. </p><p>  The easiest way to give different color to the tubes is to dip them for a short time in a solution of stain for oak, and then leave to dry.  For those who want to get different shades, water solutions of greenback, potassium permanganate or iodine are suitable.  Three to four drops per 500 ml are enough. </p><p>  More time is spent manually painting the tubes with acrylic paint.  But the advantage is that these dyes stay smoother and dry faster. </p><p>  <strong>Creation process</strong> </p><p>  A basket of newspaper tubes is woven in the same way as a vine.  To do this, you should start from the base, repeating the size of the chosen shape: for rectangular - the usual transverse weaving, for round - weaving in diameter.  Care must be taken to ensure that the tubes fit snugly against each other. </p><p>  Next, raise the "walls" of the basket.  To do this, the mold is mounted on an already woven base, and the tube-stands are bent so that they are firmly pressed against the sides of the mold.  Trying to maintain the density and shape of the product, they are braided in horizontal rows until the desired height is reached. </p><p>  The basket can be left open, but it is better to make a lid for it.  To do this, repeat the whole process, only the base parameters are increased by half a centimeter in each direction. </p><p>  As you can see, making a <span>basket from a newspaper is</span> quite simple, and most importantly - interesting. </p>
