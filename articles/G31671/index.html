    <p>  Brazil, whose population is fifth in number and second only to India, China, Indonesia and America, is a very <span>multinational country.</span>  For several hundred years, the nation has become a large ethnocultural entity.  The population of Brazil is more than a hundred nationalities and peoples. </p><p>  In this country, statistical studies of the number of not only local, but also foreign organizations are quite active.  For example, numerous agencies in the United States are regularly interested in statistics. </p><p>  If we distribute the population of Brazil by <span>age categories,</span> then the median age of the average Brazilian is about twenty-eight years.  This indicator represents the number of years a resident of the state, which is obtained as a result of the total addition of the number of years within specific age categories, dividing it by the number of residents of the country as a whole.  According to the unified statistical service, the country has about fourteen percent of the population, whose age is up to fourteen years.  <span>The working-</span> age <span>population of</span> Brazil (from fifteen to sixty-four years) is sixty-eight percent.  The rest are residents over the age of sixty-five. </p><p>  This Latin American state is characterized by natural growth.  For example, in 2010 it amounted to 1.17%.  It should be noted that some forecasts are somewhat ahead of events.  For example, in 2005, experts studying the demographic situation predicted that by 2010 the population of Brazil would be more than two hundred million inhabitants.  But that did not happen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Brazil, almost all the known races on the planet live.  Today, some ethnocultural groups classify themselves as Brazilians, distributed in a certain percentage.  So, Indians (who are the <span>native inhabitants of the</span> continent <span>)</span> make up about 0.45%, Asians (Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese) - 0.5%, Brazilians with black skin color account for about 6.2%.  38.5% belong to mulattoes, while whites make up about 54% of all residents of the country.  White Brazilians include ethnic Portuguese (20%), Italians (14%), Spaniards (about 8%), Germans (6.6%), Arabs (5.3%).  It should be noted, however, that, for example, in Sao Paulo there are even Arab quarters.  People from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and other North African countries and states of the <span>Arabian Peninsula</span> live there quite compactly <span>.</span> </p><p>  Brazil has a <span>population density of</span> around twenty people per square meter.  It should be noted that the inhabitants are distributed very unevenly across the territory.  So, almost half of the total population is spread over 7% of the total area, along a narrow strip of the Atlantic coast.  Thus, in the southeast, there are seventy people per square meter, and two in the north. </p><p>  Brazil is characterized by rapid urbanization.  So, for example, in the 1960s, citizens made up 46%, and by 2007 their share had increased to 85%. </p><p>  Women in Brazil live on average almost eight and a half years more than men.  The average life expectancy in the country is about 71.7 years.  Men in the country are 1% (two million people) less than women.  Along with this, according to statistics, more boys are born.  But they have a higher mortality rate at an early age. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the country is one of the fastest growing in South America, the level of education in Brazil is not very high.  For example, women are 88.8% educated, and men 88.4%. </p><p>  In terms of per capita income, Brazil is one in fifty-fifth, and according to other sources, in seventy-first place.  In this, it is significantly inferior to Chile, Argentina and Venezuela. </p>
