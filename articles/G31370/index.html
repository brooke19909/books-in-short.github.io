  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Narrow-nosed monkey and its subspecies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The narrow-nosed <span>species of monkeys are</span> quite numerous: currently zoologists count 96 of their varieties.  They settled exclusively in the Eastern Hemisphere (with the exception of Mona Monkeys and Green Monkeys. They were brought from Africa in the 17th century and fully adapted to living on the tropical islands of the Caribbean).  In contrast to the <span>chain-tailed monkeys, the</span> narrow-nosed have anatomical features closer to humans.  They have 32 teeth (for chain-tails - 36), some of them have no tail at all, and those who have it do not use it when climbing trees.  In most species, the pelvis performs the same functions as in humans - it supports internal organs during upright posture.  Narrow-nosed are divided into two main groups: monkey and hominoid.  Allocate another third family, parapithecidae, which is completely extinct. </p><p>  The distribution area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese primates is very wide and is not limited only to the tropical zone.  Of course, the narrow-nosed monkey prefers evergreen forests rich in fruits and plant foods, but it also occurs outside of them.  The most northern species is considered Japanese mago (39 ¬∞ N).  Hot springs save these monkeys from winter frosts, which sometimes reach -12 ¬∞ C.  In Europe, only one species has survived to the present day - the tailless monkey living in Gibraltar (36 ¬∞ N).  Two species living in the <span>coniferous forests of</span> Tibet are also described: thick wool helps the monkeys to withstand the harsh continental climate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are mainly small animals, although there are maxims within the family: the smallest <span>dwarf monkey</span> (35 cm) is considered, and the largest narrow-nosed monkey is the gorilla (meter and 75 cm).  All primates of this family have narrow nostrils (with the exception of chubby animals with a wider nasal septum. All of them lead a daytime lifestyle. Another characteristic feature is the cheek pouches, where the animal puts food ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù. In a more relaxed atmosphere, when an individual she is not afraid that her relatives will take food, she takes it out, chews it and eats it. </p><p>  A narrow-nosed monkey - both a monkey and a hominoid - has a fairly developed brain.  She uses various devices for obtaining food: stones for breaking nuts, batons for hunting snakes.  Primates cleanse young resinous shoots from the bark and put them into the anthill.  Ants stick on a stick and monkeys lick them.  Particularly striking in their mental abilities are <span>humanoid primates.</span>  Gorillas and chimpanzees can learn the language of the deaf and communicate with people. </p><p>  The monkey family, in turn, is divided into the monkey itself (these include macaques) and <span>dog-heads (baboons).</span>  In the latter, the lower part of the face clearly protrudes forward, which creates a resemblance to a dog's face.  Baboons also have developed fangs, which they demonstrate as a symbol of social status or, in danger, as a threat to the enemy.  This narrow-nosed monkey lives in a society with an extremely developed hierarchy: in a flock, each individual is subjugated to someone and submits to someone.  Zoologists believe that a similar hierarchy existed in the primitive herd of people. </p><p>  Of the hominids, the black monkey, which is also called the pygmy chimpanzee or bonobo, is of particular interest.  For a long time he was considered a chimpanzee, and only in 1957 was isolated as a separate species.  His skin is black (pink in ordinary chimpanzees), more sloping, narrow shoulders and long legs.  It makes barking, sharp sounds.  Bonobo lives in the interfluve of Lualaba and Congo.  Until now, this is a poorly studied species, and its number does not exceed ten thousand individuals.  Long black hair, parted in the middle in the middle, <span>red lips</span> on a black face, a <span>high forehead</span> and smart eyes give the animal a completely human appearance. </p>
