    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  All people love to relax.  But not everyone knows how to do this best.  Some people prefer health resorts, while others prefer hiking.  Someone prefer the most common camp sites.  If you want to rest and relax, breathing in the fresh forest air, go to Voronezh.  Chalet "Taiga" - a place where you are promised a wonderful leisure.  There is a hotel, and individual houses.  This tourist destination is perfect for families.  There are few elderly people here - only active and loving outdoor recreation remain in Taiga.  A mixed forest, a wonderful river and a piece of civilization with comfort - this is what you need for a modern vacation! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Which city can boast of having the Taiga camp site on its territory?  Voronezh!  How to get to the area?  It is worth noting immediately that the park hotel is located in the Voronezh region: not far from the city itself, in the forest.  If you look at the map, you will first have to get to the MacLock village.  Then drive north-east for about 3 kilometers.  And there you will see a camp site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taiga Voronezh camp site" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1349016.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But that is not all.  The <span>recreation center</span> has a legal address.  It can be used to contact the organization‚Äôs management.  The address of the camp site office is 35, Krasnokamennaya Street, Voronezh, Russia. It is here that you must send your complaints and suggestions.  Some are confused and scared by the presence of several addresses.  Do not be afraid.  After all, this is quite normal.  Now it‚Äôs clear where the Taiga camp site (Voronezh) is located.  How to get here?  It's no secret either.  Now let's figure out what key points to pay attention to in order to decide whether the hotel meets your requirements. </p><h2>  Means of communication </h2><p>  For example, how is the connection with this organization.  This is an important point.  After all, many lack information on the site.  I would like to reserve a room, find out some specific information.  What can a recreational place located near the city called Voronezh offer the Taiga camp site?  Firstly, the official website and feedback form.  Not the most successful, but rather convenient option.  Tourists claim that they will answer you, but you will have to wait a few days.  For quick communication, the official page of the organization is not suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taiga Voronezh camp site prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1349015.jpg" width="600"></div>

Also far from the most successful option, requiring a long wait for an answer.  Thirdly, there is a telephone service for tourists.  Thanks to her, you can book rooms or a restaurant for your event / vacation.  It is enough to call the "Taiga" at the numbers: + 7-905-051-37-78 and + 7-473-228-45-21.  You can reserve rooms and lodges for rest.  But to order a restaurant in this park-hotel you need to call: + 7-905-051-34-41 and + 7-473-228-45-24.  This separation of functionality is pleasing to many visitors - the operators know exactly what purpose you called.  You can contact Taiga at any time.  There are no problems with this. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Are you tired of the city of Voronezh?  Chalet "Taiga" at your service!  What can she offer her visitors?  A distinctive feature of this institution is the presence of a hotel and separate holiday houses.  There are 15 rooms in the hotel, and 14 log cabins in the hotel.  You can choose the accommodation option that you like the most. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel taiga voronezh how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1349014.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Visitors indicate that <span>the recreation center</span> "Taiga" (Voronezh region) is a comfortable place with nicely equipped rooms.  The rooms and houses have everything you need for a pleasant pastime.  The rooms include perfume and bath accessories, hairdryer, shower.  Double beds, wardrobes, a telephone, cabinets for things - all this is in the standard double rooms in Taiga.  And in the luxury apartments there are several rooms - a living room, an entrance hall and a bedroom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the houses, the situation is no worse.  It has everything you need: separate refrigerators, safes, beds and cabinets for clothes.  A telephone and a TV are also available.  There are both one-story log houses with a veranda, and two-story (5 bedrooms and a living room).  All this pleases customers - you can relax as a small company or a large family!  There are no complaints about the numbers. </p><h2>  Terrain </h2><p>  Park Hotel Taiga (Russia, Voronezh Region) is a place that brings pleasure to guests.  Many say that this tourist base is located in a picturesque place: in a mixed forest, among pines and oaks.  Pleasant fresh air, peace and quiet - this is what the clients of this establishment receive.  Nearby there is a beach and a river - if you wish and good weather, you can go here to swim and sunbathe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hostel taiga Voronezh how to get" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1349018.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some indicate that the coast near Usmanka, where the Taiga was built, is far from the most picturesque place.  But this is better than a vacation near the city.  By the way, from Voronezh you can get here in about an hour.  And it pleases.  In principle, there are no complaints about the construction site of the hotel.  This is not a hotel by the sea, but nature is still good here.  You can relax and unwind in the mixed forest. </p><h2>  Rates </h2><p>  Comfortable, but quite expensive vacation offers "Taiga", Voronezh.  The hostel prices are quite overpriced.  this is especially true of the room rates.  After all, the park hotel also has drawbacks, and significant ones.  But about them a little later.  The cost of rooms and houses is determined by the days of your vacation and the "starryness" of the home.  Over the weekend you have to pay more. </p><p>  On average, a standard hotel room costs from Monday to Thursday inclusive of 4,000 rubles, the rest of the time it costs 4,500. The superior suite costs 5,500 and 6,000, respectively. Renting a one-story log house will cost the guest 6,000 and 7,000 rubles.  Not very cheap.  Many point out that the Taiga recreation center (Voronezh region) is an expensive pleasure.  Not the most chic vacation, but he can hit the wallet.  For this reason, not always flattering reviews are found in the address of this database. </p><h2>  Leisure and entertainment </h2><p>  But the organization of leisure here is wonderful.  You can find something to your liking.  Those who like to steam are offered real Russian baths.  Do you prefer outdoor recreation?  No problem - barbecues with gazebos at your service!  The beach near Taiga is another advantage of this hotel. </p><p>  You can also use a beauty salon, visit a hairdresser and even a makeup artist.  For children, cooking classes are organized.  You can rent a boat, a bicycle, a scooter, rollers, a catamaran.  If you wish, you can play table tennis, invite a cook and a waiter for service, use sports equipment and play billiards. </p>

    <p>  What if you have children?  Visitors note that they will have something to do.  Many people like it.  It has already been said that children's cooking classes are organized in Taiga.  But this is only at 18:00 on Saturdays.  The rest of the time, kids can play on the beach or on site.  Obviously you won‚Äôt be bored.  And this does not leave tourists indifferent! </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  "Taiga" (Voronezh) - a camp site that offers a varied diet.  But it upsets many.  Administrators promise a hearty and varied food, but judging by numerous reviews, this is a clear embellishment of reality.  The food here is quite tasty, but not too sophisticated.  Some cannot get enough of her. </p><p>  Most of the perplexities in terms of nutrition arise in people who organize any events in the "Taiga" (for example, weddings).  Restaurant rooms are large, beautiful, it is pleasant to be in them.  The food is also tasty, but the menu is relatively scarce.  Therefore, one can understand a certain perplexity and dissatisfaction of visitors.  Such a good place to relax - and the lack of a thoughtful menu!  It disappoints many.  But this drawback is not so terrible as to refuse to visit an institution called Taiga.  Voronezh, the hostel near which is located, is a beautiful city.  Therefore, be sure to visit it with a small tour. </p><h2>  Silence or not? </h2><p>  But the following drawback may seem significant to you.  The thing is that the camp site is in a quiet and peaceful place, in a picturesque forest, not far from the river and the beach.  Only here it‚Äôs not always possible to enjoy the silence.  It is noted that the hotel territory is not too big - houses are located very close by.  And when they are full, everyone will hear each other.  So it will be noisy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Hotel Taiga Russia Voronezh Region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1349020.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is for this reason (with the exception of food incidents) that a negative is expressed towards this place.  Are you tired of the noisy Voronezh?  Chalet "Taiga" at your service.  But if you want to fully experience the peace and tranquility, try to come here out of season when there are few people here.  Only then will you be able to fully enjoy all the capabilities of the organization.  Although, as practice shows, a lot of noise here happens only when conducting organized events: weddings, corporate parties and so on. </p><p>  As you can see, Taiga <span>(park hotel, Voronezh)</span> receives a variety of reviews.  But mostly they are positive.  This place is a real gift for tourists who want to relax in a forested area with all amenities! </p>
