And now, literally now, there are reports that warm objects were found in all Egyptian pyramids.  Three stones located at the base <span>of the Cheops pyramid are</span> especially impressive <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Pyramids of Egypt </h2><p>  They are called riddles because their occurrence cannot be explained scientifically.  There are so many mysteries and unsolved secrets that you can stop at only some of them.  For example, all the same Egyptian pyramids, which, it would seem, were investigated up to a centimeter, still cause a lot of questions. </p>

    <p>  The most important of them are who, for what purpose, and, most importantly, how to erect these engineering-perfect structures, which are a complex and harmoniously built 48-storey building.  During the construction, technologies and tools were used that humanity does not possess even now. </p><h2>  Science Evolves - New Puzzles Appear </h2><p>  The mysteries of the <span>most ancient civilizations are</span> not explained by official science, moreover, she meets with hostility any interference with her dogmas.  And humanity loves riddles and secrets, especially since they are found at every step.  And the further science moves forward, the more questions arise.  For example, with the advent of genetic engineering, it was proved that the DNA of dogs suggests that all of them were artificially removed from wolves, which they skillfully converted into a friend of a person, and this happened no later than 40 thousand years BC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Faith in Aliens </h2>

    <h2>  Mysterious city </h2><p>  In a word, the mysteries of the most ancient civilizations, which official science cannot explain, are not advertised.  So it is in Pakistan in the Indus Valley of the Mohenjo-Daro city with an amazing, almost modern layout and amenities.  There was running water, public toilets, saunas, grocery stores, well-maintained houses and a reasonable street layout.  It was built at the same time according to a pre-planned project, and all this happened 2600 years before our era. </p><h2>  Mysteries of the Sumerians </h2><p>  There was a <span>Sumerian civilization</span> on earth <span>,</span> covered in secrets and consisting of continuous riddles.  How did this miracle arise in wild places with little life?  Their written language is still not deciphered, in what language they spoke - is unknown.  But it is known that the Sumerians were familiar with metallurgy and seriously engaged in mathematics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddles and secrets of ancient civilizations" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/998592.jpg" width="400"></div>  Mankind owes them the invention of hours, minutes and seconds.  They calculated that the circle is exactly 360 degrees.  The Sumerians built buildings of burnt bricks, erected aqueducts, were familiar with astronomy.  Are these not the mysteries of the most ancient civilizations?  The rest of humanity on earth at that time was in its infancy.

The exact date of occurrence, the builders of this oldest city in the Western Hemisphere, their origin and language - nothing is known.  It is only known that at the top of the <span>pyramid of the Sun</span> there are rather large sheets of mica, which was used there not as a decoration, but as protection against electromagnetic and radio waves. </p><p>  Not a single list titled ‚ÄúMysteries and Secrets of Ancient Civilizations‚Äù is complete without mention of Lake Titicaca, located in the Andes on the border of Peru and Bolivia.  Located at an altitude of 3812 meters above sea level, it is known for the high technologies that were used here in the Stone Age.  With the help of canals, dams and dams, highly productive agricultural zones have been created.  In the construction of reclamation facilities, bronze was used, which could not be here at all. </p><h2>  Easter Island </h2><p>  And there are plenty of such inexplicable secrets on the surface of the earth.  But no less interesting and numerous are the riddles of the dungeons of ancient civilizations.  Amazing mysterious dungeons are in many places on the planet - under many cities they are full.  But there are also very ancient ones, for example, Easter Island dungeons or mysterious Maltese labyrinths.  Easter Island's multi-level and multi-kilometer artificial caves were discovered recently.  They stretch under the entire island, and no one knows what is at the very bottom.  Researchers, including <span>Thor Heyerdahl,</span> descended only to a depth of 100 meters.  In 45 caves, traces and <span>artifacts of ancient civilizations were found.</span>  The whole Easter island with its strange sculptures looking into the sky from nowhere is a complete puzzle of antiquity. </p><h2>  Underground territories </h2><p>  The mysteries of the dungeons of ancient civilizations are gradually comprehended.  Recently, some objects have been comprehensively examined by scientists, as a result of which underground cities have been discovered in Altai, the Urals, the Tien Shan, in the Sahara and in South America.  Many of them were erected in completely unfamiliar ways to humanity.  And this gives the right to assert that unknown civilizations existed underground.  An example is the underground city of Asgard in Peru, Kaymaklƒ± and Tatlarin in Turkey.  One of the most famous is the 20-story City of Derinkuyu, located all in the same Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddles of the history of ancient civilizations" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/999053.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Near Ecuador and Peru, there are also systems of tunnels and caves in which scientists have come across the mysteries of ancient civilizations.  The artifacts discovered here were two libraries: one from metal books, the second from crystal tables.  And upstairs at the time to which these books belong, wild tribes lived without any writing! </p><h2>  Mayan civilization - a mystery of times and peoples </h2><p>  And, of course, the whole world is worried about the mysteries of the ancient Mayan civilizations.  There are only 50 basic questions without answers. There are even sayings that the Mayan puzzles should not be solved, because the consequences can be unpredictable.  The artifact ‚ÄúSkull of Fate‚Äù, stored in the New York Museum, is, according to many, the most beautiful mystery of ancient history. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddles of the ancient Mayan civilizations" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/998595.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is made by an unknown craftsman from a single piece of incredibly hard material, rock crystal, and is an absolute copy of the human skull.  When a light source is directed into the nasal cavity, the entire skull begins to glow, and if the sun's rays are focused in the eye sockets, a flame breaks out from the opened jaws.  There is a legend that Hitler, an ardent admirer of everything mystical, believed that the owner of all 13 skulls would become the ruler of the world.

    <p>  Mayan knowledge is astounding, the tools that they used to build houses and equip a comfortable life are perplexing.  There is no need to talk about the Mayan calendar - this is a riddle from riddles.  Anthropologists have no idea who they are.  And of course there is no answer to the main question: "Where did this civilization instantly disappear, by historical standards?" </p><h2>  Non-disclosure conspiracy </h2><p>  As you can see, the mysteries of the history of ancient civilizations will remain without intelligible answers for a long time.  But the interest caused by them is so great that it makes scientists more systematically approach these issues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddles of the history of ancient civilizations" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/998594.jpg" width="600"></div>  Archeology is a science that, due to its specificity, is called upon to discover the unknown or long forgotten.  But there is forbidden archeology, the results of which were not disclosed.  This is explained by the unpreparedness of the inhabitants of the planet to understand and accept them.  Many scientific news contradict generally accepted concepts, and therefore remain for the public as "mysteries of history and archeology."  Ancient civilizations, under the pressure of scientists, primarily archaeologists, reveal their secrets with a creak.  So the huge skeletons found in 2013 in Ecuador (six units in height from 213 to 243 cm) were sent to Germany for thorough analysis.
