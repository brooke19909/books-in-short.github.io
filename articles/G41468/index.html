Ilyinskoye is a small village near Moscow, it is known for the fact that a beautiful estate was built here, in which representatives of the monarchy of the Russian dynasty lived for some time.  We will tell you how the history and the difficult fate of the Ilyinskoye estate (Moscow region) turned out, who lived here, who visited, and what is here today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="levakov.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor in Ilyinsky" class="if uuid-2977966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2977966.jpg"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The nearest suburbs from the Middle Ages is one of the most densely populated areas of the country.  This is explained by a convenient location in relation to the capital, where economic, social and cultural life was always in full swing.  Manor Ilyinskoye (Krasnogorsk district of the Moscow region) is located only a few tens of kilometers from Moscow.  The village, where the estate is located, is located on the banks of the Moskva River, in the immediate vicinity of the Ilyinsky highway.  The places here are very beautiful, since ancient times chosen by the authorities. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.75826799999999" data-lng="37.23776720000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/1/1/2/12112.png"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The village of Ilyinskoe is mentioned in documents dating back to the 16th century.  It was the center of the Luga lands - the great royal estate.  In 1618, according to historical data, a church was built here in the name of Elijah the Prophet.  This means that by this time a settlement had existed here for some time, but the exact date of the founding of Ilyinsky is unknown.  In the Time of Troubles, the village had a hard time, it was ruined, the church was burned, and only a few years later restored. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Manor Ilyinskoye, whose history knew both the times of elevation and the times of decline, during its existence has changed many owners.  Among them there were many very eminent people.  The first known owner of the estate was the Streshnev family.  It was a noble family, close to the court.  Its representatives served the Romanovs from Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich to Emperor Peter the Great.  In the family of the Streshnev there were diplomats, and soldiers, and court servants.  They owned the estate from 1634 to 1783.  With them, the settlement flourished.  From the documents of those times it is known that there were two wooden churches in the village: one - Elijah the Prophet, the second - Basil of Caesarea.  But after 1640, the second church disappeared from the documents, apparently, for some reason, it was destroyed. </p><p>  The most famous Streshnev, who owns the Ilinsky estate, was a chamberlain, secret adviser, cavalier of the Order of Alexander Nevsky Vasily Ivanovich.  He put a lot of effort and money into the development of the village and the estate.  So, with him, the current building of the Church of Elijah the Prophet was erected.  For this, the famous architect A.P. Yevlashev was invited.  He erected a baroque building with a rich interior.  For the church, a four-tier iconostasis was made of wood, covered with gilding and blue paint.  But in 1782 V.I. Streshnev dies, and the estate changes its owner. </p><h2>  In the possession of Count A.I. Osterman-Tolstoy </h2><p>  According to Streshnev's will, the Ilinsky estate passed to his nephew Count I. A. Osterman.  He was a well-known Russian diplomat, who successively held the positions of vice chancellor, and then chancellor of the Russian Empire.  After his resignation in Ilyinskoye, he did not make significant changes to the life of the estate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1811, the count died.  And Catherine II transferred his title and estate to his sister‚Äôs grandson Alexander Ivanovich Tolstoy.  Since that time, the count had a double surname - Osterman-Tolstoy.  The famous military leader, hero of the Patriotic War of 1812, general.  After the war, he retires due to poor health and is actively taken to improve the estate.  With him, a new main building was built from two floors, with terraces and beautiful wooden carvings, a summer theater was erected, and greenhouses and hanging gardens were set up.  The estate bloomed before our eyes, turning into a modern and luxurious estate.  At the count a garden was laid in the English style, with pavilions that were given very romantic names: "Shelter buddies", "Do not smell the grief."  A separate building in the pseudo-Gothic style was built for the library, an observatory also appeared.  In memory of comrades and ordinary soldiers who died in the war, Alexander Ivanovich ordered a linden alley to be planted along the highway through Arkhangelskoye to Tushin.  This initiative was taken up by the neighbor of the count, Prince Yusupov, and together they planted about 45 thousand trees.  This avenue today exists and feels great, recalling the victims of the Russian people in the name of the Fatherland. </p><p>  The count was a highly educated man, he spoke several languages, was well versed in music and poetry.  He collected a beautiful library in the estate.  In his house there were many famous people of that time.  The estate was managed by the writer I. I. Lazhechnikov, the author of the historical novel Ice House.  It is interesting that it was Alexander Ivanovich who first brought potatoes to this strip of Russia and sowed a whole field to them.  After the death of Emperor Alexander the First in 1828, the count fell out of favor with the royal family and was forced to go abroad.  The estate was left to the manager. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.blagovest-info.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="ilyinsky estates ilyinsky" class="if uuid-2977497" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2977497.jpg"></div><h2>  Country life </h2><p>  So that the estate could pay for itself, as well as make a profit in the 30-40s, the premises of the count estate are rented to summer residents.  Many famous people of that era rested here: the romantic poet N.M. Yazykov, in Ilyinsky he collected Russian folk songs that shocked him with their beauty, the mistress of the famous literary and art salon A.P. Elagin, the writer P.V. Kireyevsky, the famous author of The Scarlet Flower S. T. Aksakov.  It is interesting that the disgraced Russian poet Polezhaev met in Ilyinsky with the love of his life, Ekaterina Bibikova, to whom he devoted several wonderful poems.  In 1845, Count Osterman-Tolstoy transferred it to his nephew, Prince L. M. Golitsyn. </p><h2>  Golitsyn times </h2><p>  <span>Prince Golitsyn</span> continued to hand over part of the territory of the estate for rent to summer residents.  And the estate Ilyinskoye became a place for the school.  This was the first educational institution in the district, here the prince taught children the basics of science, and in specially equipped workshops taught them various skills.  In 1860, Prince L. M. Golitsyn died.  And after 4 years, his widow sold the estate to the royal family for 108 thousand rubles, an impressive amount at that time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nataturka.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://nataturka.ru/muzey-usadba/iliinskoe.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Ilinskoe Usovo" class="if uuid-2977500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2977500.jpg"></div><h2>  In the possession of the Romanov family </h2><p>  Emperor Alexander II wanted to make a significant gift to his wife Maria Alexandrovna and presented her with Ilyinsky.  The Romanovs' estate was owned by the royal family until the 1917 revolution.  The Empress really liked the manor, its layout and atmosphere and she insisted not to change anything here.  However, the husband still ordered the repair of the main building, which is already pretty dilapidated. </p><p>  According to the project of architects A. I. Rezanov and F. F. Richter, reconstruction was carried out.  The exterior of the building with its wide balconies and large windows throughout the facade was updated, and the interior was completely changed.  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, the interior of the estate was striking in its sophistication, sophisticated luxury and taste. </p><p>  By the decision of Maria Alexandrovna, a school for peasant children was built in Ilyinsky, as well as a hospital for villagers.  Under the strict guidance of the empress, an exemplary farm was established in the estate, delivering food to the royal table.  Also, on her initiative, a telegraph and a post office appeared in Ilyinsky, and a new high-quality road was laid to the village of Pavshino. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nataturka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor ilyinsky" class="if uuid-2977951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2977951.jpg"></div><h2>  Usovo </h2><p>  In 1867, Emperor Alexander the Second bought the village of Usovo, next to Ilyinsky.  He had long been making offers to the owners of this land, the Velyaminovs, and so he finally managed to buy this lot.  The emperor gave the village a wife with the words that it would complement the beauty and integrity of Ilyinsky.  So, the estate territory has increased significantly, now it extended to two banks of the Moscow River.  And the empress had the opportunity to realize many of her projects.  The Ilinsky-Usovo estate pleased the imperial family until 1880, spending time on the estate, they visited both villages every day, which were united not only by economic and economic systems, but also by a common aesthetic plan. </p><h2>  Manor of the Governor General of Moscow </h2><p>  After the death of Empress Maria Alexandrovna in 1880, part of her property by will passed to her fifth son, including Usovo-Ilyinskoye.  The estate of Sergei Alexandrovich became the summer residence of the future Governor General of Moscow.  In 1889, the Grand Duke ordered the design of a new main house in Ilyinsky to the architect Sergei Rodionov, one of the outstanding masters of Art Nouveau.  And three years later, the same architect erects a house in Usovo. </p><p>  In 1884, the Grand Duke, a general, a member of the State Council brought his young wife Elizaveta Fedorovna, sister of Empress Alexandra Fedorovna, nee Princess of Hesse, to Ilinsky.  The young people spent their honeymoon in Ilyinsky and later every summer lived here.  Sergei Alexandrovich was a deeply Orthodox person, in his house life was organized in accordance with church rules.  His wife in Ilyinsky studied the Russian language, went to church service, and delved into the particularities of housekeeping.  The family of the Grand Duke led a simple life in the village, they went to the forest for mushrooms and berries, talked with people from the people, spent evenings reading, playing music.  The couple did not have their children, but Sergey Alexandrovich‚Äôs nephews and pupils were constantly in the house. </p><p>  On July 20, on Ilyin‚Äôs Day, the Romanov family arranged a big fair in the field near the estate, the holiday lasted 3 days.  The Grand Duke himself necessarily made purchases from all merchants, entered into conversation with everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="levakov.livejournal.com" data-author=": levakov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor ilyinsky address" class="if uuid-2977512" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2977512.jpg"></div><p>  During the Russo-Japanese War, the wife of the Grand Duke arranged an infirmary in the Ilyinsky Hospital for wounded soldiers.  In 1905, Sergei Alexandrovich died tragically, the Socialist Revolutionary Ivan Kalyaev threw a homemade bomb at him.  His widow devoted the rest of her life to charity.  She founded the Martha-Mariinsky monastery and retired there from the world.  And the Ilinsky estate went to the nephews of the Governor General, the children of his brother Sergey Alexandrovich Dmitry Pavlovich and Maria Pavlovna.  However, this possession was very short-lived. </p><h2>  Revolutionary and Soviet times </h2><p>  Immediately after the 1917 revolution, the Ilinsky estate was nationalized, part of the situation was looted, but the basic values ‚Äã‚Äãwere described and put into state storage. </p><p>  In 1918 V.I. Lenin came here together with the Minister of Health, they examined the estate and made a decision to open a rest house for the working class in it.  Later, a sanatorium for workers of the Trekhgornaya manufactory was located in the estate, in honor of the leader of the revolution he was named "Illichyovo." </p><p>  In 1920, F. Chaliapin even came here with a concert.  The farm of the imperial family was transformed into the Ilinskoye-Usovo state farm, which opens a large dairy farm.  The manor in Soviet times was divided into two parts, on each of which state dachas were made for high-ranking officials. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the 40s, S. I. Putin, the grandfather of the President of the Russian Federation, worked as a cook in the estate. </p><h2>  Famous guests of the estate </h2><p>  During the time of Count <span>Osteraman-Tolstoy, the estate</span> in Ilyinsky received many guests.  A friend of Alexander Ivanovich, poet P. A. Vyazemsky, poet F. Tyutchev has been here more than once.  During the tsarist period, representatives of the royal family, courtiers, representatives of the aristocracy, and eminent dignitaries visited Ilyinsky.  In 1918, the leader of the proletariat V.I. Lenin was here.  In Soviet times, N. S. Khrushchev and K. Chernenko rested at a cottage in Ilyinsky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.activatica.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor in ilyinsky" class="if uuid-2977547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2977547.jpg"></div><h2>  Homestead today </h2><p>  During perestroika, many suburbs of Moscow and their estates began to turn into ruins, a similar fate awaited the Ilyinsky estate.  The photo proves that time was ruthless towards this place, many buildings were destroyed or rebuilt barbarously, only the main house, an outbuilding, several pavilions were preserved, but you can only visit the church.  Today, there is a private sanatorium and cottage village "Ilinsky estates."  Ilyinsky, as a monument of history and architecture, essentially ceased to exist.  But in 2018, a state decision was made to restore the estate and make it a tourist attraction. </p><h2>  Church of Elijah the Prophet in Ilyinsky </h2><p>  Since today the Ilinsky estate is not accessible to the public, the main attraction and the only surviving historical building is the Church of Elijah the Prophet.  The current building was built under V.I. Streshnev.  Under Count A.I. Osterman-Tolstoy, two chapels were added to the building: John the Theologian and St. Theodore in honor of his ancestors.  In Soviet times, the church was used for various purposes, but after perestroika it was returned to its true owners - parishioners.  The church went through restoration, and now pleases the parishioners with its elegant interior.  The new abbot came up with the idea to create a faience iconostasis here, which was supplemented by icons painted by Palekh masters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="galina-lukas.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="manor ilyinsky photo" class="if uuid-2977541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39124/2977541.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Despite the fact that today there is no open access to the territory of the former estate, you can come to the village and take a walk in the vicinity, visit the Church of Elijah the Prophet.  Muscovites often like to relax in the suburbs and one of the interesting directions is the Ilinsky estate.  Location Address: Sadovaya Nov.  street, 1, in Krasnogorsk, Moscow region.  You can get here by car along the Ilyinsky highway, by train on the Riga direction or by minibus. </p>
