    <h2>  The concept </h2><p>  These groups of substances are volatile compounds of various chemical nature contained in plant organisms.  If we consider the term itself, then it consists of two components: phyton - "plants" and caedo - "kill".  From here the biological meaning of these compounds becomes clear - they are able to inhibit other plants. </p><p>  However, after more thorough research, it became clear that they destroy not only them, but also microorganisms, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and some viruses.  Thus, phytoncide is a <span>natural</span> directed <span>antibiotic</span> that forms in vivo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chemical nature </h2><p>  To determine the chemical structure of these substances, many experiments have been done.  However, little is known today.  The fact is that phytoncide is a whole complex of compounds of a volatile nature.  So, for example, this can be attributed to those contained in plants: </p><ul><li>  glycosides; </li><li>  terpenes; </li><li>  flavonoids; </li><li>  phenolic compounds; </li><li>  catechins; </li><li>  anthocyanins; </li><li>  <span>tannins</span> ; </li><li>  phenolic acids; </li><li>  constituents of essential oils. </li></ul><p>  By structure, these are complex organic <span>heterocyclic compounds that</span> make up whole combinations with each other.  The properties of volatile exhibit quite definite - inhibitory effects on living organisms of a microscopic structure, as well as on certain types of plants. </p>

    <h2>  History of discovery and study </h2><p>  For the first time, such compounds as phytoncides were discussed only in 1928 thanks to the work of B.P. Topkin.  It was he who first conducted simple experiments with gruel from onion pulp, which showed how destructive it affects ciliates, bacteria and fungi. </p><p>  Although it has been known since ancient times that there are a number of plants related to medicinal plants that have antimicrobial, bactericidal and therapeutic, general strengthening effect.  Echinacea, maral root, <span>red brush,</span> onion, garlic, blueberries, conifers and others - these are the plants that have been used to treat colds and other diseases since the development of human civilization.  Of course, no one could explain scientifically what explains this good healing effect. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But over time, there was a technical opportunity to isolate and study the components that are responsible for this.  So they were called volatile.  The term itself was proposed by their discoverer, B.P. Topkin, in the same 1928.  Later, a number of scientists made conclusions about the properties that these substances possess.  It became clear that phytoncide is an <span>antibiotic of natural</span> origin.  In 1937, G. Molish studied the phenomenon of allelopathy (the inhibitory effect of some species of creatures on others by chemical exposure to natural components).  In fact, his work was reduced to the study of what are the properties of volatile production. </p>

    <p>  A number of scientists (Grimmer, Winter, Grodzinsky) experimentally examined the phenomenon of allelopathy in laboratory conditions.  But the result was the conclusion that in artificial and natural conditions the action is much different in effectiveness.  They even began to talk about the lack of ecological significance of volatile production.  However, not all support these views.  For example, in Japan, China, Russia, to this day great importance is given to medical procedures, the basis of which are plants.  Phytoncides help fight a number of diseases, and the effect should be carried out precisely in natural conditions <span>(pine forests,</span> grass fields, gardens and so on). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Importance for animals and humans </h2><p>  What are plants and phytoncides primarily influencing, if we talk about human organisms and mammals? </p><ol><li>  Reduce the quantitative content of microbes in the air up to 250 times per 1 m <sup>3</sup> .  Therefore, walks in the forests where such plants grow (conifers, oak groves, deciduous), improve the condition of the lungs, normalize the respiratory system.  They are very useful for patients with tuberculosis, other diseases in this area.  Good bronchodilator effect in linden, thyme, birch. </li><li>  It is oak groves that have the ability to normalize high blood pressure, therefore, such treatment is indicated for hypertensive patients. </li><li>  Many herbs containing volatile and vitamins strengthen immunity, act sedatively, normalize sleep and mental state (lemon balm, oregano and others). </li><li>  Hypotonic patients are recommended to increase the pressure substances of lilac and poplar. </li><li>  Many phytoncides have a vasodilating effect, due to which they relieve headaches, spasms (peppermint). </li><li>  These compounds ionize the air, precipitate dust molecules, clean and disinfect the environment.  Accordingly, they improve the general atmosphere for the normal development of living beings. </li><li>  A number of plants help in the fight against colds, infectious and viral diseases (onions, garlic, raspberries, blueberries, radishes, mustard and others). </li></ol><p>  Thus, the importance of volatile for animal organisms and humans is important.  With the help of them, you can save yourself from the use of strong antibiotics, synthesized artificially, to prevent the formation of the consequences that they entail.  Of course, the effect of volatile production will not be so fast, but more soft, gentle and effective. </p>

    <h2>  Effects on plant organisms </h2><p>  Many studies, including the experience of inveterate gardeners and gardeners, have shown that different plants are not equally able to coexist next to each other.  So, for example, they act negatively on each other: </p><ul><li>  grapes and cabbage; </li><li>  legumes and onions, spinach, garlic; </li><li>  peas and tomatoes; </li><li>  cabbage and potatoes; </li><li>  parsnip, horseradish, celery and cabbage; </li><li>  potatoes and melons; </li><li>  peas and gladioli. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, volatile and other volatile compounds produced by plants can inhibit the growth and development of each other, and often, on the contrary, help in this.  Successful fruit growing and vegetable growing are based on such combinations. </p><h2>  Garlic volatile </h2><p>  Allicin was named the main component of the chemical composition of phytoncides of such a plant as garlic.  It is this compound that gives a sharp specific smell.  His merits include the destructive effect on different types of bacteria, fungi. </p><p>  Garlic volatile has been used since antiquity in various civilizations and countries.  This plant defended itself against diseases, protected the house from vampires, and treated gastrointestinal diseases.  For some peoples, garlic was even a symbol. </p><p>  Today, there are alcohol extracts of this plant, drugs based on it.  The harmful effects on Escherichia coli, many types of microscopic fungi, Koch bacillus, cholera and typhoid bacteria have led to the widespread use of garlic. </p>

    <h2>  Onion volatile </h2><p>  Along with garlic, onions have been used to treat many diseases since ancient times.  In addition to volatile, its composition includes: </p><ul><li>  vitamins; </li><li>  organic acids; </li><li>  minerals; </li><li>  essential oil. </li></ul><p>  All components in combination make onions a very valuable plant for use in food and medical purposes.  Also, hoods and gruel from it accelerate the healing and healing of wounds. </p><p>  Phytoncides of onions are part of the essential oil, which has a sharp characteristic odor, when irritated to the mucous membranes of the eyes, cause irritation and tearing.  They are able to defeat the sticks: cholera, tuberculosis, dysentery, Staphylococcus aureus. </p><p>  In a harmonious combination, volatile onion and garlic are able to fight colds, clear germs from indoor air and improve people's health. </p><h2>  Essential oils - a source of volatile </h2><p>  Essential oils are one of the main substances containing various phytoncides.  They are part of many (almost all) plants, only in different quantities.  There are representatives of the flora who are very rich in these compounds, and therefore phytoncides.  For example, mint, lemon balm, needles of trees, tomatoes, onions and garlic, mustard, horseradish, bird cherry, radish, currant and others.  There are those in which the minimum content of essential oils and phytoncides is cucumbers, persimmons, bananas.  Also, the location of essential oils is not the same in plants.  Some have more in the leaves, others in the roots or stalk. </p>

    <h2>  Phytodesign </h2><p>  Fitontsid is a source of freshness, purity and the benefits of air.  Therefore, there is such a direction in landscape construction as phytodesign.  It implies the planting of such a number of phytoncid-containing plants that can cope with air pollutants and maintain it in good condition.  That is, phytodesign is a way to improve the ecological state of the environment, strengthen people's health and prevent the development of massive microbial diseases. </p>
