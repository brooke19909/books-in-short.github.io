    <h2>  The location of the lake, features and location map </h2><p>  There is a reservoir just two kilometers from Rostov-on-Don, which allows you to get not only by car, but also by any other form of transport, whether it be a bicycle or a fixed-route taxi.  The location map is quite simple - you need to leave the city through the west bridge, keep to the left-bank zone and continue straight along the bridge, where you can soon see the sign. </p><p>  <span>Blue lakes</span> (Rostov-on-Don) are very clean water, but even in extreme heat it is cool.  Numerous springs, which are deep at the bottom, do not allow her to warm up.  They are the main source of replenishment of the reservoir. </p><p>  There are several equipped beaches on Lake Goluboy.  In order to spend time there, you will need to pay an entrance fee.  The fee is purely symbolic.  A large sandy beach, sun loungers and umbrellas, a barbecue area, gazebos, toilets and more are offered for it.  The cost of parking starts at just 100 rubles.  For those who do not want to splurge, there are free beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lake rostov photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150953.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Impressions of residents and visitors </h2><p>  Many vacationers note in their reviews not only positive, but also negative moments of relaxation on Lake Blue.  The main plus is, of course, the cleanest water in the district, which attracts not only local residents, but also guests of the city and people passing along the way.  It can also be noted that the proximity is a plus, since almost everyone can easily come here.  At the same time, such a crowded place for lovers of a quiet holiday is not very happy.  Many go to the Blue Lake (Rostov), ‚Äã‚Äãa photo of which you can see in the article, only because of the restaurant of the same name, which is famous for its varied menu.  Customers especially like delicious dishes and professional fast service. </p>
