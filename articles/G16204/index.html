    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the many positive reviews about the Puppyoo D-9002 vacuum cleaner, there are several negative points that arise during the use of the device. </p><ul><li>  Noise level.  Although the manufacturer assures that the vacuum cleaner uses a three-stage noise reduction system, buyers believe that the device works the same way as its counterparts.  Some consumers made noise measurements with a special UNI-T UT353 instrument.  The experiment showed that when operating at maximum power, the noise level is 77 dBa, and at minimum - 72.5 dBa.  Evaluation of other models of the same power showed that the noise level varied within 76 dBa. </li><li>  Although the container is quite spacious - 2.5 liters, some buyers, especially pet owners, believe that it was worth buying a model with a more spacious waste bin.  Sometimes you have to clean it twice for cleaning. </li></ul><p>  Negative reviews do not stop people from buying a vacuum cleaner.  They believe that, despite the shortcomings, this is a worthy model for their money. </p><h2>  Vacuum cleaner Puppyoo WP968 </h2><p>  An analogue of the D-9002 model on the market is the powerful Puppyoo WP968 vacuum cleaner.  This model is similar to that considered for the length of the cord, the volume of the dust bag and weight.  But it has a lower rated and maximum power. </p><p>  The vacuum cleaner has 5 nozzles in a set, namely: for removing mites, a combined brush, a brush for animals, brushes universal and for hard surfaces.  The latter is equipped with a strip of horse hair, which ensures maximum cleaning of the floor. </p><p>  The difference from the Puppyoo D-9002 is the inability to control the power level.  Customers also complain about the long delivery.  Some are not satisfied with the brightness of the model, but a vacuum cleaner is sold in only one color - turquoise. </p><p>  The cost of a vacuum cleaner is about 18 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="robot vacuum cleaner puppyoo v m611" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2152100.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Vacuum cleaner Puppyoo V M611 </h2><p>  Many buyers are eager to follow the technology and value the purchase of robotic vacuum cleaners instead of standard models. </p><p>  The Puppyoo V M611 robot vacuum cleaner is designed for cleaning hard surfaces - linoleum, laminate, parquet - from small debris and dust.  The device is equipped with rotating brushes that trap debris and direct it to the dust suction compartment. </p><p>  The model differs in very small dimensions, weight and the ability to wirelessly work. </p><p>  Buyers consider the absence of a contact bumper to be positive; it has been replaced with a soft safety bezel.  Such an improvement allows the vacuum cleaner not to hit the walls, but to gently bypass them. </p><p>  The suction power of such a device is 15 watts.  And the noise level reaches 60 dB.  Power is supplied by a 2200 mAh battery.  The device is able to work without interruption up to 2 hours, and the charging time is 6 hours. </p><p>  You can buy a vacuum cleaner at a cost of about 30 thousand rubles.  excluding discounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews on vacuum cleaner puppyoo wp9005b" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/2152101.jpg"></div>
