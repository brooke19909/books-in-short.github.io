Moreover, it does not matter what the weather is outside.  And in the summer heat and cold most people will not allow themselves to dress ugly.  For this reason, in this article, we will explain to readers how to knit fingerless gloves with knitting needles.  After all, this accessory, by the way, is called mittens, looks more interesting than mittens, and knits easier than gloves.  Which means it is ideal for beginners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boredpanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit mitt knitting needles mk" class="if uuid-3046726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046726.jpg"></div><h2>  Which model to choose </h2><p>  If you enter a query on a topic under study into any search engine, you can familiarize yourself with the incredible number of original fingerless gloves.  What is most important for beginners, it will be possible to find quite affordable and simple models.  However, each will differ in shape, length, pattern, decor, way of designing the thumb used for knitting with a tool, yarn and many other features.  For this reason, before studying the instructions on how to knit fingerless gloves with knitting needles, it is important to come up with or choose the most suitable design for the desired accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lomets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit mitts" class="if uuid-3046717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046717.jpg"></div><h2>  How not to get confused when buying knitting threads </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen are convinced that good yarn is one of the main guarantors of successful work.  Therefore, her choice should be approached very seriously and carefully.  First of all, gloves are a warm accessory.  Accordingly, for its knitting it is more reasonable to consider a thread that will warm the handles.  Various types of wool are considered ideal.  However, those who are prone to allergies will have to fork out for a more expensive one.  For example, merino.  Secondly, when buying yarn, one should not forget who wants to knit fingerless gloves with knitting needles.  Novice masters often make a mistake when solving this issue.  Professionals advise using any juicy shades to do children's things, women‚Äôs warm (red, herbal green, lemon), men‚Äôs cold (indigo, eggplant, turquoise). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the choice of knitting needles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles" class="if uuid-3046709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046709.jpg"></div><p>  A convenient tool is the second factor that determines the beauty and accuracy of work.  Experienced needlewomen believe that it is especially important for beginners to approach the search for the most optimal option.  Traditionally, for knitting the studied accessory they take knitting needles, the diameter of which is equal to the thickness of the prepared yarn.  However, the cuffs can be tied with a slightly smaller tool.  Moreover, it is more convenient to knit mittens, gloves and mittens on hosiery knitting needles.  They are sold as a set - 5 pieces per pack.  It is also worth noting that many inexperienced craftsmen acquire knitting needles at random, not paying attention to the material from which they are made.  Although professional knitters, talking about how to knit fingerless gloves with knitting needles, they say that each person knits differently.  Some tighten the loop, others, on the contrary, knit very weakly.  Therefore, the first is more suitable for metal tools, and the second - wooden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boredpanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit mitt knitting needles step by step" class="if uuid-3046723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046723.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine the most suitable pattern </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen rarely ask the question that we have formed in the subtitle of the current item.  In most cases, they decorate their idea with various braids and plaits or with the image of animals and winter attributes - snowflakes, deers, the symbol of the upcoming New Year.  For beginning masters, it is better to first understand the principle of work, find out how to knit gloves without fingers with knitting needles.  And already after improving his skills, implementing the most vivid and original ideas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Options for simple and interesting patterns </h2><p>  At first, it is wiser to knit with solid front loops or a series of back and front rows.  But at the same time, it is worth buying interesting yarn.  For example, melange.  Such a technique will distract attention from the usual pattern, revive a simple accessory with an original thread.  If you still want to work with the pattern, you should give preference to one of the relief.  The most simple and interesting options can be explored in the picture below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for mitts" class="if uuid-3046704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046704.jpg"></div><h2>  Palm measurement technology </h2><p>  Knitting fingerless gloves with knitting needles according to the description drawn up by an experienced needlewoman is very simple.  But most of the ready-made instructions use standard parameters.  And it seems that the exact observance of each step of the master class does not allow mistakes.  However, in this case, there is a risk that the accessory made by someone else‚Äôs standards will not fit in size - it will turn out to be large or, conversely, small.  To prevent this, it is better to independently measure the palm for which the studied product will be connected.  This is much simpler than it might seem.  It is only necessary to prepare the main tool - a centimeter tape.  And so that the parameters do not fly out of the head, they should be fixed on paper.  We need to find out only five values: </p><ol><li>  Girth of the wrist. </li><li>  The length of the main part of the accessory. </li><li>  The distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  Girth of the thumb through the bone. </li><li>  Girth of the palm. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting mitt description" class="if uuid-3046753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046753.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step master class </h2><p>  Both experienced craftsmen and beginner fingerless gloves are knitted using the same technology.  Let's consider it further: </p><ol><li>  We begin to perform the studied accessory from the cuff, so we dial the following number of loops: palm girth in cm times 2. </li><li>  We distribute the loops on the hosiery knitting needles and knit an arbitrary number of rows with a single or double elastic band.  Both options are a series of seamy and facial loops throughout the series.  But in the first, the rapport is two loops, and in the second - four. </li><li>  Having connected the cuffs, we subtract the current number of loops from the necessary for girth of the palm. </li><li>  In the next row we add the missing, but not all at once, but evenly. </li><li>  Next, we begin to knit a wedge of the thumb.  Using a thread of a different color, we separate four loops on the side.  In each odd row, add two air ones - before and after the labeled ones.  We knit all even rows without changes. </li><li>  We continue in this way until we form the desired size hole for the thumb. </li><li>  Then we tie the remaining number of rows to cover the distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  Separate the loops for knitting the main part of the accessory, transfer the rest to the pins. </li><li>  We knit a fingerless glove of the required length.  If desired, we knit several rows of elastic at the end. </li><li>  Close the hinges and return to the thumb hole.  It can simply be tied or lifted into several rows.  In the first case, we use a hook, collecting loops and creating a beautiful edge.  In the second - we work with knitting needles, moving in a circle the desired number of rows. </li><li>  By analogy, we knit a pair of accessory.  However, the thumb hole should be on the other side. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="viaspatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles for beginners" class="if uuid-3046728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3046728.jpg"></div><p>  For readers who are interested in how to knit long fingerless gloves with knitting needles, it is important to clarify that the technology in this case will be identical.  But you should start knitting cuffs with the number of loops equal to the girth of the arm in the place where the lower edge of the accessory will be located. </p><h2>  How to knit mitts on two knitting needles </h2><p>  Both beginners and experienced needlewomen agree that knitting the studied accessory on four knitting needles is extremely uncomfortable.  Therefore, an interesting technology has recently gained popularity.  It can be considered further. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="UIMCN5nAlSo" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1196&amp;v=UIMCN5nAlSo" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/7/2/0/13720.jpg"></div><p>  So, we highlighted all the important nuances of the work.  However, if the reader still does not understand how to knit fingerless gloves (openwork, patterned, simple or otherwise), we will be happy to help with advice.
