If you use bulky yarn, you can knit a cover, a cover for a stool or chair, a tablecloth, pillowcase for a pillow and so on. </p><p>  Crochet napkins for beginners is best to start with thin acrylic or wool mixture, picking up any color scheme you like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thegreendragonfly.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color napkin" class="if uuid-2581707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581707.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  First you need to take your favorite strings and choose the right hook - this is very important, since the type of the finished product will directly depend on the combination of the thickness of the hook and the thickness of the thread. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then you need to find an easy-to-follow pattern on the Internet or in a knitting magazine (you can also watch video lessons on the Internet and learn from them). </p><p>  Crocheting napkins can seem like a lot of work, but this is just the beginning.  Of course, such a painstaking job requires attention and perseverance.  It is necessary to carefully consider the loop, so as not to make mistakes.  Even one inconspicuous, it would seem, skipping a loop or an additional column in an unnecessary place can ruin all the work. </p><p>  In order not to bandage the finished napkin, it makes sense to correct mistakes immediately - it is better to bandage one or two rows than the entire napkin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volumetric napkin" class="if uuid-2581734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581734.jpg"></div><h2>  Crochet patterns for napkins </h2><p>  Any knitting begins with a search for patterns.  And their diversity is simply amazing.  There are schemes of the most simple napkins, where the whole difficulty lies in the correct calculation of columns and air loops - they are just right for beginner knitters. </p><p>  And there are such intricate patterns of fillet knitting or Irish lace that it is better for a novice craftswoman to postpone them until later, when experience appears. </p><p>  The crochet pattern of napkins will be presented below.  Guided by it, even a novice craftswoman will be able to knit her first napkin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="postila.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napkin layout" class="if uuid-2591691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2591691.jpg"></div><h2>  Napkin - the most uncomplicated option </h2><p>  The description of crochet napkins is easy to find on the all-knowing Internet or in knitting magazines and books. </p><p>  In order to really learn how to knit napkins and not to throw an untied product somewhere far away, it is worth paying attention to simpler schemes. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="5PfIaaUcp7I" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PfIaaUcp7I" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/1/0/5/5105.jpg"></div><p>  Symbols that are in each scheme: </p><ol><li>  In / p - air loop. </li><li>  CCH - single crochet. </li><li>  CC2H - double crochet. </li></ol><p>  The simplest pattern for a napkin includes a beautiful alternation of ordinary double crochet columns and chains of air loops, which give the product a delicacy. </p><p>  Knitting of this napkin begins with a chain of twelve loops, which closes in a circle. </p><ul><li>  1 row - it is necessary to make three lifting loops and knit thirty-one double crochet into a ring of air loops; </li><li>  2 row - having closed the ring, begin to knit a simple pattern; </li><li>  3 b / c, 4 CC2H fit into the columns of the previous row; </li><li>  knit 3 w / p and again four CC2H, not missing the columns in the bottom row; </li><li>  3 row: 4 military units, 6 SS2N; </li><li>  4 row: 4 military units, 8 SS2N; </li><li>  5th row: 9 military units, 10 SS2N; </li><li>  6th row: 11 military units, 4 SS2N, 11 military units, skipping 2 columns from the previous row, 4 SS2N; </li><li>  at the end of the row, the connecting half-column is knitted in the first loop; </li><li>  7th row: 5 military units, 15 SS2N; </li><li>  then 5 v / p, one column in a chain of air loops of the previous row; </li><li>  8 row: 6 w / w, SS2N a small pico of 4 w / w is performed; </li><li>  CC2H is knitted in the third column of the previous row. </li></ul><p>  Transitions between rows should be carefully looked at the diagram. </p><p>  Finish work by carefully tucking the remaining tip of the thread with a needle under the columns of the previous row. </p><p>  <span>Crocheting a</span> napkin is not difficult, but you can get great pleasure from your work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Butterfly Napkin" class="if uuid-2581708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581708.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting a round napkin </h2><p>  Knitted round napkin is a classic and the most affordable version of this product. </p><p>  Crocheting a napkin usually begins with knitting several air loops, in each pattern their number will be different.  Further, the napkin is knitted according to the scheme, which can be either simple or with a set of complex elements. </p><p>  It all depends on the skill level of the knitter.  The final size of the napkin can also vary from miniature to rather large products - this is also affected by the thickness of the yarn used for knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="articulo.mercadolibre.com.ve" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Serving napkins" class="if uuid-2581711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581711.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting oval napkins </h2><p>  Crocheting an <span>oval</span> napkin can be done in various ways: </p><ol><li>  The first method: in circular rows.  It starts with an elongated base, around which an openwork motif is knitted. </li><li>  The second way: separately create several segments of napkins, for example, flowers, which are then combined with an openwork mesh. </li><li>  Another option: lengthening a round napkin.  To do this, in certain places (on the sides) add additional elements.  Here you need skills and certain experience. </li></ol><p>  Crocheting an oval napkin is performed not only in circular rows. </p><p>  For example, the technique of fillet knitting allows you to make any kind of pattern. </p><p>  Oval napkins are made up of rectangular or square elements.  When the right amount of these elements is connected, you need to combine them using an openwork grid.  Then follows the strapping. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oval napkin" class="if uuid-2581713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581713.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitting a square or rectangular napkin </h2><p>  Crocheting square napkins is not as popular as knitting round or oval items.  But such napkins look no less beautiful and original than any others. </p><p>  You can make a square napkin, starting from the center.  There is a knitting option, when the beginning is a chain, then there are rotary rows according to the scheme. </p><p>  Square and rectangular napkins are made mainly in the sirloin technique.  Quadrangular motifs are used in knitting tablecloths or large napkins on a chest of drawers, a bedside table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Square napkin" class="if uuid-2581720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88350/2581720.jpg"></div><h2>  Napkins as a gift </h2><p>  Having mastered crocheting napkins for beginners, you can try to deal with patterns more complicated.  Such napkins can add a twist to the interior, creating a unique beauty and coziness, decorating the open spaces of countertops and nightstands. </p><p>  Since napkins are very different: small, large, multi-colored, voluminous, you can choose the right ones for any interior, even for a children's room. </p><p>  You can choose napkins with tied three-dimensional figures of swans and make the product in the form of a swan lake.  You can also create voluminous flowers and also place them around the perimeter of a related product, thus depicting a flower meadow. </p><p>  You can associate napkins in the form of a sunflower or with bulk grapes.  In general, the fantasy of needlewomen truly has no boundaries. </p><p>  Such masterpieces can be safely presented to your friends and relatives, they will be eternally happy and will appreciate the gift. </p>
