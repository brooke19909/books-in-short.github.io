This port megalopolis is the administrative center of the province of Antalya.  It is located above sea level at an altitude of 30 meters.  The city has 1,073,794 people.  In summer, the population increases to two million people.  At the moment, Antalya consists of two parts - the old and the new city.  It was founded in 159 BC.  e.  the Greek king, Pergamum, Attalus II, and originally called Attalia.  This later city was renamed Antalya.  In 133 BC  e.  it was conquered by the Romans and turned into the residence of the <span>emperor Hadrian.</span>  For a very long time Rome owned the city, and then Byzantium. </p><h2>  Antalya Tourism </h2><p>  Antalya has tremendous <span>recreational resources,</span> thanks to which it has become a real "Mecca" for European tourists.  The historical center of the resort is not losing out on modern buildings - they, as before, are interested in lovers of national colors.  Local architecture brought together elements of the Byzantine, Roman and Ottoman schools - a consequence of the complex history of Turkey.  In the territory of Antalya there are three noisy waterfalls and a large number of parks.  The ski track with sparkling snow is located forty kilometers from the metropolis.  A large number of different restaurants, bars and cafes are scattered throughout the resort for every taste and budget. </p>

They are considered one of the best on the entire Mediterranean <span>coast.</span>  <span>Antalya</span> also has a comfortable local airport.  Roads throughout the city are ideal, and from year to year the situation is only improving: here hotels are being updated, suburban highways are expanding.  It should be noted that the city authorities are doing a lot of work to develop the infrastructure of the city.  They try to decorate it as best as possible: equip cozy bus stops, build new roads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  City Hall acquired instead of the old decommissioned "dolmushi" new Japanese minibuses.

    <p>  What else do tourists say in their reviews of Prima Hotel 3 *?  Antalya is an amazing metropolis, and the opinion of guests about it is always interesting to everyone.  Vacationers say that the hotel building is in excellent condition, the rooms are superbly renovated, equipped with new furniture.  Plumbing, air conditioning and internet work fine.  Guests note that they did not hear about theft at the hotel: valuable items were sometimes left in the rooms, but there was never any loss. </p><p>  They really like the two pools that the hotel owns.  Tourists note that here the assortment of dishes is small, there is little meat and therefore men do not overeat.  By the way, they are sure that this hotel is not suitable for a summer vacation with children.  After all, there is no beach nearby, although the hotel is located near the sea.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to approach the shore here, since there are rocks everywhere.  Although, if you walk two hundred meters to the left of the hotel, you can find a descent to the rocks, on which tourists like to sunbathe.  And at an illegally built cafe you can take a deck chair for a certain price.  When entering the water, it does not immediately become deep, but the bottom is rocky.  Since a spring flows from the rocks into the sea, the water here is cool even in sultry August.  By the way, the water on the coast is not salty and transparent. </p><p>  Overall, tourists like this hotel.  They say that it is suitable for a family without children or single people.  But those who are waiting for a fun and satisfying pastime need to look for another, more suitable hotel. </p><p>  Travelers say that the cost of a trip for two with a flight from Moscow is 29,000 rubles.  And for the most inexpensive unplanned vacation in Turkey, it is impossible to find a hotel for that price. </p><h2>  <strong>Thailand or Turkey?</strong> </h2><p>  And let's look at the Prima Villa Hotel, which is in Thailand.  We will have a great opportunity to compare these two amazing resorts and choose - where do we go on vacation?  Thailand or Turkey?  Oh, this is a very difficult question.  So, let's begin. </p><p>  The magnificent Prima Villa Hotel 3 * is a cottage complex.  It is located in the resort city of Pattaya in the southeast of Thailand.  Pattaya is located on the east coast of the <span>Gulf of Thailand,</span> in the province of Chonburi, 165 kilometers southeast of Bangkok.  What does the name of the city mean?  It translates as "southwestern wind at the beginning of the rainy season." </p><h2>  <strong>Pattaya Hotel</strong> </h2><p>  Prima Villa Hotel is built at a distance of two hundred meters from the sea.  To get from the airport to the hotel, you must overcome a long distance - about forty kilometers.  This is a great hotel.  It consists of two-story and three-story buildings, small comfortable bungalows.  In the hotel, tourists are always greeted warmly and cordially, provide comfortable rooms, provide high-quality service. <strong></strong></p>
