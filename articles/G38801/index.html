We offer patterns of direct <span>dresses with</span> 3/4 <span>sleeves</span> , as well as other models.  A shortened sleeve will show others graceful wrists, a straight skirt will help to make the waist slimmer, and legs - longer.  After reading the article, you can safely go to the store for a cloth for a fashionable new thing. </p><h2>  Loose dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a direct dress with a sleeve 3 4" class="if uuid-2237745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2237745.jpg"></div><p>  Such a thing today is at the peak of popularity.  Fashionable oversize in dresses looks incredibly feminine.  The wide shortened sleeves of the ‚Äúbat‚Äù style will help to emphasize beautiful wrists and elegant brushes.  A baggy top will help distract attention from the chest and concentrate it on the hips.  So if a bust is not your main advantage, then this dress model will definitely appeal to you.  Such an outfit can very well be made a grand weekend, if you correctly beat it with accessories. </p><p>  Let's move on to the pattern of a straight dress with a 3/4 sleeve.  We print out the circuit that is given above and scale it.  Now you need to transfer the pattern to the fabric.  For this dress, you should choose a light, well-draped material.  When the blanks are cut, you can start the sewing process.  First you need to lay the side seams, and then - shoulder.  Now you should process the hem, neck and sleeves.  This can be done both with the help of a <span>slanting inlay,</span> and by tucking the fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A-Line Dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="long sleeve pattern" class="if uuid-2238202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2238202.jpg"></div><p>  Such an outfit looks difficult only on a pattern.  Making the dress will be simple, and most importantly, the final result will pleasantly surprise you.  The dress is all-weather.  It can be worn on a cool summer day, and in a well-heated room in winter.  The trapezoid style is suitable for girls with wide shoulders and narrow hips.  The dress visually removes the difference between the upper and lower body.  Also, a trapeze is suitable for girls who want to look more feminine.  Indeed, in such an outfit, any woman seems like a pretty doll. </p><p>  <span>A-line dress pattern</span> is located above.  We print it out and customize it to the proportions of our body.  Now you need to decide on the fabric.  We cut out the details from the material and proceed to sewing.  First, grind the shoulder seams.  We sew a sleeve into the open armhole, and then connect the side parts of the dress.  It remains to <span>process the neck,</span> hem and sleeves. </p><h2>  Long dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress a-line pattern" class="if uuid-2237755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2237755.jpg"></div><p>  This strict outfit can look incredibly feminine if you know how to wear it.  Midi length is in fashion today, but many girls find it very dangerous.  And not in vain.  After all, if the dress is too voluminous, it will cut off the girl‚Äôs legs, and if too tight-fitting, it will turn its owner into a ‚Äúsausage‚Äù.  Ideal when the dress is a little fitted, but still quite loose and does not fit the silhouette.  To make the outfit more informal, you can sew pockets into the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's start manufacturing.  To sew such a dress, you need to take dense material, for example, jacquard or suit fabric.  We print out the pattern and cut out the details.  The first step is to sew the pockets and stitch them to the front shelf.  Now you should connect the two large parts of the product at the shoulder seams.  The next step is to put the sleeves in place and work on their edges.  And now you should make the side seams.  It remains to process the hem and neckline. </p><h2>  Straight dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern straight dress with sleeve 3 4 classic style" class="if uuid-2237758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2237758.jpg"></div><p>  This outfit is considered a classic.  Girls choose a straight dress as a win-win option when they do not know what to wear.  Why did such a style win the hearts of millions of women?  The fact is that a straight dress does not emphasize the figure, but it perfectly hides all the flaws.  The outfit does not constrain movement, which allows the girl to feel confident.  It is enough to supplement the direct dress with suitable decorations, and in it you can go both to a nightclub and to the philharmonic.  How to sew such a universal thing?  You should print the pattern of a straight dress with a 3/4 sleeve of a classic style and transfer it to the material.  And what fabric to give preference?  This does not play a big role.  Such a model will look good both in knitwear and in dense suit fabric.  The pattern of a straight dress with a 3/4 sleeve is quite simple, so that even a novice dressmaker will not have problems.  After all the details are cut from the fabric, you should proceed to the collection of the product.  First you need to sew the front and back shelves together, then you need to grind the sleeves and work on the edges of the product. </p><h2>  Dress with long sleeves </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a direct dress with a sleeve 3 4 full-size" class="if uuid-2237762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2237762.jpg"></div><p>  Such a model could be considered an office, if not for an interesting cut of the sleeve.  It is here, as it were, double, which cannot but attract the eye.  In addition, the dress is quite short, which hints that the outfit is more suitable for informal meetings than for office everyday life.  Such a dress can be sewn both from plain fabric and from something printed.  Moreover, it is desirable that the picture was small and chaotic.  In this case, he will not distract attention from the slim figure of the girl, because this style of dress advantageously emphasizes all the curves of the body. </p><p>  How to sew this outfit?  A dress with a long sleeve, the pattern of which is higher, is sewn from two parts.  We cut the front and back shelves, and then sew them together on the sides and along the shoulder seams.  It remains only to process the edges of the product. </p><h2>  Short dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a direct dress with a sleeve 3 4 full-size" class="if uuid-2237763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2237763.jpg"></div><p>  This outfit is very informal, light and summer.  The dress will look great on young girls.  Moreover, such an outfit can even be made beach, if you sew it from thin fabric.  The pattern of a straight dress with a 3/4 sleeve (it will not be difficult to translate it in full size) is presented above.  We transfer it to the fabric, cut out the details and begin to stitch them.  Tucks should be laid, then connect the front and rear shelves, sew in sleeves and work on the edges. </p>
