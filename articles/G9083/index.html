This primarily concerns <span>chemicals.</span>  All of them are obtained as a result of certain reactions, and the conditions for mass production are created in factories.  This includes potassium nitrate, which can be considered quite popular and widely used substance. </p><p>  It has many names - potassium <span>nitrate,</span> potassium <span>nitrate</span> , but it is more commonly known as <span>potassium nitrate.</span>  This is the technical name used in academia and various manufacturing fields. </p><p>  The main field of application of this substance is agriculture.  This is one of the best and most famous fertilizers that can only be found now.  Potassium nitrate is a dual complex fertilizer that can be used for various soils and cultivated crops.  Particularly often, saltpeter is used for growing crops that are highly sensitive to chlorine.  These include tobacco, flax, grapes and potatoes.  All these are quite popular and widespread agricultural crops. </p><p>  The composition of this substance: </p><ul><li>  N (Nitrogen) - 13% </li><li>  K (Potassium) - 46% </li></ul><p>  These are the two substances that make up potassium nitrate, the formula is KNO3. </p><p>  <strong>Application features</strong> </p><p>  Among common fertilizers such as potassium nitrate, application is usually not limited to strict rules.  And this is one of the main advantages.  However, some features still exist. </p><p>  Nitrate, first of all, should act on the root system.  Top dressing occurs with a frequency of 1 time in 10-15 days.  However, there is also a non-root method of application, in this case, leaves are sprayed with a special solution of 1.5-2%.  At the vegetation stage, it is recommended to carry out from 2 to 4 sprayings. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On small trees and shrubs it usually takes 1.5-3 liters of solution, and on an adult tree it can take up to 8 liters.  Vegetable and fruit plants, such as, for example, strawberries, require about 1-1.5 liters of solution for every 10 square meters.  meters. </p><p>  <strong>Effect of application</strong> </p><p>  Potassium nitrate <strong>is a</strong> nitrogen-potassium fertilizer that gives very effective results when feeding various plants and crops: vegetable, flower, fruit and decorative. </p><p>  Potassium nitrate is especially good at strengthening the root system and increasing its sucking power.  In fact, this chemical substance establishes all the basic functions of a plant: nutrition, respiration and photosynthesis.  All this as a whole leads to the strengthening and healing of the whole plant, the state of its tissues improves markedly.  The plant is able to better adapt to environmental conditions and can survive even relatively long periods of bad weather. </p><p>  Another effect that can be achieved is an increase in the content of potassium and nitrogen in the tissues of the plant.  These two elements directly affect the appearance of not only the plant, but also its fruits.  They turn out to be more attractive, cracking and other damage are reduced, and the yield becomes larger. </p><p>  This is especially true for crops such as potatoes and cabbage.  In this case, the appearance of the root crop is a very important parameter.  Usually, top dressing occurs during the earthing up of these plants.  In this case, a large amount of nitrogen must be avoided, and potassium nitrate has the necessary advantage over other popular fertilizers - nitrogen is contained 3.5 times less than potassium. </p><p>  All this makes the scope of nitrate very wide.  It has excellent properties, has no particular restrictions on use, is quite simple to use.  With the right approach, it can give very impressive results when growing various crops. </p>
