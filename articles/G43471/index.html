Since its foundation, they have been introducing residents and visitors to the artistic heritage of the whole world. </p><h2>  Treasure chest </h2><p>  It‚Äôs probably not fashionable to go to museums today (however, the queues during the ‚ÄúNight of the Arts‚Äù refute this statement).  And in vain!  In the halls, the legacy of the past and the masterpieces of masters from different parts of the world are not easily collected.  The museum funds are a huge source of inspiration in a variety of areas.  Excursions therefore may be of interest not only to students. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore (Saratov) - exhibitions </h2><p>  On the waterfront of the city is a beautiful building, an example of classicism architecture.  This is the first stronghold on the path to exploring the heritage of the past - the local history museum.

I., Tabakova O. P., Schnittke A. G. , Gokhman E.V. and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The exposition "Natural rarities" introduces visitors to rare representatives of flora and fauna.
