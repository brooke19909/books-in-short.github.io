  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android standard file manager: program overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Android operating system is in many ways good.  Here, and flexible functionality, and a lot of settings for themselves, and the ability to freely work with files and folders.  The standard Android file manager seems to cope with the tasks, but for most users, the standard set of functionality is not enough. </p><p>  On Google Play you can find a lot of programs of this kind that will not only be copied, deleted and created, but also sent by mail, archived and much more will be done.  Some Android file managers with root privileges will help to optimize the drive and bring the folders in order. </p><p>  Yes, there are many offers, but not everyone is useful and works as we would like.  Certain options can seriously harm the platform.  We will try to identify the best <span>file managers</span> for Android 2017 and the beginning of 2018, which were distinguished by a high-quality component, a good functional set and the effectiveness of our work.  When compiling the list of applications, user reviews on Google Play itself and on specialized forums were primarily taken into account. </p><h2>  ES file explorer </h2><p>  File Manager for Android <span>ES Explorer</span> is the most popular application in its segment.  And such enviable download performance from him is clearly not due to the "beautiful eye".  The utility is essentially considered a whole complex for working with the file system of a mobile gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theappsreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best file manager" class="if uuid-2300668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300668.jpg"></div><p>  The main advantages of the best file manager for Android are its free distribution license, rich feature set and sensible localization.  Moreover, the latter was not done anyhow, on the knee, as we see in most applications of such a plan, but by professionals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to regular operations on copying, creating, moving and deleting, there is the possibility of sorting and grouping media files, removing installed applications and cleaning the drive.  You can also view and analyze internal memory, work with archives and even edit photos. </p><h2>  Program features </h2><p>  Moreover, the file manager for Android in Russian ES Explorer can be synchronized with popular cloud storage services, such as Yandex Disk, Dropbox, Google Drive and others.  To work in this direction, data transfer via FTP protocols and a local network is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="worldtour-outdoorexperience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eu conductor" class="if uuid-2300669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300669.jpg"></div><p>  In general, ES File Explorer is an excellent tool for working with files and folders with extensive functionality and completely free.  It will also be useful to know about some of the nuances of the last item for the file manager on Android.  We write in the search bar, for example, "system", and on this request, in addition to the usual platform files, it displays a bunch of advertising windows that are completely not related to the indicated criteria.  And so in almost everything.  If the advertisement is very boring, then you can buy the Pro version, where it does not appear in any way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Total commander </h2><p>  This manager is very familiar to PC users with experience.  Total Commander, along with the similar Norton, are the pioneers of its segment.  His story began back in 1993, when they did not hear about multi-platform and never heard of.  A multifunctional and at the same time utterly simple utility worthily survived all computer crises and for several years now it has been a very good file manager for Android and PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spflashfiles1.rssing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="total commander" class="if uuid-2300664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300664.jpg"></div><p>  The program entirely copes with file management, is competently localized into Russian and is absolutely free.  Moreover, unlike the previous respondent, there is no hint of <span>aggressive advertising.</span>  That is why the utility has received a lot of positive reviews and enjoys enviable popularity among all categories of users. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the utility </h2><p>  One of the hallmarks of Total is its dual-panel interface.  For the Android platform, such a solution looks much more practical than the same windows as Windows.  The basic version of the file manager for Android is completely devoid of any frills.  Here, only everything you need to manage data.  Due to its ‚Äúcleanliness‚Äù, the utility minimizes the load on the system tray, so for owners of gadgets with modest characteristics this is the best option, unlike the previous, more demanding file manager for Android. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But this does not mean at all that Total is just a miserable shadow of ES File Explorer.  The program supports the installation of plugins and all kinds of add-ons.  On the official resource of the developer and in specialized forums, you can find hundreds of extensions for any direction.  It‚Äôs worth immediately warning that you don‚Äôt need to get involved in installing plugins, because with each new addition, the file manager for Android starts loading the system, which, of course, affects performance. </p><h2>  Amaze file manager </h2><p>  If you are an undemanding user and you have enough of the ordinary functionality of a full-time manager, but due to some circumstances you want to replace it, then Amaze is a great option.  The utility is extremely easy to use, has competent Russian localization and is completely free.  As such, there is no advertising here, and if something pops up, then it is completely harmless and unobtrusive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bouncegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="explorer for android" class="if uuid-2300667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300667.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main features of the manager is quick work.  Unlike other applications of this kind, which use buffering or some other tools to facilitate (but not speed up) usability, this program works as if directly, thereby reducing the time to perform standard tasks. </p><h2>  Software Features </h2><p>  In addition, there is an application manager that allows you to uninstall or install software, as well as support for themes.  There are a lot of the latter, so everyone can choose the best option for themselves. </p><p>  As for the reviews, users especially appreciated the simplicity, beauty and speed of the manager, putting five on these items in Google Play.  Some critical flaws are not mentioned, so the application can be recommended to everyone, and especially to owners of gadgets with a modest technical component.  Amaze, like Total, in its "pure" form minimizes the load on the system and does not lag. </p><h2>  Cabinet </h2><p>  Although the application is in beta testing, it has shown itself only on the positive side.  The manager downloads for free, and the interface is fully translated into Russian.  The menu branches are not at all confused, and the set of basic tools is intuitive and understandable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pdf.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best explorer for android" class="if uuid-2300666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300666.jpg"></div><p>  The utility supports in addition to its own plug-ins and amateur ones, which are contained in large numbers on forums dedicated to the aforementioned Total.  As in another case, you should not get carried away with installing additional "chips", otherwise your interface risks simply not budging due to friezes and lags. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the utility </h2><p>  By the way, the application is quite demanding on system characteristics, so it‚Äôs better for owners of budget gadgets to look at another option, therefore, even in a ‚Äúclean‚Äù form, the ‚ÄúCabinet‚Äù can jerk due to lack of RAM. </p><p>  In addition to the usual actions with files and folders, the manager easily copes with archiving and synchronization with popular cloud services.  Also, if desired, you can radically change the appearance of the application.  If you are not satisfied with the classic and really ascetic version, then you can choose from a few pre-installed nice themes.  The latter will give a little more load on the system, but without critical sagging, as is the case with plugins. </p><h2>  Solid explorer </h2><p>  This is a paid solution, but at the same time multifunctional and extremely effective.  Unlike previous applications, the local code is extremely competently optimized, therefore, even on weak gadgets, the manager does not slow down or lag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alternativeto.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solid explorer" class="if uuid-2300663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300663.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the usual actions with files for copying, deleting and creating, the utility can analyze any SD-drive, internal memory, as well as some system or ordinary folders.  It is possible to fully view the content, whether it be audio, video or photo, plus synchronization with popular cloud storage.  If necessary, you can connect to the reception using the common FTP and WebDav protocols. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the file manager works great with archives.  If budget counterparts by no means can always cope even with the popular ZIP and RAR formats, then there are no restrictions for Solid Explorer.  The manager is able to "digest" such exotic things as TAR, 7z and IPA. </p><p>  But even if the available functionality is not enough and you need some specific tools, then on the official resource of the developer you can find an impressive list of all kinds of add-ons, plug-ins and add-ons. </p><p>  You can try the utility without restrictions for only one week, and then you have to buy a license.  You can‚Äôt call the price affordable, but for those who need a multifunctional and efficient file manager to work, this is the best option. </p><h2>  FX File Explorer </h2><p>  This is the only application in our selection without Russian localization.  But you should pay attention to it if you need the most ascetic file manager.  The utility is in the last place in the tray for the consumption of system resources.  The user will not notice the difference in performance before and after installing the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.droidfull.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conductor fx" class="if uuid-2300665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2300665.jpg"></div><p>  The manager comes with a shareware license.  That is, part of the functionality works immediately and forever after installation, and some additional plug-ins and add-ons will have to be bought for money.  But the cost of the latter is simply ridiculous, so there is no question of the high cost of the utility. </p><p>  Among the paid add-ons, one can note a plug-in responsible for synchronization with cloud services and additional encryption of user data.  Everything else is more likely to relate to professional activities and the average user, in principle, to nothing. </p><p>  As for the interface, it is simple and straightforward.  Any beginner who has never seen file managers in his eyes will figure it out.  For those who are confused by the English language in the menu, there are special sections on amateur forums devoted to this category of software, where there are just a lot of crackers, and free of charge. </p>
