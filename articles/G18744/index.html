If you are too honest and noble, serious and suspicious of people who do not understand jokes, then you should not play the Munchkin card game, since you will not like it very much. </p><p>  But if you are a positive person with the same outgoing and unfriendly friends, then you should definitely play this insidious and interesting game.  Explore dungeons, fight monsters, get treasures, reach level 10 and become a winner in this game. </p><h2>  The rules of the board game "Munchkin" and user reviews </h2><p>  First you need to figure out what is included in it, and how to play this card game.  The box contains two decks of cards: a Treasure deck (73 cards) and a Doors deck (92 cards), as well as a game cube and rules.  First you need to mix both decks thoroughly.  The only negative, judging by the reviews of the Munchkin game, which you may notice, is that you need to find something to indicate the level of your character (buttons, trifle, chips, <span>dice).</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="boardgamegeek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board game &quot;Munchkin Deluxe.&quot; Picking game" class="if uuid-2283578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72900/2283578.jpg"></div><p>  From three to six people can take part in the game, only it is necessary in any way for you to decide who will start the game.  Then, four cards from the Treasure and Doors deck, which will be in hand, are dealt.  If a player wants to receive a bonus or advantages, which are described on the cards, for this you need to put them on the table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cards can be of the following types: </p><ul><li>  races (elf, dwarf, halfling, half-breed); </li><li>  class (cleric, wizard, thief, warrior); </li><li>  clothes with a value that is indicated on the card in the lower right corner and is measured in golds, while in the lower left corner there is a place where you can put this clothes on; </li><li>  curses played against you or other players. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldofmunchkin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board game &quot;Munchkin&quot;. Types of cards" class="if uuid-2283588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72900/2283588.jpg"></div><p>  Cards that are in the player‚Äôs hand are not active in the game.  At the end of each turn, a player can hold up to five cards. </p><h2>  Phases of the course of the game "Munchkin" </h2><p>  After the player has played the cards from his hand and laid out the cards of the class, race and put on his clothes, he proceeds to the first phase of the board card game.  In total, there are 3 phases in the game: knock the door out, look for trouble and clean the bounties from bounties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dicetowernews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Game progress phases" class="if uuid-2286249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72900/2286249.jpg"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúKick the door‚Äù </h2><p>  Your game adventure begins with knocking out doors - for this you need to take the top card ‚ÄúDoors‚Äù.  What can be hidden behind these cards?  Behind the door we can wait: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  curse cards that trigger instantly on your hero; </li><li>  monsters with whom you have to fight to get levels and treasures; </li><li>  other cards that can be played immediately or picked up. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldofmunchkin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board card game &quot;Munchkin&quot;" class="if uuid-2295257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2295257.jpg"></div><p>  When you open the top card of the Doors, you immediately need to put it on the table so that all players can see.  If this is a curse card, then it immediately affects your hero and is discarded face up.  Then the player goes to the second phase.  If this is a monster card, you will have to fight it.  To do this, you need strength, which consists of your level, cards on your hand with different bonuses and your hero's gear.  When in total all this gives you more strength than the strength of the monster itself, then you won and get treasures and level as a reward.  But if the monster is stronger than you, then you can ask your friends for help for a certain part of the treasures.  And then together you will defeat the monster. </p><p>  If you see that your friends defeat the monster, do not worry, you can use the cards directly from your hand during the battle at any time.  Both the monster and the hero, these cards can help in battle.  Such cards increase the strength and power of monsters and are used without gaining treasure or losing a level (or even several). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the reviews of the Munchkin card game, many fans of this table highlight the main feature, which is that participants are allowed to cheat and deceive others, unless, of course, friends notice. </p><p>  You will not be able to proceed to the next phase until the battle is completed.  If it was not possible to convince friends to help you, then there is nothing left but to quickly escape from the monster.  If you do not have any cards that give a bonus to flushing, then your fate will be decided by a dice.  Five or six drops out - it was possible to get away, less - the monster creates indecency with your hero to your taste (described on the map).  If it is said in indecency that you are dying, then your adventure friends will take away the property from you.  You will only have your class, race and level (unless, of course, you had them). </p><p>  If you got any other card, except for monsters and curses, then you can immediately use it or pick it up in your hands. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúWe are looking for trouble‚Äù and ‚Äúwe clean the ghosts‚Äù </h2><p>  In the event that you still did not meet the monster at the door, you can play it from your own hand and fight it according to the usual rules.  But only if you are sure that you can defeat him.  If there are no monsters in the hand, then it remains only to clean the hatchbacks.  To do this, you need to take a card from the deck of "Doors" in your hand, without showing your opponents.  And finally, you can move on to the next phase. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúFrom Bounty‚Äù </h2><p>  At the time the player completes his turn, he should have no more than five cards in his hands.  When the number exceeds this maximum, then you need to either play these cards, or give extra to another player with the lowest level. </p><p>  There are times when the status of the weakest have several players.  Then you need to divide the extra cards between them according to your personal preference.  But if your hero is the lowest level, just send the extra cards to the discard.  If you have less than five cards, then just pass the turn to the next player, but before that you can also discard cards in order to get a level by selling your treasures (the cost of the level is 1000 gold).  But there is an exception: the 10th level cannot be obtained for any value of your treasures. </p><p>  Everything, now you can pass the move to the next player. </p><p>  Before the next player moves to the first phase, he can agree with another player and exchange gear.  You can also discard a class card at any time in the game if it does not suit you or if you want to change your class. </p><p>  Now, after studying all the reviews and rules of the Munchkin game, you are definitely ready to go to the dungeon to wet monsters, grab all the treasures and have fun with your friends. </p><h2>  Munchkin Deluxe </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldofmunchkin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Board game &quot;Munchkin Deluxe&quot;" class="if uuid-2283568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72900/2283568.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of the Munchkin Deluxe game, we can conclude that this game has many positive aspects and surprises: </p><ol><li>  Firstly, a very colorful design. </li><li>  Secondly, a small playing field with cells from 1 to 10 has been added to the game, with the help of which it is convenient to monitor the level of your hero. </li><li>  Thirdly, small figures (in the form of munchkins) are enclosed for moving around the field. </li><li>  Lastly, six additional maps have been added to indicate the gender of your hero. </li></ol><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Munchkin Deluxe game, we can say that this is just an updated version of the previous game, which can be a wonderful gift for a board game lover, adding to his collection of desktops.
