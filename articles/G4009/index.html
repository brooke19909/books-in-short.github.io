    <p>  Transfer of funds is quick and takes about 3 hours.  Each transaction costs 0.8% of the amount.  This percentage is quite low, but the system has a drawback.  In Belarus, it is difficult to cash out funds received through WebMoney. </p><p>  Usually, Technobank services are used for this, since this bank transfers electronic funds in cash with a 3% deduction.  With the help of this institution, funds are transferred to cards of other banks with a commission of 3-3.5%, as well as to a bank account. </p><p>  Cashing is carried out thanks to: </p><ul><li>  box office Belgazprombank; </li><li>  to various exchangers. </li></ul><p>  But these options are rarely chosen, since the commission is about 5%.  Moreover, there are much more profitable and comfortable systems for sending transfers to different countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Banking systems </h2><p>  This is another option for making money transfers from Russia to Belarus.  To do this, find a banking organization whose branches are in both countries.  These include: </p><ul><li>  "Bank of Moscow". </li><li>  VTB. </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  Gazprombank. </li><li>  "Alfa Bank". </li></ul>

You can find many reviews about the convenience of the service through banks.  There are acceptable commissions and short delivery times. </p><h2>  Cash </h2><p>  As an example, take Sberbank.  A money transfer from Russia to Belarus takes 3-5 minutes, and the commission is 2%.  The operation is performed within 2 days.  To implement it, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Passport. </li><li>  Name of the recipient. </li><li>  Beneficiary account number. </li><li>  If there is no last, you need to know the SWIFT code of the branch where the transfer will be accepted and its number. </li></ol><p>  An operation on these conditions is advantageous when sending from 102 thousand rubles, since the rate is fixed.  You can transfer funds through the bank and not cash them.  Judging by the reviews, cash items are one of the most sought after. </p><h2>  Hummingbird </h2><p>  Sberbank makes Hummingbird money transfers from Russia to Belarus.  They are sent in rubles, dollars and euros.  The execution period is not more than an hour.  The transfer can be canceled, but for a fee of 150 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The recipient should pay 1%. </p><h2>  From card to card </h2><p>  Money transfers from Russia to Belarus from card to card are in demand.  Favorable conditions are offered by Alfa-Bank.  Payments are made online using the online service. </p><p>  The advantage of this method is that you only need to know the card number of the recipient.  The commission is 1.95% of the amount.  The disadvantage is the limited amount that can be sent 1 time per month: 75 and 500 thousand rubles.  As can be seen from the reviews, many use these services because of their reliability and convenience. </p><h2>  Postal transfers </h2><p>  It carries out money transfers to Belarus and the post office of Russia.  Judging by the reviews, the system is very convenient and safe.  But this method has a drawback - Belarus has a restriction on transfers, since the maximum on transfers from Russia should be no more than 90 thousand rubles. </p>
