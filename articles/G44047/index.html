  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political management</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The definition of management in the literature is interpreted as a process of managing human and <span>material resources.</span>  At the same time, the interests of the effective use of these resources to achieve the goals of regulating relations in social, economic, political and other structures are pursued.  In other words, management is a complex of influence on specific bodies (specific individuals) in the presence of special methods and tools to achieve goals. </p><p>  General principles that are present in business management are applied in different areas of life in accordance with their specifics.  So, for example, management is used in <span>political activities.</span>  Moreover, management concerns both subjects and objects of the sphere, and decision-making processes and assessing the consequences of their implementation. </p><p>  Political management is an entire management system.  It includes scientific and creative analysis of development directions, consequences, development of recommendations for management and ensuring their implementation in practice. </p><p>  <span>The concept of "political</span> management" allows us to consider the conceptual side of the functioning processes of the modern system of government.  In addition, the application of this concept makes it possible to make concrete attempts to improve process control.  Political management allows you to direct the movement of society towards a civilized political system, designing new types of governance.  At the same time, models are built on the principle of constructivism, professionalism, and competence with a focus on humanistic values. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Political management, being a <span>process management</span> system <span>, includes,</span> first of all, a marketing analysis of the properties of the political market.  Based on the analytical data, an image of the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù corresponding to reality is created, which is the party, leader, organization, etc. </p><p>  An integral component of such management is the political support of business activity.  As well as a study of sociocultural and political factors that influence this activity. </p><p>  Management in the sphere of power also presupposes mastery of the art of working with organizations and people, which is based on the aesthetic, moral, ethical standards of an existing society. </p><p>  Political management includes public relations as well as professional lobbying. </p><p>  Management in the field of state power is closely connected with the decision-making process.  <span>The political decision</span> during the creation goes through certain stages: </p><ol><li>  Analysis of the situation in which a decision is required. </li><li>  Development of a project, program. </li><li>  Approval and acceptance of the development result. </li><li>  The implementation of the solution. </li><li>  The study of real opportunities to enhance the positive effects of the implementation of the decision. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that the decision-making process to a large extent depends on the regime of power.  Totalitarian and authoritarian state management systems imply special principles.  They are characterized by closeness and authoritarian-bureaucratic technology.  In such conditions, decisions are made by a limited circle of people, without using a comprehensive analysis of various information.  At the same time, neither opposition nor public opinion is taken into account. </p><p>  As historical experience shows, such <span>management methods</span> can be very effective in emergency economic conditions: during acute crises, wars, during overcoming man-made, natural disasters.  However, with such methods dominating, political power is inevitably identified with coercion. </p>
