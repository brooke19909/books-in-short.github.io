    <h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  To begin with, I would like to note that Chrysalis Boutique Hotel is a small and comfortable hotel with a fund of 22 rooms.  It is designed for guests who value quality service and comfort, and are also interested in a peaceful and relaxing holiday. </p><p>  The hotel we are considering is located in the village of Astypalea, 50 meters from the beach and only two kilometers from the center of Hersonissos.  Location is good.  Astypalea National Airport is only 4 km away.  Kalymnos National Airport and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="25" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Hippocrates</span> Airport are also approximately the same distance from the hotel.  As to one, and to another to go about 70 kilometers. </p><p>  Although the hotel is located at a somewhat remote distance from the center of Hersonissos, which is the place of concentration of the main attractions, still there is where to walk and what to see.  Literally 700 meters from the hotel, for example, there is the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="26" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Guerini</span> Castle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  Chrysalis Boutique Hotel is located in a well-kept clean area surrounded by lush trees.  Near the pool there is a spacious sun terrace with sun loungers and parasols. </p><p>  High-speed Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel and private parking is available.  Everyone is provided with a free airport shuttle.  If this service is necessary for guests, then they need to inform the property in advance, specifying information about their flight and time of arrival. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">It is also</span> worth noting that Chrysalis Boutique Hotel 4 * has its own library, tour desk, ticket office, luggage storage, laundry room (where they not only wash, but also iron + clean shoes), an office with fax and photocopying, rental cars.  Babysitting / babysitting services can be provided.

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  It is worth <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="17" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">focusing on</span> .  At the Chrysalis Hotel (Greece, Crete, Hersonissos), the administration and staff do everything to make guests comfortable.  There are both places for smoking and rooms for people who are not addicted to tobacco.  All apartments are isolated.  There are bridal suites and family rooms.  Daily and high-quality cleaning, maids change linen and towels regularly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="3" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">It is also</span> worth noting the attention of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">multilingual</span> staff.  The hotel has staff who speak Greek, English, Spanish, French and Italian. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Chrysalis Boutique Hotel, like any other self-respecting hotel, has a restaurant serving excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><p>  The hotel has two food systems.  The first is all-inclusive, the second is breakfast and dinner.  People relaxing in the hotel recommend the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="8" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">second</span> option.  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù does not justify itself - lunch is not much different from dinner, and the advantages of the system are only the ability to order unlimited alcohol and cocktails at the bar. </p><p>  The diet is not bad.  From drinks - several types of juice, cocoa, tea, coffee, milk.  From food - cereals, sandwiches, toasts, sausages and cheese slices, muffins, cakes, a huge selection of fresh vegetables.  For dinner - divinely cooked meat, all kinds of side dishes (mashed potatoes, rice, cereals, stews), fries, soups.  There is a variety, nobody will remain hungry.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">Moreover,</span> in a 20-minute walk from the hotel there are many taverns and restaurants with a large selection of dishes and modest prices.  The vast majority of guests go there and go for lunch / dinner. </p>

    <h2>  Deluxe Apartment </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to the consideration of rooms available in the fund Chrysalis Boutique Hotel 4 * (Greece, Crete).  The most budgetary are deluxe apartments of 29 <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">square meters.</span>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">m</span> with one large <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">king size bed</span> , individual <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">climate system</span> and minibar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All rooms in this category have a balcony with sea views, a wide-screen TV, a safe, a work area, Wi-Fi, a small dressing room, an electric kettle and a coffee machine.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">There</span> is <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="4" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">also</span> a bathroom with toilet, bath, shower and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">all necessary hygiene items</span> .

Their first difference from <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="29" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling" data-group="agnonym-">deluxe</span> is the area, which is 41 <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">square meters.</span>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">m</span>  The second is the presence of a terrace, not a balcony.

    <h2>  Booking and hotel policies </h2><p>  A few words should also be said about this.  Since the ratio of quality and price at Chrysalis Hotel 4 * is justified, the hotel is popular.  Many tourists are interested in spending their holidays in this cozy and comfortable hotel.  And since there are not many rooms in it, the reservation goes forward months.

So swim comfortably in any weather. </p><p>  By the way, the water temperature here even in the winter months is approximately +17 degrees.  Therefore, in Hersonissos tourists are even in winter.  But still conditionally ‚Äúcold‚Äù months are not seasonal.  Therefore, prices in hotels (Chrysalis Boutique in <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="22" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">this</span> regard is no exception) are reduced.  This should be considered if you want to save on accommodation. </p><p>  The beaches here are small, but they are rarely clogged - only at rush hour (from about 12:00 to 15:00) and in high season.  People who have been here recommend going to the sea either early in the morning or in the evening.  At this time of day the water is clean and the beaches are free.  And during the day you can swim in the hotel pool.  It is quite large and long, its maximum depth is about <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkGrammar">2.7 meters</span> .  The minimum is about 1.3 <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">m</span> .  There is no children's section. </p><p>  By the way, there is not much entertainment for kids here.  Only a water park located near the hotel.  Therefore, with very young children who constantly want to have fun, they should not go here - they will be bored. </p>

    <h2>  Who is this hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  Well, attention was paid to all the nuances regarding the Chrysalis Boutique Hotel in Greece - prices, reviews of tourists, a description of the hotel itself and the services provided in it.  Finally, a few words about who this hotel will definitely like. </p><p>  According to reviews, the Chrysalis Boutique Hotel should go to people who do not have the habit of focusing on a wide range of services and ways to diversify leisure.  It must be remembered that <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="24" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">this is a boutique hotel</span> , as the name itself clearly indicates.  A feature of all hotels belonging to this type is their unique stylistic design and a bias towards increased comfort of rooms. </p><p>  Chrysalis Hotel is <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="6" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">not a resort</span> complex with five restaurants on site and its own casino, and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="23" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">this</span> fact should be taken into account when going on vacation. </p><p>  And here you should not go to people who want to have fun all day in entertainment establishments.  All of them are concentrated in Hersonissos, which is located albeit at a small but still distance from the hotel. </p><p>  But people who are looking for a cozy hotel for a relaxing, mostly beach holiday, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">will</span> definitely <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">like it</span> here.  This is confirmed by numerous reviews. </p>
