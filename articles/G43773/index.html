At the time in question, the finalization of the social structure of society took place in our country thanks to the policy of the government and the adoption of a number of resolutions, in particular, the famous Council Code, which essentially fixed the established traditional hierarchy of social layers. </p><h2>  Boyars </h2><p>  Estate in Russia in the 17th century was often called the "rank", but it did not mean so much membership in a particular service, but inclusion in a particular social corporation.  At this time, in our country the bureaucratic apparatus of power finally took shape, first of all the <span>Boyar Duma,</span> Zemsky cathedrals and orders.  The right to serve in these representative bodies was enjoyed by the privileged estate in Russia in the 17th century.  The latter category included secular and spiritual feudal lords. </p>

    <p>  The top of society was considered the boyars.  It included several groups: representatives of the lateral branches of the Rurikovich dynasty, who transferred to the service of the Tartar, Horde princes, as well as nobles from Moldavia and Wallachia, the old Moscow nobility, as well as close unit princes, rulers of principalities, who at different times were attached to Moscow.  In the 17th century, this privileged estate in Russia possessed the right to own the patrimony - hereditary land ownership, inherited and the right to own serfs.  The boyars occupied a special place in the Duma under the prince and tsar.  It was they who made up the main management elite in the administration.  Of great importance were the roundabouts - people who accompanied the ruler on the road, received ambassadors from foreign countries, and also commanded regiments, held the posts of governor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Privileged classes </td><td>  Dependent Estate </td></tr><tr><td>  Boyars (okolnichii, "children of the boyars") </td><td>  <span>Peasants (black-</span> haired <span>,</span> landlord, palace) </td></tr><tr><td>  Nobility (solicitors, city nobles, stewards) </td><td>  Posad people (residents of black and white settlements) </td></tr><tr><td>  Clergy (monks, priests) </td><td>  Merchants (guests, ordinary traders) </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Nobles and servants </h2><p>  The next step was occupied by the nobility.  It was also divided into categories.  The Moscow nobles enjoyed special honor: solicitors, captains.  In second place were the city nobles - the provincial nobility.  These people, like the boyars, had the right to own land allotment and serfs, however, unlike the first, this property passed by inheritance only if the son continued to serve after his father. </p>

    <p>  The main estates of Russia in the 17th century took shape precisely in this century, when the social structure that had formed in the previous time received legislative registration.  Another important category was military people.  They were divided into several categories: archers, gunners, blacksmiths and Cossacks.  They were considered a dependent category of the population. </p><h2>  City dwellers </h2><p>  This group was also very dependent on the state.  The fact is that she was the main supplier of taxes to the royal treasury, and therefore the government was especially interested in attaching these people to their permanent place of residence.  Posad people were imposed a so-called tax, tribute, and in the case of the escape or departure of a posad person, his share fell on the rest.  Therefore, the government attached the population to a permanent residence.  However, many found a way out that they began to switch to <span>white settlements,</span> which were exempted from taxes, laying down for their owners and owners, while losing personal freedom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristics of the 17th century estates in Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1281901.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Peasants </h2><p>  The characteristics of the 17th-century estates in Russia include an analysis of the situation of the bulk of the country's population.  We are talking about peasants, who were also not a homogeneous mass.  They were divided into black-nosed (who belonged to the state or were personally free), landowners, who were personally owned by landowners, palaces, which belonged to the royal family.  They carried all sorts of duties, primarily corv√©e (subsistence mining) and quitrents (cash or in-kind contribution in favor of the landowner).  <span>The Council Code</span> introduced an indefinite search for fugitive peasants, which finally cemented the existence of <span>serfdom</span> in Russia. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main estates of Russia in the 17th century" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282001.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Merchants </h2><p>  The 17th century estates in Russia, the table of which is presented in this article, show how much differentiation Russian society has reached.  Merchants belonged to a separate group.  Among them stood out the most distinguished and wealthy guests who held prominent posts in financial management and had the right to own estates and were exempted from taxes.  Members of the living room and cloth hundreds also belonged to the privileged part of the merchants.  They had the right to self-government and their internal affairs were in charge of elected heads and foremen.  The rest of the merchants paid the state customs duties. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme of estates of Russia in the 17th century" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1282029.jpg" width="525"></div></h2><h2>  Clergy </h2><p>  The scheme of Russian estates in the 17th century shows the place of each social group in the hierarchy.  The clergy was divided into two parts: black and white.  The first category included monks.  Monasteries also owned land with ascribed peasants.  Parish priests had a family, property, they were in charge of education.  So, based on the foregoing, we can conclude that in Russia in the 17th century the hierarchical <span>feudal society</span> finally took shape <span>.</span> </p>
