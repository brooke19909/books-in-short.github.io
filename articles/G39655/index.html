In this case, a minimum of documents is required, and the process takes a little time. </p><h2>  Online Credit </h2><p>  The main feature of a consumer loan is that it is not issued for any specific purpose.  It can be taken without explanation to the bank and spent on any of your personal needs.  Significantly simplifies the procedure available on the websites of banks such an option as " <noindex>  <span>online loan application</span> </noindex>  ".  In order to get a loan on the Internet you need: </p><ul><li>  preliminarily examine all available offers; </li><li>  choose the most appropriate option; </li><li>  fill out an application on the bank's website by filling out a specific form; </li><li>  wait for approval by phone. </li></ul><p>  And then - either the bank sends a registered letter by mail or courier, or agrees with the borrower to receive money from the bank.  The whole procedure is extremely simplified and does not take much time. </p><h2>  Receiving at the Bank </h2><p>  Such a receipt implies a direct appeal to the applicant's bank.  The following steps need to be taken: </p><p>  go around all the banks you like and study the terms of the loan and the necessary documents for collection; </p><ul><li>  choose the right bank with the best deals; </li><li>  to collect the necessary package of documents; </li><li>  leave a request with the collected documents in the bank; </li><li>  wait for approval of the application after verification. </li></ul><p>  Then the bank will call and report a positive decision and agree on the date and time of the meeting.  It remains only to get <noindex>  <span>consumer credit</span> </noindex>  and enjoy the money provided. </p><h2>  Loan agreement </h2><p>  Before obtaining a loan, you need to carefully study the conditions for providing money.  If something is not clear, you need to ask for a consultation of a banking specialist with detailed explanations.  After this, you should critically evaluate your financial capabilities and, if all the criteria are satisfactory, sign an agreement. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  To take money we borrow directly from the bank and via the Internet: </p><ul><li>  passport and any other identification document; </li><li>  certificate of own income; </li><li>  copy of personal work book. </li></ul><p>  To obtain a loan when buying in a store, you only need a passport and an additional identification document.  There are banks that ask for all of the above: a copy of the military ID (for men), a copy of the marriage certificate, a copy of the title deed. </p><h2>  Loan repayment </h2><p>  The loan is paid in two ways: </p><ol><li>  Annuity payment.  To do this, each month the borrower must pay off the same amount, which includes both the payment of the main (body) debt and the interest on the loan and service.  This is the most common method, it is undoubtedly very convenient. </li><li>  Differentiated payment.  With this method, the largest amount is repaid in the first month, and then payments are reduced. </li></ol><p>  All debts should ever be paid.  This also applies to bank loans.  After all, in case of non-payment, the bank will surely sue the debtor and collect its debts by force.  So when taking a loan you need not to rush, but to think carefully about your creditworthiness. </p></div></article>
