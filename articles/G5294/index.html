Such a decision cannot be called deliberate, although the desire to save is understandable.  There is another, legal way to reduce the cost of the policy - accident-free riding.  In this case, the driver class is assigned.  How to determine and use it correctly, read on. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Today, such a thing as a “driver class” is most often used by “seasoned specialists” who worked back in the Soviet Union.  Then graduation began.  Each driver sought to obtain the rights of the 1st category.  For this, the State Committee for Labor introduced a salary bonus.  The enterprise was also proud of the leading workers.  Today, such a mandatory graduation is no longer.  But if the director introduced it at the enterprise, then he can’t cancel it.  This is spelled out in paragraph 3.8 of the "Federal Agreement on Road and Land Transport". </p>

    <h2>  Grouping </h2><p>  How to determine the driver class according to the old scheme?  There were only three of them and they were ranked from larger to smaller.  The basis for the division was the number of open categories in rights: </p><ul><li>  “A” - motor transport; </li><li>  “B” - a car; </li><li>  “C” - freight vehicles; </li><li>  “D” - a bus; </li><li>  "CE" - heavy transport with a trailer. </li></ul><p>  How to determine the driver class? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  3rd grade </h2><p>  This group included drivers whose categories “B” and “C” were open.  There was another gradation.  Instead of “C”, “D” could be opened. </p><h2>  2nd grade </h2><p>  The presence of category “B” rights is not required for this group.  In this case, it was necessary to have permission to drive a bus ("D") and heavy vehicles with a trailer ("CE").  Allowable conditions: “B + C + CE” or “B + C + D” or “D + CE”.  Rights of this category were issued after three years of continuous driving. </p>

    <h2>  1 class </h2><p>  Advanced workers included people with all categories open.  Although it was noted that the presence of a permit to drive motor vehicles is not necessary.  As in the previous case, the rights of the first category were issued after two years of continuous truck driving. </p><h2>  Changes </h2><p>  Such a gradation has been used before.  How to determine the driver class today?  The process became more complicated as new categories appeared in the document: </p><ul><li>  "BE" - a car with a trailer; </li><li>  "CE" - a truck with a trailer; </li><li>  "DE" - a bus with a trailer. </li></ul><p>  For rights of the first category, opening “BE” and “DE” is optional. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Classification for CTP </h2><p>  "Auto Citizen" includes a specific list of classes.  There are only 13 of them.  There is a minimum class among authorized drivers.  How to identify it?  If the driver does not have a history of insurance as such, then by default it is assigned the value “1”.  This means that when calculating the cost of the policy, all factors except the driving history were taken into account.  With a decrease in the number of calls to the company for payments for the year, the driver's class is constantly increasing. </p>

    <p>  In parallel, the KBM indicator is calculated.  With it, you can reduce annual contributions by 5%.  A person who is assigned the highest category “13” can get a 50% discount when paying for the policy.  Getting into an accident causes an increase in the price of the policy and a decrease in class. </p><p>  Drivers who have been assigned the lowest class (M) purchase a policy with a 45% premium on a flat rate.  This situation occurs if a person has applied for payments to the company more than four times a year. </p><h2>  Policy cost </h2><p>  In calculating the cost of the policy, the driver class is crucial.  How to determine it will be discussed in detail below.  The essence of the calculations is as follows: the higher the class, the lower the price.  The cost of the policy is determined on the basis of four factors.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Vehicle type </h2><p>  Tariffs are prescribed separately for buses, trucks and cars.  Separately, there is a division by make and model of vehicles based on the statistics of their accident.  Coefficients by region are based on incident data in all cities.  Novice drivers are assigned the highest ratio, and experienced drivers are assigned the lowest. </p><h2>  Driving history </h2><p>  Based on this indicator, the value of the MSC is calculated.  As mentioned earlier, the coefficient "bonus-malus" affects the cost of the policy. </p><h2>  Driver class </h2><p>  On which site can I determine the class of the MTPL driver?  PCA.  Here is a special form for calculation.  It is necessary to enter personal data (full name, date of birth) and identification number.  In response to the request, all information will appear on the driver, that is, his insurance history.  This information is used not only by consumers of services, but also by insurers.  The story of a particular person can be found even if he changed his name.  A similar database is available in each insurance company. </p><p>  When signing a contract with a client, all companies must enter his data into the PCA database.  It doesn’t matter if this person used to be a client of the company or not.  The insurance history is formed according to data from all insurers.  This is spelled out in Art.  9 Federal Law No. 40 "On CTP". </p>

    <p>  How to determine the driver class for insurance through the site?  If a person first applies for a policy, then first all the information is entered on the insurers website.  If subsequently he applies for payment, then the information is adjusted.  Data on the nature of damage, the amount of payment are recorded.  Even if after a while a person turns to another company, all information about him is stored.  The new insurer will check the entire history in the PCA database.  Here's how to determine the driver class for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance according to SAR. </p><h2>  Checks </h2><p>  Any driver can also check information about themselves on the insurer's website.  You need to do this annually when buying a policy.  When calculating the cost of the policy, it is impossible to exclude the human error factor.  The agreement spells out the sequence of settlements.  If discrepancies are found, then you should contact the company to obtain a decryption.  Usually this situation occurs when changing insurers.  If they refuse to carry out detailed calculations, you will have to contact the prosecutor. </p><h2>  Statement of claim </h2><p>  To appeal the cost of the policy, you must provide a statement stating: </p><ul><li>  the essence of the claim is the transfer of violated rights; </li><li>  a detailed description of the circumstances; </li><li>  a request to take action with respect to the insurer and institute proceedings against officials; </li><li>  personal data. </li></ul><p>  Documents are considered within a month.  Usually, after such a procedure, the company will carry out all the calculations. </p>

    <h2>  KBM </h2><p>  Previously, KBM was calculated separately for each vehicle and zeroed in case of its sale.  Accordingly, the discount on the purchase of the policy was reduced.  The person who bought the new car had to collect points again and once again upgrade the class.  Since 2016, the calculation methodology has changed.  The coefficient is assigned to the person himself, and not to the car. </p><p>  You can also learn KBM, how to determine the driver's safety class.  Option one - view information on the PCA website.

It is necessary to find in the table the value of the category that was assigned to the driver at the beginning of the year, and compare it with the number of requests for payments.  An experienced driver is assigned the highest class “13” and he receives a 50% discount (KBM = 0.5) for the purchase of the policy.  How to determine the driver class at the beginning of the year?  It is equal to the number of years of driving experience. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  The insurance company assigned the driver a “5” class of accident-free driving and sold the policy at a 10% discount (CBM 0.9).  If during the year, while the policy is valid, the driver will apply for payment, then the next time he will be assigned class “3”.  If there are no calls to the company during the reporting period, then a “6” class with KBM 0.85 will be assigned.  That is, he will be able to buy a policy with a 15% discount. </p><h2>  KBM subspecies </h2><p>  Insurers divide this ratio into three types: </p><ul><li>  Driving - determined for each driver at the time of insurance; </li><li>  vehicle owner; </li><li>  Estimated is used in costing. </li></ul><p>  There is also a maximum and minimum indicator value.  The first one provides a discount on the purchase of the policy.  With a minimum value, the policy is sold for 100% of its value.  With a further decrease, the cost of the policy increases. </p>

    <h2>  Application </h2><p>  Compulsory and unlimited <span>OSAGO coefficient</span> is applied in different ways.  The first category includes contracts under which the number of persons allowed to drive a car is limited.  Accordingly, no limits are set in the policies of the second category. </p><p>  The coefficient is determined for each driver separately.  The calculation uses the indicator taking into account information for all drivers.  Let’s say the driver kept the driving class for the current year.  The discount will not be given to the owner, but to the specific driver.  If the owner of a car changes over a year, KBM will not be recounted.  An increase in the value of MSC for next year will be carried out in relation to those who became the culprits of the accident. </p><h2>  Cost calculation </h2><p>  Calculation is carried out according to such an algorithm.  Upon first receipt of the policy, the driver is assigned a third class.  If during the year there were no accidents involving him, then next year the class will be increased.  If there was one request for payment, the category will remain the same.  If there were two or more calls, the class is reduced to "M".  With each increase in the category decreases the class of KBM.  Accordingly, the discount is growing.  For example, when switching to class “4”, the driver is assigned a 0.95 KBM, which means the right to receive a 5% discount. </p><h2>  Factors </h2><p>  The KBM is directly dependent on a trouble-free ride.  Assignment of the coefficient is carried out according to the policy of compulsory motor liability insurance, the validity of which ended a year ago.  Existing contracts are not taken into account.  That is, if it is not possible to calculate the driver’s KBM, it is assigned the class “1” by default. </p><p>  The driver’s experience also matters.  The owner of the vehicle and persons authorized to drive will be considered separately.  The class is recounted at the time when it is necessary to make payments for accidents in which the driver is guilty.  At the same time, the <span>insurance premium</span> is reduced <span>.</span>  The discount on the purchase of the policy is maintained even if the client has changed the insurance company. </p>

    <h2>  Reflection of information in the policy </h2><p>  According to the law, it is not required to enter the driver’s and owner’s KBM data into the policy.  But the insurer can do this on the basis of an internal order of management.  Typically, such information is written in front of the full name.  the owner of the car and each authorized driver.  Sometimes an entry is made in the column “Special Marks”. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>MTPL insurance is</span> thought out with a reward system for experienced and tidy drivers.  With great experience and proper driving, the client receives a 50% discount on the purchase of the policy.  When making calculations, drivers are divided into certain categories.  How to determine the minimum driver class?  Given the number of claims for payments and driving history, you can view the corresponding indicator on the PCA website or in a special table. </p>
