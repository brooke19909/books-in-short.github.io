This is one of the four hotels that are part of the Ambassador City tourist complex.  On a vast territory of more than 160 thousand square meters.  There are 5 buildings, 8 restaurants, 4 swimming pools, several bars and night clubs, as well as a fitness center. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline and has its own beach.  Ambassador Ocean is located off the coast of Jomtien.  The distance from Bangkok Airport to the hotel is 130 km, to the city center - 12 km. </p><p>  The advantage of this hotel is its remoteness from the city, there is neither a large number of people, nor dust and smog, as in Pattaya itself.  It is perfect for relaxing with children or a romantic trip. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel </h2><p>  "Ambassador Ocean" reviews in 2016 are called a cozy, great option for accommodation.  It is an 18-story building.  It was built almost 30 years ago, but thanks to major repairs in 2013, it is not inferior in comfort and equipment to new hotels.  There are more than 900 rooms of different configurations in the building: standard with one or two beds, family rooms with two rooms and one corridor and superior rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  8 elevators provide fast delivery of all guests to their destination.  The hotel windows face both the street and the territory. </p><p>  "Ambassador Ocean" is located on the first coastline, a few meters from the sea. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  All visitors to the hotel note that the staff does not speak Russian well.  I had to explain using gestures or in another language.  Only at the reception there is always an administrator who understands Russian-speaking tourists, ready to help as soon as possible. </p><p>  Housekeeping is provided daily.  If you leave a little tip to the maid, then upon arrival in your room you will find not only a clean room, but also amazing creations from towels or bedspreads on the bed. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Tips </h2><ul><li>  All rooms have a remote control near the bed.  It regulates the lighting in the room and the operation of the air conditioner.  You can set an alarm on it. </li><li>  On the balcony there is a small metal clothes dryer.  When you decide to use it, do not forget about clothespins, otherwise your clothes run the risk of being on the balconies of other rooms. </li><li>  The hotel is non-smoking, smoke sensors are installed.  You can smoke on the balcony, using an ashtray for this, which you need to purchase yourself. </li><li>  Every day, 2 bottles of clean water per person are brought to the room.  It is free, but it is not recommended to take it out of the room, as this is returnable packaging, and if the maid does not find the bottle, they will charge you a fine. </li><li>  You cannot drink tap water at the hotel!  Also, be careful when swimming in the pool or the sea, try to prevent water from entering the stomach.  Watch carefully for children who accidentally swallow part of the water when bathing.  Sewage treatment facilities in Thailand do not work at full strength, even native Thais do not drink such water.  Therefore, always have activated eel in the medicine cabinet, as an ambulance leaves for the vacationers only for a very serious case. </li><li>  If you store food in your room, you need to do this in the refrigerator, otherwise it will be eaten by ants, which are present in almost all hotels in Thailand. </li><li>  Want to exchange currency?  Go to the exchanger or ATM.  At the reception, the exchange rate is always disadvantageous for tourists. </li><li>  Decided to go on excursions?  Do not take tours from official representatives at the hotel.  Opposite the main entrance there are a large number of local companies that will provide you with the same excursions for little money.  And, as tourists assure, the quality of service at such companies is much better than that of official companies. </li><li>  The city center can be reached by white tuk-tuk.  Its cost is about 20 baht. </li><li>  If you decide to stay late in the city until late, it is worth remembering that after 10 p.m. tuk-tuks become taxis and their prices take off several times. </li></ul>
