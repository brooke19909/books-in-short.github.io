    <p>  History has the property of repeating itself after some time.  Globally, you can specify more than a dozen situations that have not yet been confirmed in these words, but the case with 8800 perfectly demonstrates that this thesis has the right to exist and use.  The fact is that the 8800 Nokia Arte project, developed by employees of the Finnish company, was copied from the 8810 sample. Even with the first comparative look at these two models, a certain similarity of the devices becomes apparent.  In general, when creating the ‚Äú8800 Nokia Arte‚Äù product, developers and engineers laid down the basic principles in a unique foundation of the phone. </p><h2>  What did the model inherit? </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the very beginning, this mobile phone was positioned by developers as a direct descendant of the device under the name 8810. It is interesting that they did not hide it at all.  On the contrary, they even emphasized.  Nevertheless, there were some differences between the two devices, which, however, is obvious.  Otherwise, there would be no sense in this, would it?  Thus, the designers announced their decision to create an apparatus with a body made of metal, and present the form factor of the model as a slider.  For the premium segment at that time, this form factor was the most advantageous among all the others.  On the other hand, we can talk about the differences between the models indirectly, emphasizing not full originality, namely the application of the principle of modernization, adjusted for current trends. </p><h2>  Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte: market promotion </h2>

    <p>  I would like to listen to the opinions of users regarding the issue of what became the main topic during the promotion of the device.  Most have long ago decided to erase the slogan ‚ÄúSixth Sense‚Äù from their memory, to write it off as irrelevant.  Note that the presentation of the model took place in the capital of the Russian Federation, Moscow.  Then the venue was the gallery of Harry Tatintsian, and it was decided in advance to divide it into six specific territorial zones, which were subsequently called zones of feelings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What did it look like? </h2>

    <p>  At first glance, this approach may seem strange and even, no matter how rude, delusional.  But such is only the first impression of a person who simply did not understand the intricacies and connections of the phone as a whole and its presentation.  More specifically, music was playing in one of the areas of the room, and guests could enjoy drinks in the second.  Accordingly, according to this principle, the list consisting of six items continued.  But in the sixth zone we were expected by the device, which received the name 8800 Nokia Arte. </p><h2>  Labor of engineers </h2><p>  Yes, such a move before the presentation allowed the Finnish company to increase its credibility in the eyes of the public.  And what did the developers themselves do before this event was organized and the phone appeared before the public in all its glory?  Especially in order to present the device in a favorable light for both the buyer and the company, the engineers worked on creating a truly unique set of custom tunes. </p><h2>  Mobile Phone Specifications </h2><p>  The Nokia 8800 Sapphire Arte operates in the 900, 1800 and 1900 bands of the GSM standard.  The official release date for the phone is the second quarter of 2005.  The ‚ÄúSeries 40‚Äù version 2.0 is installed as the platform.  If we talk about the dimensions of the device, they are 107 in length, 45 in width, and 16.5 mm in height.  In this case, the mass of the phone is 137 grams.  A lithium-ion battery with a capacity of six hundred milliamps per hour is built-in as a source of battery life.  Thanks to this charge, the device can work in standby mode up to 192 hours. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  Nokia 8800 Carbon Arte is presented in the slider form factor, as mentioned earlier.  The screen is coated with a special coating that protects it from scratches.  In the manufacture of the case, metal was mainly used (this is the so-called stainless steel).  If we talk about the color representation, then steel (also called silver), as well as black, are available.  An antenna is built into the housing. </p><h2>  Display and performance </h2><p>  Most smartphones are mostly available with an IPS standard matrix.  But in the case of a phone like 8800, you don‚Äôt even expect anything more than TFT.  To store user data, the owner of the device is provided with a little less than fifty megabytes.  The transmission of packet data is carried out due to the standard VAP version 2.0.  The resolution of the built-in camera is 0.5 megapixels, digital zoom increases the subject up to eight times.  As we can see, the characteristics will please the average user, but lovers of something more powerful and of high quality will have to turn their eyes to other models. </p>
