    <p>  The Russian police armed themselves to the teeth - everywhere on the road there are various radars: "Golden Eagle", "Vizir", "Falcon", and the most treacherous - "Strelka".  Its peculiarity is that it analyzes the traffic situation at once on all the lanes and transfers all data about the speed drivers to the traffic police database through a special program.  That is why, when choosing, you need to focus on the fact that your radar detector effectively copes with signal recognition.  Which is better?  Prices in this case do not always play a decisive role, since the main thing nevertheless is the functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  4 selection rules </h2>

    <p>  Just note that most radars differ only in hardware and software.  And these differences ultimately affect the number of false positives and the possibility of receiving a signal at a certain distance.  And additional functions, of course, greatly facilitate the life of the driver behind the wheel.  So, to know which good radar detector to choose, consider the following rules. </p><ol><li>  Frequency check.  It is important for Russian drivers to capture the signal at frequencies of X and K, this, as well as equipping a laser receiver, is quite enough.  In our country there are only three radio bands, so we do not need additional frequencies. </li><li>  What is the signal reception range?  This indicator is able to talk about how far from the police radar your device will be able to recognize it.  Experts advise choosing models equipped with a GPS module, which confidently takes a signal, including Strelka.  According to reviews, among advanced models Neoline radars are attractive in their functions and capabilities, capable of accurately recognizing Strelka. </li><li>  Immunity to interference.  This parameter should be taken into account when choosing radar detectors.  Which is better?  User reviews come down to the fact that cheap models respond to any interference, including phones or radiators.  It is best to take those devices that can distribute the power of the received signal, and therefore are resistant to interference. </li><li>  Functionality  Many strive to buy a multifunctional device that can do a lot for little money.  But experts, and numerous customer reviews, say the opposite: the simpler the device, the more reliable it will work.  So when deciding for yourself which good radar detector, and which is not very good, pay attention not to unnecessary functions, but to important elements: the ability to switch the city / highway modes, the convenience of fastening, an intuitive display, and a compact body. </li></ol><p>  All these requirements are met by many modern models of radar detectors.  Consider the most popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Street Storm STR-9750EX </h2><p>  <span>This radar is</span> chosen by many users.  In the reviews it is noted that the device is clearly in the lead against analogues due to the greater detection distance, the ability to update firmware and the presence of police radars in the database, and the database is constantly updated.  Of the minuses, insufficient display brightness is noted.  This brand produces more and more advanced radar detectors every year.  Which is better?  User reviews suggest that the Street Storm STR-9750EX model attracts attention with its compact body, ESP platform, GPS modules and a convenient interface. </p>

    <p>  The device was subjected to many tests and in each of them showed its best side.  The combination of a high range of alerts with convenient user properties suggests that the device is very reliable.  The popularity of the model is explained by the presence of a special application Street Storm GeoSpot, thanks to which you can quickly and conveniently update the base of police cameras. </p><h2>  Sho-Me G900 STR </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which dvr with radar detector which is better" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1144455.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  What <span>good radar detector</span> to choose in the price range up to 10,000 rubles?  The Sho-Me G900 STR got a lot of good reviews.  Among the advantages of this model, drivers note the richness of the configuration, open access to firmware, compact size, but there is also a minus - a small warning distance.  The second drawback is the weak attachment: the suction cup radar is very weak.  But this model can be bought at an affordable price, and in terms of its operational properties, it is not inferior to expensive analogues.  The uniqueness of the device is in the ability to update simply using the USB bootloader. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Karkam Stealth 3+ </h2><p>  If you are interested in which good radar detector to choose among budget models, then you may like Karkam Stealth 3+.  According to reviews, the device is attractive at an affordable price and resistance to interference.  It confidently copes with the notification of police cameras.  For everyday use, the model is just perfect. </p><h2>  Prestige 562 GPS </h2><p>  This radar detector attracts attention with an affordable price, informative display.  But, as users note, the noise immunity of the device is not the highest, and sound signals are sometimes difficult to catch in the car interior.  On the other hand, in terms of convenience, reliability of use, you don‚Äôt even have to think which radar detectors are the best: this model can bypass even expensive analogs in terms of these characteristics.  For a relatively small price (just below 7000 rubles) you get a device equipped with a GPS module.  All letters and signs are visible on the bright integrated display.  A significant minus of the radar is false positives in the conditions of the city. </p><h2>  Combined Devices: Pros and Cons </h2>
