    <h2>  About company </h2><p>  To begin with, we note that a company manufacturing products under this brand has Ukrainian roots.  It is there that the manufacturer‚Äôs main offices are located, as well as warehouses with products.  The profile of the manufacturer is wide enough.  Besides the fact that you can buy a Bravis smartphone, there are also other electronic devices on sale - lamps, household appliances, various music gadgets and more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the developer has been operating for several years, they managed to develop a whole line of devices with different technical characteristics and functionality.  A user who wants to purchase a device can do this in any of the dozens of online stores where Bravis mobile phones are presented. </p><h2>  Products </h2><p>  The phones that this company offers are particularly affordable (compared to other manufacturers).  The Bravis price benchmark can only be attributed to the lower budget class, given the average cost of the devices.  Moreover, the quality of the devices is no worse than Chinese products. </p>

    <p>  As indicated on the official website of the company, they make their phones in Chinese factories that produce other available devices: ZTE, Jiayu, MicroMax and others.  All this indicates that Ukrainian and Chinese phones can be compared in terms of similar approaches to their production.  True, there are similar brands in our country, ordering products at factories of the Middle Kingdom. </p><p>  What devices are included in the line of smartphones of this company?  First of all, we can say that this is a wide range of devices from the lower price range.  That is, the <span>most expensive phone</span> will cost no more than $ 100 (we are talking about the ‚Äútop‚Äù models), while the average smartphone will cost no more than $ 60-70.  This, for example, is somewhat outdated in its filling "Bravis Jazz". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pricing </h2><p>  If you look at how cheaply the described devices are offered, you can be surprised how this company exists, whether it works at a loss.  Even Chinese smartphones from the same class can be more expensive than their Ukrainian (or Russian) counterparts.  How can this be? </p>

    <p>  Speaking specifically about the Bravis products, the manufacturer notes its low costs for marketing and promoting phones.  If you believe the message on the official website, due to this, the final cost of their devices is significantly reduced.  And this, in turn, provides the buyer with the opportunity to save on every purchased mobile phone. </p><p>  Also an important point in the value policy can be called sales.  Each Bravis smartphone (and we are talking about almost two dozen modifications) is presented on the market in thousandths.  It is not surprising that factories can reduce the cost of each device, providing significant discounts to end customers.  This attracts a person who is looking for a budget, affordable and at the same time universal gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Functional </h2><p>  The fact that each Bravis phone (its price does not matter at the same time) has a wide range of functions, you can also make sure - just look at the characteristics of the models for this.  All of them are built on the basis of the Android operating system, which already implies the ability to work with such basic applications as a browser, camera, audio / photo / video players, maps, the Google Play application catalog and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of course, device capabilities vary by model.  For example, there is such a touch-screen phone with a 4-inch screen, like "Bravis Jazz".  It, of course, is controlled by the Android OS and, as we said, has all the features that are present in a modern smartphone.  At the same time, the cost of the device is very underestimated, since this model is no longer produced by this company.  For those buyers who need a minimum of capabilities, affordable price and comfort in working with the device, this gadget is the best option. </p><p>  Another example is the so-called Bravis Base dialer.  The phone is presented in a ‚Äúmonoblock‚Äù case, which means the presence of a physical keyboard, a small screen and, of course, the absence of any operating system.  It is convenient to work with this ‚Äúbaby‚Äù only if the most primitive is enough for you - the ability to send and receive messages, calls, and have a list of contacts.  At Bravis Base itself, everything is organized in a very convenient way.  For this, they acquire it. </p>

    <h2>  "Top" models </h2><p>  As noted above, the Bravis phones (reviews about them will be a little later) are represented by a fairly wide range of models.  However, only a few of them, as the promotional offers of stores show, are in high demand among buyers.  We will talk about them in more detail in the framework of this article, in order to understand more specifically what is at stake. </p><h2>  Bravis A501 Bright </h2><p>  In the first place in the device hierarchy from the Ukrainian manufacturer, the device with the code name A501 is presented as an explicit ‚Äúflagship‚Äù.  The smartphone really has good characteristics: at least it was made in a unique case with a rounded shape (like the one used by LG to develop its ‚Äúcurved‚Äù smartphones).  Obviously, even in the appearance of the phone a lot of efforts of designers were put. </p><p>  The ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the device also boasts its adaptability: the SC7731 processor is installed here, which produces a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  1 GB of RAM allows you to play even quite ‚Äúbulky‚Äù (in terms of graphics) games, as well as work with videos without delay.  It is also worth noting the ability to connect a memory card, the presence of two cameras (2 and 5 megapixels), as well as a capacious 2000 mAh battery.  If you configure the phone correctly, it may be enough for a day of work on a single charge. </p>

    <h2>  Bravis air </h2><p>  Another representative of the brand on sale is the Air model.  Customers write reviews about these Bravis phones as inexpensive, obviously not the most productive, but reliable devices.  A simple angular case, the minimum display diagonal for smartphones (4 inches), a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels - all this indicates that this gadget serves as a good ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with additions in the form of a memory card, camera and wireless Bluetooth and GPS interfaces.  The processor runs on two cores, showing 1.2 GHz <span>clock speed.</span>  But with RAM, everything is not so cool - 512 megabytes for such a phone is clearly not enough. </p><h2>  Bravis alto </h2><p>  Another Bravis phone, the price of which reaches <span>$ 100,</span> is the Alto model.  It also has a large, colorful 5.5-inch screen, 4 processor cores, as well as 1 GB of RAM.  The smartphone differs from its predecessors by a powerful 8 megapixel camera.  But in terms of autonomy, you should not buy these Bravis phones.  Reviews note that Alto have only 2000 mAh batteries.  Given the level of charge consumption, this gadget will last in active mode for no more than 8-10 hours. </p><p>  Plus, again, the phone is easy to configure - just select the interface in the most convenient way for you. </p><h2>  Bravis light </h2><p>  Some phones of this manufacturer, despite the fact that they are equipped with a touch screen and a powerful processor, do not differ too much from the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù button versions in their technical parameters.  Here, for example, there is a Bravis Classic model - a stylish, strict (in its design) device with a physical keyboard.  And there is Bravis Light - a device that, although it is running the Android OS, but has only 512 megabytes of memory (like Air) and a screen with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels not the best in picture accuracy.  There is a main camera with 2 megapixels (and 0.3 megapixels - front), as well as a number of wireless interfaces (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G). </p><p>  Such <span>‚ÄúBravis‚Äù phones</span> are called basic <span>reviews</span> , and by their capabilities they are really not far from the keyboard ‚Äúmonoblocks‚Äù.  But at least it‚Äôs advantageous to take them for working with two SIM cards. </p><p>  If you are not interested in Android, a camera and a touch screen, you can get by with a version like Bravis Jazz.  There is only internal memory (represented by a 32 GB microSD card), a 1.77-inch display and support for 2 SIM cards.  The cost of the device, by the way, is only $ 15.  In the settings, as you can guess, it is also as simple as possible. </p><h2>  Bravis alpha </h2><p>  There is an average option in terms of price and quality in the line of the Ukrainian manufacturer of mobile devices.  True, it has already been discontinued, but positive feedback from customers about it can still be found. </p><p>  The device has a simple 4.5-inch display (based on IPS-matrix), a 5 megapixel camera, as well as a MediaTek processor (1.3 GHz).  By adjusting the graphics settings, you can achieve optimal gadget performance.  This applies to graphics settings in games, for example. </p><p>  The model is noteworthy in that it cost an order of magnitude cheaper than its ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù in a number of (flagship devices, in particular, the A501 version), but showed very good results.  Read more in the section with characteristics from real people. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, we have described some of the most significant phones of this brand.  The time has come to provide feedback that is mentioned by those who have directly worked with these devices. </p><p>  So, for starters, we note that there really are a lot of them.  This suggests that the Bravis smartphones are in great demand, people are buying these phones.  The second aspect that we managed to draw from the characteristics of users is the orientation to a low price.  Most reviews focus on the fact that Bravis products are very affordable, have a low cost, which means that they can compete with the same inexpensive, but less high-quality Chinese smartphones from noname-brands. </p><p>  The third point is quality reviews.  The devices presented in this article really do not have the best technical specifications on the market.  Even some representatives of reputable brands in China show better results in terms of performance, for example.  But people positively note the build quality and stability of the model. </p><p>  For example, take the same ‚ÄúBravis Alpha‚Äù.  The phone, which does not have the <span>most powerful processor,</span> works without ‚Äúdelays‚Äù and freezes, as is often the case with weak Chinese smartphones.  The manufacturer ‚ÄúBravis‚Äù apparently pays attention to the proper optimization of the operating system and hardware of its devices, due to which their work is more coherent and stable. </p><p>  Finally, we must not forget about the "pleasant things."  This refers to such aspects of the development of the phone as its design, body materials and positioning.  If the device is presented in the lowest price class, but can please with high-quality plastic conveniently in your hand, the user will be glad to purchase it.  Apparently, the company is working on such tactics.  At least, the mass of positive reviews is proof of this. </p>
