Then the young journalist allowed herself to incorrectly speak out to her mother with many children, which brought down public indignation.  Some remembered the girl thanks to a press conference with V. Putin, which took place in 2012.  Then Ekaterina Vinokurova, whose photo will be provided in our article, was present at the mentioned event as a visiting journalist.  The girl, not at all embarrassed, managed to ask the president a question that led him into a stupor and, one might even say, discouraged.  Naturally, many remembered Katya just then, since not everyone is able to do this with Vladimir Vladimirovich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Vinokurova journalist" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371111.jpg" width="295"></div>

    <p>  After such stories, many could begin to mistakenly believe that Ekaterina Vinokurova is a journalist who tries to gain fame and recognition solely by provocation and fanning scandals.  And there is a certain amount of truth in such conclusions.  But at the same time, one should not discount that this girl managed to independently build her career as a shark pen at a fairly young age, she has vast experience in both journalism and the PR field.  If you take an interest in <span>Catherine‚Äôs</span> biography <span>and</span> look a little deeper through the scam of her scandalous reputation, it becomes clear that she is a very principled person and knows how to fully defend her point of view. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief curriculum vitae </h2><p>  Despite the common misconception, the journalist discussed in our article hails from a very ordinary family.  Ekaterina Vinokurova is the daughter of simple parents who have no direct relation to professional journalism or the country's political elite.  Both parents worked as teachers.  Their daughter was born in 1985.  The girl is a native Muscovite, she studied at a specialized school with in-depth study of English. </p><p>  Ekaterina Vinokurova got to her first job quite early, at the age of fourteen, while still a schoolgirl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Vinokurova daughter" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371109.jpg" width="535"></div>  Despite her young years, the girl was entrusted with playing the role of assistant bill editor at one of the Moscow news agencies.  Even then, having fallen into the atmosphere of news and limitless information circulation, Katya realized that she wanted to become a journalist in the future.

    <h2>  Received education and first experience </h2><p>  After graduation, Ekaterina Vinokurova firmly decided to make her dream a reality.  To graduate, she entered Moscow State University, where she studied at the Faculty of Advertising.  In 2005, she began to conduct active social activities and became a member of the youth movement "Defense", whose main goal was the democratization of the state and the openness of power.  But at the same time, the ideology of the movement sometimes became very ambiguous, and against the background of the differences that arose, Ekaterina Vinokurova left the ranks of this organization a year later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Political Views </h2><p>  Since 2007, the journalist has had experience working with Andrei Bogdanov.  Katya was the press secretary of his Democratic Party.  In tandem, they participated in presidential and parliamentary campaigns.  Despite the colossal experience that Vinokurova should have gained during this period of her life, the girl brought out only disappointments from him.  She herself said that she had the opportunity to become a direct witness to how the idea during such campaigns slides from idealism to cynicism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Vinokurova photo" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371107.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <p>  Similar disappointments will happen to the girl more than once.  Initially, Ekaterina Vinokurova largely supported the policy of President Vladimir Putin.  But such support ceased after Vladimir Vladimirovich began to pursue a policy of monetization of benefits. </p><h2>  Opposition disappointments </h2><p>  It would seem that a young activist with a long-formed own civic idea should have joined the opposition.  And after the start of the first civil rallies and protests that swept across Russia in 2011, this almost happened.  Rallies on <span>Bolotnaya Square, the</span> action of disagreement on the avenue to them.  Sakharova, ‚ÄúMarch of Millions‚Äù, the action ‚ÄúBig White Circle‚Äù on the Garden Ring - all this inspired hope that real changes could begin in the country.  And Vinokurova supported such actions, but here she was disappointed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinokurova Ekaterina Vladimir" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371108.jpg" width="600"></div>  Over the course of events, Catherine realized that none of the proclaimed opposition leaders was ready to lead people further beyond rallies and actions.

    <h2>  Work in editions </h2><p>  Since 2008, Katya goes into business and works in the PR field.  After 2 years, she was hired by the online newspaper Gazeta.ru.  First Vinokurova worked in the news department, then was transferred to the political department.  In 2013, the journalist quit.  The reason was that the editor-in-chief Svetlana Lolaeva was dismissed from her post, and Katya left with her in solidarity. </p><h2>  2013 scandal </h2><p>  Unfortunately, a wide audience had the opportunity to learn about Catherine after the scandal of 2013.  On March 9, the next congress of the United Popular Front took place.  At it N. Sarganova acted.  This woman is the mother of 2 natural children and 35 adoptive children.  During her speech, she talked about the difficulties of having many children, adoption, and mentioned the poor financial condition of her family.  Apparently, this performance caused Ekaterina Vinokurova too violent emotions, and she decided to immediately comment on her post on Twitter.  But Katya didn‚Äôt do it in the most correct way, calling Sarganova ‚Äúsome idiot‚Äù and expressing her opinion on this subject as follows: ‚ÄúShe weeps for the GDP that she has little money.  Well, I would not adopt. "  Naturally, a similar post on Twitter was immediately met with sharp criticism.  Vinokurova Ekaterina Vladimirovna very quickly removed him, and then was forced to apologize to her mother with many children. </p><h2>  An inconvenient question for Putin </h2><p>  In the same 2013, Vinokurova was able to distinguish herself again, during one of the press conferences held by V.V. Putin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Vinokurova" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371112.jpg" width="505"></div>  After a certain incident related to the fact that law enforcement agencies, including riot police, are exceeding their authority, Yekaterina asked Putin what he would do like a real man if he saw a riot police officer beating a girl.  Apparently, not knowing the correct answer to this question, the president said that he could not imagine himself in such a situation.

    <h2>  What is Vinokurova doing now? </h2><p>  For some time, the girl headed the Moscow correspondent point of the online publication Znak.com.  Her articles were published in such publications as ‚ÄúSlon.ru‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù, The Question, ‚ÄúMedialix‚Äù, ‚ÄúActual Comments‚Äù.  Relatively recently, in May this year, Catherine resumed her collaboration with the newspaper.  RU".  Together with Georgy Bovt, she began to conduct a video project called The Tea Party, in which co-hosts satirically discuss various events. </p><h2>  Namesakes with different fates </h2><p>  If you are interested in the activities of this activist and journalist in detail, you can come across a question about who the husband of Ekaterina Vinokurova is.  And just then, a certain confusion arises.  The journalist herself does not advertise her personal life and information that she is married is not provided anywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Catherine Vinokurov‚Äôs husband" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371118.jpg" width="315"></div>  But there is mention of Alexander Vinokurov, who is the wife of Ekaterina Vinokurova.  Alexander is more than rich: he is the head of one of the largest pharmaceutical companies and simultaneously owns several large companies of his own.  In fact, this man has absolutely nothing in common with the journalist to whom our article is devoted. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ekaterina Vinokurova Lavrova" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32144/1371119.jpg" width="452"></div>  His wife is Ekaterina Vinokurova-Lavrova, daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  After <span>Lavrova Ekaterina Sergeevna</span> married and took the name of her husband, she became Ekaterina Vinokurova, which leads to some misunderstandings.  But in fact, a millionaire has nothing to do with Kate Vinokurova, a journalist.
