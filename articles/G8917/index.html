  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Indian architecture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most outstanding achievements of Indian civilization is undoubtedly architecture.  But these are not only the greatest monuments, such as the famous Taj Mahal, Khajuraho and Vijayanagar complexes.  The architecture of India is diverse.  It, which has developed over many centuries, reflected the social, economic, geographical conditions characteristic of the country. </p><p>  During the reign of Ashoka the Great (273 BC - 232 <span>BC)</span> , large-scale construction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas was carried out. </p><p>  The Buddhist architecture of India prevailed for several centuries, and some examples of magnificent buildings have survived to the modern time - the Big Stupa in the village of Sanchi, erected by order of Emperor Ashoka, which is considered the first stupa in history, and the temple and cave complex Ajanta. </p><p>  By the eighth century, with the unification of Hindu kingdoms, the architectural style of the southern school became dominant.  The most famous achievements of the Pallava dynasty, whose state was concentrated in the northern territory of the modern state of Tamil Nadu (4th-9th centuries), are the temple-cave complex of Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram. </p><p>  The rulers of the states of Chola, Khoyasal, Vijayanagara also tried to leave a mark on Indian architecture. </p><p>  Khoyasal architecture (between the 11th and 14th centuries) is an <span>architectural style that</span> reached its peak in the 13th century.  Active construction of temples in the state of Khoyasal was associated with social, cultural, political events of that period.  The stylistic features of the temple architecture reflect elements of the popular religious traditions of the Vaishnavas and Virasaivas, as well as the military prowess of the rulers of Khoyasala, who tried to surpass the western rulers of Chalukya, which was manifested primarily in artistic achievements. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Located in the state of Karnataka, Chennakeshava (Belur), Hoysaleshvara (Halebid), Kesava (Somnathpura) provide wonderful examples of temple architecture, thanks to which there is an excellent opportunity to study medieval architectural traditions.  About 100 temples have been preserved in the state of Karnataka, mainly in the Malenadu region, where the state of Khoyasala was located. </p><p>  Sculpture of India is combined with architecture.  So, the masters of Khoyasaly were famous for their images of Hindu deities, scenes from epics and everyday life.  Their unique art demonstrates scrupulous attention to all the details, every aspect is perfect, right down to the fingertips and nails of the sculptures. </p><p>  The most stellar achievement of the state of Vijayanagar is the Meenakshi Temple (Madurai, Tamil Nadu). </p><p>  On the territory of the current state of Kerala, a special style of architecture has formed, combining Buddhist and Hindu traditions.  A striking example is Ellora (Kerala), where Hindus added a new collection of temples and sculptures to Buddhist caves.  One of the most magnificent creations of Ellora - Kailasanatha - a majestic rock temple with amazing relief images. </p><p>  At the same time, a distinctive style known as Nagara style architecture developed in northern India.  In the plan, the churches were built quadrangular with a towering part in the center. </p><p>  In central <span>India, the rulers of</span> Chandel built an amazing complex <span>of Khajuraho temples.</span> </p><p>  During the reign of the <span>Mughal dynasty, the</span> architecture of India was represented by the so-called Islamic-Indian style, also known as the imperial style (it was neither strictly Islamic nor strictly Indian). </p><p>  With the <span>colonization of India</span> , a style was developed called Indo-Moorish architecture, combining Hindu, Islamic, European elements.  In the <span>Indo-Moorish style</span> , public buildings were built in India - post offices, railway stations, government offices, holiday homes. </p>
