    <p>  In addition to the targeted program providing for the resettlement of a communal apartment, several more are also operating in the Northern capital, also aimed at improving the comfort of the living conditions of the population.  Relevant programs exist in other cities and regions of the Russian Federation.  So, for example, the resettlement of communal apartments in Moscow will last until 2020.  The program itself was adopted three years later than in St. Petersburg in 2010.  Another project, with the help of which it was planned to end communal utilities, was implemented by the city authorities back in 1998-2003. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Objectives of implementing a program for the resettlement of communal apartments </h2><p>  The resettlement of communal apartments (2016-2017) is carried out in order to <span>improve the living conditions of</span> citizens of St. Petersburg, who are on the list of those in need.  Thus, the city authorities strive to ensure exclusively single-family settlement of the apartment, which, of course, will affect the general standard of living of citizens. </p><h2>  State assistance in the framework of the program </h2><p>  The resettlement of communal apartments (2016-2017) is carried out thanks to the help of the state.  The actions of authorized persons and bodies that contribute to the successful implementation of the target program are as follows: </p><ul><li>  providing families with housing from the state housing fund; </li><li>  providing social benefits to the needy (accrual procedure and formula for calculating cash payments below) to improve living conditions: construction, purchase or repair of housing; </li></ul>

Most of them are implemented without attracting investors, but an option involving legal entities is also present.  So, the resettlement of the apartment is represented by the following interaction options: </p><ul><li>  Residents of a communal apartment under a contract of sale transfer rooms to a single buyer and purchase their own (separate) housing in the secondary market.  Families are assisted in finding and acquiring apartments. </li><li>  One of the families living in the shared apartment acquires rooms from other residents - neighbors.  Thus, the apartment becomes a separate housing. </li></ul>
