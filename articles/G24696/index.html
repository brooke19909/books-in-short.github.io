    <h2>  Location and landscape </h2><p>  Kranjska Gora is the common name of a resort town and locality in the north-west of the country, located in the Upper Sava River Valley, surrounded by the Julian Alps, which are partially located in Italy, and the Karavanke mountain range. </p><p>  In the past, the Krajina region, to which this territory belongs, was part of Austria-Hungary.  Now, only proximity to the Austrian border, the distance to which does not exceed two kilometers, can recall Austrian rule.  The picturesque town of Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (photos you can see in this article) is located at the junction of the borders of Slovenia, Italy and Austria.  The three countries are separated by only a few kilometers: Austrian Villach is 23 km away, Italian Tarvisio - 22 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort Kranjska Slovenia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2111451.jpg"></div>

This is one of the most popular, fashionable and, it should be recognized, the most expensive resorts in the country.  It is located at an altitude of eight hundred and ten meters above sea level at the foot of Vitrank Mountain.  This is an all-season resort.  The ski season starts here in December and lasts until March. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Kranjska Gora in Slovenia is a place characterized by an alpine climate with snowy and long winters that last four to five months, and rather cool and short summers.  In January, the average air temperature is around - 8 ° C, in July +23 ° C. </p><h2>  Kranjska Gora in Slovenia: resort description </h2><p>  This resort town has a special festive atmosphere.  It is always crowded, because not only experienced skiers come here, but also beginners who only learn the basics of skill.  Kranjska Gora in Slovenia attracts winter sports enthusiasts with its well-equipped slopes.  Everything is thought out here to the smallest detail for the convenience of athletes.  The highest level of slopes in this resort is evidenced by the fact that international skiing competitions are held here annually.  The rest of the time, skiers relax here, from beginners to professionals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slovenia kranjska gora how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2111447.jpg"></div>

The magnificent nature, sincere cordiality and hospitality of local residents, clean air only reinforce a pleasant impression of this place.  Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (holiday reviews confirm this) is an attractive place where the old and the new are bizarrely intertwined: fashionable hotels designed for Dutch and British tourists, with modest taverns and inns for skiers who have more modest wealth. </p><h2>  Lifts </h2><p>  There are still lifts that can be attributed to museum exhibits: low-speed towbars and single chairlifts.  In Europe, there are almost none.  But it is noteworthy, and it must be noted that all these mechanisms are in perfect condition and, according to vacationers, only add to the charm of the resort.  23 lifts will deliver you to the top, and 18 of them - tow-lifts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Kranjska Slovenia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2111449.jpg"></div>
