    <p>  So, this procedure is performed quickly enough and does not require much time.  At the same time, voluntary health insurance helps provide adequate medical assistance when needed.  In this case, specialists diagnose and prescribe the correct treatment much faster. </p><p>  Some insurance programs also include preventative measures, such as inspection.  Modern companies that care about the health of their employees, as well as smooth operation, try to include this procedure in their social package. </p><p>  Naturally, voluntary medical insurance is made at the request of a person, has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as design features.  We will consider all these points in more detail. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2>

    <p>  There are several programs that you choose at your discretion and financial capabilities.  For example, a standard service package provides: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - Dental care. </p><p>  - Call an ambulance and a doctor at home. </p><p>  - Attachment to any clinic. </p><p>  Voluntary medical insurance in its program may also include a list of cases in which the company will not be required to pay for treatment.  For example, the policy does not cover such diseases: </p><p>  - HIV, tuberculosis, genetic and hereditary abnormalities, cerebral palsy. </p><p>  - Mental pathologies. </p><p>  - Neuroinfection. </p><p>  - Oncological diseases. </p><p>  This list may be longer.  It all depends on the responsibility that the <span>insurance company</span> is ready to take upon itself <span>.</span>  In addition, such cases require ongoing treatment, so the policy will be very expensive. </p><h2>  Voluntary and <span>compulsory insurance:</span> what is the difference? </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned, there are many packages that include certain services of specialists.  However, in <span>municipal enterprises,</span> voluntary health insurance is most often not carried out.  That is, another type of insurance is provided here - compulsory (compulsory health insurance).  Therefore, the differences between the two procedures should be considered. </p><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 688px; height: 211px;"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="284"><p>  Compulsory insurance </p></td><td valign="top" width="284"><p>  Voluntary insurance </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="284"><p>  1.

That is, you have freedom of choice. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In any case, compulsory and voluntary medical insurance allows you to get the help of specialists quickly and efficiently.  However, you yourself have to decide how much service you want to receive. </p><h2>  Features of the design of VHI </h2>

    <p>  First of all, you should definitely conclude a voluntary health insurance contract.  It should only be in writing.  There is a certain form for such a document, which is provided to you by the insurance company.  In addition, it should contain the following information: </p><p>  1. The validity period of the document, as well as the names of both parties: the enterprise (in the case of a collective procedure) or the initials of a <span>private person,</span> as well as the insurance company. </p><p>  2. The number of persons to be covered by the contract. </p><p>  3. The procedure for making <span>insurance premiums</span> and their amount. </p><p>  4. A list of those services that a <span>medical institution</span> is required to provide <span>.</span> </p><p>  5. Responsibility of both parties in case of failure to fulfill the contract, as well as their rights and obligations. </p><p>  After the conclusion of this contract, it begins to act immediately, unless otherwise provided.  Participants in the transaction are issued a voluntary health insurance policy.  You can contact the company personally, or your management. </p><h2>  Features of the use of the policy </h2><p>  Now consider the question of how you can use the document.  So, the voluntary health insurance policy is used when an insured event occurs, provided for by the contract.  If you have a completely different situation, and you need such help that was not prescribed in the document, then you will have to pay for additional services. </p><p>  Please note that in some cases, the provision of services may be refused, even if you have PDMS.  For example, if: </p><p>  1. Before signing the contract, the client had hidden some information about his state of health. </p><p>  2. The insured event occurred as a result of alcohol or toxic intoxication. </p><p>  3. Injury occurred as a result of a client committing an unlawful act or attempted suicide. </p><p>  In other cases, you can safely submit your policy to the institution to which you are attached. </p><p>  That's all.  Be healthy! </p>
