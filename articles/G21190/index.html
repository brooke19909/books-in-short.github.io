A country that attracts travelers with its sights and unusually hospitable beaches.  The gentle sea, amazing resorts - and Hurghada, and Taba, and Sharm El Sheikh.  Hotels whose photos are admirable and desire to drop everything right now, board a plane and go on vacation to this wonderful land ... By the way, many of our compatriots who prefer to spend their vacations in foreign resorts most often prefer To Egypt.  Moreover, many of them claim that for them to go here today is almost the same as going to a country house for a vacation.  Of course, for such a "country" trip, you must have in your hands the appropriate amount, which is estimated at more than one thousand.  e. But we will not look into other people's wallets.  For those who practice frequent trips to Egyptian resorts, there is nothing unknown in this country.  But those who have never been to Egypt before going on the road, still need to pre-arm themselves with at least basic knowledge as to what hotels are here, whether they will be comfortable and affordable in financial terms, whether the rest is irrevocably damaged due to the fact that a hasty decision was made. </p>

    <h2>  Sharm El Sheikh: hotels </h2><p>  Photos of hotels, which are full of brochures, are unlikely to provide comprehensive information about a particular hotel.  Therefore, we will try to help you a little to make a choice.  Of course, in one review it is impossible to describe all the <span>resorts of Egypt,</span> its hotels and attractions.

Each room has a TV that broadcasts not only foreign, but also Russian-language channels.  The apartments have a small refrigerator, coffee or tea making facilities, and a safe.

These are the so-called Ultra All Inclusive (UAL) and Royal Ultra All Inclusive (RUAL).  By the way, many tourists, acquiring permits to this or that hotel, very often wonder what these abbreviations and these similar mean.  Since the issue of nutrition is one of the most important on vacation, we will focus on these notations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel royal albatros moderna" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/477924.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to the <span>All Inclusive</span> system (we call it ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù), all five-star hotels of a country such as Egypt work.  Royal Albatros Moderna 5 * is no exception.  In principle, this is the best option for a tourist who does not want to burden himself with worries about daily food.  All Inclusive is standard and, so to speak, ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù.  The standard refers to food (breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, usually a buffet), free booze (juices, water, alcoholic drinks, but usually locally made).  And all this without restrictions.  As well as the opportunity to engage in all sports offered by the hotel that do not require any additional costs from the administration (say, gasoline for refueling motor boats, etc.).  Further, all the additives to the main All Inclusive type, such as Mega, Ultimate, the same Royal and Ultra - this is nothing but, by and large, a public relations campaign of the hotel administration.  As a rule, the maximum that you get for these additives is the presence on the menu of not only local, but imported alcohol.  Which, although nice, but not always worth it to overpay for it several times when buying a ticket. </p><p>  What then offers us Royal Albatros Moderna?  Ultra All Inclusive - this is just imported alcohol, but not at night, as well as a glass of compulsory freshly squeezed juice for breakfast.  Having assigned the word ‚Äúroyal‚Äù to the type of service described above, at the output we will also receive the following: additional free access to the Chinese a-la carte restaurant (owners of ‚Äúultra‚Äù will have to pay for it) and a jacuzzi in the SPA complex.  And also the opportunity to use laundry services once without payment.  There aren't many privileges, are they?  However, a matter of taste.  Nutrition in both cases will be the same.  Therefore further - about food. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  As for the cost of living, then in Royal Albatros Moderna 5 prices can even be called affordable (especially for a hotel of this level), given that today Sharm El Sheikh is considered one of the most expensive resorts in Egypt.  Naturally, the cost depends on the category of apartments.  But if we talk about average numbers, then the day spent at the Royal Albatros Modern Hotel will cost about 3800 rubles.  A ticket from Moscow costs from 1700 rubles (the price depends on the class of the cabin and the date of departure), for a charter you can pay a thousand rubles less.  Of course, someone may say that it‚Äôs a little expensive, but still, given that you pay for the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù described above, thereby removing a lot of problems from the agenda and gaining the ability to do nothing but just enjoy your vacation, it‚Äôs not such a big amount.  But enough impressions until next summer. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p> As for hotel reviews, they are mostly positive.  There are also negative ones, but they are, let's say, some kind of frivolous.  Some complain that restaurants serve too many meat dishes.  But for someone, this aspect is just not a minus, but a plus.  Moreover, as many who have visited the hotel note, the menu is more than varied: there are vegetables, fruits, seafood, and delicious pastries.  Russian tourists are also pleased with the helpful and attentive staff, and especially the fact that many employees understand the Russian language, so that there are no communication problems.  The service offered by the hotel is also considered by many to be excellent, and Royal Albatros Modern's parents are especially delighted by their parents, who believe that this magnificent Egyptian hotel is a great place for children to relax.  As for entertainment, yes, some of them really are not enough.  However, the complex, which was discussed in today's review, does not position itself as the second Ibiza.  Rather, on the contrary, all the administration‚Äôs efforts are aimed at attracting couples with children to the hotel.  By the way, for those who do not have enough fun on the territory of Albatross, you can offer a great way out - to have fun outside its walls, in the city.  By the way, the hotel administration always listens to the wishes of its customers, and therefore a bus runs from the hotel to the city (even at night), which will take you to any nightclub or disco, and then bring it back.  Especially impatient or spoilers can call a taxi. </p>
