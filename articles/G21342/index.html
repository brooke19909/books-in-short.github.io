More truly, it used to be that we did not have time to keep track of which models appeared and what they can boast about.  Today, no one does this, since dozens of corporations are engaged in the constant release and development of new device models.  It is not surprising that they constantly ‚Äúthrow out‚Äù smartphones on sale that most of us have not even heard of.  Yes there, even the names of some manufacturers are unfamiliar to us! </p>

    <p>  In this article, we would like to introduce you to one interesting phone developer.  This is Bravis, a company that has been present in the Ukrainian electronics market for several years.  In addition to working with compatriot customers, the company also exports electronic products, including to Russia. </p><h2>  Brand positioning </h2><p>  All the top brands in the world of electronics, unfortunately, already work in other countries.  If we are talking about smartphones, then this, for example, is either Korean Samsung and American Apple, or Chinese Xiaomi and Meizu.  There are no Russian or Ukrainian manufacturers of such technological products for the reason that it is simply impossible to get around the companies described above in this segment (given the technologies and capabilities of entities operating in Eastern Europe).  Therefore, companies from this region most often seek a low price segment, where you can get some demand from compatriots who prefer such devices to more expensive ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, the Bravis phones (we also used reviews of them in the process of preparing the material for the article) are in high demand among buyers who are looking for affordable and reliable devices in their daily work.  Accordingly, this company also works in this area. </p><h2>  Models </h2>

    <p>  In this article, we will describe in more detail all devices manufactured under the Bravis brand.  We indicate their characteristics, cost and advantages or disadvantages relative to other phones.  In the meantime, we briefly note that all models can be conditionally divided into two groups - button and touch.  Obviously, the difference here is clear in the way the user receives information, as well as in the type of housing.  The capabilities of phones from different groups also differ, and this should be considered if you choose an inexpensive, but reliable and functional device. </p><p>  For example, judging by the reviews, it is sometimes more beneficial to purchase a touch-type phone that has a minimum price, but, say, has a number of smartphone features that the Android operating system offers.  Another situation is when the user needs the simplest ‚Äúbrick‚Äù for calls.  The needs of both those and others are able to satisfy the Bravis products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone, reviews of which are different, can be safely called a popular gadget.  These are also the devices that we describe below.  Some of them have already been discontinued, others have just gone on sale, but all of these devices are real: they are used by customers and leave their positive (most often) reviews. </p><p>  To begin with, we will clarify information on the cost of production. </p><h2>  Prices </h2>

    <p>  Each Bravis phone (reviews confirm this) is sold for no more than $ 100.  This is surprising, because even many noname products from China are offered at a higher price.  And although formally their technical parameters are one level higher than those possessed by the <span>models of the Ukrainian</span> developer, in essence the stability and build quality of these devices, as well as the level of final support, are much worse organized.  Bravis has more than sixty service centers. </p><h2>  Smartphones </h2><p>  So, it is best to introduce the reader to the company's products by characterizing each of the models presented in the line.  Therefore, smartphones from this company will be presented to your attention further.  Immediately, we note that their characteristics are an order of magnitude lower than those that occupy leadership positions in terms of sales.  Nevertheless, these devices are in great demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bravis omega </h2><p>  We will begin our review series with an interesting specimen - a clear contender for the title of ‚Äúflagship‚Äù among Ukrainian-made phones - the Omega model.  The device is equipped perfectly compared to other versions: it has a five-inch display, working on IPS technology, with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone is the <span>MediaTek MT6582 processor</span> - a popular chip used on budget gadgets.  This Bravis-promoted phone reviews are called one of the most technologically advanced in the entire lineup, as it has an eight-megapixel camera that allows you to take fairly high-quality pictures in any conditions. </p><p>  The lack of a smartphone reviews called its battery capacity.  The <span>technical specifications</span> stated about 2000 mAh - the battery capacity, which is enough (taking into account the capabilities of the device) for no more than a day's work.  So without an additional portable charger can not do. </p><p>  But the cost of the phone is only $ 100, which cannot please the seekers of budget devices. </p><h2>  Bravis power </h2><p>  The next in line for a mini-review is the Bravis Power phone.  Reviews call it the most expensive model that goes beyond our one-hundred-dollar limit.  True, this is an obsolete modification.  Rumor has it that the company is preparing a replacement for this device. </p><p>  Its characteristics speak for themselves: the battery has a 4,500 mAh battery, which is enough for 1.5-2 days of work.  You can also note the powerful matrix in the camera (resolution 13 megapixels) and a colorful screen (IPS technology and picture sizes 1280 by 720 pixels). </p><p>  The reviews characterizing the Bravis Power phone testify that there are also minor flaws in the device.  For example, we were able to notice a trend: customers write that after a couple of months of work it violates the stability of the gadget.  You have to restart the device, and in some cases even reset it to the factory settings. </p><h2>  Bravis next </h2><p>  A relatively inexpensive phone can be called "Bravis Next."  Reviews about this device testify to its ‚Äúmodesty‚Äù: a screen resolution of 480 by 854 pixels is a clear confirmation of this.  In addition to the display, the developers also saved on RAM by equipping the device with a 512 MB module.  But practical users cannot but rejoice at the support of two SIM cards. </p><p>  There are also problems with the battery here - its capacity is only 1700 mAh, which is not enough even for one day of full work. </p><h2>  Bravis trend </h2><p>  Another noteworthy gadget is the Trend smartphone, also, of course, produced under the Bravis brand.  The phone, reviews of which will be presented later, combines not only the accessibility characteristic of all devices of the line, but also manufacturability.  At least this can be judged on the basis of a five-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels, a 5-megapixel camera, a processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  This combination is really typical for a device that can support the work in most games presented in the Google directory.  Well, of course, in everyday activities, the phone shows stability. </p><h2>  Bravis solo </h2>

    <p>  Less technological, but also quite high quality assembled, can be called another device.  This is a version of the ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù, presented in the lower price segment.  The device has predictably modest characteristics: a display that is found on other versions (854 by 480 pixels), 512 MB RAM, a 2 megapixel camera.  Of course, from the point of view of entertainment, this device will not be the best choice due to the low characteristics.  However, feedback from those who use it in everyday life, indicates its stability and quality work. </p><p>  Another device has similar parameters - ‚ÄúBravis Jazz‚Äù - a phone, reviews about which are almost identical to those that were left about the Solo model.  People on the positive side characterize its design, convenient shape of the case and, of course, reasonable cost.  Given the price of a smartphone, other minor flaws such as grain on the screen or a small amount of RAM seem simply insignificant.  This can explain such a demand for the described Bravis smartphone.  The reviews confirm this - hundreds of users buy these models in Ukrainian online stores. </p><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  In addition to touch devices, which can be classified as smartphones because of their advanced functionality, the Bravis model list also has simple keyboards (as we already mentioned).  They are primarily in demand among the elderly, as well as those who need a phone just for calls.  We present the two most popular models, also indicating reviews about Bravis. </p><p>  The Bravis cell phones that we characterize here, again, are not all available for sale at the time of writing, one of the models has been discontinued.  Her place in the line is taken by another phone. </p>

    <h2>  Bravis pronto </h2><p>  So, let's start by describing the Bravis Pronto telephone in more detail.  Reviews about it are presented in an exceptionally positive light - people are happy about the perfect purchase of this device.  Of course, the model is equipped with a minimum set of functions, so no one is too demanding on it.  At the same time, this does not prevent the phone from remaining a convenient, reliable and pretty nice assistant in everyday affairs. </p><p>  There is, of course, information about some of the shortcomings - the creak of the keyboard or small print - but these minuses are more likely to be someone's individual whims (to some extent), because the product will never be ideal.  But in all other respects the device is really excellent.  It is bought, including by children, at school, guided by the fact that "it is not a pity." </p><h2>  Bravis classic </h2>

    <p>  An analogue of the ‚ÄúPronto‚Äù described above is the Bravis Classic phone.  Reviews about this model are very similar to those that we described above.  The difference between the phones is only that the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù is more representative than the ‚ÄúPronto‚Äù, because it has a strict design with right angles and slightly more advanced characteristics.  The cost of the gadget is also slightly higher - about $ 25.  It is on sale and continues to be produced. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What about the Bravis mobile phones?  The reviews we gave above about some of these models best described what they are.  In the responses, buyers note, first of all, the availability of devices.  In this regard, of course, the developers made the right choice of a segment, because it is simply impossible (or very difficult) to compete in more expensive classes where serious companies are present.  Many Russian manufacturers of mobile devices do the same. </p>

    <p>  The second point is stability.  Yes, the devices developed by the Bravis company do not have the most advanced characteristics and, in addition, cannot boast of serious indicators in terms of performance.  But they are designed with a focus on stable performance.  This is important if you want to use your device not as an entertainment center, but as a device for making calls.  Therefore, the gadget system is fully optimized for smooth operation and the performance of regular tasks. </p><p>  Finally, the third important factor is practicality.  All devices are marketed with support for two SIM cards.  This means that the buyer is given the opportunity to work simultaneously with two starter packs, using communication services and, say, mobile Internet.  Or it may just be different operators to reduce the cost of calls and messages.  And all this - at such an affordable price! </p>
