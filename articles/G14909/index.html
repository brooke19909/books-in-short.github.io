The first planet not belonging to our solar system was <br>  discovered back in 2009.  However, according to all the characteristics available to us, it is absolutely not suitable for the emergence of life.  There was a need for <br>  an apparatus that could constantly observe the starry sky, analyzing all the changes.  In addition, it was necessary to provide this unit with the ability to <br>  constantly observe one part of the sky, which is impossible to do from the surface of the earth.  All this led to the launch of the Kepler space telescope in 2009, <br>  who should look for exoplanets. </p>

    <h2>  Goals </h2><p>  The device, launched by NASA, was called "Kepler".  The planet for the search for which <span>this telescope</span> was created can be at any distance from our system. <br>  Therefore, the transit method is used to search for exoplanets.  It consists in observing a small portion of the sky and measuring the brightness of stars.  When past the stars <br>  passes the planet, the brightness decreases slightly.  It is by this sign that one can find out if the luminary has a planetary type of body.  To set the period <br>  circulation and the number of planets, it is necessary to observe the star for at least three years.  Only after that it can be argued that the brightness of the star decreases precisely by <br>  the reason for the passing of an exoplanet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, there may not be so many planets on which life may have been formed or once already formed.  That is why Kepler has been operating for so many years and there is currently no need to stop this project. </p><h2>  Achievements </h2><p>  Today, through Kepler, more than 4 hundred exoplanets have been discovered.  All newly opened are given the names of the telescope, with the assignment of a serial number and a letter.  The letter shows how many planets a star has. </p>

    <p>  Of the hundreds open, several may well be livable, Kepler showed.  Planet 186f, for example, was once seriously considered the "twin" of the Earth.  However <br>  at present, we cannot be sure of the real suitability of all the discovered planets.  After all, among other things, to be able to say <br>  Since the <span>celestial body</span> is suitable for life, it is necessary to study many really suitable ones.  We have the opportunity to study only one planet, for sure <br>  livable - Earth.  This amount of material is extremely small.  But based on known facts, scientists believe that for the emergence of any life <br>  water must be in liquid form.  This parameter made it possible to introduce such a concept as "habitable zone" - here are the planets on which, thanks <br>  favorable distance from the star, maybe liquid water.  In this zone, the water has a chance not to evaporate and not to freeze.  The presence of fluid depends on the brightness <br>  stars, and from the remoteness of the planet itself from the sun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Second earth </h2><p>  What needs to be further clarified in order to claim that a <span>planet similar to Earth has</span> been discovered <span>?</span>  ‚ÄúKepler,‚Äù be that as it may, give us no such information <br>  can.  It was created only to detect the very existence of exoplanets.  Nevertheless, we know for sure that the characteristics of the planet can be completely different. <br>  For example, even a discovered gas giant cannot guarantee that there is no water on it.  After all, he may well have a satellite with a suitable atmosphere. </p><p>  Many factors are responsible for the likelihood of a known life occurring: the presence of satellites, the distance from the star, the activity of the star, the presence of unstable <br>  stars in the neighborhood, giant planets in the star system.  Based on the data known to us, scientists suggest that life may arise, first of all, on those <br>  planets that are as close as possible to our own - revolving around a sun-like star in a similar orbit having a similar mass, age, <br>  radius and other parameters.  Such many requirements for the ‚Äúsecond Earth‚Äù leads to the fact that the discovery of planets that are similar to the Earth, causes violent emotions <br>  scientists and ordinary people.  Currently, two exoplanets have been discovered that require closer attention, as they may well be the ones for which the Kepler astronomical satellite was created.  Planet 186F and 452b. </p><h2>  Kepler 186f </h2><p>  186f Kepler - planet discovered in April 2014.  Despite the considerable distance, quite a bit was found out about it: it revolves around a red dwarf with a periodicity of 130 Earth days, 10% larger than the Earth.  It rotates in an orbit passing along the outer edge of the habitable zone.  The statement of astrophysicists was greeted with enthusiasm, immediately many inhabitants and even quite respected publications began to assume the appearance of the planet, its characteristics and the bonuses that the Earth could receive from such a "sister."  However, over time, scientists managed to return the dreamers to reality. </p>

    <p>  In order to accurately say how likely life on the planet is, it is necessary to have much more data.  For example, you need to find out <br>  atmosphere, its composition, composition and nature of the planet itself, surface temperature and many other characteristics.  We currently don‚Äôt have any equipment <br>  capable at such a great distance to find out all the factors that interest us.  However, in the 2020s, a similar mechanism is planned to be launched into orbit, <br>  for a detailed study of exoplanets. </p><p>  How much fly to the planet Kepler 186f?  Well, she‚Äôs practically next to us - she‚Äôs only about 400 <span>light years away.</span> </p><h2>  Kepler 452b </h2><p>  It is located a little further away from us - at a distance of 1400 light years.  The star around which this probable "double" of the Earth rotates is similar to our Sun. <br>  The Kepler 452b orbit is almost identical to Earth.  A day is equal to our 385 days.  <span>The size of the planet is</span> significantly larger than the Earth - the radius is 60% larger.  Thus, <br>  if the density of this planet is the same as that of the Earth, then it will weigh 4 times more, which will lead to more gravity - 1.5 times.  The age of the star system, in <br>  which lives on the planet of interest to us, 6 billion years, against 4.5 - the age of our Sun. </p>

    <p>  Could there be life on this planet?  Can.  But it may not be.  Until accurate and modern equipment appears that allows you to study the planets, <br>  located at such great distances, we can‚Äôt say for sure what this and others are like, we can‚Äôt see a photo of the planet Kepler 452b and others like her. </p>
