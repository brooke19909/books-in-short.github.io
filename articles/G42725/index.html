For example, participating in a salary project, that is, getting salary on the card of this bank, you can get a credit card on a personal offer.  The same goes for deposit clients.  Sometimes a credit card can be literally imposed (bank employees also have a plan that needs to be implemented).  In today's article, we will consider this type of banking service as a Visa Gold credit card.  Reviews on this product abound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visa gold card reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59173/2113434.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The reviews confirm that the following factors can be mentioned among the features of using a gold card: </p><ol><li>  Round-the-clock service, which is carried out through the head office of Sberbank. </li><li>  In the event that you lost your card while being abroad the Russian Federation, an urgent cash withdrawal is possible. </li><li>  Sberbank subsidiaries located outside the Russian Federation issue cash on the same terms as in Russia. </li><li>  It is possible to link an account to an electronic wallet. </li></ol><p>  The availability of additional opportunities to use VISA Gold provides significant advantages over other loan products.  The main advantage of any credit card, including a VISA Gold card, according to reviews, is the lack of the need to enter into direct relations with the bank or its representative office in case money is urgently needed.  That is, the procedure is greatly simplified: instead of going to the bank, thinking and worrying about issuing a loan, you simply go to the nearest ATM and withdraw money or pay at the store with a card, limited to a credit limit.  A credit card can be kept, so to speak, on a "rainy day" without using it.  In this case, the bank will not take interest.  From this point of view, such a banking product is very convenient to use, but it is necessary to remember some nuances.  The preferential limit is 50 days by credit card of Sberbank of Russia Visa Gold.  Reviews are presented at the end of the article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What does it mean?  This means that you can use credit funds absolutely free of charge, but you need to pay off the debt in a period not exceeding 50 days.  In this case, you use cash, but the bank does not charge interest.  It should be remembered only that this provision applies only to those expenses that you carried out by bank transfer.  When withdrawing cash from an ATM, other rules apply.  In this case, a commission fee of 3% of the withdrawn amount or at least 390 rubles is charged for withdrawing funds.  This must be taken into account.  In addition, when using a gold card abroad, there is a danger of a later receipt of information on the balance of funds in the account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="preferential credit card sberbank visa gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59173/2113430.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the correction of the balance occurs later than is necessary for timely payment.  This is fraught with the accrual of interest, which can turn the minimum amount into a rather large debt.  In addition to all this, when using a gold credit card, you should remember about the so-called secondary dangers.  These pitfalls are determined by the characteristics of human psychology.  As a rule, a person paying with a credit card does not lose cash, they remain in his pocket.  There is no feeling that you spent more than you planned, since in fact there is a calculation of virtual money.  As a result, you spend a lot more than you planned, so you should think about it before using this banking product and treat it like cash. </p><p>  Real reviews of owners about Visa Gold from Sberbank can be found in large numbers. </p><h2>  Excess grace period </h2><p>  If it was not possible to repay the loan amount during the <span>grace period,</span> then, unfortunately, this means that the bank will accrue interest.  And they will be quite tangible amounts.  They must be repaid on time in accordance with the schedule drawn up by the bank, otherwise penalties will come into force, which can increase the amount of payment by an order of magnitude.  Care must be taken to ensure that after depositing funds, no debts remain in the account.  This can be done at a bank branch, on the website or at an ATM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card sberbank russian visa gold reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59173/2113432.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Closing a golden card </h2><p>  If you have an unused Sberbank gold credit card, you should be aware of the terms of its service, as they do not change.  The bank does not cease to accrue interest if there is a debt on payments.  The card must be correctly closed in order to avoid further problems, disputes with the creditor and make life easier, saving money and nerves.  In order for the closure to occur correctly, you must first pay off all your debt obligations on this card (the exact amount of debt can be found by calling the phone number on the card or in your personal account on the bank's website).  Then you need to submit an application for closing a credit card to the department that issued it.  After the application is submitted, the plastic card remains with the manager, who is obliged to destroy it in the presence of the client.  Further, the client has the right to receive a certificate of absence of debt to Sberbank.  This document may help in case of a dispute. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  It should be recalled that the credit funds on the card can be used by scammers, therefore, in case of loss of a Visa Gold card, you should urgently contact the bank in order to block it.  If, nevertheless, the theft of money from the account has occurred, then this is also an occasion for an early appeal to the nearest bank branch.  Institutional staff will instruct you on how to proceed.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Owning a gold credit card has its positive and negative sides.  Let's try to figure it out with the help of customer reviews.  Impressions based on personal experience of borrowers are always of much greater value than advertising slogans.  Most borrowers, among the main advantages, note a long grace period (50 days), during which interest-free repayment of the loan is possible.  In addition, there is no annual card maintenance fee, which is also good news.  Among the negative reviews, there are often complaints not about the banking product itself, but about customer service: delays in queues, incompetence, and sometimes rudeness of employees.  Another significant drawback is customers consider high interest on cash withdrawals.  But many consumers are quite satisfied with the service and the loan product itself. </p><p>  But this is only a small part of the reviews about the Sberbank Gold Bank credit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="visa gold card replenishment methods" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59173/2113435.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Analyzing all of the above, we can say that this is a good banking tool for unforeseen situations.  However, the disadvantages of this product must also be taken into account, otherwise indiscretion can threaten a real debt hole, from which it will be very difficult to get out.  If you handle a gold credit card with care, then trouble can be minimized.  It is also worthwhile to objectively assess your financial capabilities and real incomes when issuing a card. </p><p>  We reviewed the real reviews and conditions of Visa Gold from Sberbank. </p>
