    <h2>  Resort status and infrastructure </h2><p>  Due to its subtropical climate, the resort town of Pitsunda is currently a popular resort with more than ten high-rise 14-story pensions, several health resorts, holiday homes and hotels.  All buildings are located along the coast, a stone's throw from comfortable beaches - sandy and pebble.  Pitsunda's infrastructure is designed so that every guesthouse is a fully autonomous entity, it has everything: catering blocks and restaurants, game and concert halls, cinemas and night clubs.  You can live in such an institution without leaving its territory for weeks.  However, no one remains in a high-rise building if the sea is calm and the sun is in the sky. </p>

    <h2>  Heritage of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Pitsunda, the sights of which are for the most part the legacy of the once great and mighty USSR (however, some of them have been preserved since ancient times and have unconditional historical value), is primarily considered a resort city - with beaches, the sea, attractions and all the ensuing details.  As for any unique structures or relics, all of them have long been studied and systematized by local scientists.  Pitsunda is a conservative city, new architectural monuments do not appear in it, the historical museum is not updated with new exhibits every year ... However, the sights that make up Pitsunda's wealth are quite enough.  Get to know them a little closer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pitsunda Attractions </h2><p>  1. The main <span>attraction of Pitsunda</span> is the Great Pitiunt State Reserve (this is the ancient name of this settlement), which has an architectural and historical status.  The exposition collections of the museum contain materials on the entry of Pitiunt into the Abkhazian kingdom at the end of the 8th century AD.  e.  And after 200 years, the city became part of the Abkhaz-Georgian state.  In the XI century, it began to be called Bichvinta, as mentioned in historical Georgian tablets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pizunda photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/472749.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  2. Dome Cathedral of the Holy Apostle Andrew the First-Called, built at the beginning of the 10th century AD  e.  The temple has an organ hall with 360 seats.  On the walls of the narthex are murals of the 16th century by an unknown artist.  The cathedral is a cross-domed structure with three naves in plan.  Under the altar is the tomb of St. <span>John Chrysostom,</span> Bishop of Constantinople, who died on the road to Pitsunda in 407.  Later, the relics of the saint were transported to Constantinople, and in the tomb a particle of the dust of the great martyr is now stored. </p><p>  3. The pine relic reserve.  A grove of bicentennial pines stretches along the coast for 4 kilometers, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpine forest is about 200 hectares.  The coniferous aroma mixed with sea air can also be called a landmark in Pitsunda, since such a rich air-healing cocktail is no longer anywhere in the world.  Doctors at local spa resorts prescribe for their patients, as well as ordinary guests, long walks among the pine trees along the sea.  Fertile lands and orchards with orange and <span>tangerine trees are</span> located next to the relic reserve <span>.</span>  Herds of cows and sheep graze in green meadows. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  4. The statue of Medea, the legendary Queen of Colchis, wife of the Argonaut Jason, with whose assistance he stole the Golden Fleece.  The sculpture was created by the national artist of Georgia Merab Berdzenishvili.  The witch Medea sits on a pedestal with her children, two infant sons, whom she then kills, and she hides in a chariot sent to her by Helios.  The composition is set in the sand near the water and is one of the most visited attractions of Pitsunda. </p><p>  5. Lighthouse of Pitsunda.  Located near the sea, for many years guided ships at the right course.  A few years ago it was closed and decommissioned, but remained as a navigation monument.  The new lighthouse, equipped with modern warning equipment, is installed on the roof of the highest guesthouse, which received the same name.  The rays of the new lighthouse cover several times greater distance and are visible for many miles around. </p><p>  6. The famous sculpture of Zurab Tsereteli called ‚ÄúDivers‚Äù, located on the waterfront, is a symbol of the spa town, one of its main attractions, emphasizing the color of the swimming season in Pitsunda, which lasts more than six months.  The sculpture depicts two bathers surrounded by marine animals.  It was established in 1967, and immediately caused a stream of criticism, as, indeed, any work of Tsereteli, around which spears break in endless debate. </p>

    <h2>  What do vacationers need </h2><p>  The resort town of Pitsunda, the sights of which attract tourists to a large extent, is primarily a place for recreation, swimming, jet skiing, diving and other marine activities.  Tourists and vacationers, with and without vouchers, go to this region on the advice of relatives or friends.  People want what they want in a well-established small resort town called Pitsunda.  Sights in this case play a secondary role.  And at the same time, there is nothing wrong with that, leaving the beach in the evening, vacationers will pass by the sculpture "Stone Girl" or admire the "Divers" of the same Tsereteli. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a choice </h2><p>  Perhaps the words "Pitsunda", "rest" are for tourists who want to soak up comfortable beaches, much more than the phrase "attractions of Pitsunda", but does not exclude one another, but rather complements it.  In the evening, vacationers can visit bars, restaurants, gambling establishments.  The hospitable city of Pitsunda has much more to offer visitors, a map of which hangs on almost every corner, indicating directions to certain establishments.  In addition, there is information on how transport can reach your destination. </p>

    <h2>  Pitsunda: photos and drawings </h2><p>  During the day, photographers work on all the beaches of Pitsunda, some with a monkey, some with an inflatable dolphin.  There are many options, you can take a picture even on a horse.  Family photos also do not suffer from a lack of imagination.  And on the embankment are portrait painters.  For a moderate fee, you can order a good portrait there or some other <span>pencil drawing.</span>  The resort town of Pitsunda lives its own life, in which there is certainly a place for you. </p>
