The whole territory of Turkey is surrounded by the sea, except for its central part.  This makes the center of Turkey warmer and drier in January, and the eastern part rainy and frosty.  In general, each season is good for holidays in Turkey, it all depends on our preferences and expectations. </p><h2>  Weather in Turkey </h2><p>  The weather in Turkey in different regions is very different.  If tourists go on vacation in January, they should prepare for cold weather, as well as heavy and frequent rains.  The lowest temperatures are recorded in central and eastern Anatolia.  They sometimes fall below zero, but on average no more than -6 ° C.  So compared to the European winter, this is a rather comfortable temperature. </p>

    <p>  The warmest climate is observed in the Mediterranean - average values ​​are about 10 ° C.  Due to the small number of sunny days, water in the sea barely exceeds 10 ° C.  Beach resorts are empty.  Turkey will begin to wake up only at the end of March, when the weather improves and a more comfortable temperature is established. </p><h2>  Temperature and precipitation </h2><p>  The temperature in Turkey in January does not please either the beach or sightseeing.  In most tourist resorts, the thermometer shows a maximum of 10 ° C.  In addition, very unfavorable weather conditions exist throughout the country.  January is a month in which on average fifteen days of the total are rainy.  Precipitation often falls a lot, and the amount throughout the country usually exceeds 200 mm.  Humidity is high and maintained at 50%.  The sun shines on average only 3-4 hours a day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weather in Turkey in January at the main tourist resorts is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Bodrum: 6 ° C. </li><li>  Antalya: 12 ° C. </li><li>  Kusadasi: 11 ° C. </li><li>  Cesme: 10 ° C. </li></ol><h2>  Entertainment in January </h2><p>  January is a winter month, but in the Mediterranean it is relatively warm.  Of course, this is the rainy season, so vacationers should be prepared for long cloudy days, but they cannot stop visiting this beautiful country.  While in Turkey in January, tourists should mainly focus on exploring the architectural beauties of the state.  Low winter temperatures contribute to longer trips by car, so during this period you can visit the mountainous surroundings. </p>

    <p>  If guests want to take a break from the rain, they should take refuge in cozy Turkish cafes and try local delicacies.  On the streets you can always find many different pubs, often with live music. </p><h2>  Ski season in Turkey </h2><p>  Turkey, a country very diverse in terms of climate, is finally a mountainous country.  Between December and March, heavy snowfall is observed in the eastern and central parts of the country.  Holidays in Turkey in January are favorable for visiting areas where mountain lifts operate.  Skiing in winter is a favorite way to spend free time not only for tourists, but also for local residents.  The most popular Turkish ski resort is Uludag near Mount Bursa.  There are quite a lot of lifts there, and they usually work from December to April.  But first of all, pay attention to the air temperature and the amount of snow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Turkey in January: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Walking in the winter months is not much different from visiting in the summer months, except that you have to dress differently and remember a short day, and after dark it gets much colder.  All tourist facilities during this period are accessible and underpopulated.  Central areas are best suited for sightseeing. </p><p>  The most important architectural monuments of Turkey are primarily the fabulous Cappadocia, Ephesus and Pamukkale.  But if guests happen to relax in Antalya in January, then it is worth noting that this is not only a beach resort with kilometers of white sand, but also a city with a long history and interesting monuments.  Particularly noteworthy is the oldest part of Antalya and its port. </p>

    <p>  It is worth visiting the symbol of the city The Great Mosque (Yivli Minare) - a monument of the 13th century (the kingdom of Sejuk).  As well as the white mosque of Ulu-Kami with its characteristic domes.  Here you can also see a very old olive tree, take a walk to the former Dervish House (XV century) - today is an art gallery.  Hadrian's Gate is one of the most important monuments of the city.  This Arc de Triomphe was built in honor of the emperor Hadrian.  The Antalya Museum is also a very interesting object with exhibits dating from the 15th century BC.  The oldest treasures of the museum are represented by sculptures, household items - vases, ceramics, sarcophagi, coins and many other items from southern Anatolia. </p><p>  A must-have place for a vacation in Turkey in January, according to tourists, is Istanbul, the largest city and the former capital of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.  The city is one of the most popular weekend destinations in Europe.  More than 8 million tourists come here every year, which puts it in the top ten most visited cities in the world.  The vibrant industrial and cultural center of the two continents, combined with a variety of architectural styles, will not leave anyone indifferent. </p>

    <p>  The real pleasure to get from Turkey in January is to look at the panoramas of the mountains, enjoy the fresh transparent air and ride on the mountain slopes.  According to tourists, you can spend long cold days in a cozy cafe with a glass of delicious Turkish Salep drink, warming in the winter months, as well as try local herbal teas such as hell sai (with lemon and honey), ihlamur (with cinnamon and linden) and, of course, a Turkish pie. </p><p>  Tourists also recommend going to the Turkish bath.  And in the open air it will be especially useful to run, ride bicycles or go to the gym in the open air.  Mild climate, lack of heat - an ideal opportunity for training in sports.  In addition, for those who have the opportunity, you can use the indoor pools and go swimming. </p><h2>  Disadvantages when visiting Turkey in January </h2><p>  Vacationers often complain about the low temperatures in the apartments (if someone will not live in a hotel).  No radiators.  Water is heated by solar panels.  The best, according to guest reviews, is to stay in hotels or hotels that have air conditioning in the rooms. </p>

    <p>  Winter is certainly a bad time to travel to the east of Turkey - there is little frost there at this time of year, and heavy snow can temporarily block access roads. </p><p>  Winter is not the best time to visit Turkey.  In January, it is better to visit the Mediterranean, Marmara, Aegean and Black Sea regions with a mild marine climate, without severe frosts, but with the opportunity to experience all the "charm" of the rainy season.  An interesting idea could be a trip to winter Turkey for both sightseeing and skiing. </p>
