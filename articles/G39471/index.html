A feat that entered centuries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Battle of Thermopylae is a battle during the war between the Persians and Greeks, which occurred in mid-September 480 BC.  e. </p><p>  One of the most fierce battles in the history of antiquity took place ten years after Darius sent his ambassadors to all Greek policies with a humiliating demand for humility and recognition of the power of the Persians.  ‚ÄúLand and water‚Äù was demanded by the envoys of the powerful Persian king, which almost all the cities of Ancient Hellas agreed to.  Only the Athenians who executed the ambassadors and the Spartans, who threw them into the well with a proposal to get what they wanted, both land and water, did not want to show humility.  King Darius undertook an expedition to the shores of Attica, but the Persian army was defeated at the <span>Battle of Marathon</span> .  After the death of the ruler, the father's work was continued by his son Xerxes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="battle of the thermal saws" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/48459.jpg" width="424"></div>  Of the many peoples of the vast empire of the Persians, an unprecedentedly large <span>army</span> for that time was assembled and a powerful fleet equipped.  When the army of Xerxes set off to conquer Southern Greece, the pan-Greek congress decided to follow the advice of the Athenian strategist Themistocles to confront the invaders in the Thermopyllus Passage, the narrowest place on the army‚Äôs path.  The calculation was correct.  But in order for the Battle of Thermopylae to end with the victory of the Hellenes, it was necessary to assemble a large army, which the Greek policies did not manage to make.

    <p>  The enraged Xerxes ordered the allied army of the Greeks to lay down their arms, to which, according to Plutarch, he received a worthy answer: "Come and take it."  The most combat-ready units of the Persian army, at the direction of the king, began an assault.  Thus began the battle of Thermopylae - the battle that became the most striking episode of the Greco-Persian wars.  In ancient sources, researchers provide conflicting data on the number of participants in the battle.  The data of modern historians on the balance of power of opponents and losses of the parties are presented in the table. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Battle of Thermopylae </caption><tbody><tr><td>  Opponents </td><td>  Greek policies </td><td>  Persian empire </td></tr><tr><td>  Commanders </td><td>  Spartan king Leonid </td><td>  Persian king Xerxes </td></tr><tr><td>  Forces of the parties </td><td><p>  At the beginning of the battle: 5200-7700 warriors (hoplites) </p><p>  On the third day: 500-1400 warriors (hoplites) </p></td><td>  Approximately 200,000 warriors </td></tr><tr><td>  Losses </td><td>  From 2,000 to 4,000 killed, about 400 prisoners </td><td>  Approximately 20,000 killed </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  For two days, the Greek soldiers managed to repel the attacks of the Persians, but Xerxes managed to circumvent the maneuver and surround the defenders of Thermopylae.  The outcome of the last battle for the Greeks was a foregone conclusion, since it was impossible to defeat the enemy army, which was hundreds of times more numerous.  The Greeks could only count on a glorious death on the battlefield. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="feat of 300 Spartans" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/48463.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is not known for certain how many hoplites took the battle along with the Spartan king.  Ancient sources indicate that there were still Thebans (surrendered) and Thespians who died with the detachment, which consisted of 300 Spartans.  The story of the heroic deed of heroes who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their native land has become a legend that has been educating and inspiring youths of all European states for several centuries in a row.
