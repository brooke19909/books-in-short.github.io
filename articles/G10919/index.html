Rename it or not - the answer to this question was of interest to both native Petersburgers and those who moved to the city on the Neva not so long ago.  Today the answer to this question is affirmative.  The embankment was returned to its original historical name.  June 23, 2014 she again became Voskresenskaya.  Let us take a closer look at what is remarkable for the embankment and its surroundings. </p><h2>  From the history of St. Petersburg </h2><p>  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city can not be attributed to peripheral.  However, it was built up in a later era, when the city center was already largely formed.  The embankment received its historical name after the name of the Resurrection Church, which stood in the first half of the eighteenth century on the corner of Shpalernaya and Voskresenskaya streets.  Today Voskresenskaya street is known to St. Petersburg as Chernyshevsky Avenue.  In 1923, the embankment was named after a prominent figure in the French Revolution Maximilian Robespierre.  For the Soviet era, such a toponym was not unusual.  But after the historical name was returned to the city in 1993, the phrase "St. Petersburg, Robespierre Embankment" began to sound somewhat strange.  The public often drew attention to this circumstance, but changing the names of objects of urban infrastructure has traditionally been associated with significant financial costs and administrative difficulties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Robespierre embankment" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461306.jpg" width="499"></div>

The most important moment here was the construction of the granite embankment of the Neva.  The total length of the retaining wall was 288 meters.  Its construction was completed in 1852.  The embankment had two stairs, providing convenient access to the water surface.  This allowed for a long time to use it as an unloading platform for river barges and storage of building materials intended for the construction of city blocks.  In its final form, the Robespierre embankment was formed already in Soviet times.  Many of its buildings have features characteristic of Soviet architecture of the pre-war period.  The last large-scale reconstruction took place here in 1967.  It was associated with the construction of Liteiny Bridge and approaches to it.  Robespierre embankment passed under the bridge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Quay Robespierre pier" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461305.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Some attractions </h2><p>  On the Petersburg scale, the Robespierre embankment is not so rich in remarkable places.  Until recently, St. Petersburg attributed the house 32 to its unconditional sights. This <span>residential complex is</span> outwardly very characteristic of the Soviet historical era.  It was built in 1950 for workers of the nearby Big House on <span>Liteiny Prospekt,</span> that is, the Leningrad Directorate of the KGB of the USSR.  Its windows opened a magnificent view of the Neva, the legendary cruiser Aurora and the famous <span>prison "Crosses"</span> on Arsenalnaya embankment.  But this building did not survive its era for a short time, in the nineties it was declared damaged and demolished.  Also, the only <span>coffee museum</span> in Russia in house number 14, next to the pier, is customary to be attributed to city attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg embankment robespierre" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461304.jpg" width="492"></div>

In 1995, a <span>memorial to the victims of political repression</span> opened there <span>.</span>  Its author is the world famous sculptor Mikhail Shemyakin.  The sculptural composition consists of two sphinxes mounted on granite pedestals.  They are facing not only the embankment, but also the famous Crosses prison on the opposite bank of the Neva.  Many of those to whom this memorial is dedicated passed through it.  On the pedestals of the sculptures there are copper tablets with the sayings of poets, thinkers and philosophers.  Thematically and figuratively with this memorial complex echoes the monument to Anna Akhmatova located nearby, on Shpalernaya Street.  He is also facing the Crosses.  Many poetry lines of Anna Akhmatova are devoted to this prison.  At different times, her husband Nikolai Gumilyov and son Lev Nikolaevich Gumilyov visited her.  Anna Andreyevna Akhmatova herself indicated the place for the monument to herself in one of her works; it was supposed to be put up at the famous Crosses prison. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Robespierre embankment will be renamed" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461303.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  From the point of view of a realtor </h2><p>  This bank of the Neva was the outskirts of the capital during the reign of Empress Catherine II.  But at present, the answer to the question of the client of the real estate agency: "Embankment of Robespierre ... What area?"  may be unambiguous.  This is the Central District of St. Petersburg.  And real estate on this promenade is in great demand.  This is one of the most expensive and prestigious areas of the city.  There is simply no characteristic St. Petersburg housing of the old building here.  In most buildings, both facing the Neva and in the depths of the blocks, major repairs and redevelopment were made.  Apartments meet the criteria for luxury real estate.  The price per square meter of living space here is quite high, but high demand indicates that many St. Petersburg residents would like to settle on this embankment for permanent residence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Robespierre embankment which area" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/461302.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Quay Robespierre, pier at the house 14 </h2><p>  Every year, walking in the Neva and the Gulf of Finland acquires more and more popularity in St. Petersburg.  Many have noticed that the architectural ensembles of the northern capital most advantageously look from the deck of the ship.  But the river vessels are no less in demand as entertainment establishments.  It has become fashionable to celebrate birthdays, weddings and various corporate events on the deck.  Against the backdrop of this trend, a pier at house number 14 on Robespierre's Embankment has become a very significant element of the urban tourist infrastructure.  He is able to receive and serve double-deck pleasure boats.  The marina is convenient for those who want to ride along the Neva with their location in the city center, it is quite easy to get to it. </p>
