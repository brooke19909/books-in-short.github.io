  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Disneyland in Sochi - opening, photo, ticket price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first in Russia and the sixth in the world (according to the type of design) Russian “Disneyland” in Sochi received its first visitors in February 2014. The grand opening took place <span>on June 1</span> this year, on the eve of the international holiday - Children's Day.  The amusement park occupied more than 22 hectares of land on the Black Sea coast and was divided into five main parts.  Now we can say with accuracy: a grandiose project took place!  Adler became not only a city of ultra-sports facilities, but also a large-scale entertainment center of the Russian Federation.  Let's take a closer look at the long-awaited object of general attention. </p><h2>  Sochi, Disneyland: Discovery </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Sochi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481655.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The scheduled launch schedule has been slightly revised.  Despite the fact that May was the starting point for the start of the operational period, nevertheless, the park received the first guests (as already mentioned) in February 2014.  Of course, the Olympic Games, which took place this year all in the same Krasnodar Territory, contributed to this accelerated action. </p><p>  The main festival, dedicated to the beginning of life of an amazing place, was scheduled and successfully held in accordance with the established dates.  On this day, Disneyland in Sochi took more than 3,000 children.  The magnificent and enchanting entertainment center appeared in all its amusement and extreme beauty before those who came to the opening celebration.  “Finally,” the organizers said, and the friendly “Wow!”  filled each of the 5 main parts of the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The journey begins </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Disneyland Opening" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481656.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Probably, every resident of the Russian Federation feels a sense of pride and admiration for the fact that such a grandiose project was implemented in Russia, an analogue of which simply does not exist in the world.  Indeed, literally all objects in the park are related to true Russian folklore.  The immortal work of Pushkin served as the main <span>source of inspiration</span> for the designers and builders of the park.  Russian "Disneyland" in Sochi is a fairy-tale world with its original design and incredibly developed infrastructure of our time. </p><p>  Crossing the line of the main entrance, the visitor finds himself in a huge country of happiness and unfulfilled dreams.  And real and tangible.  Children are delighted, and adults, not hiding admiration, look around with interest, marveling at the scope and strength of the applied talent of magicians in human form.  After all, it was their hands, engineers, designers and builders, who managed to realize a fantastic and endless celebration of joy, in the arms of which even an adult can become a child for a while.  Believe me, there are plenty of reasons for this! </p><h2>  Alley of lights, or where does Disneyland begin in Sochi </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Disneyland in Sochi" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481658.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Ticket prices are more symbolic than a generally accepted tribute to commercial commercialism.  An adult ticket can be purchased for just some 1,500 rubles, and parents will pay three times less for a child - 500 rubles.  By the way, boys and girls under the age of 5 have the privilege of free entry.  Well, where else can you and your child enjoy the unlimited fun for such little money?  You can ride, jump, turn and safely hit as much as your heart desires.  Buying tickets takes place here.  Guest service and modern help desk points are also located on the Alley of Lights.  For special groups of visitors, wheelchairs and prams are issued.  There is a lost property office, and for the peace and protection of guests the police station has been relentlessly functioning.  You can enjoy refreshments or refreshments by visiting the nearby Gvidon restaurant or by walking a few hundred steps forward, where the doors of the cozy Magic Garden cafe will open before guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "The Edge of Science and Fiction": Extreme </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland in Sochi, ticket prices ..." class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481659.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  <span>Sochi</span> attracts many people <span>.</span>  Disneyland <span>Park</span> , the photo of which you probably already reviewed on the page of this review, if you didn’t, then in the near future it will surely become a kind of pilgrimage center for people who want to test their nerves for strength.  Thrill-seekers will have something to remember after their arrival at the Quantum Leap ride.  The incredible speed and adrenaline rush are the essential components of an unforgettable pastime in the arms of the safety mechanism and seat belts.  While older adults and children break in dizzying slides, the younger generation can play in the “Space Jungle” or frolic in the “Children's Town”. </p><h2>  Labyrinths and gravity </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of special signs and landmarks, you can get lost in the park.  Of course, you will be rescued from Lukomorye, but impressions will still remain.  The part of the park, called the “Enchanted Forest”, has in its entertaining arsenal another object not for the faint of heart - the “Firebird”.  Do not be afraid to fall.  Just don’t break your vocal chords, as the feeling of free fall causes an irresistible desire to scream with all your might.  However, you can hoarse on the "Serpent Gorynycha."  The speed of the trolley reaches 100 km / h.  For 1,056 meters, daredevils will have to test their strength by overcoming all the bends and swings of the intricately woven track. </p><h2>  Introducing National Origins </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Park - Disneyland photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481657.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Disneyland in Sochi is also a well-thought-out complex of cultural and educational character.  In the <span>pavilion of trade</span> crafts, which is located in the "Eco-Village", you can get acquainted with the original culture of the Slavic people.  Only a few hundred meters separates it from another shopping center, where you can not only see and sincerely be surprised at the products and products of different nationalities, but also purchase original souvenirs.  Believe me, when visiting this wonderful place, not only children are enthusiastic and feel in seventh heaven with happiness!  Serious and accomplished people here can get a forgotten feeling of a children's holiday.  Still would!  Fairy-tale heroes of Pushkin’s poems and poems with their unobtrusive presence will make even the most petrified heart imbued with warmth and kindness, a naive and childishly unlimited fantasy fantasy of carefree and endless fun. </p><h2>  Hotel in the "Land of the Bogatyrs" </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Park, Disneyland Rates" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/481660.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you have come from far away, you have already been taken care of.  Disneyland in Sochi has a whole hotel complex, which corresponds to the level of a four-star hotel.  The beautiful interior of modern rooms and friendly staff will not leave you indifferent.  However, it is unlikely that you will begin to relax when there are so many unknown, untested and alluring things outside the window!  Of course, you should definitely visit the Mirror Palace, a magnificent sight of an unpretentious, but perfectly coordinated game of mirror reflections.  Guests of the park can take a look at, or perhaps compete in physical strength, in a special pavilion of power games.  Time flies, and the Russian Disneyland is truly huge, as if not to miss something ... </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The Disneyland park that appeared in Sochi, the prices of which are far from European, and ours, so to speak, are Russian (affordable and incredibly “pleasant to hear”), is waiting for you!  After all, only here an adult becomes a child, and children begin to feel themselves in a fairy tale.  The entertainment center in Adler will not only give you a lot of unforgettable pleasant sensations, but also introduce you to the elements of Russian culture, show the art of ancient artisans in practice and enrich you spiritually.  After all, only here a person begins to understand what it means to have fun and be happy in Russian!  Welcome to Sochi! </p>
