Located near Sakhalin Island, between Asia and Japan.  Washes South and <span>North Korea,</span> Japan and the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Although the reservoir belongs to the ocean basin, it is well isolated from it.  This affects both the salinity of the Sea of ​​Japan and its fauna.  The overall balance of water is regulated thanks to outflows and tributaries carried out through straits.  Almost not involved in water exchange (small contribution: 1%). </p><p>  It is connected with other water bodies and the Pacific Ocean by 4 straits (Tsushima, Soyu, Mamaia, Tsugaru).  <span>The surface area</span> is about 1062 km <sup>2</sup> .  The average depth of the Sea of ​​Japan is 1753 m, the largest - 3742 m. It is difficult to freeze, only its northern part is covered with ice in winter. </p>

    <p>  The hydronym is generally accepted, but disputed by the Korean powers.  They claim that the name, literally, is imposed by the Japanese side on the whole world.  In South Korea, it is called the East Sea, and North uses the name Korea East Sea. </p><p>  The problems of the Sea of ​​Japan are directly related to the environment.  They could be called typical, if not for the fact that several countries wash the pond at once.  They have different policies for the <span>protection of the</span> sea, so the impact on people also varies.  Among the main problems are the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  industrial mining; </li><li>  release of radioactive substances and oil products; </li><li>  oil stains. </li></ul><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  <span>The climate is marine,</span> so warm water and monsoons are a frequent occurrence for this sea.  Frequent precipitation is characteristic of the southeast, with a minimal amount of rainfall in the northwest.  In the autumn season typhoons are often observed.  Waves sometimes reach 10 meters.  The Tatar Strait freezes by 90%.  As a rule, ice lasts about 3-4 months. </p><p>  The temperature of the Sea of ​​Japan varies by several tens of degrees, depending on the area.  North and west are typically -20 <sup></sup> , east and south - +5 <sup></sup> . August has been considered a warm month for several years.  At this time of the year in the north, the temperature reaches +15 <sup></sup> , in the south - +25 <sup></sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salinity of the japanese sea" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1020762.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The salinity of the Sea of ​​Japan and its glaciers </h2><p>  Salinity ranges from 33 to 34 ppm - this is several times lower than in the <span>waters of the World Ocean.</span> </p><p>  The Sea of ​​Japan on glaciation is divided into three parts: </p><ul><li>  Tatar against; </li><li>  Peter the Great Bay; </li><li>  area from the Cape Pivot to Belkin. </li></ul><p>  As already described above, ice is always localized in part of this strait and bay.  In other places, it is practically not formed (if you do not take into account the bays and northwestern waters). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An interesting fact is that initially ice appears in places where fresh water is present in the Sea of ​​Japan, and only then it spreads to other parts of the reservoir. </p><p>  Glaciation in the <span>Tatar Strait</span> lasts about 80 days in the south and 170 days in the north;  in Peter the Great Bay - 120 days. </p><p>  If winter does not differ in severe frosts, then the areas are covered with ice in the beginning and end of November;  if temperature drops to critical levels are observed, then freezing occurs earlier. </p><p>  By February, the formation of the cover ceases.  At this point, the Tatar Strait covers about 50%, and the Gulf of Peter the Great - by 55%. </p><p>  Thawing often begins in March.  The depths of the Sea of ​​Japan contribute to the rapid process of getting rid of ice.  It can begin in late April.  If the temperature is kept low, then thawing begins in early June.  First, parts of Peter the Great Bay “open”, in particular, its open water areas, and the coast of the Golden Cape.  While ice begins to recede in the Tatar Strait, it thaws in its eastern part. </p><h2>  Sea of ​​Japan resources </h2><p>  Human biological resources are used to the maximum extent.  Near the shelf developed fishing.  Valuable species of fish are herring, tuna and sardine.  Squids are caught in the central regions, and salmon are caught in the north and southwest.  An important role is also played by the algae of the Sea of ​​Japan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="depth of the sea of ​​japan" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1020751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The biological resources of the Sea of ​​Japan in different parts have their own characteristic features.  Due to climatic conditions in the north and north-west, nature has moderate characteristics, in the south the faunistic complex prevails.  Near the Far East there are plants and animals inhabited by a warm-water and temperate climate.  Here you can see squid and octopus.  In addition to them, brown algae, sea urchins, stars, shrimps and crabs are found.  Yet the resources of the Sea of ​​Japan squeak from diversity.  Few where you can find red ascidium.  Scallops, ruffles and dogs are common. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="problems of the sea of ​​japan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1020752.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea problems </h2><p>  The main problem is the consumption of sea resources due to the constant fishing of fish and crabs, algae, scallops, sea urchins.  Together with the state flotillas, poaching is booming.  Abuse of prey for fish and shellfish leads to the constant extinction of any species of marine animals. </p><p>  In addition, careless fishing can lead to deaths.  Due to fuels and lubricants, wastewater and petroleum products, fish die, mutate or become contaminated, which poses a great danger to consumers. </p><p>  A few years ago, this problem was overcome through cohesive actions and agreements between the Russian Federation and Japan. </p><p>  Ports of companies, enterprises and settlements are the main source of pollution with water containing chlorine, oil, mercury, nitrogen and other hazardous substances.  Due to the high concentration of these substances, blue-green algae develops.  Because of them, there is a danger of contamination with hydrogen sulfide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sea ​​temperature" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1020760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The tides </h2><p>  Complex tides are characteristic of the Sea of ​​Japan.  Their cyclicality in different areas is significantly different.  The semidiurnal is found near the Korea Strait and near the Tatar.  Daytime tides are inherent in the territories adjacent to the coast of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea and the DPRK, as well as near Hokkaido and Honshu (Japan).  Near the Peter the Great Bay, the tides are mixed. </p><p>  The tide level is low: from 1 to 3 meters.  In some areas, the amplitude varies from 2.2 to 2.7 m. </p><p>  Seasonal fluctuations are also not uncommon.  They are observed most often in the summer;  in winter there are fewer.  The nature of the wind, its strength, also affects the water level.  Why resources of the Sea of ​​Japan are highly dependent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water of the japanese sea" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1020778.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Transparency </h2><p>  Throughout the length of the sea, water has a different color: from blue to blue with a green tint.  As a rule, transparency is maintained at a depth of 10 m. There is a lot of oxygen in the waters of the Sea of ​​Japan, which contributes to the development of resources.  Phytoplankton is more common in the north and west of the reservoir.  On the surface of the water, the oxygen concentration reaches almost 95%, but this figure gradually decreases with depth, and already by 3 thousand meters it is 70%. </p>
