And such investors with different levels of profitability are available to such investors. </p><p>  If you spend time analyzing and checking reliability, you can get a tangible increase in capital in a few months. </p><h2>  What investments are called high-yield </h2><p>  This category includes those investments that bring big profits or increase resources quickly.  High margin, significantly exceeding deposit rates (15%), and is the main difference between high-yield investments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mipuntodevista.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to invest" class="if uuid-2773587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773587.jpg"></div><p>  Investments in projects with high returns are inevitably associated with significant risk.  For this reason, it is important to carefully study specific tools, initially calculating possible losses. </p><p>  In most cases, investors choose among the following options: </p><ul><li>  Mutual funds. </li><li>  OFBU. </li><li>  PAMM Accounts, Forex. </li><li>  Hedge funds. </li><li>  HYIP projects. </li><li>  Cryptocurrency </li><li>  Equal Lending. </li></ul><p>  It is important to understand that only available funds are invested in such projects that the investor is ready to lose without serious consequences. </p><p>  As for risk, it is inevitable, especially when it comes to the rapid growth of capital.  But at the same time, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of losing invested money.  To do this, diversify - distribute your funds.  That is, invest in several promising projects at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is better to invest the bulk of funds in the most stable instruments.  For those who cannot calmly put up with high risks, it makes sense to pay attention to high-yield investments with insurance.  There are companies on the market that provide full or partial compensation services for invested funds. </p><h2>  How to choose projects </h2><p>  Among the many attractive offers you need to be able to highlight the real opportunities for earning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wavecity.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cash investments" class="if uuid-2773617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773617.jpg"></div><p>  In the selection process, you need to pay attention to the following indicators: </p><ul><li>  Features of the offer.  It is important to study the terms of investment, working conditions in the project and other factors affecting the level of earnings. </li><li>  Reliability and availability of technical support.  Feedback is very important as various failures and errors can occur leading to a loss of money.  In such situations, a quick response from the company is very important. </li><li>  Tariff plans.  Any prices and interest promised in a particular project should always be checked for accuracy.  Sometimes, bright offers and attractive numbers hide nuances that negatively affect the final profit.  Unreliable projects often spell out unfavorable deadlines for withdrawing earned funds. </li><li>  Advertising campaigns.  The substantial amounts invested in the promotion of the project and its continuous development indicate the seriousness of the company.  If the advertisement is cheap, illiterate and the project has not been updated for a long time, then you should not risk the money. </li><li>  Website.  It is also an indicator of quality.  You need to pay attention to the uniqueness of the site, the average cost of its design, level of protection, type of hosting and script.  It is also necessary to check the legal and physical address, data of managers and contact numbers. </li><li>  Reputation.  Any project needs to be studied, including through reviews.  There are many websites, blogs and forums that are dedicated to monitoring <span>investment projects.</span>  There you can find all the necessary information. </li></ul><p>  Verification of a specific project requiring investment is a necessary measure to reduce risks.  And if it is a highly profitable investment, then everything needs to be monitored carefully. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to calculate the possible profit </h2><p>  Before starting the process of finding suitable projects, it is important to understand how you can calculate your return on investment.  This skill will quickly determine the relevance of a particular proposal. </p><p>  The calculation itself is better done in percent - it‚Äôs easier to determine the level of effectiveness of the selected tool.  For this purpose, the following formula is used: </p><p>  ROI = (income - cost): the amount of investment x 100%, where ROI is the profitability ratio. </p><p>  This formula is used to evaluate transactions.  If we are talking about ownership of an asset, then we need to use a different calculation scheme: </p><p>  ROI = (income - cost) x period: investment amount x 100%. </p><p>  Such a calculation of investments must be mastered and constantly applied in order to objectively evaluate the real benefits. </p><h2>  Investment in mutual funds </h2><p>  Mutual investment funds at one time became very popular due to the high profits that they brought to investors.  Such profitability was possible thanks to real estate operations and investment in high technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate return on investment" class="if uuid-2773601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773601.jpg"></div><p>  Now, mutual fund managers are also working with various companies.  Good indicators are those funds that invest trusted funds in bonds and precious metals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the goal is to find a reliable mutual fund, then you must initially rely on a moderate percentage of profit.  Such organizations use optimal strategies, which reduces profitability. </p><p>  The average percentage that an investor can count on is 9-14% per month.  Almost two-thirds of existing funds generate 3-4% per month. </p><p>  When choosing a mutual fund, you need to pay attention to the manager: if he works recently, then it is likely that the strategy for using the funds received will be aggressive.  As a result, profitability indicators may turn out to be high due to the labor enthusiasm of staff.  But the risk in this case will also be significant. </p><p>  Thus, a mutual fund can be safely classified as a highly profitable investment.  But a stable result will be possible only with a competent analysis of the tool itself and the potential of the manager. </p><h2>  OFBU </h2><p>  A general banking management fund is a good option for those who are looking for where to invest. </p><p>  Here, as in mutual funds, everything is built on trust.  The bank receives funds from investors, combines them into one fund and invests in securities.  Other tools may be used.  Such activities are regulated by applicable law, but the risk of losing money always remains. </p><p>  To implement different strategies for working with the financial market, a bank can create several funds, each of which will be focused on a specific scheme. </p><p>  The degree of risk and the level of income when investing in OFBU largely depends on the manager.  For this reason, it is important to study the features of the work of funds created by the bank. </p><h2>  PAMM accounts </h2><p>  This highly profitable investment tool has a tangible plus - the ability to limit losses incurred as a result of the manager‚Äôs illiterate activity.  Moreover, the profit margin is not limited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.financemagnates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high-risk, risk-free investment" class="if uuid-2773603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773603.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the investments to materialize, you must carefully select the traders who manage the deposit and distribute the available funds in different accounts. </p><p>  Stable managers, as with other instruments, rarely give high interest rates.  But in the end, the income will be significantly higher than bank rates on deposits. </p><p>  The transactions themselves are carried out on the Forex market.  Compared to the stock exchange, it has a lower level of volatility, but a few successful transactions can give a tangible increase in deposit.  At the same time, the manager is interested in good performance for two reasons: </p><ul><li>  earnings is a percentage of successfully closed transactions; </li><li>  his own funds are used in trade. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, losses to the trader are extremely disadvantageous. </p><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the reliability of the broker, since the possibility of withdrawing funds directly depends on it. </p><p>  In general, the profitability and return on investment when choosing a PAMM-account can be at a high level.  To do this, you need to distribute funds between stable experienced traders and managers with an aggressive trading style. </p><h2>  HYIP projects </h2><p>  The structure of such an investment project actually repeats the scheme of the financial pyramid.  But formally, this tool is positioned as a fund that manages the money of investors. </p><p>  The possibility of high income is explained by the fact that managers trade on the stock and currency exchanges using the funds received. </p><p>  In the vast majority of cases, such projects do not have real offices, detailed reporting and all the necessary documents.  The level of proposed profits can vary from 20% per month to 120% per day.  That is, for several months, some HYIP projects promise to give more than 3000% growth.  But often they close before this deadline. </p><p>  Profit in the vast majority of cases is paid from those funds that were received from new investors. </p><p>  Although the degree of reliability of such instruments is low, they can be included in the list of highly profitable investments.  If you invest in HYIP immediately after its opening and not delay the withdrawal of money, then you can get good income in a short time. </p><p>  But before investing, you need to conduct a competent analysis.  It is necessary to pay attention to several indicators: </p><ul><li>  Interest rate.  The higher it is, the less likely it is to take your money.  But with an adequate percentage, Hype can last even several years, which will make good money. </li><li>  Launch date.  It is important not to pour money into the project if it exists for more than 3-4 months.  Otherwise, the risk of investing in the project at the stage of decline will be very high. </li><li>  Distribution of attachments.  In order not to go broke on HYIP projects, it is important to actively use diversification.  That is, do not invest in one hype more than 10% of available funds.  Therefore, first you need to conduct a competent analysis of the most reliable options and then invest small shares in several of them. </li></ul><p>  You can select several Hyps with an affiliate program.  It will allow you to get additional income by attracting other investors. </p><h2>  Hedge funds </h2><p>  Such a fund has an investment partnership structure.  It is led by a manager - the main partner.  Background capital consists of investor funds. </p><p>  A feature of this tool is a high entry threshold.  Based on current legislation, investors who are able to offer investments from 3 million rubles can participate in hedge funds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wall-street.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most profitable investment" class="if uuid-2773605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773605.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing where to invest, it is worth paying attention to such funds for several reasons: </p><ul><li>  Vast field of investment.  Money can be invested in stock and currency exchanges, land, real estate, etc. </li><li>  Ability to combine with other hedge funds to increase the level of reliability. </li><li>  Implementation of various investment strategies. </li></ul><p>  Such institutions can use many tools to make a profit and change their strategy depending on market conditions.  This makes possible a high percentage of capital growth. </p><h2>  Cryptocurrency </h2><p>  If the goal is to find the most profitable investments, then Bitcoin must be used without fail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="revistas2.uepg.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high yield investments with insurance" class="if uuid-2773607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773607.jpg"></div><p>  Investing in cryptocurrency is worth the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  Stable rate growth. </li><li>  Inflation protection.  Due to the structure of the code, Bitcoin will not depreciate. </li><li>  Independence from governments, banks and other external structures. </li><li>  Great liquidity.  Bitcoin can be exchanged for many goods and services. </li><li>  Popularity.  Many investors have already invested in cryptocurrency and its capitalization continues to grow. </li></ul><p>  In addition to acquiring coins, you can <span>invest in</span> mining and generate bitcoins. </p><p>  A source of high income may be investing in blockchain-based startups.  There are many similar projects, and there is plenty to choose from.  As a result, such a direction as working with cryptocurrency and blockchain makes it possible to earn high profits from several sources.  It is profitable and safe. </p><h2>  Equal Lending </h2><p>  Investing in P2P sites can bring good returns.  We are talking about <span>lending to small and medium-sized businesses</span> at a percentage favorable to the investor.  Sometimes this figure is 120% per annum. </p><p>  The lending process can be carried out using the online platforms where the investor and the borrower meet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.startlr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="profitability and return on investment" class="if uuid-2773620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32106/2773620.jpg"></div><p>  Equitable lending as a tool for increasing capital has 3 tangible advantages: </p><ol><li>  It does not require the personal participation of an investor.  All that is needed is to provide your funds, the specialists responsible for the P2P site will take care of the rest. </li><li>  Legal and transparent.  Reporting and all necessary documents are in the personal account of the investor. </li><li>  Moderate risks.  The solvency of companies acting as borrowers is always checked. </li></ol><p>  In addition to this tool, you can use microcredit, which is also a popular way to make high profits. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Highly profitable investments include many tools to increase capital.  And each of them requires careful study and analysis. </p><p>  If you thoroughly approach the search for a company and a manager, then a significant profit in a short time will be a real challenge. </p>
