    <p>  Yagoda, Yezhov, Uborevich, Tukhachevsky, Blucher, Bukharin, Kamenev, Radek and many others were extinct in this way from books and from memory.  But the most demonized figure of the Bolshevik party was, without a doubt, <span>Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich.</span>  His biography was supplemented by work for British intelligence, which, of course, was not true, otherwise MI-6 would have proudly recalled its success today. </p><p>  In fact, Beria was the most ordinary Bolshevik, no worse than others.  He was born in 1899 into a peasant family, and from childhood he was drawn to knowledge.  At the age of sixteen, having graduated with honors from Sukhumi elementary school, he expressed a desire to continue his education at the Secondary Mechanical and Technical Construction School, where he received an architect‚Äôs diploma.  A year later, he entered the Baku Polytechnic, where he also joined the underground work.  He was deported, but not far, to Azerbaijan. </p>

    <p>  Thus, at the top of the social democratic underground there were few such intelligent people as <span>Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich.</span>  Biography after the revolution demonstrates his desire to control the situation.  He is engaged in secret operational affairs, and over time, having squeezed Redens (son-in-law of Stalin himself), he occupies the post of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  Not without the knowledge, of course, of the secretary himself, who believed that business qualities were more important than the closest <span>family ties.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having successfully done away with the Mensheviks and other enemies of the Soviet regime, Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich, whose biography could not stall at this post due to his active character, covered Stalin with his chest during a shooting on Lake Ritsa, which was unclear to anyone and why. </p><p>  Such a readiness for self-sacrifice was appreciated, but the main factor in <span>career growth</span> was not she, but really outstanding organizational skills and amazing performance.  Deputy Yezhov, who soon took his place, a candidate for membership in the Politburo - these steps of the career ladder were completed in 1938. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that the main executioner of Stalin was Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich, his biography, however, refutes this.  He led the affairs of state security for a very short time (until 1941).  The chairman of the Council of People's Commissars is much higher than just the chief security officer.  His attention is focused on the entire defense industry of the USSR during the war years, including the creation of nuclear weapons, which he was in charge of since 1943. </p><p>  A special article for the conversation is Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich and women.  The wife of Stalin‚Äôs closest ally, the beautiful Nino, took all the allegations about his amorous mania‚Äôs habits with great skepticism.  She knew her husband‚Äôs <span>work schedule</span> , he didn‚Äôt have enough time to even sleep.  He had a mistress, very young, but she testified that Beria had committed violence against her under the pressure of the investigation.  In fact, the girl got an apartment on Gorky Street in Moscow, and her mother even treated her teeth in the Kremlin hospital.  So everything was exclusively on a voluntary basis. </p><p>  Much has been written about a bold conspiracy in which Beria Lavrenty Pavlovich was arrested and soon executed (or killed).  His photo was just as quickly extinct from all the textbooks as the images of previous enemies of the people exposed.  The projects of the economic and political reforms that he proposed, in particular, the limited introduction of private property and the <span>unification of Germany,</span> were later implemented during the Gorbachev perestroika. </p>
