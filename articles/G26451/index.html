    <p>  Travel agencies offering tours to Russian residents in Turkey, Alara Star Hotel 5 * characterize as a hotel with an excellent combination of price and quality.  Immediately, we note that the majority of vacationers who have been here completely agree with this assessment and were quite satisfied with their choice of a place to stay, and are also ready to recommend this hotel to their friends and relatives.  But we learn about everything in more detail. </p><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, almost all tourists were satisfied with the rooms offered to them.  So, according to them, since the hotel is not new, you will not find modern furniture and appliances here.  However, everything is in good and working condition.  If something failed, then, according to our compatriots, after contacting the reception, the breakdown was eliminated as soon as possible.  The rooms themselves are quite spacious, with furnished balconies and freshly renovated.  True, some guests complained that the apartment is a bit dark.  However, this did not become a problem, since most tourists came to their rooms only to change clothes or in the evening before going to bed. </p><p>  According to travelers, all rooms at Alara Star Hotel 5 * (Turkey) have safes that can be used on a free basis, and minibars, where two half-liter bottles of water are reported every day.  As for cleaning, then, as our compatriots say, it was carried out every day.  The maids renewed towels and bedding a couple of times a week.  By the way, as for beach towels, they can be exchanged every three days in a hammam. </p><h2>  Own territory </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, Alara Hotels Star 5 * occupies a small territory.  So, there is only a swimming pool with a sun terrace and a bar, as well as an amphitheater.  However, no crowds, as noted by the guests, are not observed.  The territory itself seemed to tourists very well-groomed, beautiful and green.  Next door are two hotels of the same chain as Alara Star.  So guests can freely enter the territory of all hotels and use the entire infrastructure, with the exception of restaurants and housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alara star hotel 5 alanya" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1021873.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  As our compatriots note in their reviews, in most cases Alara Hotels Star 5 * adhere to internal rules stating that new arrivals can only enter their rooms after two in the afternoon.  However, this mainly concerns the height of the holiday season.  If you are on vacation in September or October, then even with an early check in you will most likely be settled almost immediately.  But, according to some travelers, they managed to resolve this issue even in July and August, paying the administrator for the early check-in service.  In most cases, a free room with a good view was for them almost immediately, even if before that they assured the reception that all apartments were occupied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours alara star hotel 5" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1021872.jpg" width="500"></div>
