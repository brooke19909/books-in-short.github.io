    <p>  At the beginning of the eighteenth century on this territory were the <span>Summer Gardens,</span> broken up under Peter, and later, in the 1745th, a summer residence was erected here for Pavel's cousin - Elizaveta Petrovna, within whose walls the future Russian emperor was born. </p><p>  The monarch always remembered his happy childhood spent here with warmth.  And once he said that he wanted to die in the place where he was born. </p><p>  The engineering castle designed by Bazhenov was built for a long twelve years, immediately after Paul ascended to the throne.  The dilapidated summer residence was demolished, and in 1797 they began to build the Mikhailovsky Palace. </p><p>  The emperor was in such a hurry to finish the construction that for the sake of laying the bookmark for the day, he mourned Catherine II and Peter III. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ghost in Engineering Castle" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/218494.jpg" width="370"></div>

The architecture of medieval buildings has always attracted him.  Therefore, Paul‚Äôs decree called his other residences ‚Äúcastles‚Äù, both urban and suburban: Zimny, Tsarskoye Selo, etc. </p><p>  To complete the work as soon as possible, building materials from all other large construction projects were delivered to Mikhailovsky or Engineering Castle: decorative stone, columns, sculptures were brought from the Academy of Arts and Tsarskoye Selo, a frieze placed above the main gate from St. Isaac's Cathedral, parquet from the <span>Tauride Palace.</span> </p><p>  The main entrance to the palace was radically transformed.  The approaches to the building began from Italianskaya Street, passed through a semicircular triple gate, the middle passage of which was intended only for the royal family. </p>

The engineering castle, whose photo is striking not only with the monumentality of the structure, but also with its chic interior decoration, combines a variety of interiors from malachite, marble, jasper and lapis lazuli with wooden carved elements, amazing sculpting, velvet upholstery trimmed with silver, with works of the most famous artists.

    <p>  Mikhailovsky Palace has always been full of mysteries and legends.  They say that on the day the castle was consecrated, the golden-haired young man came to the sentry of the imperial army, who ordered something to be transferred to the emperor.  Immediately after the murder of Paul, the imperial family left the palace.  However, for another year his ghost in the Engineering Castle frightened the employees of the Court Office, who moved here. </p>
