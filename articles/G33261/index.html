And you can’t say this at once, since the components of this town are interconnected by an underground tunnel.  So, let's understand what the "Village of Sunshine" is (this is the translation of the name of the complex).  It was built in the early nineties for leisure tourists with children from Western Europe.  And now, in the main hotel, eighty percent of the tourists are Germans.  Until the beginning of the two thousand and twelfth year, the hotel was called the Liktos Hotel.  Then it was acquired by the Sunshine Vocational Clubs network.  Caution should be taken immediately from confusion.  In Crete there is another hotel with a similar name.  And he has the same stardom.  It is called Sunshine Hotel Village Hersonissos 4 * and belongs to another network - "Best Western".  This hotel is located, as the name suggests, not far from the town of Hersonissos.  And the hotel complex described here is located eight kilometers from Ierapetra.  It is the southernmost city in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Calimera Sunshine Village 4" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location Sunshine Crete Village 4 * </h2><p>  Near the complex is the small Cretan village of Kuttsunari.  The main hotel of the complex, which is called the Kalimera Club, is located on the front page of the sea.  Across the road and on a hill, seven hundred meters from the beach, is the "Additional" hotel.  It is called - Sunshine Crete Village Annex 4 *.  There are two international airports on Crete.  From Heraklion to the hotel complex - about 100 km.  Chania International Airport is even further - two hundred and fifty kilometers.  But getting to the hotel on your own is not a problem.  The island has a well-developed bus service.  A stop is only a hundred meters from the entrance to the main hotel.  Free shuttle buses run between the hotels of the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine village 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512223.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its large hull is on the first line of the beach.  But guests of the Annex are not offended by fate.  On the territory of this hotel you can immediately see why the whole complex was called the "village" - the village.  After all, this hotel consists of seven two and three-story cottages.  Like Hersonissos Sunshine Village 4 *, "Annex" stands on a hill, far from the sea (about eight hundred meters).  But, unlike the guests in Hersonissos, Annex 4 * guests can come to the beach on a free bus, which runs between parts of the complex very often.  Want to walk?  Nothing is simpler: an underpass has been laid under a busy road.  In addition, residents of Annexa can use the entire infrastructure of the coastal hotel: <span>a la carte restaurants,</span> bars, pools.  On the hill you can only sleep.  The territory of the complex in total is simply huge.  Reviews say that it resembles a Mediterranean fairy tale.  Particularly beautiful panoramic views open from the "additional" hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Village 4 Crete" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  In the complex Sunshine Village 4 * a total of three hundred twenty-six rooms.  Most of them are located in a coastal hotel.  All of them belong to the same category - “standard”.  But there are double rooms and a family room.  The latter are designed to accommodate families and consist of two bedrooms.  Some “family rooms” have a sliding door between the rooms and on TV in each room.  In the main hotel building, rooms have balconies overlooking either the sea or the garden.  In the “Additional” hotel, guests are also offered to choose between a double “standard” and a “family room”.  But they can choose where to live: in the building or in one of the fifteen bungalows.  The filling of rooms is almost the same for everyone.  Air conditioning with individual remote control will help regulate the temperature in the bedroom.  There is also a plasma-screen TV (there are also Russian-language channels), a telephone.  Bathrooms include showers and hair dryers.  Cleaning maids carry out daily, put hygiene items, change towels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Crete Village 4" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1512299.jpg" width="600"></div>

Meals are on schedule, but reviews say you can eat almost around the clock.  Early breakfast smoothly turns into late breakfast, and there is already lunch, followed by an afternoon snack, etc. In both hotels there are main restaurants, where meals are served in buffet style.  In “Kalimer Club” it is “Dionissos”, and in “Sunshine Village Annex” - “Minos”.  In terms of food in the main restaurants, the complex has a simple rule.  Annexa guests should have breakfast and dinner at their Minos and lunch on the beach at Dionissos.  The hotel on the hill during the day serves only light snacks from half past three to four and tea with sweets from five to six.  Dionissos has a children's buffet.  There are several a la carte restaurants in the hotel complex.  A single visit to each of them is free for the guest, subject to prior reservation of the table.  These are themed restaurants of Italian ("Mamma Mia") and Greek (tavern "Zorbas") cuisine.  Enough in the complex and bars.  They offer an unlimited amount of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks of Greek origin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Village Hotel 4" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512235.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  All tourists agree that in both hotels Sunshine Village 4 * feed excellently.  Especially vacationers liked the dinners.  Every day they are thematic, dedicated to the culinary features of a country or region.  Tourists claim that in two weeks not a single dinner was repeated.  Guests were pleased with the quality of alcoholic cocktails, delicious pastries, lots of fruits and vegetables.  Each main restaurant has a corner of Greek cuisine, where you can taste Cretan delicacies.  Ladies liked the five-hour tea party tradition.  But, reviews say, there are too few bars in the Annex.  All infrastructure is concentrated in the main hotel of the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Crete Village Annex 4" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512232.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Despite the fact that both hotels of the Sunshine Village Hotel 4 * complex have the same stardom, the price difference between them is about fifteen euros per night.  Club Kalimera is a more expensive hotel, which is logical: it stands on the front page, and it takes about three minutes to go to the sea from the building.  The guests of the “Annexa” have to either go down to the beach through the underpass or ride a minivan to it.  Cars ply often, but not as vacationers would like.  As for the beach, there are no differences of opinion and cannot be.  Pebbles are faithful, volcanic, smooth and shiny like monpassier.  Sunset at sea is very good, the lagoon is protected from winds and storms.  On the private beach of the complex, sunbeds and umbrellas are free.  But towels charge a deposit of ten euros.  Both hotels have their own pools.  Based on the fact that in the daytime all activity is transferred to the Kalimera Sunshine Club, there are more swimming tanks.  There is a swimming pool in the seaside hotel for adults, and for relaxation, and two small "paddling pools" for children.  All of them are filled with fresh water.  One of the children's pools has slides. </p><h2>  Hotel complex infrastructure </h2><p>  The "additional" hotel is designed for a measured and relaxing holiday.  There is no animation, in the evenings it is very quiet.  All active life is concentrated in <span>Club Calimera Sunshine</span> Village 4 *.  There you will have <span>Greek dance</span> lessons <span>,</span> and aqua aerobics in the pool, and tennis courts, and a disco.  Business meetings are often held at the Annex, for which the hotel has six conference rooms of various capacities.  This hotel offers free access to a sauna and a jacuzzi, while a massage parlor and beauty center are available at an additional cost.  Internet access is present, but only in public places.  And it costs a lot of money: five euros for an hour and a half.  A lot of attention in Kalimera Sunshine Village is given to sports.  The entire complex offers tennis courts, an outdoor gym, a playground and equipment for playing boccia, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunshine Hotel Village Hersonissos 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1512245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists liked the rest in the complex Sunshine Village 4 *.  Spacious rooms with beautiful views (especially in the bungalow in Annex), comfortable furniture and good plumbing ensured comfortable accommodation.  A very beautiful beach with pebbles was liked by everyone, without exception.  A lot of praise was devoted to nutrition.  Tourists especially recommended visiting the Greek a la carte tavern.  In addition to delicious dishes, it has a special atmosphere of the Cretan holiday. </p>
