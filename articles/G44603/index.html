  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State tax policy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any tax policy of the state implies that every citizen of the country should be honest with his homeland and his compatriots.  No matter how much you earn, you still have to pay a certain percentage to the state treasury. </p><p>  Russia's tax policy is based on the fact that pensioners, students and <span>government employees</span> receive their money from what businessmen and their private workers contribute to the country's budget.  When they, in turn, reach retirement age, they will be credited with financial assistance already from the pockets of the youth, who at that time will only begin to earn money. </p><p>  Thus, the tax system of this state is based on humanity and democracy.  Every citizen understands that the money that he gives monthly to the state treasury will not be returned to him after some time, but rather will be given to people unfamiliar to him.  Nevertheless, we continue to perform these actions, thinking that in the future, other people will themselves provide pension payments.  The state in this cycle of money acts only as an intermediary, receiving a certain percentage for its services.  The proceeds can be allocated for the development of other areas of the country. </p><p>  Many do not particularly like the tax policy of the state.  This mainly concerns businessmen who receive huge income.  Of course, the more earnings, the greater the amount that will subsequently need to be paid to the state: for example, owners of large companies often have to pay taxes that can cover a significant part of the monthly expenses of the entire state.  Naturally, large businessmen are asking themselves - is all their money subsequently spent for the benefit of the population, or does a certain part of it go into the pockets of government officials? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, these people understand that the <span>taxes and taxation</span> that concern them are substantial, and pensions in our country are not particularly impressive.  Thus, many businessmen, having estimated the balance of what they give each month and what they will receive in old age, are far from enthusiastic about the need to pay taxes. </p><p>  Based on this, it can be assumed that the tax policy of the state at the moment is not functioning correctly.  It turns out that those people who have earned a lot of money on their own and those who have only been registered at work all their lives will receive almost the same pensions.  In addition, during their youth, they will have to <span>pay</span> completely different amounts <span>to the pension fund</span> . </p><p>  Now, in principle, one can at least partially understand those entrepreneurs who have truly acquired their huge capital by legal means and who do not want to pay a large amount of taxes every month.  Those same businessmen who have broken the law many times to achieve financial independence, and even hide their income from the state, do not cause sympathy at all. </p><p>  The conclusion to this article may be the idea that the tax policy of the state has long required significant changes in its field, since for many segments of the population it is completely unfair.  After all, it is very important that people trust their leaders, and absolutely all sectors of society equally understand that the taxes and taxation that exist in the country, as well as the money that you have to pay to the state treasury, do comply with the laws.  In addition, it is possible to make the pension accrued depending on the average person's payments for the entire period of his work.  Perhaps this will be true in relation to all citizens of the state. </p>
