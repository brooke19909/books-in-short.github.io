Deposits is the main product offered by him.  But the organization is also engaged in the manufacture of plastic cards, consumer loans, deposits, currency exchange transactions, Unistream money transfers, etc.  Uniastrum currently ranks 63rd out of 600 in the ranking of Russian banks.  The amount of its assets is more than 108 billion rubles.  But what I would like to talk about in more detail is the contribution. </p>

    <h2>  "Perspective" </h2><p>  This is the name of the tariff from which I would like to start.  You can open it in rubles, dollars and euros - for 91, 181, 271 and 370 days.  Minimum need to invest 10 000 r.  Or 150 $ / €.  The maximum is not limited.  Interest is accrued at the end of each month or at the end of the term (all at once).  Another depositor can choose where they will come to him - to the current account or to the card.  It is better to immediately put a large amount, since the replenishment function is not provided. </p><p>  So, what percent can Uniastrum Bank offer?  Deposits under the “Perspective” tariff are very profitable.  It is best to make a short-term investment - for 91 days, and in rubles.  Then the rate will be 8.75% per annum.  If, for example, you invest 1,000,000 r, then after 91 days the client will receive 21,875 rubles of profit.  In dollars, the most profitable period is 370 days.  As in the euro.  The rate is 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Universal" </h2><p>  This is another advantageous tariff offered by Uniastrum Bank.  Deposits "Jubilee", "Affordable" and "Large percentage", which need to be extended, often serve as the basis for the opening of the "Universal".  The term is 91, 181, 271 days and exactly 1 year.  The amount may be from 20 TR  up to 20 million rubles.  Or from $ 1,000 to $ 500,000.  If you want to make investments in euros, then the range will be the same.  Replenishment, by the way, is provided.  But only within the maximum amount. </p><p>  For ruble deposits, the most profitable interest is again set for a 91-day period - 8.25% per annum.  If you want to make an investment in dollars or euros, then you need to draw up everything for a year.  Rates are 1.5% and 1.3% per annum, respectively.  Interest is transferred to the account every month. </p>

    <h2>  "Progress" </h2><p>  Another tariff offered by Uniastrum Bank to its customers.  Deposits of this type are also accepted in rubles, dollars and euros - for terms similar to the above.  The minimum amount is 10,000 rubles, and the maximum is not limited.  Interest is accrued on the first day of each new month and at the end of the term.  If this option does not suit you, you can ask to pay a one-time profit - at the very end. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Top-ups are provided.  There are no time limits.  But replenishment of the account should be carried out at least 1000 rubles.  If a person “forgot” that he has a contribution, then he is automatically extended for the same period for which he was open. </p><p>  Interest is slightly lower than in the previously mentioned cases.  Uniastrum Bank offers different deposits - all of them have their own advantages, which are accompanied by certain nuances.  In this case, this is just the rate.  7.75% per annum for ruble deposits for a period of 91 days.  If you open it for 370 days, then the interest will decrease to the level of 7%. </p>

    <h2>  "Independence" </h2><p>  It is worth saying a few words about this tariff offered by Uniastrum Bank.  Contributions have their own characteristics, and “Independent” is no exception.  In his name, in fact, lies what distinguishes him from the rest.  But first, general information. </p><p>  It opens only for 370 days, with a minimum amount of 10,000 rubles and an unlimited maximum.  Interest payments - monthly, to the card.  They are also included in the deposit amount (capitalized).  Replenishment is possible, in addition, there are no restrictions on the frequency and amount (the exception is the last 30 days of the term).  But a person should at least put 1000 rubles into the account “from above”. </p><p>  Possible withdrawal of the contribution.  There are no restrictions on the frequency.  The most important thing is that the minimum deposit amount is kept on the account.  Prolongation is automatic, for 370 days.  The rate is 7.25% per annum (rubles), 1% (dollars) and 0.8% (euros). </p>

    <h2>  "Anniversary" </h2><p>  And such a tariff is offered by this organization.  The “Jubilee” deposit “Uniastrum-Bank” made very profitable.  9.5% per annum upon opening for a year!  The amount can vary from 20,000 (this is the minimum) to 20,000,000 rubles.  Interest is accrued monthly.  Moreover, their capitalization is taking place.  Which is very good.  For example, if a person invested a maximum (20 million), then every month 158,333 rubles will be added to his contribution. </p><p>  Replenishment, by the way, is provided.  But within the declared maximum.  Also, it will not work to replenish the deposit in the last 60 days of the term. </p><p>  Withdrawal of part of the amount is possible.  The main thing is that the account maintains the established minimum (20 000 r).  And early termination of the contract is also provided.  But if such a need arose, a person would lose a considerable amount.  This refers to interest.  Instead of paying 9.5% per annum, he will receive only 6.33%. </p><p>  If we compare deposits at Uniastrum Bank for individuals, then Yubileiny will in all fairness be the best and most convenient in terms of conditions. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing </h2><p>  It is important to note the fact that the Uniastrum organization participates in the system of compulsory deposit insurance, which cannot but arouse trust. </p><p>  To open a contribution, you need to prepare some documents.  You will need the original and a copy of the passport.  Also, instead of him, you can present a civilian "foreign".  Or a sailor’s passport who is.  A military card or employee identification card is also suitable. </p><p>  In addition, you will need a copy of the TIN certificate, which must be certified in advance by a notary.  But you can do without it, and simply present the original with it. </p><p>  Self-interested contribution can be opened by anyone who is 14 years old.  But with the presentation of all of the above documents.  And, by the way, the number of deposits opened by a person is not limited.  There can be any number of them.  You can verify this by contacting Uniastrum Bank. </p><p>  Feedback on deposits is mostly positive.  The interest rate does not change throughout the term, payments are not delayed, the conditions are transparent.  When opening a deposit, even citizenship and registration do not matter: everything is for the comfort of customers.  And this is the main reason for trust. </p>
