They like to represent themselves as responsible adults with professional responsibilities.  Of course, interest in the process of such a game quickly decreases, if all actions are carried out only with imaginary objects.  Children's Railway (Tyumen), the price of which we, adults, can afford, is a real gift for the baby.  Here, in fact, everything happens for real!

    <p>  <strong>Children's Railway Tyumen.</strong>  <strong>History of creation</strong> </p><p>  At the end of the 60s, a children's railway was created near the village of Borovsky in the Tyumen region.  Its creator was Nikolai Georgievich Glotov, who worked at the Sverdlovsk railway.  After leaving the post of chief in connection with a change in his state of health, he took up the implementation of an interesting project - a railway line where children work.  From the very beginning, all professional duties here were performed by adolescents.  Branded clothing was made for them.  Cashier, guide and even workers and engine drivers - all the posts here are carried out by children!  Surprisingly, diesel locomotives on this road are completely real.  At first, TU2 diesel locomotives were used here.  Later - TU2-142, TU2-143. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In June 1988, a children's railway was created in the Crimea, and one of the diesel locomotives was transferred to this new transport facility.  Unfortunately, the railway in Yevpatoriya, where children could try themselves as professional workers, did not work long - its history ended in the early 1990s.  The Tyumen children's road also stopped working in 1996, but it did not completely liquidate, and its functioning was restored.  In July 2009, 40 season was opened at this facility.  By this time, the children's railway was modernized.  Traffic safety has been improved.  The track, station building and wagons were repaired at the expense of the Tyumen branch of the <span>Sverdlovsk railway.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Children's Railway Tyumen.</strong>  <strong>How does she work?</strong> </p><p>  Little kids really like what their smiling guides meet.  It is these positive emotions that the children's railway (Tyumen) guarantees, the schedule of which depends on the time of year, and you can see it on its official website. </p><p>  The trip lasts 45 minutes.  During this time, the train manages to overcome the path to the final destination (Priozernaya station) and back.  The cars are very beautiful, and the seats are comfortable.  It‚Äôs no doubt interesting to look at how trees, bushes, paths ‚Äúmove‚Äù outside the window.  Vivid impressions of such a trip remain for a long time! </p>

    <p>  Before you go with the child to the children's railway, you should call the instructor and reserve a place.  In this regard, an appropriate entry should be made in the application journal.  Otherwise, it may turn out that there will be no free places, and the child will be very offended that you can‚Äôt ride. </p><p>  On weekends, Yunost station does not accept passengers, so the trip is possible only on weekdays.  In total, during the work days, the train on such a road carries out 4 flights. </p><p>  When children with interest in practice learn to do adult work, this is wonderful!  And the kids, when visiting such a road, have a desire to also become an employee here and ride other kids on a real diesel locomotive! </p>
