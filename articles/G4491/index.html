It adjoins the river, which makes it even more popular in the summer.  The park is located in the very center of the city.  On the territory it is huge - there is where to roam.  In its southern part, Gorky Park passes into the Neskuchny Garden.  There are ponds on the territory of TsPKiO, but its main advantage is its proximity to the Moscow River.  On it during the navigation period cruise ships, sightseeing boats and floating yacht restaurants ply.  Therefore, for many tourists who have arrived at Gorky Park, the pier is the main attraction.  How to find him in the vast green zone?  How to get closer by car or public transport?  This will tell our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bitter Park mooring" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183108.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The past and present of Gorky Park </h2><p>  CPKiO was defeated in 1928.  He occupied an area of ​​one hundred hectares.  But he did not appear out of nowhere.  Even before the revolution, it was a vast green zone - a meadow reserved for grazing horses from the imperial stables.  Therefore, rich people began to settle near it, because the air in this area was fresh.  Beautiful villas with park gazebos ennobled the landscape.  The <span>embankment of the Moscow River</span> was not forgotten <span>.</span>  In the summer, there were indoor swimming pools.  After the revolution, this meadow was the first VDNH.  But then the exhibition was moved, and the park was intended, as its name says, for culture and recreation.  Since various competitions were held in it, including water sports, the need arose to equip the pier.  Gorky Park was built mainly by the hands of ordinary Muscovites, on subbotniks.  At first, the pier was a simple wooden platform.  Pleasure boats moored to it, competitions in rowing were held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pushkinskaya embankment pier Gorky Park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183110.jpg"></div>

And when <span>the Gorky Park was</span> going through its golden age, from 1935 to 1939, the embankment of the Moskva River in this place was also landscaped.  The marina was complemented by a pontoon made of wood, metal and stone.  And in 2008, a major reconstruction of the Gorky Park pier was carried out.  The boards were coated with special varnish, laid out beautiful paving stones.  The marina is now wonderfully lit.  Near the shore runs a bike path.  There is also a summer bar with a rain canopy.  This marina is one of the longest in the capital.  Four or five large motor ships can moor here at the same time.  But there are no cash desks selling tickets for them on the pier and next to it.  In the stalls that stand on the promenade, you can rent bicycles and other similar vehicles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wharf Radisson Park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183112.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  activity </h2><p>  All year round, despite the severity of the Russian winter, the movement of ships from the Gorky Park berth does not stop.  The Radisson Royal has a flotilla that easily crosses the ice.  Yacht-restaurants of this company drive guests every day, seven days a week.  During the navigation period they are joined by cruise ships and excursion boats of the Central Moscow promenade line.  Annually, approximately in the second week of July, the Marina TsPKiO becomes the venue for the Yacht Festival.  At this time, many owners of such ships come to Moscow, as well as those who plan to become them.  The wooden covering of the pier is great for dancing.  And in the summer, such cultural events are organized there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorky park pier how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2183107.jpg"></div>

The pier has several names.  It is called differently.  Sometimes they say “TsPKiO”, sometimes “Culture Park”, but most often - “Gorky Park”.  The pier address - Pushkinskaya embankment - is misleading to many.  The fact is that nearby, a little closer to the Sparrow Hills, is another marina.  And its official name is “Pushkin Embankment”. </p><p>  The Gorky Park pier is located downstream of the river.  To be precise, this marina belongs rather to the Neskuchny Garden than to the Central Park and Garden.  The nearest metro station is Oktyabrskaya.  It can be reached by the Koltsevaya or Kaluga-Riga lines.  The journey from the metro station to the pier will take a quarter of an hour.  You need to go along <span>Krymsky Val</span> Street to the entrance to the park and move towards the river. </p><p>  There is a second opportunity to get the subway to the pier "Park of Culture named.  Gorky. "  To do this, go to the metro station of the same name.  Also near the entrance to the Central Park of Culture and Culture are Shabolovskaya and Frunzenskaya. </p><h2>  How to get to the pier by land </h2><p>  You won’t be able to drive a car right to the pier - it’s a strictly pedestrian zone of the park.  But in front of the main entrance to the CPKiO there is a large parking lot.  On holidays and weekends, it is free.  You can leave your car on the opposite side of the river, on Frunzenskaya embankment, and calmly walk to the pier along the pedestrian Andreevsky (Pushkinsky) or Krymsky bridge. </p><p>  How to get to the Gorky Park pier by public transport?  The closest trolleybus stop number 10 and "B" is called "TsPKiO".  Also, there are several bus routes.  Numbers 196, 144.111 and M1 make a stop on Akademik Petrovsky Street.  Trolleybuses No. 4 and 7 also land passengers there. Bus No. T79 runs to 1st Frunze Street (on the opposite bank of the river). </p>
