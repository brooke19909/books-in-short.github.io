    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The route along these natural wonders is located in a green forest, where many rare plants grow - boxwood, laurel cherry.  The river is constantly changing throughout the way and can be either perfectly straight or curl at right angles.  The bed itself is made up of stony reaches, as well as rocky shores.  But its main feature is Zmeykovsky waterfalls. </p><p>  Sochi is a city located on the Black Sea coast, so many vacationers come here every year.  Travel companies strongly recommend visiting waterfalls, offering interesting excursions.  It‚Äôs worth noting right away that you don‚Äôt need to have special training. </p><p>  The first waterfall has two cascades about 30 m high. The second within about 9 m. Behind it, the river turns and flows through a rocky gutter, where it passes into the third cascade waterfall.  Under the fourth is a small bowl where numerous visitors like to swim.  This place ends the official tourist route, but no one will stop you from going further and finding a quiet place for a picnic, relaxing or walking through the woods.  At the disposal of tourists the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Host. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Zmeykovsky waterfalls</span> have one feature - numerous springs.  Thanks to them, the river is fueled, and water cascades never dry up.  It is worth mentioning that at the end of the route there is a natural key with very clean water, which you can pour into bottles and drink right there. </p><p>  Throughout the journey, you can find small pavilions and cafes where they offer refreshments and continue their journey through the waterfalls.  And, of course, no one forbids to go off the trail and wander through the woods far from groups of tourists, have a picnic or photograph the views of the surroundings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zmeykovsky waterfalls Sochi how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140085.jpg" width="600"></div>
