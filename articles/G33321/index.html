    <h2>  Does a tourist need a metro for sightseeing in Munich? </h2><p>  <span>The capital of Bavaria</span> is huge in size.  But most of the attractions are concentrated in Altstadt - and the <span>historical center of Dusseldorf</span> .  This is Munich as it was when it was surrounded by ramparts.  Therefore, there is no need to rent a car for sightseeing in Altstadt.  Parking is paid, and expensive.  The old city is declared a car-free zone.  Therefore, its sights will have to be examined on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In size, the old Munich - the city (its attractions are mainly built in the Baroque style) is small.  From time to time, reinforced by Bavarian beer, it can be inspected in a few hours.  It is enough to arrive at the Marienplatz metro station (third and sixth lines). </p><p>  Maria Square is the heart of Munich.  All tourist groups start exploring the city from Marienplatz.  In general, to explore Altstadt you do not need to go down the subway.  All attractions are within walking distance.  But here the museums of Munich are taken outside the historical center.  Three world-famous pinakothek, glyptotek and other interesting collections of collections are compactly located in the district of Maxforstadt.  You can also get to him by bus number 1000 - the Museum Line, but the subway will be faster. </p>

    <h2>  What you need to know about Munich public transport </h2><p>  In the city, in addition to the underground metro, which is designated as “U-Bann” (U-Bahn), there are also ground trains “Es-Bann” (S-Bahn), as well as buses and trams that are familiar to everyone.  It is noteworthy that for all types of public transport a single ticket is valid.  This is very convenient, because it makes it possible to change trains from the Munich metro, the scheme of which covers the entire territory of the city, by tram, bus or Es Bann. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All transport runs with purely German punctuality, minute per minute, as the schedule indicates.  The metro runs from four in the morning, and ends at one in the morning on weekdays (at 02:00 on weekends and holidays).  And immediately after that night buses and trams go on the route.  So you can move around the city by public transport at any time of the day, ignoring the expensive taxi.  But it is important to know some features of such movement. </p>

    <h2>  Munich metro areas </h2><p>  At each public transport ticket vending machine, at any subway station or stop, you can see a diagram of the city on which four circles are superimposed.  In the center, the color of the disk is white, a little further - green, then comes the yellow rim and, finally, red.  These colors indicate zones.  Moving between them affects the fare. </p><p>  <span>Munich Metro</span> also falls under zoning.  Drive two stations on the subway or four stops by tram or bus will cost 1 euro and 40 cents.  But the ticket is valid for an hour.  You can’t go back and forth on one coupon, you have to buy another ticket.  To move around the white zone ("Innerraum"), one tariff applies.  If you cross two, three or go to the distant suburbs of Munich - it’s completely different.  Violation of these rules faces a fine of 40 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What ticket to buy if traveling in a group </h2><p>  The fare is also affected by how many people travel together.  This is German know-how, it operates both on <span>German railways</span> and in the Munich metro.  The scheme is quite simple: the more people in the group, the cheaper the fare for one passenger.  Such group tickets are called “Partner-Tageskart” (for one day) and “Partner-City-Tour-Card” (can be for 1 or three days).  The last option provides an opportunity not only to travel by public transport, but also to receive discounts on visits to more than sixty Munich attractions. </p><p>  However, the number of partners in such a group should not exceed five people.  The ticket for the day is valid not twenty-four hours, but from the moment of composting until six in the morning of the next day.  The cost of Partner Tagescart varies depending on the coverage of the zones: moving inside one (Innerraum) will cost 11 euros and 70 cents, 14.80 € for Ausenraum, 22.30 Є for the whole city. </p><p>  There is also such an option for traveling company - a group ticket for three days.  But it is valid only for the inner (white) area of ​​Munich.  Such a ticket costs 27 euros and 10 cents. </p>

    <h2>  How to move around the city to a lone traveler? </h2><p>  The Germans are actively using discounts provided for groups.  On social networks, they are looking for travel companions and go on excursions.  In our case, this is not always possible.  What to do for a lone tourist, what kind of tickets should he buy?  Munich Metro is a special system. </p><p>  It should be noted that about 90% of the city's attractions are located in the inner zone.  Therefore, it is best to buy a "Streifenkarte" - a ticket consisting of ten strips.  Each gives the right to travel two metro stations or four stops by ground.  It costs a ticket of 13 euros, has no restrictions on the expiration date.  Two strips must be composted within the inner zone, four strips outside.  It should be borne in mind that if you are not yet twenty years old, you are entitled to benefits.  You can move inside the inner zone by spending just one strip. </p>

    <h2>  Munich underground </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the third largest city in Germany acquired its subway relatively recently - in 1972.  The opening of the metro was timed to coincide with the Olympics held in Munich.  But in the new U-Bann, even when planning it, all the amenities for people with reduced mobility were provided.  And it was appreciated by people who visited the old metro of Paris with its endless narrow stairs. </p><p>  Munich metro stations are deprived of excessive decor, but very functional.  There are information boards, seats for waiting for the train.  The trains move at intervals of five minutes during peak hours and a quarter of an hour at other times. </p>

    <h2>  Subway length </h2><p>  Munich Metro, the scheme of which looks like a ball of multi-colored lines with protruding ends, covers over a hundred kilometers.  But outside the city limits there is only one branch - U6, which goes north to Garching. </p><p>  The subway has a hundred stations.  About 90% of the paths go underground.  Munich metro consists of six lines - you can get to almost all areas of the city.  They vary in numbers (from one to six) and color. </p><h2>  Is it possible to get lost? </h2><p>  Six branches, one hundred kilometers of tracks, the same number of stations unwittingly inspire fear: is it possible to get lost in the Munich metro?  His scheme seems confusing only at first glance.  All six branches with the seventh under construction (it is already indicated in the plan) pass in the center.  Most of the lines follow through the train station.  This is extremely convenient for a tourist, since you do not need to make any transfers if you are heading to the historical part of the city. </p><p>  Outside the inner zone, the lines diverge with forks.  In the Olympic quarter, one and three lines follow.  On Theresa Meadow, where Oktoberfest celebrations take place, - four and five.  But it is best to get to the Nymphenburg and Bluttenburg castles by tram.  From the nearest metro station Moosach (third line) you have to walk about fifteen minutes, or even more. </p><h2>  How to compost tickets </h2><p>  There are ticket vending machines at every metro station or ground stop.  The purchased ticket should be stamped.  Special machines are on the station platform or at the entrance to it.  There are no turnstiles in the subway.  However, stowaways are caught by controllers.  If you have already stamped your pass, and its validity period (one hour for a regular ticket) has not expired, the second time you do not punch it.  At the entrance to the bus you need to present such a ticket to the driver. </p><p>  <span>Due to the 100% equipping of stations with</span> elevators <span>,</span> travelators <span>and</span> escalators <span>, as well as a well-thought-out system of transfers, the Munich metro is considered one of the most convenient in Europe.</span> </p>
