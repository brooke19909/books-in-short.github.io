    <h2>  Who can transfer money? </h2><p>  Various life situations oblige us to know as much information as possible about the services we use.  In order to make a transfer, you must be a subscriber to the Beeline network.  <span>The term of the contract</span> does not matter.  It also does not matter which tariff plan a person uses - the main thing is that he is not corporate.  If at the moment there is money in the account, then they can be used in accordance with the wishes of the subscriber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money from a beeline number" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/377262.jpg?1397824517824" width="595"></div>  It is possible to transfer money from a Beeline number to the phone of any other mobile operator if the withdrawal amount is at least 10 and not more than 150 rubles.  In addition, after all the manipulations and commissions should remain at least 60 rubles.  If all these conditions are met, then the operator will agree to this action.

Starting from the fact that a person who is far from a service point of service can continue to communicate using any of his friends.  And ending with cases when emergency assistance is needed, and the money in the mobile account just ran out.  This service has real value, it is not only an advertising move.  Until recently, such manipulations were impossible between different operators, but today any teenager knows how to transfer money from Beeline to Megafon.  By the way, almost every subscriber at least once in his life used this service. </p><h2>  What you need to do to make a transfer </h2><p>  Directly to transfer money, you need to perform certain actions. </p><p>  In order to make a payment, you need to dial the following combination on your phone: * 145 * phone number without an eight * amount #.  It is important that the transfer fee is charged from the sender, and the recipient sees the full amount on his account.  For a Beeline subscriber, transferring money from a phone to another number does not cost anything today - there is no commission for the service or a fixed fee. </p>

To prevent unauthorized transfers of funds from one account to another, a system of restrictions is provided.  It allows you to prohibit the use of this service and transfer money from a Beeline account becomes impossible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline transfer money from the phone" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/377257.jpg" width="502"></div>  To do this, a USSD request is simply sent with the following text: * 110 * 171 # and any transfers of funds from the account will be prohibited until the subscriber himself wishes to restore this function.  To do this, call 0611 and, using the operator‚Äôs prompts, reconnect the money transfer function.

    <h2>  What amounts can be operated on </h2><p>  To transfer from an account to another number, you must have the minimum amount that is set for each tariff plan.  For settlement schemes that require a minimum amount of funds in the account, the balance of the money after the transfer must be at least this minimum fixed amount.  What is she like?  If the tariff plan does not provide for any restrictions, then the minimum balance is 60 rubles. </p><p>  There are also rules on the amount of transfers.  For example, you cannot transfer more than 300 rubles per day from the same number.  If the money is sent to the Beeline number, then it can accept no more than 500 rubles within 24 hours.  Since transferring money from Beeline to Megafon means using the services of another operator, the restrictions will be in accordance with the rules of someone else‚Äôs mobile network.  The largest amount accepted for the Megafon subscriber will be 15,000, and this is significantly different from the maximum allowed by the Beeline tariff. </p><h2>  What are the limitations </h2><p>  Many subscribers are interested in this issue.  At the moment, except for those related to the amount, no other restrictions have been established.  Therefore, the service is available to any client of the cellular network.  The main thing is to know the mechanism of how to transfer money from Beeline to Megafon.  In this case, your friends and relatives will be insured against various troubles.  The Beeline administration imposes one more restriction: the subscriber must be loyal (that is, he must spend at least three hundred rubles on communication or Internet services from the moment he connects to the network). </p><h2>  Can I ask for a transfer? </h2><p>  If the money is over, you do not need to wait until it is transferred to the account.  Representatives </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer money from beeline" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/377259.jpg?1397824685590" width="441"></div>  Cellular communications make it possible (with a zero amount on the account) to contact a friend and ask him for help.  This service is provided by all major telecom operators.  To voice such a request, it is necessary to use the same USSD request with the text: * 143 * Subscriber number without figure eight # - for Beeline and Megafon customers.  You just need to remember this combination.

    <p>  You can have a ‚Äúzero‚Äù in your account and still contact a friend, the main thing is to know how to transfer money from Beeline or Megafon to other numbers.  If someone has become in the habit of often asking for help, and such messages with requests for the necessary amount are already tired of the order, then you can prohibit these calls with the help of the operator.  Especially this proposal has been relevant recently.  Often, scammers make such requests, so even before the transfer is completed, you need to call the specified number to verify the authenticity of his request.  Only after that they recommend sending money.  Such measures will help to avoid very unpleasant consequences, because no one will be able to return the voluntarily transferred funds. </p><h2>  How to make other types of transfers </h2>

    <p>  Cellular operators allow you to transfer money not only from number to number, but also to virtual wallets, such as Yandex Money or WebMoney.  If you know a <span>simple mechanism</span> of how to transfer money or replenish the balance or pay for services through Beeline, then your life can be greatly simplified. </p><p>  In today's world, competition between mobile operators is extremely high, as well as between any other service companies.  It is difficult to imagine such an operator who does not want to improve the quality of the services provided, attract new customers and expand its zone of influence.  To do this, you just need to constantly improve the service system, invest in new equipment and various technologies. </p><p>  If earlier a simple and familiar voice communication service was very expensive and at the same time did not differ in high quality, now even such complex functions as managing an electronic wallet or communicating with anywhere in the world have become familiar and affordable.  Crazy competition and the pursuit of new subscribers take the service system to a whole new level, which, of course, is primarily in the hands of ordinary users who, for a moderate fee, have the opportunity to discover new opportunities. </p>
