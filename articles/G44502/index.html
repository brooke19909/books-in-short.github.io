    <p>  Not at all.  "Forest Glades" is the most common guesthouse that does not conduct medical procedures.  It is intended solely for leisure or business meetings.  Here you can get the following services: </p><ul><li>  organization of weddings and celebrations; </li><li>  holding social events; </li><li>  graduation organization; </li><li>  Conferences </li><li>  entertainment programs; </li><li>  show; </li><li>  banquets. </li></ul><p>  Among other things, you can just come here to relax.  Although, as practice shows, most often the boarding house "Forest Glades" is rented for a variety of events.  For example, for weddings.  According to customers, this is an ideal place to accommodate a large number of guests.  You can organize a restaurant, and a rooming house.  And all this in the immediate vicinity of Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forest glades reviews boarding house" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1353823.jpg"></div>

But some negative still takes place.  The thing is that this organization is located in a forest area.  It pleases many.  Beautiful pine forest, silence, lack of city bustle and clean air - this is what is necessary for a good vacation.  Nature pleases with its beauty. </p><p>  But at the same time, many indicate that the "Forest Glades" are far from civilization.  A minimum of negativity is expressed by people who came to this area by car.  For them there is a separate parking lot, with which there is no problem heading back to the city.  But if we talk about traveling by public transport, the boarding house "Forest Glades" (Odintsovo district - a place in which there is also a similar institution) is really far from the nearest stops and urban areas.  In any case, it is precisely this impression that is being formed by customers. </p><p>  In reality, this place is not so distant from civilization.  Just a few tens of kilometers from Moscow.  This is not a wilderness, as noted by customers.  By car and public transport to get here is not difficult.  Yes, in the second case, you will have to walk about 2-2.5 kilometers on foot, but this is not such a problem.  As already mentioned, there are no complaints from the drivers of a personal car regarding the position of this resting place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house forest glades of balashikha" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1353820.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you do not want to go to Moscow, but are bored in urban areas, remember: the area around which the Lesniy Polyany boarding house is located is Balashikha.  You can easily get to her.  Perhaps this is the only residential complex, which is located in close proximity to our current organization. </p><h2>  For everyone and always </h2><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  Many people think about who can go to a boarding house.  Indeed, if you think about it, some holiday homes do not accept visitors with animals and children. </p><p>  Pension "Forest Glades" receives positive reviews already because it accepts clients with minors of any age.  The main thing is to warn in advance about which child will rest with you.  But they do not accept animals here.  Not too frustrating a moment, but it does.  Pets will have to be left at home. </p><p>  Customers of different ages are found in Forest Glades.  But most often these are either families or relatively business people of middle age who hold conferences.  Lonely elderly visitors are extremely rare here.  But young people can be seen most often. </p><h2>  Situation </h2><p>  What conditions of stay does our organization today offer?  This is an important point.  In this area, customer opinions are shared.  Someone considers the conditions to be good, and some indicate that they visited the "prehistoric age."  We can say that the situation in the boarding house "Forest Glades" is an amateur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house forest glades Gorkovskoe highway" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1353824.jpg"></div>

This does not mean that they feed poorly in a boarding house.  You simply will not see any culinary delights.  A simple healthy food for everyone and everyone, it also somehow reminds the Soviet era. </p><p>  <span>Banquet menu, on the</span> contrary, pleases.

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The next important point is the price of services.  What can the Lesnaya Polyany boarding house offer (Shevelkino - the place where the organization is located)?  It is noted that this vacation spot is considered a budget.  The way it is.  After all, the price of living here is not so high.  They are affordable for every citizen. </p><p>  A single room (standard) per day costs 1,200 rubles, a double 2,480. Renting an economy-class house will cost 3,400 rubles a day.  It is designed for two rooms, 3 places.  As you can see, not too expensive.  Just what you need if you are planning some kind of event with accommodation for guests on an overnight stay.  This is how you can spend a quality holiday without much spending on it!  This factor pleases all customers. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  In the <span>Moscow region</span> there is another boarding house "Forest Glades".  Zvenigorod - this is the area in which this organization is located.  Try not to confuse these two completely different vacation spots. </p><p>  What is your impression of Lesnaya Polyana, located in Shevelkino?  In general, this institution pleases many customers.  Only this is far from the most modern holiday destination.  The boarding house is frustrating with its decor and the proposed food.  Therefore, do not consider it ideal. </p><p>  The fact that sometimes you can agree with the administration of the boarding house and take pets with you is encouraging.  Unless under any pretext it is impossible to bring large dogs to the "Forest Glades". </p><p>  Prices and service here also cause only positive emotions.  A great place to relax, which is suitable for business meetings and family holidays.  The boarding house is popular because a huge number of celebrations are held here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house forest glades shevelkino" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1353826.jpg"></div>
