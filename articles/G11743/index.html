    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Environmental safety at the enterprise is a certain complex of measures.  Their goal is to bring its activities in line with environmental standards and increase its profitability.  It is understood that an organization that uses energy and resource-saving processes increases its efficiency, and in addition, reduces the impact of harmful substances on both the employees themselves and the environment.  Compliance with Russian and European eco-standards makes the company more competitive, as it makes it possible to participate in more various projects.  The fact is that for foreign customers the ecology of production is very important, and when choosing an artist, it is almost a decisive factor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="production ecology" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/452367.jpg" width="461"></div>

In order for the owner to know what and how to change, a special audit is carried out every five years.  In the case of reconstruction, studies are carried out much more often.  During the audit, measurements are made, as well as an assessment of production processes that affect the environment and employees.  Based on the data obtained, the owner is given instructions on how to organize the technology and reduce pollution.  In addition, environmental safety measures of the enterprise include the installation of treatment facilities and the implementation of appropriate modernization of production. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial ecology and safety" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/452372.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  "Direct proportionality" </h2><p>  In Russia, environmental safety at the enterprise is directly related to money.  Companies pay emission taxes: the more they are, the higher the amount.  If the audit fails or the established pollution standards are exceeded, penalties are imposed.  In general, being ‚Äúdirty‚Äù is more expensive for yourself.  By the way, the influence of harmful substances is taken into account not only on the environment, but also directly on the employees of the organization.  Therefore, if it turns out that the production ecology is not well organized, the company may not pass certification.  As a result, in addition to the fine, the organization may also receive a work ban until the reasons are eliminated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sources of pollution </h2><p>  Speaking of harmful emissions, many immediately imagine the chimneys of a certain plant.  However, everything is not so simple.  <span>Environmental pollution</span> means not only gas mixtures, but also waste water, as well as noise.  In scientific terms, industrial ecology is closely involved in the study of this topic.  Waste may accumulate at the facility.  By these are meant compounds that are released into the air, into water.  They also include solids, noise, thermal and electromagnetic rays formed as a result of the manufacture of products from raw materials.  All this has a negative impact on the environment.  There are two types of pollution sources.  The first is understood directly as the manufacturing <span>process</span> itself <span>.</span>  Under the second - technical systems and devices, that is, pipes, drains, through which waste enters the environment.  Emission sources are of two types.  If an enterprise has special systems that affect the environment, these are organized sources.  If the waste is simply stored, then it is unorganized. </p><h2>  Calculations <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="industrial ecology at the enterprise" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/452368.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><p>  Environmental safety at the enterprise is calculated in a certain way.  In the presence of organized waste, measurements are made on pipes, drains and other systems.  When unorganized, the gross emission and its capacity are calculated, as well as the size of the production itself from which pollution is produced.  The data obtained is entered into special computer programs, which are the implementation of the mathematical model of Professor Berlandt.  They, taking into account the wind rose, features of the relief, meteorological conditions, as well as the impact on the ecology of other capacities, calculate the calculation model.  According to these calculations, recommendations and prescriptions are given that must be fulfilled for the further functioning of production. </p><h2>  In full trust </h2><p>  Any enterprise in the territory of Russia, according to the legislation, must develop a whole system of engineering documentation to carry out its activities.  The organization should clearly indicate the maximum permissible and temporarily agreed amount of emissions, discharges and waste disposal limits.  According to these data, environmental safety at the enterprise, the impact of capacities on the hydrosphere, atmosphere and environment in general are evaluated.  The reliability of these documents, as mentioned earlier, is checked every five years during an audit. </p><p>  Having received the instructions, the company undertakes to independently, without supervision, follow them, until the next inspection.  That is, a peculiar <span>presumption of innocence</span> is in effect <span>, the</span> organization is considered law-abiding until the contrary is proved.  But this does not mean that, having passed the test, you can live in peace for the next few years.  The fact is that local and federal supervisory authorities can conduct an audit at any time.  Moreover, both planned and spontaneous, provoked by local residents who complained, for example, of excessive noise or gas pollution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="enterprise environmental safety measures" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/452371.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Once again about money </h2><p>  The environmental safety of the enterprise is assessed at the local level by the bodies of sanitary and epidemiological surveillance.  At the federal - environmental prosecutor's office.  Owners of production should take into account that these organizations quite easily issue fines, ranging from several tens of thousands of rubles to millions, and also close production to eliminate the reasons.  In the case of a ban on the functioning of the organization, you still have to pay for the violation of the norms.  Speaking of norms.  They are calculated according to the results of the <span>environmental audit</span> in accordance with the regulatory documents of the Law "On <span>Environmental Protection".</span>  At the same time, the results of the studies, which are given both in text and in graphical form, imply the worst development of events in production.  That is, the owner is interested in the continuous modernization of capacities in order to reduce the amount of waste, since the more they are, the higher the tax that is assigned for environmental pollution. </p>

    <h2>  Foreign criteria </h2><p>  Another factor that should push enterprises to comply with environmental safety standards is the attitude of foreign investors to this issue.  It's no secret that the topic of environmental protection in the last twenty years in Europe and America is very popular.  Of course, in fact, the cost of completing an order is important to foreign partners.  However, given the public mood, they have to carefully choose a contractor, relying on the environmental friendliness of production.  This is largely due to the fact that if information comes up (and thanks to competitors it always appears in the media sooner or later) that the production of goods has caused great harm to nature, this will affect the image of the company.  This, in turn, is fraught with a decrease in the stock price, and in the worst case, a boycott of products by consumers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="labor protection and industrial ecology" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/452370.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Health Above All </h2><p>  As can be seen from the foregoing, environmental safety at the enterprise is, above all, a matter of finance.  And we have not yet considered this issue from the point of view of personnel.  Harmful production means high salaries, additional payments, frequent sick leave and large leave.  At the same time, it is still necessary to constantly spend money on <span>training personnel in</span> occupational safety according to the law at least once every six months.  In general, keeping employees in a ‚Äúclean‚Äù enterprise is several times cheaper.  In addition to mercantile interest, there is, so to speak, also moral.  Leaving dirt where you yourself or your employees live is at least a shame.  Let not in front of contemporaries, but in front of descendants.  Who knows, perhaps, in the future, the children of its owner will have to live near a dangerous enterprise. </p>
