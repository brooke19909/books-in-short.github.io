  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I need a cadastral passport for an apartment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of us are the owners of real estate - apartments, houses, land.  Such a status requires you to know the answers to some legal questions that we may encounter sooner or later, say, when buying or selling this real estate.  Selling an apartment is a responsible and troublesome business.  It‚Äôs not enough to find a buyer and agree on a price, but in order for the transaction to be recognized as legal, and subsequently the seller and the buyer do not have any unnecessary problems, it is necessary to prepare an ‚Äúnth‚Äù number of documents required when registering a sale.  As a rule, real estate agencies are involved in the collection of such documents, but it is much cheaper to do it ourselves, especially if the transaction is supposed to be carried out without expensive intermediary services. </p><p>  One of the important papers that will be needed to buy or sell real estate is a cadastral passport for an apartment, house or land.  Without its execution, no transaction will be deemed valid.  In addition, it will be required when obtaining permission to redevelop the apartment, as well as when registering the right of inheritance.  What is a cadastral passport for an apartment and how to apply for it? </p><p>  The concept of ‚Äúcadastral passport‚Äù has been officially enshrined in the Russian Federation since March 1, 2008, when the law ‚ÄúOn the State Real Estate Cadastre‚Äù came into circulation.  This law determined the creation of an information resource containing information on all recorded real estate of the Russian Federation, i.e.  plots of land, houses and structures, apartments and other premises, unfinished objects, as well as the territorial boundaries of all subjects of the Federation.  The same law determined the mandatory receipt of a cadastral passport by the owners of the premises when registering their rights.  Thus, the cadastral passport for an apartment is the data on the property recorded from the state register, which are required when registering the right of ownership and conducting various transactions with it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where can I get a cadastral passport?  To do this, you need to contact the design and inventory office (BIP), located at the location of the apartment, with an application, a passport, an identity card and a document of ownership of this apartment. </p><p>  What is the difference between a cadastral passport for an apartment and a technical passport </p><p>  Until March 1, 2012, there was a law under which a <span>technical passport of an</span> object was required when making various real estate transactions and registering rights to it.  This document, which contained a much larger amount of information about the object (plan of the apartment, the material of the walls and floors, year of construction of the house, the terms of the overhaul, as well as the inventory value), is now an addition to the cadastral passport and is issued if necessary and with an additional request.  For transactions and registration of ownership right at the moment it is enough to have only a cadastral passport for an apartment, but, say, when registering a mortgage, a bank may also require a technical passport of an object. </p><p>  Now a little about <span>the validity of the cadastral passport.</span>  By a decree of the Government of the Russian Federation, data on the valuation of all real estate owned by citizens are valid for a year, and the starting date is January 1 of each current year.  And although the cadastral passport cannot have a limited effect, the data indicated in it are valid only for a year.  Based on this, obtaining a cadastral passport for an apartment is limited to one year.  If during this time you were not able to complete the proposed transaction, then this document loses its significance, and it will have to be done again. </p>
