But everyone knows from their own experience that it is best to choose a place that meets not only financial capabilities, but also the purpose of the trip.  Some consider it a good option for an annual vacation Coral Hills Resort 4 *, Sharm El Sheikh.  Whether it is so or not, it is necessary to understand in detail. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be noted that the Coral Hills Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) is located very conveniently.  Only 25 kilometers separate it from the local airport.  Typically, visitors are transported on special buses that are rented by one or another travel agency.  It is very comfortable.  It is only necessary to name the destination and present the relevant documents.  Travel time passes very quickly, and already at the reception of newcomers smiling hotel workers meet.  Not to say that the place here is very busy. </p>

    <p>  The area where the hotel is based is located at a distance of 4 kilometers from the old city.  This is quite a bit by the standards of Charm.  In addition, it is very close to the sea, only one kilometer.  True, here it will take longer to get to the beautiful Naama Bay.  But 11 kilometers is not the distance, given that a shuttle service is provided to the beach.  Every half hour, a comfortable mini-bus is ready to take vacationers from Coral Hills Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) to the bathing place.  The road passes through a desert area, which is already interesting in itself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resting-place </h2><p>  When choosing a tour, everyone wants to know in advance where they will have to spend their best days of the year.  The hotel area, in principle, is small, but there is almost everything to relax here: comfortable buildings on one and two floors, a restaurant for daily meals and several bars with drinks if desired.  In addition to all this, the services of vacationers include a health center and a gym.  And after hard work, tourists can regain their strength in the sauna and relax in the jacuzzi.  The territory of Coral Hills Resort 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) is completely surrounded by greenery.  Everywhere neatly cut lawns are broken and perennial palm trees planted, and a picturesque fountain is constantly working at the main entrance.  The paths between the buildings are lined with curly colored tiles, and you can always find a cozy bench anywhere to rest in the shade from the scorching sun.  And in the evening, when the sun sets, lanterns illuminate the area.  Warm air gently blows from all sides, and a walk at such a time becomes especially pleasant.  The hotel has a well-developed tourism infrastructure.  You can exchange currency or rent a car directly on the territory, and in the shops at the reception there is always a rich selection of souvenirs, industrial and some food products. </p><h2>  Convenience of living </h2><p>  All visitors to the hotel are accommodated in rooms.  Here they are quite enough: 100 standard rooms and 56 separate rooms for families.  With this issue, as a rule, they are determined even when choosing a tour.  A lot of people recently visited the Coral Hills Resort 4 *, Sharm El Sheikh.  Their reviews on this subject are very different.  As you know, the level of such an institution is determined by its stardom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In this case, the rooms are equipped, rather, on the "three".  There is a separate bathroom with a shower, a washbasin and a hairdryer, a TV, air conditioning, a balcony (or terrace) and a separate safe for storing valuables.  True, it may not always be in working condition.  In addition, there is a telephone for communication with the porter.  For those wishing for a fee, you can order drinks in a special minibar.  The rooms are cleaned daily and fairly thoroughly, and on the third day linen is changed.  In principle, not bad for a place like the modest Coral Hills Resort 4 *, Sharm El Sheikh.  Reviews of many tourists suggest that the rooms are different in size, and to settle in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù, sometimes they offer a little extra.  One has only to fork out for 10-15 dollars, and living conditions immediately change for the better.  But even then no one can be insured against unscrupulous personnel.  Sometimes theft even happens.  After this, in every smile of the hotel employees, one senses a catch.  By the way, many couples come to such places to celebrate their anniversary.  Here they cannot be surprised or upset by anything.  Over the years of marriage, spouses, as a rule, have seen a lot, and are ready for the most unforeseen situations.  Well, you can simply ignore small shakes.  They will not spoil anything, but only give the trip a special note of piquancy. </p><h2>  Organization of rest </h2><p>  Visitors should not forget that the country where the Coral Hills Resort 4 * is located is Egypt.  Sharm el Sheikh, in turn, is a place of true pilgrimage for tourists from different parts of the world.  Here tourists from Poland, Great Britain and Italy have a rest.  There are also many tourists from the countries of the former Union: Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.  Very disappointing, but in the hotel there is practically <span>nothing to do.</span>  Of course, you can play tennis or billiards, but it‚Äôs paid, and it‚Äôs not cheap.  There are practically no animators.  Only for children occasionally meager events are held.  Young people here, roughly speaking, can die of boredom.  In short, the hotel is designed primarily for older people or couples with children.  Yes, and sometimes you want to do something.  As a result, from entertainment only the bar and pool remain.  Everything is in order here. </p>

    <p>  The pool is always clean and surrounded on all sides by sun loungers.  So finding a free place is not difficult.  And those who are tired of the burning sun can sit in a cafe.  Here you can smoke a hookah or cool with the help of the drinks offered.  But mommies who came to rest with their children should really like it here.  In addition to a specially equipped compartment in the pool for babies, there is a comfortable playground.  If suddenly parents need to leave somewhere for a while, then their children will be happy to take care of qualified nannies.  True, this will already have to pay.  But what can‚Äôt you do for a child? </p><h2>  Who needs a good rest? </h2><p>  It would seem that everything should be thought out here for an international-class establishment.  This is what tourists expect, going to an institution with the sonorous name of Coral Hills Resort 4 *, Egypt (Sharm El Sheikh).  Reviews say quite the opposite.  On the territory of the hotel, vacationers have practically nothing to do.  The only way out is to visit the excursions.  Arriving in this country, many prefer to spend their free time on vacation in this way.  To organize such trips to the reception, there is always a representative of a travel agency who offers to visit the famous monastery of St. Catherine and climb Mount Moses, go to the fabulous Color Canyon or explore the mysterious Navamis.  A trip to the national parks of Abu Galum and Nabq can be very interesting.  And lovers of antiquity will definitely enjoy a trip to the archaeological site of Serabit al-Hadim, which is located only forty kilometers from the city.  In addition, tourists will find a historical museum and ancient pyramids.  Guides' stories will help you plunge into the past and for a while feel like an eyewitness to the events of those years.  A tour of Cairo will help you get to know the city closer, and a short trip along the Nile will make you recall the lines of an old children's fairy tale.  But all this is only for lovers of active pastime, and the rest will have to be content with silence on the seashore or pool. </p>

    <p>  Perhaps someone just imagines a vacation.  But as a rule, people go to such a distance for vivid emotions and pleasant sensations. </p><h2>  Food conditions </h2><p>  According to the terms of booking, Coral Hills Resort 4 * is an institution that provides two types of food: half board and all inclusive.  Most tourists are usually inclined to the second option.  This is understandable.  Indeed, on vacation, I want to forget about such a problem as food.  This is especially true for women.  A popular buffet option is often found in places of public rest.  Tourists are given three meals a day in the restaurant. </p>

    <p>  True, the choice of dishes is not very rich.  But boiled chicken, fish, fried squids and various vegetables have always been.  Yes, and baking - more than enough.  So for the amount that is paid for the ticket, normal.  You can‚Äôt count on more.  During the day, in all bars you can take drinks at the bottling.  Usually they are served in plastic cups.  But if beer and wine still go nowhere, then strong drinks do not stand up to any criticism.  You need to know about such trifles in advance so as not to overpay for a ticket.  Indeed, subject to half board, the trip can be much cheaper.  This option is suitable for lovers to relax actively, spending time traveling on excursions. </p><h2>  By the sea </h2><p>  Mostly people travel to Egypt from overseas.  And here it is too.  True, this longed-for miracle is located a thousand meters from the location of Coral Hills Resort 4 *.  Charm is a mountainous area with a complex coastline.  Perhaps that is why most of the hotels here are located on the second line.  But this is not scary, because every 30 minutes a shuttle runs, which delivers vacationers to the beach for free.  The duration of such a trip is only 5 minutes.  It is very convenient, and you don‚Äôt need to walk.  Umbrellas and sunbeds with mattresses are provided free of charge to vacationers on site. </p>

    <p>  Two types of beaches (coral and sand) allow you to please anyone.  Especially lucky for those who love diving, and for the rest all sorts of water activities are provided.  True, all this is paid and not cheap.  But money is nothing compared to the beauty of the deep sea.  Is it possible to evaluate the rich underwater world and picturesque places in rubles?  There are very beautiful coral reefs.  And those who want to be alone with nature can move away and find a cozy place on the shore, where there are almost no people.  Here you can dream, collect seashells or go diving.  Lovers can only dream of such a place. </p>
