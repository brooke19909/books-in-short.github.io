  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the mobile phone "Nokia 7380"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The hero of this review was the Nokia 7380 phone.  He joined the ranks of the exclusive L'Amore line.  This device differs from standard devices in the unusual shape of the case and the lack of a numeric keypad.  And given the design features of this model, women are potential buyers. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  A rather unusual design was implemented in Nokia 7380 (the photos posted in the article confirm this).  The shape of the phone is a square bar.  The front panel is fully decorated with a mirror.  The disadvantage of this solution is that the owners will have to constantly clean the case from fingerprints.  Unlike its predecessor in this model, the manufacturer added an original pattern to the mirror surface.  It is located in the upper part at the level of the speaker. </p><p>  The mirror panel is framed by a plastic rim.  It is made in a bronze shade.  As a complement, there is a leather insert in the same color on the back cover.  It is placed on an ivory-colored plastic panel.  This design looks pretty bright and, as they say, rich. </p><p>  Unlike the previous model, in the Nokia 7380 the indicator is mounted in the OK button.  The backlight is orange.  Also on the front panel there is a navigation wheel with a rubber rim.  It also has a backlight, but less saturated.  By the same principle, two arcs are made that perform the functions of receiving a call, reset.  The usual keyboard in this model is missing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the bottom of the case there is an arcuate mount for the strap.  There are also connectors for connecting s / y and headphones.  On the rear panel, in addition to decorative inserts, there is a camera lens (2 megapixels).  The slot for the SIM card is displayed on the left end. </p><p>  All these elements are located on the case, which has a fairly compact size (114 √ó 30 √ó 20 mm).  With such dimensions, the phone turned out to be quite heavy.  Its mass reaches 80 g. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmarena.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 7380 review" class="if uuid-2530742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530742.jpg"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  In Nokia 7380, the manufacturer installed a screen that was already used in the previous model.  Given that the phone itself is small, the display is the same.  Its dimensions: 30 √ó 16 mm.  It is made using TFT technology.  Color rendering is limited to 65 thousand shades. </p><p>  One vertical service line and four text lines are placed on the screen.  The image quality of the picture is relatively good.  Colors are saturated and vibrant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.testfreaks.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone Nokia 7380" class="if uuid-2530708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530708.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  In Nokia 7380, the manufacturer installed a non-removable battery.  His model is BL-8N.  The resource of the battery is 700 mAh.  Official testing showed the following results: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  talk time - 3 hours; </li><li>  standby time - up to 240 hours </li></ul><p>  With an average load, the phone will work for about two days.  It will take a little more than one hour to charge the battery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features of Nokia 7380" class="if uuid-2530741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2530741.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  In order to start working, Nokia 7380 must be placed horizontally in the hand.  By pressing any key, activate the screen.  On the desktop, the soft-key symbols and the logo of the mobile operator will be displayed. </p><p>  To go to the menu you need to click on the central button "OK".  The phone provides quick access to the most frequently used options.  It is located in the GoTo section.  If there is a need to dial a subscriber number, then you need to hold the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù key for a while.  Numbers and symbols (asterisk, grille, etc.) will appear on the bottom of the screen.  In order to select the desired character, you must rotate the selector.  The disadvantage is that for each digit you need to repeat the operation from the beginning.  Confirms the selection by briefly pressing ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  After the number is fully dialed, just click on the call button.  This input principle is also valid for typing. </p>
