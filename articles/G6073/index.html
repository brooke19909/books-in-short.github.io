Arboretum is what you need!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In summer, in Sochi, nature is overwhelming with its beauties, and sometimes there is not enough vacation to enjoy this riot of colors.  But in the days of scorching heat, the arboretum (translated as a garden of plants) is especially popular in Sochi.  This park is unique, it contains a rich collection of subtropical flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Park history </h2><p>  Founded back in the 19th century (or rather, in 1892) by the famous writer S. N. Khudekov, it originally occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 hectares.  To date, this figure has tripled.  It was the first park to have a rich collection of exotic plants.  Its founder, on duty many traveling, was a connoisseur of subtropical vegetation.  Therefore, in the territory decorated as Italian <span>terraced parks,</span> more than 400 species of plants that did not grow in Russia appeared immediately.  The hot <span>climate of Sochi</span> also contributed to this <span>.</span>  The arboretum was opened in a place that was picturesque in itself, it only remained to be beautifully designed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arboretum sochi opening hours" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/398604.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <p>  But the development of the park did not stop there, every year it was replenished with new specimens of flora from Germany, the Caucasus and tropical trees from different botanical gardens.  All this beauty was complemented by unique sculptures and vases made by A. Durare and P. Capellaro, famous at that time, in Paris workshops.  The unique ensemble ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù consists of several figures: ‚ÄúGolden Cockerel‚Äù, ‚ÄúShepherd Boy‚Äù and ‚ÄúFisherman with a net‚Äù.  In total, there are 17 such objects in the park; they are architectural monuments and are protected by the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the 99th year of the 19th century, peach gardens were laid out on the free territory of the arboretum and a villa was built, which today, after reconstruction, is preparing to open doors for visitors. </p><p>  In the early Soviet period, the park was nationalized and fell into decay, many plants died.  Only by 1930, work began on its restoration.  During the war, a hospital was located here.  In 1978, a cableway with a length of over 900 meters was launched. </p><h2>  Favorite family fun - funicular </h2><p>  <span>The cable car</span> in the arboretum of Sochi is one of the favorite attractions for tourists.  And for good reason, because the view from the hanging cabin opens up simply amazing.  The entire resort area and city blocks below you are revealed in full view, and then the endless sea merging at the horizon with the Caucasus mountains, and bright sky blue ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cableway to Sochi Arboretum" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/398327.jpg" width="582"></div>

    <p>  When planning your walk in the park, be sure to consider that it occupies a large area (about 50 hectares), in addition, and the arboretum is located in the mountains.  Hiking uphill, to view all the beauties, especially in extreme heat, is very tiring.  Therefore, it is better to go up immediately and begin a leisurely trip down, along with the guide.  Arboretum park in Sochi is a real treasury filled with rare plants and beautiful animals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Upper park </h2><p>  Now we will take a virtual walk in the park to decide exactly what we will spend next vacation in <span>Sochi.</span>  <span>The arboretum</span> is the place without visiting which the journey cannot be considered completed.  The funicular will take you to the highest point in the park.  From here you can go to the sequoia grove, because, going down below, you don‚Äôt want to return to it.  I would like to give advice to future tourists: get a map, it very conveniently shows the entire arboretum (Sochi).  The official website provides the opportunity to print it for free or even download it to your phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arboretum of the city of Sochi" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/398332.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <p>  Going down below, you find yourself in a panoramic glade, very beautiful and green, and then go to the avenue of mayors.  Exotic palm trees grow here, which were once planted by famous people who visited the park.  Near each you can read the name of this person.  A view platform opens from the alley.  You can stand on it endlessly, absorbing the surrounding beauty.  There are no less impressions than when climbing the cable car. </p><p>  After enjoying the views, go down the stairs to the Tale Fountain with a large statue of the Swan Princess.  Then you will find three epic roads: to the left - to the Chinese courtyard, to the right - to the aviary of ostriches, directly - to the stylized Japanese garden.  Entrance to Australian birds is paid.  Walking directly from the Japanese garden, you can look into an interesting cave with an <span>artificial waterfall.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Going down, visit the cottage "Nadezhda" - this is a pretty beautiful old building that fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape.  Along the edges of the villa are the aforementioned ensemble "Morning" and a gazebo of love.  Nearby is a statue of the "Dancer", exalting the glory of Russian ballet, and two pools with lotuses and water lilies. </p><p>  Directly in front of the summer cottage are the Amur and Boy with Fish fountains, as well as two beautiful arbors, which often host wedding photo shoots.  Further, the park is separated by Kutuzovsky Prospekt, and you can get to another part of it through the underpass.  As you can see, the arboretum of Sochi is very rich in all kinds of expositions, so take some free time to take a walk slowly. </p>

    <h2>  Lower park </h2><p>  After the upper half, it may seem that nothing will surprise you anymore.  But no!  The most interesting is yet to come.  Almost at the entrance is the exhibition pavilion, which shows a huge number of exotic plants.  You can get a shoot of any of them. </p><p>  Walking along the avenue of magnolias, you will reach a saltwater aquarium.  This is another pearl of the arboretum, as its volume is 150 cubic meters.

    <p>  Each season here is beautiful in its own way, life never leaves the arboretum.  Sochi in winter retains its greenery and beauty.  Many plants (for example, magnolia) continue to bloom under flying snowflakes.  And especially delicate palm trees for the cold period are covered with special greenhouses. </p><h2>  These amazing animals </h2><p>  You will meet them everywhere: in specially designated enclosures and freely walking in the park.  Take a look at the ostriches and peacocks, because these majestic beauties are not often seen.  By the way, birds are allowed to feed, which children will be very happy about. </p><p>  Many waterfowl can be seen on the pond at the bottom of the park.  These are pelicans and storks, muskrats, porcupines and turtles.  True enjoyment will be observed by graceful swans, domestic geese and ducks.  Often the latter walk along the alleys along the pond, leading a brood of chicks.  To wait out bad weather on cold (fortunately, few) winter days, warm aviaries are equipped for all birds. </p><h2>  Ticket price </h2><p>  The price is reasonable enough for a good holiday.  Entrance to the park will cost you 230 rubles.  To ride the funicular (one way), you have to part with another 200 rubles.  The services of a guide will cost 50 rubles, but you can save by buying a card for 20. Children under 7 years can go for free, and from 7 to 14 pay 50% of the ticket price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Arboretum opening hours" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/398336.jpg" width="600"></div>  Visiting aviaries with birds and an aquarium, as well as numerous tents with drinks and goodies, require additional costs.

    <h2>  Mode of operation </h2><p>  We have already indicated enough reasons for visiting the arboretum (Sochi).  Opening hours depend on the time of year.  From November to March there is a winter regime: from 9.00 to 17.00.  The rest of the time the park accepts everyone from 8.00 to 21.00.  You will be a welcome guest every day, the park works without days off and lunch breaks (with the exception of the aquarium). </p><h2>  Address and Directions </h2><p>  The easiest (albeit expensive) means is a taxi.  It is enough to name the address: Kurortny Avenue, 74, or simply say that the purpose of your visit is a walk in Sochi (arboretum).  How to get there, the driver knows for himself.  If you stopped near the resort town, you can take a train to the station, and then by bus or minibus to the park itself. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Choosing routes for your summer vacation, do not forget about the pearl of the Krasnodar Territory - Sochi.  The arboretum is one of the most striking and memorable places of this resort.  Allotting the hike all day, you will get a lot of impressions, and the <span>family album</span> will replenish with beautiful photographs. </p>
