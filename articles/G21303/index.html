    <h2>  “Turn on”: a new generation tariff line </h2><p>  Modern tariff plans are focused on various categories of subscribers.  However, more and more often there are favorable offers for young people.  Megafon has introduced a new line of tariffs that easily covers the needs of both young people and those who prefer communication with a “voice."  What is remarkable about the new tariffs from the white-green operator? </p><p>  The reviews draw attention to their “speaking” names: “Listen,” “Speak,” “Look,” etc. Having seen such names on brochures, users just need to conclude that the “Speak” tariff is aimed at subscribers who use more often voice communication services.  In the conditions of such a tariff, the number of minutes will be greater compared to the volume of other services.  For the “Look” tariff plan, the operator has prepared the maximum amount of Internet traffic, because the target group in this case is active users of mobile Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Of the advantages that subscribers have identified are unlimited traffic for social networks and instant messengers, which is provided by the “Turn On” Megafon tariff plan.  Feedback on "unlimited" communication through a number of services has also been found on the Internet.  It follows from this that the operator does not deceive, promising not to take into account traffic in some Internet services.  Also, from the advantages of TP, it can be noted (based on the opinions of subscribers) that there is no limit on Megafon numbers, including inter-city calls.  However, their minus follows from this plus: in order to get this unlimited, you will first need to spend all 500 minutes from the prepaid package. </p>
