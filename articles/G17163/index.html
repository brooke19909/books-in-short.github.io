    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the name of the service, after connecting to which music appears instead of beeps?  Tele2 gave it the name Buzzer.  This feature is of interest to many subscribers. </p><p>  Tired of boring phone beeps while making a call?  Then you can easily replace them with any melody from the proposed catalog.  The service is offered to all interested subscribers of the Tele2 operator.  If necessary, at any time, you can change the melody or completely abandon the connected innovation. </p><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  In some cases, music instead of beeps ("Tele2") may not work.  What are the limitations on this account?  The fact is that the provision of the service is not guaranteed in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  If the caller has an active feature called ‚ÄúRingtone for Yourself‚Äù.  In this case, when you call the person whose "Beep" is connected, the first service will be active. </li><li>  When located outside the coverage area "Tele2". </li><li>  If the phone is on hold or the second line.  Then only one caller (first) will hear the music.  Only beeps will be available to the second. </li></ol><p>  No further significant restrictions.  As a rule, music instead of beeps ("Tele2") works in almost 100% of cases.  But how to use it?  And how can I disable this feature? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to turn off music instead of beeps on body2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1501782.jpg"></div>
