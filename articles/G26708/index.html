But truly revolutionary changes in the segment of vacuum cleaners do not appear so often.  First of all, this, of course, is the spread of washing machines, in which aquafilters replaced traditional dust bags.  In such designs, the Bork vacuum cleaner, which is presented in the home appliance market in several variations, shows its best qualities.  At the same time, the company does not ignore the classical approaches to the implementation of devices of this type, improving both power indicators and functional support. </p><h2>  Bork Vacuum Cleaner Overview </h2>

    <p>  The German manufacturer seeks to maintain a high level of product reliability, keeping up with the technological content.  A modern vacuum cleaner of this brand is equipped with S-class filtration systems, a wide range of nozzles with the inclusion of a turbo brush and shockproof housing elements.  We can say that such equipment has long been mandatory not only for European manufacturers, but the Bork vacuum cleaner is distinguished precisely by the quality of implementation.  Even against the background of eminent manufacturers, the company stands out in that its products are assembled in Germany.  Signs of a thorough approach to the production process are especially evident in the housing.  Structural lines and seams have impeccable geometry, and the absence of backlash and uneven seams is carefully monitored at the factory inspection stage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Characteristics of Bork vacuum cleaners </h2>

    <p>  The company offers several models from a traditional family of devices with a dust collector, and a number of new modifications in the line of <span>washing vacuum cleaners.</span>  The main characteristic of units of this type is power, on which all other indicators depend.  Perhaps the most productive is the Bork 2100w vacuum cleaner from the V707 series.  There are other models with a similar indicator of power potential, but this option is good in that it has the ability to adjust power.  The next parameter is the suction force.  The power range for this indicator varies on average from 400 to 500 watts.  It should be noted that these are by no means record-breaking values, but Bork experts put more emphasis on structural performance and ergonomics, due to which the average power level is revealed optimally.  So, the working radius of vacuum cleaners is 7-15 m, which already corresponds to the best indicators in the class. </p><h2>  Technological features of the models </h2>

For this reason, the German company seeks a balanced approach to the integration of new developments.  For example, to increase functionality and ergonomics, a combined nozzle is provided that equally performs cleaning of soft surfaces and cleaning hard coatings.  Also, in some versions, the Bork vacuum cleaner is equipped with a dual-line suction system, which contributes to the effective elimination of dust.  Provide developers and improvements in security systems.  For example, the power filling is protected from overheating, and the engine is provided with a smooth start function.  In case of blocking the air flow, the device has a system that automatically turns off the device. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on the model 5017 SI </h2><p>  This is in every sense an entry-level solution - a device from the VC SHB series, which, however, has gained a lot of fans.  The version is a classic design with a dust collector and a small set of nozzles of 4 pieces.  The power potential is also small and amounts to 1700 watts with a suction capacity of 350 watts.  As for user reviews, the Bork VC SHB in the 5017 SI modification is rather a positive experience.  The fact is that high power is not always a decisive factor in terms of cleaning quality.  Ergonomic advantages often come to the fore, and in this case, owners note maneuverability, functionality and small size.  At the same time, many praise the 8-meter cleaning radius, which also adds comfort during operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reviews about the model CHB 7220 </h2><p>  Another representative of the VC line, which received an unusual combination of high power and small body sizes.  In practice, this combination provides both pros and cons.  The pleasant moments include convenience when moving the structure and high suction ability, which is provided by the 2000 W engine.  However, the nozzles that are supplied with the Bork VC vacuum cleaner in the CHB 7220 modification vibrate and make a lot of noise.  Many users suspect that the design is simply not compatible with the components.  The power regulator helps to smooth out the unpleasant nuances of operation - at medium speeds, the signs of vibration and rattle of the structure practically disappear. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the model V505 </h2><p>  The latest generation of Bork vacuum cleaners opens with this model.  There are younger versions, but in this case, the device optimally combines both modest dimensions and the latest technological inclusions.  Owners appreciate the features of 6 nozzles, electronic indicators and the HEPA12 filter system, which also comes with this Bork vacuum cleaner.  Reviews, in particular, emphasize effective air purification with the retention of the smallest particles in the dust collector.  Along with this, the device saves the room from unpleasant odors and bacteria.  But with regard to working with large areas, of course, this is not the best option.  For such tasks, it is worth looking after an older and more powerful version. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model V705 </h2>

    <p>  One of the best representatives of high-power vacuum cleaners in the line of the German manufacturer.  At the same time, as users note, the operation of the unit is characterized by a low noise level.  The device of the filtration system also attracts favorable reviews.  The fact is that the filters are made of electrostatic materials, which realize high level cleaning, but at the same time do not reduce the suction power.  There are unique developments that the Bork V705 vacuum cleaner and its modifications have incorporated.  Of these, a soft bumper with shockproof structure can be noted.  On the one hand, it performs the protective function of the technical basis of the vacuum cleaner, on the other hand, it eliminates the risk of damage to upholstered furniture and other interior objects that are sensitive to mechanical contacts. </p><h2>  How to choose the best model? </h2><p>  In the assortment of "Bork" you can find a model for any task.  Here are presented small-sized versions, which are distinguished by high maneuverability and mobility, and powerful devices with optimal suction capacity.  So, for a small room, you can purchase a version from the VC SHB line.  Such models are less and less found on the market, but their simple design and low cost retains demand in this segment.  If you need an uncompromising assistant who can easily solve the most difficult tasks in cleaning, that is, it makes sense to pay attention to the Bork V705 vacuum cleaner.  Reviews of this model mark a harmonious combination of performance, versatility and power.  The company makes a lot of efforts to provide the consumer with a wide selection of equipment with different operational parameters.  But the main direction of the development of vacuum cleaners remains the same - towards increasing reliability, power and convenience. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conditions of close competition, even large brands can not always surprise the client with the characteristics of their products.  Each new technology that has gained consumer acceptance is rapidly spreading across families of other manufacturers, smoothing out any benefits.  Nevertheless, the Bork vacuum cleaner may be interesting in that, along with the introduction of advanced developments, its creators do not forget about the basic qualities of technology.  These include the strength of the structure, the convenience of the nozzles, the slewing capacity of the housing and the ease of operation.  The manufacturer comprehensively approaches the work on these and other qualities of vacuum cleaners, which at the output allows you to get reliable and balanced products in terms of their parameters.  Of course, you have to pay the corresponding price for high quality, but even here the Bork brand vacuum cleaners compares favorably with many premium manufacturers of household appliances.  For example, already in the segment of 15-20 thousand rubles.  You can find the device with a modern and multifunctional filling.  For comparison: high-tech counterparts from the same German competitors are estimated at 40-50 thousand rubles, but in this case the bundling support can be expanded. </p>
