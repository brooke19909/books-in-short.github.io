He got such a terrible nickname thanks to the active work of the Germans - they totally mined his territory.  A lot of time has passed since the end of the war, but peaceful sappers and researchers die from the hard work of the Nazis.  The island has such conditions and nature that it‚Äôs just right to build sanatoriums and recreation centers, but the war still throws up its terrible ‚Äúgifts‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Role </h2><p>  Islands around the world are numerous.  Each has its own purpose.  Some of them are paradises for relaxation, others are trading harbors or pirate havens.  The island of Big Tyuters has its own destiny.  His fate was the defense against enemies from the sea.  The war sprinkled blood on the island - there were fierce battles.  For several centuries, he continually passed from one hand to another.  Most often they were Russians.  Everything passes by him - ships, people, it seems, time stopped here 60 years ago.  Very few people visited it during this period - mainly these were expeditions. </p>

    <h2>  Island today </h2><p>  The island of Big Tyuters in the Gulf of Finland is one of those places where time has stopped.  The buildings and constructions are overgrown, even the lighthouse keeper does not risk far departing from his workplace, since the island can present an unpleasant surprise, which the Germans gave him generously.  Since the latter left him in a hurry, they left behind not only <span>minefields,</span> but also a lot of equipment, ammunition, and heavy weapons.  But at the same time, here is simply indescribable beauty of nature, which, unfortunately, only a few can see.  To neutralize the dangerous island, sapper troops are regularly sent to it.  In addition, they are often joint, for example, the work of Russian and Swedish sappers in 2005 made it possible to detect and neutralize more than 30 thousand objects that could explode at any time.  There were seven such landings in the postwar years.  However, even half of the island cannot be called safe. </p>

    <h2>  Forgotten Technique </h2><p>  The island of Big Tyuters in the Gulf of Finland, a photo of which can be seen in the overview, is a real <span>cemetery of military equipment.</span>  Considering that its samples on the island are abundant, unique ones are found among them.  Such as, say, an automatic anti-aircraft gun 40 caliber "Beforos".  The amount of equipment that the Germans left can be pulled to a large museum.  Expeditions that are engaged in the study of its territory, discover many instances, some can be restored.  Today, there are about two hundred pieces of equipment that were able to be moved to the mainland.  There are 6 in-depth fortifications on the island. </p><h2>  Expeditions </h2><p>  The expedition goes to the Bolshoi Tyuters Island to study the ‚Äúwhite spots‚Äù on the map of Europe.  Due to the dense mining on it, even decades after the end of the war, military personnel died.  It is for the neutralization of the territory that similar studies are carried out.  One of the last was the Hogland expedition, which, in addition to the Big Tyuters, covered some of the outer islands of the Gulf of Finland.  Before the main landing, <span>engineering reconnaissance</span> was carried <span>out,</span> moorings and platforms for helicopters were equipped.  Of her achievements, the discovery of about 200 units of military equipment and weapons can be noted.  Most of them are unique.  After examining him for the availability of equipment, representatives of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Geographical Society went after the search engines.  At the moment, a search is underway for the remains of soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War. </p>

    <h2>  Island trip </h2><p>  Going to the island yourself is very dangerous.  Of course, this is a historical place where unique models of equipment and weapons are located, but there are much more mines on it.  Its nature is amazing, it is very quiet and calm.  The only thing that the island gives out <span>is a lighthouse</span> that works to prevent ship wrecks.  The ship has been passing by for more than 60 years.  This is the peculiarity that the island of Big Tyuters has.  How to get to it is immediately visible on the map.  The main routes are by water or by helicopter.  If you still have a great desire to touch this part of the story, you can go to the neighboring <span>island of Gogland,</span> and even from it you can also view Big Tyuters from afar. </p><h2>  Ghosts of the island </h2><p>  That‚Äôs what they call the technique that ‚Äúrests‚Äù on the territory.  The Great Tyuters in the Gulf of Finland, if it had not been mined, could be called an open-air museum of military equipment.  It seems that anti-aircraft mounts have become part of nature, sometimes they are difficult to distinguish from tree trunks or branches that fell.  An <span>anti-aircraft installation</span> can be buried in the dunes <span>,</span> and only a third mark itself from under the sands.  On the coastal slopes in the trees you can see 37-caliber defensive weapons.  Parts of equipment are scattered everywhere, including engines.  In the forests you can even meet a gas station and a cable layer.  Here and there, fuel barrels are scattered.  You can also find personalized jars of Germans.  All equipment was simply combined with nature, trees sprouted in car bodies, some tools were covered with moss and grass.  If it were not for the danger that lies in wait at every corner, here one could conduct fascinating excursions. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The island has long been considered a banned territory.  There have been successful attempts to clear it, but there is no way to fully ensure safety.  In far-reaching plans is to make an open-air museum on the territory of the Great Tyuters.  But everything rests on the financial part of the issue.  Minimum infrastructure needs a lot of money.  In addition, the path to the island is very difficult and expensive.  That is why he remains completely unexplored and almost deserted. </p>
