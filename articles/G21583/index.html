Picturesque landscapes, pristine nature, magnificent beaches, fashionable hotel complexes ... The first hotel, which opened on the island in 1908, was called the "Grand Hotel".  Today, more than 100 years later, the chic buildings of more than 1,000 hotels rise on this tiny stretch of land.  The best resorts of the island - <span>Palma de Mallorca, Palma Nova,</span> Ibiza and others. They are considered the largest party centers in all of Europe, but the best hotels of Mallorca 3-5 stars are still located in Alcudia.  This ancient Spanish town, which is located in the north-west of the island, is famous for its wonderful beaches, cozy bays, fashionable hotels.  This resort is designed for a quiet family holiday.

    <h2>  What is Mallorca's appeal? </h2><p>  This wonderful island seems to be covered with a romantic halo, a mysterious aura, an atmosphere of love.  His special enchanting beauty has always attracted many creative personalities.  She inspired them to create brilliant masterpieces.  For example, Mallorca was chosen by such figures of world culture as Frederic Chopin, Agatha Christie, Juan Miro, <span>Georges Sand,</span> Gaudi and others. Today this island is also considered a well-developed sports center.  For lovers of water <span>sports (sailing,</span> water skiing, diving, swimming, windsurfing, snorkeling), as well as golf, parachuting, horse riding, cycling and even hang gliding, this is a real paradise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bellevue club 3 majorca" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fans of noisy entertainment and nightlife are waiting for such resorts as Magaluf, Palma Nova, Ibiza.  It will seem incredible, but the annual tourist flow to Ibiza alone is more than one and a half million people.  But the beaches of Alcudia, as noted above, are more attractive for families with children.  Despite the fact that many hotels in this resort are considered more than expensive, here you can find great options for a budget holiday, for example, the BelleVue Club 3 * hotel. </p><h2>  How to get to Alcudia? </h2><p>  In summer, at the peak of the holiday season, direct charter flights operate between Moscow and Palma de Mallorca (the island's capital).  In other months, if you want to get to the island, you will first need to fly to Madrid or Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand then transfer to a local airline plane.  By the way, from Barcelona to Mallorca you can also cross by ferry.  From the capital to the resort of Alcudia, the distance between which is 60 km, you will have to go by road: either by a rented car (30 euros / day), or by bus (3-10 euros), or by taxi (30-80 euros).  If you bought a tour to the Bellevue Club 3 * hotel (Mallorca), the price of which includes a transfer from the airport to the hotel, then you will be met at the ramp by the travel agency or hotel and taken to the complex by bus.  The distance from the capital to the resort is about 60 km.  Along the way, you can admire the beautiful landscapes of these places. </p><h2>  When is the best time to go to Alcudia, to the Bellevue Club 3 * hotel? </h2><p>  The beach season in these parts begins in April and can last until the end of October.  The mild Mediterranean climate provides the island with wonderful conditions for relaxation.  There is practically no sweltering heat.  In summer, the air temperature warms up to a maximum of 28-30 degrees, water - up to +25 degrees, and in winter does not drop below +7 degrees, while the water in the sea never never cools below 15 degrees.  So Alcudia, if desired, can be visited in other months.  For example, you can book a tour to the Bluebay Bellevue Club 3 * hotel (this is the full name of the hotel) for Christmas or New Year holidays and spend an unforgettable winter holiday here.  Indeed, there are so many interesting entertainments on the territory of this gigantic hotel complex that the pastime will be wonderful even in the non-beach season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bluebay bellevue club 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mallorca island.  Hotel BelleVue Club 3 *: general description </h2><p>  5 kilometers from the city of Alcudia, 5-10 minutes walk from the beach, in an area of ‚Äã‚Äã250 thousand square meters.  meters stretches this giant hotel complex.  It consists of 17 (three-, four-, six- and eight-story) snow-white buildings, which are combined into mini-complexes with interesting mythical names: "Siren", "Minerva", "Neptune", "Apollon", "Fedra", Caesar and Diana.  In front of each of them there is one or several pools, including children‚Äôs, playgrounds for games, restaurants, night clubs, sports facilities, etc. An elevator operates in multi-storey buildings.  The hotel was last reconstructed in 2004.  A distinctive feature of BelleVue Club 3 * is a natural body of water, which is located on the territory of the hotel and has access to the sea.  Vacationers can have a great evening here, boating and catamarans or doing kayaking in the morning.  By the way, here you can also go fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bellevue club 3 reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474554.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As you may have guessed, this is not a simple hotel, but a real mini-resort with well-developed infrastructure.  The total number of rooms in the Belevue Club Hotel is 1468. These are studio apartments and 1- and 2-room apartments.  They all include kitchenettes with a fridge, microwave, electric stove and dishes, a bathroom with shower, toiletries, towels and a hairdryer.  Each room has a balcony or terrace.  There is also satellite TV, a telephone, a safe (for a fee), etc. </p><h2>  Room Facilities </h2><p>  Like all 3 star Mallorca hotels, Belevue Club cannot boast a high level of room service.  There is no such thing as daily cleaning or daily linen change.  Therefore, you can often find very unflattering comments about the service at the Bellevue Club 3 * hotel.  Reviews, of course, are subjective and are sometimes even exaggerated.  However, if such details as daily linen change and room cleaning are very important for you, then you should initially abandon tours to three-star hotels in Spain, as you will not find this anywhere.  In principle, on the island of Mallorca, 4 star hotels also do not always provide the level of service that you are used to getting in hotels in Turkey or even mainland Spain.  But the cost of tours to a three-star hotel is even very tempting.  So, for example, a weekly ticket to the Belevue Club hotel for two (without food) costs about 25,000 rubles, and this includes the cost of air travel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca Hotel Bellevue Club 3" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel has several restaurants, bars, taverns and eateries, pizzerias and ice cream parlors.  Vacationers can choose for themselves the following types of food: </p><ul><li>  No meal </li><li>  Breakfast only (BB). </li><li>  Half board (breakfast + dinner, HB). </li><li>  <span>Full board</span> (breakfast, lunch, dinner, FB). </li><li>  All inclusive. </li></ul><p>  Guests can eat once or several times a day in the hotel restaurant, where they can enjoy <span>a buffet</span> of international dishes, or satisfy their hunger in pizzerias, cafes and taverns.  However, many of the vacationers prefer to buy groceries in the market at the hotel and cook their own meals.  So living is much cheaper.  But tourists who choose the all-inclusive system can use the services of restaurants, as well as bars located next to outdoor pools, almost for free. </p><h2>  Hotel service </h2><p>  The following services are available on site: </p><ul><li>  a business center where you can use computers and the Internet, and if necessary, office equipment (photocopier, fax, printer, and scanner); </li><li>  minimarket and gift shop; </li><li>  fitness club and gym; </li><li>  doctor's services; </li><li>  barbershop; </li><li>  parking; </li><li>  ATM; </li><li>  Currency exchange </li><li>  laundry and dry cleaning, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Mallorca" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474550.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Of course, such a large resort complex cannot but have a diverse entertainment program.  Every evening, the hotel hosts a fun animation for both adults and children.  There is a karaoke club where everyone can demonstrate their vocal abilities, and dance lovers can go to a nightclub or disco.  For young tourists there is a mini club, a games room with machine guns (for a fee), a playground and a pool with slides. </p><h2>  Sport </h2><p>  For adults, the hotel has 8 pools of various shapes and sizes.  This is probably why Belevue tops the rating of 3 * Majorca hotels.  Indeed, for many tourists this circumstance is decisive when choosing a hotel.  By the way, umbrellas and sunbeds by the pools are free for all vacationers.  From sports activities, the hotel has mini-golf, billiards, bowling, tennis courts, go-karts, etc. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Belevue hotel complex does not have its own beach, and the nearest public beach is 800 meters from the hotel entrance.  Here all services are paid: umbrellas, deckchairs, water activities, etc. The beach is especially convenient for children because of the gentle entrance and comparative shallow water.  Tourists complain a little about the large amount of algae in the water, which is inconvenient when entering the sea. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If during the design of the tour you did not agree on excursions to the sights of the island, then this does not matter.  You can arrange them both in the travel agency operating at the hotel, and in Alcudia itself.  However, the best option is to rent a car for 30 euros per day and independently visit all the places of interest on the island using a map of the city and its environs. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majorca 4 star hotels" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/474580.jpg" width="600"></div>  The most interesting natural attractions are the beautiful beaches of Alcudia, which are closely approached by pine forests, which makes the air of these places not only fresh, but also healthy.  Rest in these parts of the world is especially useful for people suffering from respiratory diseases, such as asthma.  The resort also has S'Albufera Park with lakes, in which in winter numerous flocks of migratory birds fly to the nesting grounds.  There are no rivers on the island of Mallorca, but there are mountain springs in the rocks.  Sometimes it‚Äôs interesting to see how a small stream of cool fresh water beats from a stone bag with a fountain.  By the way, artificial reservoirs have been built for the reserves of drinking water in Mallorca.

    <p>  As for historical sights, Alcudia itself is it.  After all, she is about 7 centuries old.  This town is now surrounded by medieval fortress walls, on which there are 8 defensive bastions.  The entrance to the city is beautiful.  The opening gate at first glance creates a sense of unreality and takes tourists to the fairy world or to the pages of a <span>chivalrous novel.</span>  Near Alcudia there are the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pollencia, in which the ancient Roman amphitheater is well preserved.  Nearby is the current Catholic Church of the XVIII century.  In a word, there is something to see and where it is interesting to spend time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holders of both beach and educational holidays will enjoy a vacation in Alcudia, and a stay at the hotel will give a lot of positive emotions to both adults and young tourists. </p>
