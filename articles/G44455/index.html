Many of us strive to go to the sea, to show our children the vast expanses, colorful sunrises and sunsets, that is, to spend unforgettable days.  More than 80% want to spend their holidays abroad.  Why?  Everyone has their own reasons for this - someone has already visited the most colorful places in our homeland, someone prefers to see the world, and another reason - most often, relaxing abroad is even cheaper than going to the same Black Sea.  That is why the question "where is it cheap to relax abroad" worries citizens more often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where it is cheap to relax abroad" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/146845.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Let's try to figure this situation out together.  You can <span>relax</span> at any time of the year, so do not get hung up on the question of <span>where to relax in the summer</span> abroad.  You can go on vacation and in the offseason, and even in winter.  One of the most popular places is Thailand, which is where most Russians go at any time of the year.  In large travel companies, you can choose from several options, but one of the "Russified" resorts where to meet Russians is a regularity, are Pattaya, Bangkok, Samui and Phuket.  Photos, stories, descriptions, devoted to travel to this country, can easily be found on any website about the rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where is it <span>cheap to relax abroad</span> except Thailand?  There are still options, for example, Turkey.  This is the second most popular option among Russian tourists.  A feature of the rest here is that out of season, that is, not in the summer, but a little later, you can save a huge amount of money.  You just need to follow the messages from travel companies, because it is in this direction that most often come across burning tours.  Another advantage is the visa-free regime.  For a trip you need to have only a foreign passport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation abroad" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/146843.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Egypt is the next place where it is <span>cheap to relax abroad.</span>  In addition to the world famous pyramids, there is also the Red Sea, where you can not only swim at any time of the year, but also go diving.  Most often, those who are unlucky on vacation go here and he fell out of the summer months.  As in the case with the previous options, travel companies offer vouchers in this direction, where "all inclusive", and often come across hot tours.  So it‚Äôs possible to relax inexpensively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to relax in the summer abroad" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11501/146842.jpg" width="406"></div>

    <p>  Do not forget about those countries that are a little closer to our country and where almost all went to rest in the days of the Soviet Union.  This is Bulgaria.  Of course, here to relax - a little more expensive than in Turkey or Thailand, but it's worth it!  The only drawback is that the service is not the same as in European countries, but the rest is all five plus. </p><p>  In recent years, holidays in Macedonia, which is also included in the ‚Äúinexpensive‚Äù class, have gained great popularity.  The sea, ski resorts, historical monuments and museums - all this in abundance!  Those who like to spend their holidays actively will also like here - fishing, rafting, mountain and hiking.  It is worth noting the high class of service, the service here meets all European standards, and the prices are even lower than in Bulgaria. </p><p>  Choosing a direction, do not think only about <span>where it is cheap to relax abroad,</span> choose what exactly you like.  After all, your body will be able to fully rest only in the environment that suits it better, and the next vacation only after a year.  So choose, travel and have a good rest! </p>
