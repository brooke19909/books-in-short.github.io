His manner of holding on and speaking was replicated by the boys, portraying dashing cowboys.  And the style of clothing, elegant and at the same time brutal, became the standard of taste and wealth.  Harry Cooper was at the forefront of cinema and managed to work in silent cinema, with the advent of sound he did not lose popularity, like many other actors of that time, but on the contrary, became one of the greatest stars in Hollywood.  Widely known for his Oscar-winning roles in Sergeant York (1941) and at Exactly Noon (1952), this amazing person still delights people.  The composition named after the actor continues to be a musical hit; it was performed by Taco (Dutch singer).

    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  (Gary or Harry) Frank James Cooper (1901-1961) was born in the city of Helena, <span>Montana,</span> in an English family.  His father served in the Montana Supreme Court and owned a ranch north of the state capital.  James's mother was never enthusiastic about village life, and her main desire was to send her two sons to study in Britain, so that the boys could get the right education.  This became a source of constant contention between the spouses, but in the end the father gave up and allowed to take his sons to England.  However, when World War I broke out, their mother hurriedly sent them back to the States. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Frank gained excellent riding skills while working on the ranch as his father’s assistant.  At Grinnell College, Iowa, he continued his studies, learning the art of graphics, with the intention of making a career as an artist or cartoonist.  To earn money and to a lesser extent depend on his parents, Frank worked as a cartoonist in a local newspaper, and spent the summer working as a seasonal ranger in Yellowstone National Park.  When his father resigned from the State Supreme Court and moved to California, a young man followed him.  Thanks to the occasion, Frank got into the extras of the Hollywood movie and realized that he had fallen in love with cinema forever.  He abandoned the goal of becoming a commercial artist and took part in various film screenings for almost a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Harry Cooper photo" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1213964.jpg" width="346"></div>

    <h2>  Career </h2><p>  The efforts of the young actor were eventually rewarded, the Paramount film studio signed a long-term contract with him after Frank appeared in a short film with the famous silent actress Eileen Sedgwick.  Having decided to devote himself to cinema, Frank changed his name to Harry Cooper, under whom he appeared in more than a hundred films.  Some of the many: “Wings”, “A Man from the Plains”, “Farewell to Arms”, “Alice in Wonderland”, “Sergeant York”, “Friendly Exhortation”, “Exactly at Noon” “Tree for the Hanged” and his last work “Naked Blade” - became a classic of cinema and received awards and prizes.  The handsome actor was not only loved by the movie camera, he was adored by the most beautiful and famous women of the United States. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singer Harry Cooper" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1213990.jpg" width="393"></div>

Photo, of course, cannot convey the charisma for which the public and ladies loved it so much.  Cooper was credited with a romance with Marlene Dietrich, <span>Ingrid Bergman</span> and Grace Kelly.  The actor’s longest romance was with film star <span>Patricia Neal.</span>  This relationship nearly ruined Cooper's marriage to Veronica Balfe, who was a socialite and daughter of the head of the New York Stock Exchange.  Despite the many intrigues on the part of both spouses, the marriage still survived.  Later, the actor settled down and even converted to Catholicism under the influence of Veronica.  The main genre of the films in which he played was westerns, and although critics did not always approve of Cooper's work, for the viewer he forever remained the unsurpassed, courageous and dashing hero of the Wild West. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  When, at the age of 59, Harry Cooper learned that he was seriously ill with cancer, his wife was always with him.  The actor underwent tiring treatment, and when he wanted to take a break from him, he often visited his friend <span>Ernest Hemingway</span> ’s ranch <span>.</span>  The couple tried to fight the disease to the last and hoped for the best, trying to hide the diagnosis from the public.  But when in 1961 his friend Jimmy Stewart came out with a sad face to receive a special Oscar for his contribution to world cinema, instead of Harry Cooper, it became clear to everyone that his beloved actor would soon be gone.  Harry Cooper watched the Oscar ceremony on TV at home with his wife and daughter Marie, a few months later he was gone. </p><h2>  Heritage </h2><p>  A song to the words of Irving Berlin Puttin 'on the Ritz, written in 1929 and first performed by the famous Fred Astaire, was re-edited in 1946 by Harry Cooper.  Since the words “dress like for Ritsa (the most luxurious hotel of that time) and“ look like Harry Cooper ”meant to correspond to a fashionable style, you can understand what authority the actor was for the secular public. The song is still considered an unofficial anthem“ Dream Factory "- Hollywood. In 1981, her cover version appeared, performed by Taco." Harry Cooper "- under this name, the legendary song is now more known to the modern listener. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taco harry cooper" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1213985.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Taco's disc with this composition scattered in millions of copies and instantly raised it to the pinnacle of success, and the synth-pop version of the song is still very popular to this day.  By the way, thanks to this performer, our viewers began to pronounce and write the name of the actor more often as Harry, and not <span>Gary Cooper.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Harry Cooper Krasnoyarsk" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1213987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Interestingly, in Russia, fans of the actor’s creativity decided to express their admiration for his work and style, naming the enterprise in honor of the legendary performer of courageous heroes.  Since the organization is engaged in creating the interior at a high professional level, it is not surprising that it has the name "Harry Cooper".  Krasnoyarsk can also be proud of its model of style and professionalism. </p>
