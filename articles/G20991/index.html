    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  By today's standards, the Lenovo A859 has a fairly modest package.  Reviews of dissatisfied music lovers only confirm this saying.  The quality of standard acoustics is poor.  This is an economy class accessory, its sound is appropriate.  Therefore, if you want more, then immediately buy a high-quality <span>speaker system</span> with it <span>.</span>  In addition to headphones, the smartphone itself, a charger, a standard USB 2.0 cord for charging and connecting to a PC, and a 2250 milliampere / hour battery are included in the package.  Its capabilities will be discussed later.  In addition, the boxed version of this gadget includes a <span>warranty card</span> (must be filled out by the seller in the store, it is valid only if there is a purchase receipt with packaging) and a user manual in several languages.  In general, a standard set for today.  The only downside is that the quality of the speaker system leaves much to be desired, and therefore it is better to immediately buy another, better one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  This smartphone is a classic <span>touch candy bar.</span>  It is available in three colors: white, gray and black.  The first of them (it is designated as Lenovo A859 White) is more suitable for the weak half of humanity.  But black is better for men.  The gray, which is called Lenovo A859 Gray, is universal: it is perfect for both the first and second.  Externally, the device is very similar to the Galaxy S3 from Samsung.  Only it is larger in size, and the logo on it is different.  Case material - plastic.  Solid assembly, no backlash.  There are three standard buttons at the bottom front: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  A little lower is the microphone hole and the micro-USB 2.0 connector for connecting to a PC or charging the battery.  On the right are two buttons that allow you to adjust the volume level.  Above is the power button, as well as a 3.5 mm jack for connecting an external stereo system.  The last solution is not sucking convenient.  You can‚Äôt hold the smartphone with one hand and press this button if headphones are connected.  Therefore, you have to do it with the second hand, which is not always convenient.  Another nuance is that the case is not protected from scratches, like plastic glass.  Therefore, in this case, well, you just can not do without a cover and a protective sticker.  It‚Äôs better to buy them together with the device at the same time, so you don‚Äôt worry about the appearance of your smartphone.  This will keep it in its original condition for a long time.  Otherwise, scratches and cracks may appear soon, which is not entirely good.  The phone is bought for more than one year.  If he immediately loses its presentation, it will be unpleasant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  CPU and its features </h2><p>  Smartphone Lenovo A859 Gray, like its other modifications, is equipped with the same type of processor.  This is a single-chip system based on the architecture of the MTK 6582 workstation. It consists of 4 revision cores A7.  The maximum allowable clock frequency is 1.3 GHz, which is automatically achieved in peak load mode.  If maximum performance is not required, then the processor automatically unloads up to 300 MHz.  In this case, idle kernels will automatically shut down.  MTK 6582 managed to prove itself from the best side, but it can not be attributed to the new products.  It has long been successfully sold, but still a little outdated.  So do not forget about it at the stage of choosing a new smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics subsystem </h2><p>  Equipped with Lenovo A859 5-inch touch screen with HM quality resolution.  Its resolution is 1280 pixels in height and 720 pixels in width.  In this case, the density of points in the picture is 294 PPI.  The screen is based on high-quality IPS - a matrix that is capable of displaying about 16 million colors.  Viewing angles are ideal.  But there is one important minus.  This is the presence of an air gap between the sensor and the display.  Therefore, when the screen is rotated, slight picture distortions are possible.  For high-quality image output, the Lenovo A859 White smartphone and its other modifications are equipped with a 400MP2 adapter from the developer of graphic solutions for this Mali platform.  This is a time-tested solution.  An acceptable level of performance and good quality are its main advantages.  But the disadvantage is that it is already out of date. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory subsystem </h2><p>  An impressive amount of memory can not boast of Lenovo A859.  Reviews all over the internet only convince potential buyers.  First of all, this saying relates to random access memory, which is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1 GB of the DDR3 standard here.  This is very small today.  Of course, for most everyday tasks (surfing sites, watching movies, listening to music) this is enough.  But if you start something more serious, then you won‚Äôt be able to work or play normally.  For example, a three-dimensional toy.  The integrated memory in this device is 8 GB.  They are enough for comfortable work on this gadget.  If desired, this value can be increased by another 32 GB using a memory card.  The corresponding slot is located near the place of installation of SIM cards and batteries. </p>

    <h2>  About the camera </h2><p>  "Lenovo A859" is equipped immediately with two cameras.  One of them is located above the screen, next to the speaker.  It is based on a 1.6 megapixel sensor.  Its main purpose is to make video calls.  In this case, the outgoing picture, if necessary, can be viewed on the device screen.  There is support for making video calls using special software (such as Skype) and conventional 3rd generation mobile networks.  The second camera is located on the back of the device.  She already has an 8 megapixel sensor.  For higher quality of the received image, autofocus and automatic stabilization system are used.  At night, you can use the LED flash to take pictures.  Also use it to make a video recording. </p>

    <h2>  Communications kit </h2><p>  A standard set of communications for this smartphone model.  It is quite enough for most everyday tasks.  The device has a built-in module for working with 2/3 generation mobile networks (SIM card slot No. 1) and 2nd generation (second SIM card).  The maximum data transfer rate for the first case is 5.76 Mb / s.  This is enough for comfortable work on the Internet.  But the second slot will allow you to get only a few hundred kilobytes, which is enough to communicate on social networks and view simple sites on the global web.  The device is also equipped with Wi-Fi and bluetooth models.  In the first case, with the appropriate wireless network, a high-speed connection to the global web is provided.  But bluetooth allows you to exchange data (for example, music, video or photos) with similar devices of this class.  For navigation, a ZhPS receiver is integrated into it.  There is also a micro-USB slot for revision 2.0, which allows you to connect this device to a PC. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Smartphone Lenovo A859 8Gb <strong> </strong>  comes with a 2250 milliampere / hour battery.  With the active use of its resource is enough for a maximum of one day.  If you reduce the load, then the maximum you can count on is three days of battery life.  No matter how much, but still enough.  Many devices of this segment and with a similar diagonal cannot even boast of this.  So it turns out that the A859 is a clean middle peasant entry-level on this indicator. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  To date, Lenovo A859 8Gb is sold with a preinstalled Android operating system, the version of which is 4.2.  Of course, it is not the latest revision, but this is quite enough for the successful functioning of this unit.  For the normal functioning of the installed software on a smartphone, this version is quite enough.  So there will be no problems with software compatibility.  But the question of switching to newer versions of the OS remains open.  It is unclear whether the manufacturer will update the operating system.  There are no proprietary settings in this case.  But a rich set of different themes for the design of the device is an undoubted plus of this device.  Not every smartphone of this level boasts similar.  However, they really tried, and there is plenty to choose from.  So using this to express your personality is not difficult.  The rest of the set of pre-installed services is standard, including social services.  The only thing that distinguishes the work of designers is a high-quality and soundly organized interface of preinstalled utilities. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Average enough, as for its class, it turns Lenovo A859.  Reviews, specifications and specifications only confirm this opinion.  So that he stands out from the competition, this is not.  There are no serious shortcomings in it either.  In general, a reasonable purchase at this price.  An excellent combination of cost and quality, but if you look closely at the specifications of competitors, you can find better offers.  Nothing bad can be said about him, but he has not so many positive sides.  In any case, if you buy a similar device, it will live up to all your hopes. </p>
