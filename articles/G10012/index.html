    <h2>  Practice situation </h2><p>  Every year the process of obtaining the necessary documents is simplified.  But it‚Äôs too early to say that the lines are a thing of the past.  Here, many motorists deliberately ignore the need for an insurance policy.  The penalty for his absence is not yet very large, so drivers prefer to ride without it at their own peril and risk.  At the same time, they jeopardize their own safety and the safety of their car.  It is dangerous to rely solely on yourself, because an accident can occur due to the fault of an oncoming car, but no one will pay you anything, since there is no insurer! </p><p>  In 2015, innovations occurred in the insurance field, and OSAGO policies were allowed to issue remotely.  This made the procedure less formal and simpler.  In fact, the driver provides all the data independently, and the system substitutes them into the formula for calculating the total amount.  It turns out that the process becomes as transparent as possible and the driver sees how the result is formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, you can also choose where to issue <span>an insurance policy.</span>  You can be at home, at work or traveling.  The main thing is to have a computer, tablet or phone with Internet access.  Well, of course, you have to choose an insurer company whose services you rely on.  If you take out insurance for a long time, then you are likely to remain faithful to one company.  Is it on the list of companies issuing an electronic policy?  If there is, then everything comes out much easier, since you know who you are dealing with.  Otherwise, you will have to choose a new company or issue a policy in the old fashion, offline. </p>

    <h2>  Is there any difference? </h2><p>  First, let's understand what is an electronic policy?  His powers are not reduced in any way when compared with a paper counterpart.  Mandatory insurance is provided for a motorist in case of an accident occurring through the fault of the insured if there is damage to the victim‚Äôs car or damage to the health of another person.  Thus, the MTPL policy guarantees you protection if, due to your negligence, such an unpleasant event has occurred.  This allows you to feel more confident in the material plan, as the policy is compensating for losses.  The amount of such compensation, of course, varies.  So, the damage to the health of the victim can be compensated in the amount of up to 500 thousand rubles.  If damage is caused to the car, then the amount of insurance is limited to a limit of 400 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to buy? </h2><p>  So, an electronic policy can be bought at a company that is geographically related to the region where the motorist lives.  This is an important point, since the process of obtaining reimbursement is simplified, and cases where the search for insurers leaves the region are also excluded.  No extra charge for online registration is made.  On the Internet, the cost of insurance is calculated at the same basic rates that apply throughout the country.  Next is the adjustment according to the region of residence, type of vehicle, age and experience of the driver.  All data must be driven in on the website of the insurer company.  It is not difficult to find it, you can first visit the sites of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers,</span> where there is a special tab dedicated to the design of CTP.  Here you can see which insurance companies issue an insurance policy, and make a choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic policy osago Ingosstrakh" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1692349.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How is the design going? </h2><p>  So, you decided to try out the novelty and get insurance through the Internet.  What are the pros in this choice?  Firstly, you will save time.  After all, you can do without queues and standing in traffic jams. </p><p>  Secondly, get the policy in a very convenient form.  Electronic CTP can be stored on your phone, tablet.  In principle, you can simply write down the policy number for yourself and simply call it to the inspector, who will be able to break the number in the database. </p><p>  Thirdly, when registering CTP via the Internet, the price does not suffer in any way.  You pay the amount that came out when calculating through the form.  No commissions, duties or other charges. </p><p>  For registration, you need to look at the list and find out which insurance companies issue an insurance policy.  The initial algorithm on almost all sites is the same - you need to register in your account on the company's website.  Enter your last name, first name, middle name, as well as gender and passport data.  Contact details will be required, namely a phone number and a mailing address.  And at the next stage, it is especially important which insurance companies issue an electronic CTP insurance policy and which sample of insurance application needs to be filled out.  They may vary slightly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buy an electronic policy of OSAGO SOGAZ" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1692350.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Consider an example </h2><p>  Once you have access to a sample insurance application, a boring routine begins to enter data in the required lines.  To help a novice computer user - a drop-down menu.  Fill out the information about your car in order, using the technical passport.  Then check the registration certificate and diagnostic card.  At the end of the questionnaire there will be fields for information from the driver‚Äôs license.  The easiest way to use the previous car insurance when filling in to eliminate errors.  After registration there will be a pause.  During this time, there will be an automatic reconciliation of data with the PCA database.  During this time, the system will determine if the specified documents actually exist.  If everything is in order, then after verification you will be offered a form of payment. </p><p>  The amount is calculated at existing rates.  There is also a bonus system.  In particular, if for the past insurance period you did not have problem situations, then you will receive a 5% discount.  Those drivers who ride stably without incident are entitled to an annual discount increase.  Payment can be made in any convenient way for the client.  But, of course, everything happens online.  When paying for insurance, the client can indicate how he wants to receive it.  In the standard version, the policy comes by e-mail, but for fans of the classics it can be printed out and delivered to the address indicated in the questionnaire. </p>

    <h2>  Where do they process MTPL online more often? </h2><p>  Rosgosstrakh remains the leader in car insurance.  The lion's share of motorists turns to this company.  The first is a company with a name.  Secondly, it is a proven quality.  Thirdly, this is one of those companies that are innovators in the field.  Of course, there are plenty of competitors, because insurance through the Internet today offers more than sixty organizations.  If you decide to execute CTP online, Rosgosstrakh provides comprehensive information on its website.  There you can also get news about changes in legislative acts and the allowable amount of damages.  Conveniently, before filling out an application, you can calculate the cost of your insurance.  Also, customers are impressed by the moment that the site highlights in a different color the fields that have not passed the system check.  You can print out the mistakes made. </p><h2>  Golden mean </h2><p>  Other companies are also in demand.  For example, it is worth buying an electronic insurance policy <span>, "Sogaz"</span> which offers.  In the insurance market, the company has a high rating, and customer trust is growing every year.  The site has enough information about insurance, tariffs and bonuses.  Before applying, you can calculate the size of the total amount on the calculator.  Customers are attracted by the opportunity to buy an insurance policy for CTP (Sogaz) because the company does not boast of its status and does not have scandalous stories in the media. </p>

    <h2>  Bet on fame! </h2><p>  Quite proudly another organization is declaring itself, which offers to issue an electronic insurance policy.  RESO is a fairly well-known company.  Some clients praise the insurer to heaven, while others are skeptical, believing that they do not think about the benefit of the applicant.  So where is the truth?  I must say that the interface of the company‚Äôs website is quite simple and pleasant to perceive.  There is comprehensive information about insurance, rates and possible errors.  There is also an algorithm for possible solutions to the turmoil.  The insurance section contains the addresses of the support service, so that no customer will be left without a consultation.  If you have questions about errors, then you can get answers instantly.  So, among others, the electronic insurance policy of OSAGO RESO makes out faster and easier.  By the way, you can fill out an application in two versions - as a new client and as a RESO-Garantia client. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of insurers </h2><p>  Speaking about popular companies, one cannot ignore the insurance policy of OSAGO, which Ingosstrakh draws up.  The site of this company is easy to navigate, the system works perfectly, and all possible misunderstandings are resolved at the same moment.  Very quickly there is an information exchange with the database.  The site service offers the client to first familiarize themselves with the amount of insurance, and only then buy an electronic insurance policy ("Ingosstrakh").  The client can choose the desired type of contract - conclude a new one or prolong the old one.  It is worth noting that the Ingosstrakh company has very contact support group managers who respond promptly to calls.  The client does not feel abandoned.  On the site you can discuss the possibility of delivering a printed policy to your home. </p><p>  Not the most perfect in technical terms is the CTP insurance policy that Renaissance offers.  A lot of complaints come to the interface of the site and services of this company.  But there are a lot of necessary notes and news on the topic of car insurance. </p>
