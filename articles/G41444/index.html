The construction of the Olympic Park in Munich was timed to coincide with the XX Summer Olympic Games, held in Germany in 1972.  Built by the famous architect Gunther Benisch, the park and after many years still serves people as one of the largest venues for all kinds of sports, social, cultural and religious events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelerfolio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General view of the park." class="if uuid-3128392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3128392.jpg"></div><h2>  Title </h2><p>  After the Games, the local <span>population of Munich</span> became the Olympic Park to call the entire territory of the Olympic region.  The park has no official name yet.  This name is rooted in the everyday speech of citizens and tourists.  And yet it is not yet official. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The park is located in the north of the capital of Bavaria, in Milbertshofen am Hart (11th urban district).  The total area of ​​its territory is about 85 hectares.  The borders of the Olympic Park in Munich in the east extend along Lerchenauer Strasse, in the north - along the Moosacher Strasse.  In the west, the territory is bordered by the Landshuter Alley and Willy-Gebhardt-Ufer. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="48.17650500000001" data-lng="11.530977399999983" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/3/0/9/15309.png"></div><h2>  Olympic Munich </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this project was created specifically for hosting the XX Summer Olympic Games (1972). In general, for all the years the park has existed, about 13,528 various mass events have been held here: sports, festivals, concerts, exhibitions, championships with approximately 211 million visitors.  Today, the Olympic Park in Munich is a place where various sports, cultural and social events are actively held.  This area is one of the favorite vacation spots of the city residents.  Here you can work out various sports, relax and lie down on the grass, have a picnic, sunbathe or take a short walk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The territory on which the Olympic Park is located today (address: Munich, Georg-Brauchle-Ring, 80992 Germany), until 1913 belonged to the city of Milbertshofen.  Its flat surface was the best suited for the location of the airfield.  There used to be Munich-Oberwiesenfeld, the airport at which French President Deladier and English Prime Minister Chamberlain, who signed the Munich Agreement, landed in 1938.  During the Second World War, the Third Reich — the Luftwaffe — was based at the airport, and later, until 1957, the US military aviation. </p><p>  Since 1957, the northern part of the field has been used as a sports airfield.  It is known that the last plane took off from here to the sky in the spring of 1968.  In the period from 1954 to 1967, the southern part of the future park was occupied by the annual construction exhibition Bauma.  In 1965, an ice stadium was erected here, which in the future was destined to play the role of the Olympic Center for Speed ​​Skating.  During the 1972 Olympics, boxing matches were held in this building.  The architecture of the Olympic stadium, with its spider-like roof, was different from previous monumental Olympic objects made in the neoclassical style. </p><p>  Another pre-Olympic building was built nearby - a television tower. </p><p>  In 1967, the bureau of the architect Behnisch (Benisha), who became the winner of the announced competition, began to implement the Olympic project.  By 1970, the main earthworks were completed: construction sites, communications, and a specially built metro line.  In addition, about 3,100 trees were planted in the future park and lawns were broken. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the International Olympic Committee awarded Munich the right to host the Games (1966), concrete plans for the reconstruction of the territory were developed.  The conceptual slogan of development was: "The Olympic Games in nature."  The very idea of ​​building a sports complex in the green zone was not new.  But the idea of ​​holding the Olympic Games in the recreational natural area was completely innovative. </p><p>  By the beginning of the Games (1972), the following were built in the Olympic complex: Olympic Village, a press center, a tower 291.28 m high, a swimming pool;  Olympic arena, stadium and various sports fields;  tennis court;  The Olympic Park with a lake, on the banks of which the Teatron, the palace for cultural programs of the Games, and the Olympic Mountain were built. </p><h2>  Territorial zones and objects </h2><p>  The Olympic Park in Munich is conditionally divided into four zones.  In the so-called Olympic zone (first zone) are located: an arena with a tower, an Olympic stadium, as well as venues for competitions in various sports.  The Olympic Village (the second territorial zone) consists of training facilities and residential buildings for athletes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.studentenwerk-muenchen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympic Village." class="if uuid-3128352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3128352.jpg"></div><p>  In the third zone - the Olympic Press Center (former) - today is one of the largest shopping centers in Europe.  In addition, there is also a fourth zone - the so-called.  Olympic Park, representing the attention of the guests Olympic Lake (artificial) and Olympic Mountain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The picturesque shore of the Olympic lake." class="if uuid-3128342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3128342.jpg"></div><h2>  What is worth seeing here? </h2><p>  “What to see in the Olympic Park in Munich?”  - This issue always remains relevant for tourists.  For guests' information, the complex has water and Olympic stadiums, an ice rink, and the famous television tower, which has two viewing platforms (located at an altitude of up to 190 m), closed and open, to which tourists are lifted by a high-speed elevator.  In good weather, visibility reaches forty kilometers from here, and if desired, guests can enjoy the chain of the Alpine mountains.  Here, tourists are welcomed by a restaurant (with a capacity of up to 150 people).  Numerous cultural and sports events and festivals attract travelers' considerable interest. </p><h2>  About the Olympic Stadium </h2><p>  The construction of this object, one of the most important and most sought after in the park, was carried out by the Gunter Benisch architectural bureau for four years.  During the construction process revolutionary environmental technologies of those times were used. </p><p>  The capacity of the stadium is about 80 thousand spectators.  The idea of ​​the architects was that the structure did not look like a huge skyscraper.  For this purpose, a high hill, the Olympic Mountain, was specially poured.  The stadium building itself is not impressive in its height.  Its field is located 5 deeper than the outer part of the structure, which allowed the authors not to erect tall stands.  One of the innovative technologies used in the construction of the stadium with such a grandiose scale was the creation of the so-called “tent” roof, consisting of steel cables and canopies made of acrylic glass. </p><p>  One of the first events held at the Olympic Stadium was a friendly match between the football teams of the Soviet Union and the FRG, held here in the spring of 1972, before the opening of the Games.  The guests lost to the hosts with a score of 4: 0.  In addition to the opening and closing of the Summer Olympic Games (1972), the stadium hosts numerous sports competitions.  At the conclusion of the Games, this facility was used to conduct home training sessions for Bavaria München (Bavaria's main football team), as well as for international championships in athletics and football. </p><p>  In addition, Olympiastadion is the largest global platform for performances by various artists in a wide variety of genres.  The open-air festivals of rock music are held annually on this site in the open air.  Concerts of many world stars took place at the Olympic stadium over the years of its existence: Rolling Stones and Bon Jovi performed here six times, Genesis - three times, Michael Jackson - four times, Pink Floyd, Tina Turner, Prince performed twice.  Three performances at this stadium were: Andreas Gabalier, Paul Mccartney, Gianna Nannini, Rock over Germany, Rod Stewart &amp; Simple Minds, Rockavaria, Dire Straits, Three Tenors, U2, Elton John, Guns and Roses, Celine Dion, AC / DC , Robbie Williams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.parkinn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympic Stadium." class="if uuid-3128369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3128369.jpg"></div><h2>  About the television tower </h2><p>  The Olympic Tower, located near the Olympic Speed ​​Skating Center, is very popular among tourists and residents of the city.  This is the second pre-Olympic building in the park.  The tower in the Munich Olympic Park is a famous symbol of the city.  With a height of 291.28 meters, it takes second place in Bavaria in this parameter (the first belongs to the Nuremberg TV tower).  The facility was built in the late 1960s and has since served guests as a convenient viewing platform.  The restaurant, located in the tower, is awarded a Michelin star. </p><p>  Previously, technical support for broadcasts in Munich was carried out using the radio mast built in 1957 by the German Postal Company - a telecommunication tower 50 meters high, which was first increased by another 50 meters, and then decided to build a tower of optimal height that would meet the increased requirements of the city.  Initially, the height of the new project reached 325 m, but this option was rejected due to the fact that it interferes with the normal operation of aviation. </p><p>  The construction of the tower began in the summer of 1965, and was completed in the winter of 1968.  It is known that the Munich administration and the builder could not agree on an approach to the design features of the structure.  The result is the existence of two separate tower baskets.  The lower platform (Postkorb) is the location of communication facilities, the upper (Aussichtskorb) has a viewing platform (two parts - open and closed), as well as a restaurant (rotating) with a capacity of about 250 seats, located at an altitude of 181 m. The rotation speed of the restaurant: one 360 ​​degree rotation takes 53 minutes.  During lunch, guests have the opportunity to enjoy beautiful views of the city and the Alpine mountains from different perspectives.  Restaurant rates are higher than average in Germany.  In windy weather, when the wind speed exceeds 80 km / h, the rotation automatically stops. </p><p>  The platform on which communication devices are located is located at an altitude of 147-167 meters.  The guest superstructure is located at an altitude of 174-192 meters.  The diameter of the site is about 28.3 meters.  Those wishing to get to the platform must overcome exactly 1230 steps.  This is possible only during special events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mikesbiketours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympic tower." class="if uuid-3128345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3128345.jpg"></div><h2>  Munich Olympic Park: opening hours </h2><p>  The Olympic Stadium is open daily for visiting: </p><ul><li>  in winter: from 11.00.  until 4 p.m .; </li><li>  the rest of the time: from 9.00.  until 4 p.m. </li></ul><p>  Visitors are offered: self-examination, exciting excursions, as well as active tours on the tent roof of the stadium.
