According to reviews, the weather in Prague during the winter months will delight tourists with a comfortable temperature and lack of frost.  In December and January, precipitation in the form of snow or light rain is possible here.  It should be noted that the winter in Prague, as well as throughout the Czech Republic, is foggy.
