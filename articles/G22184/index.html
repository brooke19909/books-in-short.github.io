  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Lobachevsky": reviews of residents, location, layout of apartments</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Reviews about the <span>residential complex</span> "Lobachevsky" are of interest to everyone who is considering moving to this <span>residential complex.</span>  These are business-class apartments located in the Western Administrative District of Moscow.  The quarter consists of three multi-section buildings, as well as a two-level underground parking and a kindergarten.  Houses are being built using monolithic technology using ventilated facades and quality finishes.  At least this is what the developer himself says.  We‚Äôll find out how things really are based on real reviews of residents, interest holders and potential buyers who have already managed to see with their own eyes what the developer offers them. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078423.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about LCD "Lobachevsky" are very different, to understand the pros and cons, we will consider these new buildings from all sides. </p><p>  Currently, the developer offers more than a thousand apartments, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich varies from 45 to 122 square meters.  These are options in which there are from one to four rooms.  In all rooms without exception, high-quality plastic windows are installed, in some cases they are panoramic, as well as metal entrance doors.  Finishing is not provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In each of the buildings there are three silent elevators, on which you can not only climb to any floor, but also go down to the underground parking.  The apartment has all the necessary communications, including internet, telephone and satellite TV. </p><p>  Uninterrupted power supply is guaranteed on the territory of the residential complex, as its own autonomous substation is equipped. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.693588" data-lng="37.46912420000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/2/7/14327.png"></div><p>  The residential complex "Lobachevsky" is located in Ramenki.  It is believed that this is one of the prestigious areas of the Russian capital. </p><p>  Within walking distance is a large number of various well-known higher education institutions.  For example, Moscow State University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, the Academy of Social Relations and Labor, as well as the national economy, working under the federal government. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility of the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="advancerealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings in residential complex &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078430.jpg"></div><p>  Potential residents are attracted by the good transport accessibility of this microdistrict, both on personal and public transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, you can drive your own car from the Lobachevsky new buildings to Vernadsky and Michurinsky Avenues, from where you can go in any further direction.  For example, if you move five kilometers along Michurinsky Prospekt, you can go to the Moscow Ring Road. </p><p>  In ten minutes by bus or taxi you can get to the metro station "University".  For longer distances, it is preferable to travel by electric trains.  Buses run regularly to the nearest Matveevskaya train station.  Travel time will be about a quarter of an hour, excluding probable traffic jams. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroi-ki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure in residential complex &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078420.jpg"></div><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the residential complex is a large number of convenience stores, building supermarkets.  On the way there will be many auto parts stores and car services. </p><p>  However, really large supermarkets, in which Muscovites are used to buying, are still quite far from the residential quarter.  Prior to Pyaterochka, Crossroads and Fix Price more than one and a half kilometers.  Three kindergartens and a secondary school are relatively close.  To get to educational institutions, you will need to walk about a quarter of an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that the residential complex is located quite far from large shops and shopping centers, in addition, there is an acute shortage of kindergartens and secondary schools in the district.  So the new settlers should be prepared for the fact that they will encounter certain problems if they make a choice in favor of this residential complex. </p><h2>  Courtyard space </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078421.jpg"></div><p>  The houses in the residential complex are located in such a way as to form a closed courtyard.  On its territory, the developer has done everything to make it comfortable and interesting for both adults and children.  In particular, sports and children's playgrounds, recreation areas appeared as part of the improvement. </p><p>  Large-scale landscaping has been carried out.  The territory of the residential complex itself is as safe as possible; 24-hour video surveillance cameras are installed around the entire perimeter of the territory.  In addition, the territory of the residential complex is under protection. </p><h2>  Social institutions </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that in addition to residential buildings, the developer provides infrastructure facilities.  For example, the second building includes a two-story kindergarten, which is organically attached to the main building.  It has a capacity of 125 seats. </p><p>  In all houses, the first floors are reserved for commercial real estate.  It opens grocery stores, hairdressers, fitness centers. </p><p>  A huge two-level parking for almost two thousand places is arranged for car parking.  It is equipped with a roof.  Guests of the complex can leave their cars in the ground parking, which provides space for 27 cars. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews about LCD &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078422.jpg"></div><p>  The obvious advantages of this residential complex include the fact that its construction is carried out in one of the most prestigious areas of the Russian capital.  So the acquisition of real estate here in any case will be a profitable and promising investment. </p><p>  In customer reviews of the Lobachevsky residential complex, they especially note that they like a spacious parking lot, the opportunity to go down to it by elevator. </p><p>  It looks attractive that most of the apartments are equipped with panoramic windows.  The complex has round-the-clock security, the LCD itself is under video surveillance.  The metro station "Michurinsky Prospekt" is also within walking distance, and the station "Aminievskoye Shosse" should be commissioned in 2019.  After that, the transport accessibility of this microdistrict will only improve, there will be even more positive reviews about the Lobachevsky residential complex. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.only-remontkvartir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location LCD &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078429.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, we must admit that this residential complex has enough shortcomings.  For example, they are associated with a not very good location, since the LCD is located in close proximity to the railway, which runs literally under the windows of new buildings.  About a kilometer - to the local thermal power station, the proximity of which significantly worsens the environmental situation in the entire microdistrict. </p><p>  As a result, such a neighborhood not only spoils the air.  It turns out to be so close that from the windows of the upper floors you can see the industrial zone with harmful enterprises, and the thermal power station, and the highway.  Admittedly, a little inspiring sight. </p><p>  In addition, a landfill is also located very close to the residential complex.  It is located in the Ochakov highway.  This fact can often be found in negative reviews of the Lobachevsky residential complex, for many it simply discourages the desire to buy real estate here, to invest its money, even though the microdistrict itself is considered very prestigious. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the fact that the apartments are rented without finishing.  Kindergarten and school are far enough away.  In addition, they have a shortage of free places.  Limited access to the territory of the residential complex, organized only on Aminyevskoye Shosse and Lobachevsky Street, leads to regular traffic jams in the morning and evening. </p><p>  In addition, newcomers should be prepared for expensive maintenance.  The management company will have to pay 60 rubles per square meter. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metering apartment LCD &quot;Lobachevsky" class="if uuid-3078424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078424.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of this residential complex is carried out by Bestcon.  LCD "Lobachevsky" is her next project.  It has been operating on the domestic real estate market for more than ten years. </p><p>  This construction and investment company in 2003 began to actively invest in housing construction.  Today it has become one of the largest developers in the country.  Successful work allows the implementation of a full cycle of development of commercial and residential real estate, starting from the design of the facility, ending with its construction, fulfilling the duties of the customer and the realtor. </p><p>  The company is characterized in that it never builds separate houses, thinking more globally.  She erects exclusively entire neighborhoods.  The principles of work that allowed her to occupy a leading position in the country are dynamics, reliability and confident security. </p><p>  Over the years of work in the real estate sector, the company has gained invaluable experience, constantly improving the level of customer service.  One of the main priorities for her remains a high level of trust of partners and customers.  The company carefully monitors that each employee regularly improves the quality of their work, takes special training courses, and improves their own skills. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the company builds houses in a variety of price and status segments.  The developer of the residential complex "Lobachevsky" is constantly striving to increase the number of offers in the market that they are ready to make to their customers.  In their practice, there are already apartments in economy-class new buildings, housing with the most difficult level finishes for apartments located in the historical center of Moscow, townhouses in club complexes of the capital and the Moscow Region. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  At the moment, directly from the developer, you can purchase one-, two-, three- and four-room apartments.  The cost of one square meter is from 183 to 210 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Measuring an apartment in the Lobachevsky residential complex will help to establish that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãodnushka is approximately 45 square meters. </p><p>  In this case, the buyer gets a kitchen with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 11 and a half "squares", a room of 17 and a half squares, a separate bathroom.  The cost of such housing is about eight and a half million rubles. </p><p>  The most spacious of the remaining options is a four-room apartment of 68 square meters for 24 million rubles.  In such a living space, the size of the kitchen will be 15 and a half "squares", three rooms of approximately 16 and one of almost 19 square meters. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  You can find a lot of positive reviews of residents about the residential complex "Lobachevsky".  Immediately after moving, the houses are warm, heating is connected without delay.  This is very important, especially in the winter period, as it allows you to immediately check the quality of windows, walls, measure the average temperature that can be achieved in apartments. </p><p>  In the reviews of the residential complex "Lobachevsky 120", real estate investors who have already purchased apartments in this house admit that a monolithic building, coupled with ventilated facades, really looks attractive and original, especially compared to most other new buildings. </p><p>  By putting the houses into operation, the developer manages to complete the main landscaping work.  Landscaping was carried out, children's and sports grounds were installed, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  Most are inclined to believe that the company really knows a lot about construction, all work is done efficiently and on time.  Even when deficiencies and shortcomings appear, they are quickly eliminated.  These are the reviews about the residential complex "Lobachevsky 120", which is now actively being populated. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative aspects, poor transport accessibility is mainly noted.  She has to focus on reviews to mystery shoppers in the residential complex "Lobachevsky".  No matter what the developer says, you constantly have to stand in traffic jams.  So, those who have personal vehicles are the first to suffer. </p><p>  In addition, the incessant noise from the CHPP, which does not subside even at night, interferes with living.  Steam and smoke from the station literally goes through the windows, especially if they go to the wrong side.  This is especially frustrating for those residents who paid a lot of money for real estate, and now they have to suffer from these problems.  The ecological situation in the microdistrict is really extremely unpleasant and tense. </p>
