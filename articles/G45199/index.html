    <p>  For the driver, a workplace is equipped in the new two-system electric locomotive, which controls the entire train.  The staff of this department is very pleased with such new equipment, since earlier it was necessary to change the locomotive in Kazan.  Now the electric locomotive copes with such a trip alone.  Named train Moscow ‚Äì Kazan (two-story) has a restaurant car specially for those who decide to have a snack on the road, which can take about 45 visitors at a time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first floor has 32 passenger seats, and the second - 31 seats, the remaining 50 are located in the head coach.

    <h2>  Service and passenger service </h2><p>  This new train was launched on June 1, 2015, and already in the first month of the trip between the capitals of Russia and Tatarstan, more than 40 thousand passengers took advantage of its services. </p><p>  The trip is long, so the service should be at the highest level, it is provided by the double-decker train Moscow ‚Äì Kazan.  The reviews by which one can judge comfort and coziness are only good, therefore it can be said that the service is at the highest level. </p><p>  In order to always keep the linen clean and ironed, at the end of the trip they take it to the laundry room, where it is quickly washed, ironed and even stacked with special machines.  The staff who meet at the station near the train are friendly and tidy, so the expectations of the trip can only develop in a favorable way. </p><h2>  Ticket price and travel time </h2><p>  The fare is formed at a dynamic pricing, that is, tickets can be bought at a low price at the moment when their sale for the Moscow-Kazan branded train (two-story) is open.  The photos taken on the platform of the stations may indicate a large passenger flow.  Only one conclusion follows from this: tickets are sold out very quickly, since their price corresponds to the quality of the trip. </p><p>  The fare in the SV-car is from 4200 rubles, and in ordinary compartments is much lower - from 2100 rubles.  If you have time to buy a ticket in the first days of sale, then the price can drop to 1,550 rubles, which is equivalent to a regular reserved seat on the same route, but it is no longer branded. </p>
