    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  In the Saratov region, the Irgiz River originates from the ramification of the <span>Common Syrt.</span>  The coordinates of the source are 52 ° 12'34 "N, 51 ° 18'55" in.  D., mouth coordinates - 52 ° 0'49 "N, 47 ° 23'7" in.  The river flows into the Volga and belongs to the Lower Volga basin.  Irgiz has a large catchment area - 24 thousand km, and 675 km - the length of the river.  The current is slow, as in most large and developed water streams.  In the summer, Bolshoi Irgiz dries up, and during the period from November to March, an ice drift is observed on the river.  In some places, <span>the Irgiz River</span> freezes completely.  And over the drain many dams were built. </p><p>  Sulak and Pugachev reservoirs are two water areas that are located on the river.  About 800 artificial reservoirs and ponds have been created, having a total volume of about 0.45 km³. </p><h2>  Origin and name </h2><p>  Scientists believe that the Irgiz hydronym is of Turkic origin.  Translated from this language, the name means "source".  Ahmad ibn Fadlan is an Arab traveler who mentioned this river in one of his studies in 921.  And her name was Irgiz.  At the time, there were many settlements on the banks of the water stream. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irgiz Saratov River" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1343115.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cities and villages </h2><p>  On Big Irgiz is Pugachev.  This is the only city that uses water in large quantities in industry and economy.  The remaining small villages and towns consume river reserves in smaller quantities.  For example, Sweatshirt, Belenka, Davydovka, Bolshaya Tavolozhka, Imeleevka, Klevenka and Old Porubechka.  There are also several more small settlements that are located on the banks of the Irgiz River. </p><h2>  Tributaries and lakes </h2><p>  The Irgiz River <span>(Saratov Region)</span> has many tributaries, both small and large enough.  The largest: the left - Rostashi (slightly less than 640 km), Bolshaya Glushitsa (more than 600 km), the right - Talovka (length - about 630 km), Karalyk (length - more than 560 km). </p><p>  Long, Naumovskoye, Podpolnoye, Kamyshovoye, Kalach - one of the largest and most famous lakes that are located in the basin of this stream. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irgiz River Saratov Region" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1343122.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Coastal fauna and fish </h2><p>  Big Irgiz surprises with its flora and fauna.  In the area of ​​Zhuravlihi there is a forest <span>where hares,</span> foxes, pheasants, wild boars <span>live</span> .  All of them come to the riverbank.  Wild boars are especially frequent in these areas for swimming.  They love dirt, and therefore this area is great for them.  There are many vipers, toads, midges, mosquitoes, spiders, lizards, otters, red ants on the shore.  Also, gulls nest their nests here, this is confirmed by the fact that the Irgiz River (Saratov Region) has a great relationship with the Volga.  A large number of fish live in the water: pike, ruff, pike perch, crucian carp, high water, roach, perch, and catfish. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the shore you can always see fishermen.  But especially a lot of them in the autumn and spring.  During good frosts in places where water freezes, there are daredevils who break through the ice-holes and catch fish. </p><h2>  Forest zone </h2><p>  The coastal flora of the river is almost the same on both sides.  You can see on the left bank many willows and aspens, which lower their branches to the water.  Of the herbaceous plants, plantain, wild grasses, tansy, dandelions, wormwood, <span>mouse peas,</span> and whiteheads are found.  Solanaceous grow on the slopes.  The right bank is overgrown with forest (about 140 m).  The most common trees are poplar, aspen, oak.  But the warty spindle tree, rosehip and blackthorn grow closer to the shore.  Basically, vegetation is represented by a large number of plants that easily tolerate the lack of sunlight, or those that love the shadow.  There are also many hops, celandine, plantain, nettle, sage, and many other species. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irgiz dam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1343119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aquatic flora </h2><p>  But vegetation in water is represented by fewer species.  What is unique is that there are a variety of plants in different areas.  One can meet <span>broadleaf cattail,</span> but its plantations are small.  Also in some places cane is found.  And there are areas where water lilies and egg capsules are the main decoration. </p><h2>  Dam on the Irgiz River </h2><p>  The dam has the following latitude coordinates - 51 ° 51′48.12 ″ and longitude - 48 ° 17′30.76 ″.  It was built to supply the Saratov Canal.  After rains and at the beginning of summer, the water there is dirty and muddy, and the rest of the time it is mirror-clear.  In hot weather, people in this area escape from the heat.  In winter, there is practically no one, so they come here to enjoy nature and beautiful views.  You can get to these places in 2 ways.  For example, enter from the highway, turning into the area of ​​Maloperekopny.  Or move from Sulak.  Dirt roads lead to the dam, on which absolutely any passenger car will pass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="overflow river irgiz" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1343123.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on the river </h2><p>  Overflow Irgiz River has small beaches.  There you can have a great vacation or weekend.  Especially in the summer there are many vacationers.  You can also go on a picnic to the wilder part, where the banks of the river “protect” willows and aspen.  Most often, tourists set up campsites and stay overnight to enjoy the beauty of Greater Irgiz. </p><p>  A lot of people come here every year to enjoy the scenery.  Acquaintances, friends or relatives invite someone, and some themselves find such an amazing place.  Here you can fry kebabs, sit by the fire and sing funny songs with a guitar.  Nobody forbids!  Fishermen will also find a worthy occupation, because the catch will be unforgettable. </p><p>  Children will also have a great time.  The water in the river is warm and warms up quickly.  Here you can swim;  the beaches are equipped, you can purchase swimming equipment and rent them.  The cost is small, so everyone can afford it.  Catamarans and boats are also provided.  The price per hour is also symbolic (up to 300 rubles). </p>
