The land of alpine taiga and steppes, the cleanest mountain streams and beautiful cascades of flowing water, transparent lakes and healing springs.  This is Khakassia.  Lake Tus, the rest on the shores of which attracts tourists not only from nearby areas, but from all over Russia, is compared with the famous Dead Sea.  The thing is that the salt content in its water is incredibly high and amounts to about 155 grams per liter in the bottom part.  The name of the lake is translated as ‚Äúsalt‚Äù.  It is impossible to drown in it, even diving really does not work - water immediately pushes to the surface.  Lake Tus has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 2.5 square meters.  km, the greatest depth is about 4.5 m, the coastline stretches for 8 km.

    <h2>  Leisure opportunities </h2><p>  Today, not only incorrigible romantics who are used to traveling on their own cars and live in tents come here, but also supporters of more comfortable conditions.  In recent years, camp sites have opened on the lake, where cottages with amenities are adjacent to the tent towns.  I must say that in the summer, recreation facilities on Lake Tus are very popular among tourists, therefore, places must be reserved in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center lake tus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/463706.jpg" width="600"></div>
