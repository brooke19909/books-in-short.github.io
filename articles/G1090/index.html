In general, the Chinese company Huawei is the largest player among similar manufacturers.  A presentation in the Russian Federation was scheduled shortly after the first announcement abroad.  To this end, in Moscow (and more precisely, in the ‚ÄúAfimall City‚Äù) a really grandiose show was held.  Moreover, the official Russian face of the brand, which introduced Honor 7, reviews of which the reader can find at the end of the review, was singer Natalya Ionova.

    <p>  It is interesting that in China itself, Huawei Honor 7, which phone owners have already written reviews, does not perceive as the creation of the company itself.  For residents of the Middle Kingdom, Honor is generally a sub-brand.  However, our citizens do not yet want to breed Huawei and Honor on opposite sides of the barricades.  Yes, and in today's review we will adhere to this point of view, since Honor itself is unlikely to be noticed or taken seriously by anyone. </p><p>  Huawei Honor, reviews of which are rapidly spreading on the Internet, can be purchased, for example, in the online store of the company M.Video.  The price of the device is currently about 23 thousand rubles.  However, the circulation of the smartphone in our country is limited, and if you want to purchase it, then do not postpone the purchase until tomorrow.  Otherwise, it may happen that waiting for the arrival of the goods will have a long and painful, as they say. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The internal competition of Honor 7 (gray graphite), reviews of which give the device a rating of 4 points, is the device under the name P8.  It has a less productive hardware stuffing, but for some reason, the Chinese manufacturer is positioning the device precisely as a premium one.  So, this smartphone costs 7 thousand rubles cheaper. </p><h2>  Brief Specifications </h2>

    <p>  Navigation in space is carried out due to the GPS and GLONASS modules. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The battery refers to non-removable devices.  This is a lithium-ion battery, which is designed for a capacity of 3100 mAh. </p><p>  The dimensions of the device are impressive.  With a height of 143.2 and a width of 71.9, the thickness of the smartphone is only 8.5 millimeters.  In this case, the mass of the device is equal to 157 grams. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What is included with the phone?  Having opened the package, for such a price we will find there only the device itself, a network adapter for recharging, and also a wire for synchronization with a personal computer.  Not very impressive.  Well, of course, there will be a brief user manual that no one has been reading for a long time, as well as a <span>warranty card.</span> </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  You have yet to find out <span>reviews about the Huawei</span> Honor 7 <span>smartphone</span> , and in the meantime, we are moving on to considering the appearance of the device.  It should be noted that the design of the model can be said to be classic.  Almost all modern smartphones have a similar appearance.  What is meant by the classic look? </p><p>  This is probably primarily a rectangular shape.  The corners of the device are well-smoothed.  Prevailing on the front side, of course, is a fairly large screen.  It occupies three quarters of the entire frontal surface.  But with all this, the subject of our review today looks presentable, which cannot be said.  There is a kind of sense of completeness of design.  The thing is that on the front part there are no decorative inserts or inscriptions.  Which, by the way, will only please the owners of the device. </p><p>  Interestingly, even the front camera and flash were placed at the same distances from the voice speaker. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device were selected very, very well.  With a thickness of 8.5 mm, the height of the apparatus is only 143, and the width is 71 mm.  Thus, we end up with a very compact smartphone, which looks quite harmless against the background of monsters equipped with a 5.5-inch screen diagonal.  It turns out that our device is not very "thin", but it does not at the same time resemble a garden shovel.  Weight is only 157 grams, which falls into the ideal interval. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  In the hand, the device lies conveniently and reliably, does not strive to slip anywhere.  The only problem is wet hands.  Materials of manufacture did not protect the apparatus from slipping in such a case.  In general, in similar situations, the risk increases many times.  But let's hope that this does not happen.  Reviews of Huawei Honor 7 (16GB) in terms of reliability once again prove that the materials need to be selected carefully, and we will move on to a more detailed study of the front surface of the device. </p><h2>  Front side </h2><p>  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protects it from physical damage. Many of the readers are surely familiar with this element, so we won‚Äôt go into details here.  In general, tests showed that for a period of up to a couple of weeks, large scratches do not appear even with loose contact with sharp objects.  However, we will not forget that minor scratches cannot be avoided, and during operation they will certainly let you know about yourself. </p><p>  There is <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Fingerprints on the screen still remain, but thanks to him, they are erased quite easily and quickly.  The finger glides confidently and simply along the surface of the front side.  Thus, we can automatically record all of the above into the advantages of a smartphone. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Well, it's time to take stock and talk about what people who have purchased this model of mobile phone think.  They repeatedly noted that there are no complaints about the quality of communication.  Firstly, the interlocutor is heard quite clearly and loudly.  Secondly, the connection via Wi-Fi does not disappear.  Thirdly, navigation in space works qualitatively.  There were no glitches in the GPS technology, the device always displayed where it needed to be. </p><p>  The price of Huawei Honor 7, reviews of which we are now analyzing, is 23 thousand rubles.  You can buy a smartphone in the online store.  In general, the device, of course, is at its best for the money.  Among the other advantages noted in the reviews are a high-quality and powerful main camera (and the front one too), strong hardware filling (and we are talking about a processor, a graphics accelerator and RAM).  You can not ignore the well-made body. </p><p>  According to reviews at the color level of the screen.  In sunlight, the picture does not fade.  In the headphones, the music sounds pretty decent, you can note the high quality of recording through a voice recorder.  The function of two SIM cards is supported.  Pleased users with the autonomous operation of the device.  The shell and software work smoothly, without glitches.  There is an indicator of missed events.  The device can be woken up by a double touch.  The sensor works through gloves. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, reviews note a weak flashlight, which plays the role of a flash for the front camera, as well as a slightly inhibitory sensor, designed to compare fingerprints. </p>
