  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rare varieties of Russian coins</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, in a handful of coins that were given to you for change, you can easily find one expensive one, about the cost of which not everyone knows.  Such money can easily end up in your wallet, although most of it was minted in the mint in order to replenish the collection of some numismatist.  Rare coins, which after a while become special, are obtained from defective money and the so-called hybrid coins.  Take, for example, a jubilee coin of ten rubles, which has an obverse with a ruble jubilee coin of the Republic of Moldova, and a reverse from a coin worth ten rubles. </p><h2>  Hybrid coin </h2><p>  The catalog includes coins, known in several copies, which are legitimate.  Usually they are copies that are made at both mints and are not included in the print run.  For example, a five-ruble and five-kopeck coin of 1999, a coin of fifty kopecks, five rubles of 2001 and two rubles of 2003.  This list can include a large number of varieties of metal money that have been issued since 2011 (except for 2013).  Their cost is now undetectable.  It will now differ significantly from one auction to another, and will change in both directions.  These types of coins in Russia will be the most expensive.  The lower limit on the value of such coins will be kept at around one hundred thousand Russian rubles.  For example, the price of a ten-ruble coin in 2011, which was sold at a recent auction, reached 105,500 rubles.  Based on this, the rare and valuable coins described below will be composed of provided modern and commemorative coins that you can give for change in the store. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Five-ruble coin of 2003 </h2><p>  The price of this five-ruble coin at the end of 2017 and 2018 was ten thousand rubles.  By the number of rare instances multiple of the ruble, there are many such coins in comparison with the rest.  In any case, getting this coin in the store is a great success! </p><h2>  Coin 50 kopecks 2007 </h2><p>  This kind of coins, which has a rare obverse, like the five-penny coin of 2007, occupies the first position.  Its distinguishing feature is its wide obverse edging, which consists of a pair of rings, because the nickel will not be as large as fifty penny coins.  At the moment, only a couple of them have been found, and at the auction these coins will cost you seventy thousand. </p><p>  The five-copeck copy of 2006, which is made on ten copecks, has a price slightly less.  During the manufacture of this coin, it was assumed that it was coated with a dusting.  However, after examination by experts, it was confirmed that the coin was made of copper and zinc and is consistent with the diameter. </p><p>  For 10 rubles in 2012, they offer more than twenty thousand.  Its reverse was carried out with the help of a stamp that appeared in 2009.  She has a thick bottom line at zero that forms a semicircle. </p><h2>  Ruble 1997 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One ruble 1997" class="if uuid-3038954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3038954.jpg"></div><p>  This ruble differs from other rubles of the same coinage in that it has a wide edging.  On the side without an eagle, a leaf of the plant on the edge hides slightly behind the edging.  This is a pretty expensive model.  Today, its value can reach eight thousand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  2003 ruble coin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sola.ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One ruble 2003" class="if uuid-3039089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3039089.jpg"></div><p>  This type of coin in 1 ruble today will cost the buyer 20 thousand Russian rubles.  Just yesterday, she was on top of coins that beat all records, but over time, the cost drops.  In any case, it is the rarest ruble denomination coin of 2003, which got into circulation.  This refers to a coin of the usual execution.  If this particular coin came to you, then you are very lucky. </p><p>  The next rare coin of this list is a two-ruble coin of 2013 with the reverse of "Sht.2.2 (Yu.K)".  An expert in this area would recommend that you be careful and follow the purchase for wide, smooth cuts in the top sheet.  At the moment, the value of the coin is in the range of 17500-19200 rubles. </p><p>  When buying a coin variant of 10 kopecks in 2002, you also need to be careful.  Its uniqueness can be determined by how the letter "M" is located.  Real connoisseurs will pay you 16,000 rubles for it. </p><p>  Since 2006, ten and fifty kopecks coins have been minted in plated steel.  However, a small part dating from the following year is minted in brass.  Thus, 50 kopecks of 2007 were released, which have a smooth edge.  This instance differs from the samples of another decade, which were clearly ordered, in that it is legal.  Now its price is about 15 thousand Russian rubles, but numismatists believe that this coin is extremely underestimated now, and are in no hurry to sell it. </p><h2>  Rare ruble and two ruble coins of 2001 (MMD) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.numista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="two rubles of 2001" class="if uuid-3038964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3038964.jpg"></div><p>  These coins rightfully bear the title of one of the rarest, because, in principle, they should not have come into circulation.  Their weight is just over three grams, and the thickness is one and a half millimeters.  The edge has about 110 corrugations.  The exact value of this coin is now quite difficult to determine, since there are not very many of them. </p><h2>  2003 two-ruble coin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Two rubles 2003" class="if uuid-3038974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3038974.jpg"></div><p>  Just a couple of years ago, this coin could cost the buyer more than 15 thousand rubles.  However, after the crisis, its value has decreased significantly due to the reduced number of collectors who want to get it.  However, this coin is still considered very rare. </p><h2>  Two-ruble coin of 2001 with the image of Yuri Gagarin </h2><p>  Her obverse without an image of the mint today will cost the buyer about 12 thousand Russian rubles.  Professionals, having examined it, noted that this two-ruble coin was issued by the MMD.  The image of the mint in which it was released is not on it.  Its price will largely depend on how secure it will be.  When trying to get this coin, be careful and beware of fakes - fraudsters can disguise interference by polishing it or cutting off the logo. </p><p>  In the varieties of the coin of 50 kopecks in 2002, the stamp "1E (Yu.K)" and "1.2V (A.S.)" are allocated.  These options are determined by the location of the letter "M".  The differences are so small that, most likely, specialist help will be needed.  The cost will be determined based on the demand for the coin and will vary from seven to fifteen thousand Russian rubles. </p><p>  Recently, an interesting prototype with a face value of two rubles, dated 2009, was discovered.  These coins are magnetized, although they are not covered with electroplating, but cupronickel.  Their color is similar to the color of five-ruble coins minted in 2009.  Rare two-ruble coins can be identified by the type of seam and plating.  At the moment, they will cost about eleven thousand Russian rubles.  Their value will increase or decrease, while it is not clear. </p><h2>  Ten rubles 2010 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ten rubles 2010" class="if uuid-3039104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3039104.jpg"></div><p>  Ten rubles in 2010 is the most expensive commemorative bimetallic coin.  About a hundred thousand were released, and the relative majority settled in Salekhard.  The cost of each sample is directly proportional to its appearance, and recently the price of this type of coin of 10 rubles almost exceeded 20 thousand, but after the economic collapse, the solvency of amateur numismatists slightly crippled it. </p><h2>  Three pennies of 1940 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three pennies of 1940" class="if uuid-3038956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113900/3038956.jpg"></div><p>  3 kopecks is a type of coin that is not issued today in Russia, but in the USSR such money was in circulation.  Often the extraordinary thing lies in the obverse, but this coin is extraordinary just because it has an extraordinary reverse.  She has a flat star on her front side.  At the auction, "Coins of the country of the Soviets" sold one such in good condition, and bought it for almost one hundred thousand rubles. </p>
