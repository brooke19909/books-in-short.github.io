  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the human ear, jaws and head.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The structure of a</span> person‚Äôs <span>ear</span> is a whole chain of ear canals, so important that any negative effect can become a very serious problem. </p><p>  Thanks to the four sections, we can pick up any sounds that surround us.  The most visible organ for us is the <span>auricle</span> and beyond it the external auditory canal.  The sound passes through it to the <span>middle ear.</span>  If the <span>outer ear has</span> undergone deformity at birth, the sound cannot pass normally.  Hearing can also be impaired due to sulfur, which often blocks the ear canal. </p><p>  No matter how we look at the structure of the human ear, we will not see the middle ear.  However, it is and it is located behind the eardrum.  The middle ear cavity is ideally filled with air, but in the presence of any disease, it is filled with fluid.  Eardrum immobility indicates the presence of fluid, inflammation, or other abnormalities. </p><p>  Further, the structure of the human ear is represented by the inner ear, in which about forty thousand hair cells are located.  They are catchers of <span>sound vibrations of</span> different frequencies and generators of weak electrical impulses transmitted to the brain, or rather to its cortex.  Damage or loss of hair cells is a stopper for electrical impulses, resulting in significant hearing impairment. </p><p>  The cochlea and the auditory centers of the brain are the passage for the fibers of the auditory nerve.  The electrical impulses that arise in the cochlea reach the auditory centers of the brain, and the obstacles that arise in their way distort the sound.  He becomes fuzzy, muffled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The structure of the human ear is a difficult hearing aid, which requires special attention and careful care. </p><p>  The structure of the jaw of a person is a very complex mechanism that, at first glance, seems to perform only a chewing function.  However, it is not. </p><p>  The most important is the <span>upper jaw, a</span> pair located in the upper front region of the facial skull.  It is considered one of the air bones that form the maxillary sinus. </p><p>  The bone itself is represented by the body and four processes.  The body has four surfaces: orbital, anterior, nasal, infratemporal.  The bone processes have frontal, zygomatic, alveolar and frontal parts. </p><p>  The lower jaw is represented by unpaired bone.  In itself, it is large and strong, having two symmetrical halves that grow together in the middle into a single bone by the first year of a child's life.  The lower jaw has a body and a pair of flattened branches.  The body of the lower jaw is due to the base and upper part.  The upper part smoothly passes into the so-called <span>alveolar process.</span>  Each side of the lower jaw forms the angle of the lower jaw.  The result of the dentist's work depends on the knowledge of the structure of the bone of the lower jaw. </p><p>  The structure of the human head is the structure of his skull, which is divided into two parts - the facial and brain. </p><p>  The brain is represented by the frontal, two parietal, two temporal, occipital and other bones.  All these bones serve as reliable protection to the brain.  Separate bones of the brain skull are interconnected by a very complicated suture, reminiscent of the connection of the teeth of a crocodile, which, when attached, each enters its recess. </p><p>  Inside the brain part of the skull is represented by a cavity that is filled with the brain. </p><p>  The front part has paired bones: maxillary, zygomatic, nasal, palatine, unpaired mandibular.  The bones are interconnected motionless. </p><p>  Also in the front part there is a nasal cavity, an oral cavity and two eye sockets. </p><p>  The orbit has the form of a deep hollow in which the eyeball is located, framed by a plexus of nerves, muscles and blood vessels. </p><p>  <span>The nasal cavity</span> is divided by a septum into two halves, each of which has narrowed nasal passages. </p><p>  The oral cavity is separated from the nasal using the palatine bones and processes of the maxillary.  It is bounded by the upper and lower edges of the jaws. </p>
