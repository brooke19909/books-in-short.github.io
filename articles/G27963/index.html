Restore iPhone factory settings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Along with sophisticated technologies, paradoxically, the operational moment of using electronic gadgets is simplified.  However, not every owner of the "apple" device knows how to <span>restore contacts</span> on the iPhone.  Sometimes the user may encounter other difficult situations, which he, in principle, is able to resolve independently.  However, the method that is not always used by a person in order to save data from the phone or return the "wound" settings to their initial state is rational.  As a result of which there is an unjustified waste of time and even more than that, this fact may become a reason for contacting specialists.  That as a result of improper actions with the mobile device and the use of third-party unlicensed software, the phone starts to ‚Äúfail‚Äù, respectively, loses its functional ability.  To avoid all this, you should pay special attention to the material of the presented article, from which you will learn about <span>how to restore iPhone</span> from iCloud and a lot of other useful information. </p><h2>  It‚Äôs worth considering ... </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore contacts on iPhone?" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/368773.jpg" width="338"></div></h2><p>  Your smartphone is, first of all, a multifunctional device controlled by the iOS mobile operating system, which, in turn, is a simplified version of Mac OS X. It's no secret that phone software sometimes requires updating, and in some cases, its complete reinstallation.  Buying a newer device, all of the same Apple brand, can be fraught with a lot of inconvenience, primarily regarding the issue of how to restore contacts on the iPhone.  And even such phenomena as theft and loss of the device will not be so catastrophic in nature, given that it is possible to return all the data in its original state to a smartphone of a similar model.  As a result, we have a number of compelling arguments in favor of the appropriateness of using standard tools from the manufacturer to store and restore data, the use of which determines the efficiency and ease of solving many difficult operational situations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Sky safe": what can be more reliable? </h2><p>  Cloud technologies today are at the peak of popularity - it is simple, reliable, and at the same time absolutely free, of course, if the user does not have an increased "appetite", expressed in a significant amount of information.  To help you resolve the issue of how to recover iPhone from iCloud, let's look at the main features of this program. </p><h2>  So what is it all about and how does it work? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore contacts from iCloud?" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/368772.jpg?1396840752925" width="600"></div></h2><p>  If you are an iPhone smartphone user, then you are familiar with concepts such as an account and an Apple ID.  ICloud service allocates 5 GB of free space on its server, and it‚Äôs completely free.  Everyone who wants an iPhone can use this service, which is incredibly convenient and extremely necessary, given the software imperfection of the device and the human factor as a whole.  In order to be able to restore the saved data from the iPhone backup, you need to go into the installed iCloud application and make the initial settings.  It is worth noting that, by default, the data will be automatically backed up to all standard programs installed by Apple at the smartphone production stage.  For the sake of saving the allocated space, it is advisable to disable unnecessary applications that synchronize their data with iCloud.  A fairly understandable configuration process is fraught with several unexpected points.  In particular, automatic <span>backup</span> is performed provided that the device is connected to a power source, in the case when the iPhone is in lock mode and Wi-Fi is activated.  However, the user can always manually create a backup in the <span>cloud storage,</span> which also does not seem to be a particularly difficult process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to restore iPhone via iTunes? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Restore iPhone to factory settings" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/368775.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In relation to models older than the 4S smartphone, the popular program for <span>synchronizing iPhone devices</span> retains all the same devotion and favorable conditions for interaction.  Nevertheless, for full data backup, the installed software version must be up-to-date and correspond to the latest publicly available update.  Of course, the principle of the program has not changed in anything and everything is also simple and extremely understandable in terms of use.  The only restriction may be the mismatch between the software of the connected iPhone and the <span>backup copy of the data</span> "merged" from the device with an earlier version of iOS.  In order to restore iPhone factory settings, just go to the device settings, go to the "Basic" tab, then "Reset" and finally "Reset all settings".  This completes the process.  But to remove the jailbreak, you will need iTunes and the coveted "Restore" button.  By the way, being directly in the program, just press the key combination "Shift" + "Restore" and you can select a file with a previously downloaded version of the software. </p><h2>  Make the best choice </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore iPhone via iTunes?" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/368774.jpg?1396841076940" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The two main ways to restore contacts on the iPhone, as you noticed, are fundamentally different.  The cloud option is most acceptable, as it does not make you dependent on the computer and is completely comfortable.  Familiar iTunes becomes nothing more than a convenient intermediary in comparison with the effective iCloud service.  But, nevertheless, one more important point should be taken into account: cloud technologies imply the use of an Internet connection, and also put the user before the fact: 5 GB and not a kilobyte more than the established limit.  Therefore, a universal solution is seen - to use two possibilities, so to speak in tandem. </p><p>  And then the question of how to restore contacts on the iPhone, you will no longer have.  Moreover, storing data in iCloud, you can always transfer some of the information to your computer, thereby freeing up precious and at the same time free space in the cloud.  So it is advisable to use two synchronization options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Restore from iPhone Backup" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/368777.jpg?1396841547621" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In conclusion, or recalling the past </h2><p>  Of course, to this day, <span>first-</span> generation <span>iPhones</span> are used, so to speak, "early apples."  For such phones, it is not possible to climb to the "cloud peaks", due to their technical imperfections.  Therefore, a better and more effective method for you and your device than using iTunes and not find it.  So "get comfortable" with this thought, until you get another California gadget. </p>
