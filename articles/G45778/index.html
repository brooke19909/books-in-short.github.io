Menshikov, a favorite and close associate of Peter I, was one of the prominent military, political, statesmen of Russia of the 19th century.  In addition, he was a diplomat, headed naval institutions, participated in many campaigns, and was close to the two emperors.  He was famous in society for his wit and gaiety.  He was also the largest bibliophile of his time, collecting a library of more than fifty thousand books. </p><h2>  Some facts of life </h2><p>  A brief biography of Alexander Menshikov, which will be described in the framework of this article, is interesting in that it shows how versatile and multifaceted his activity was.  He was born in a military family, received an excellent home education, studied at German universities.

    <p>  However, very soon he entered the military service and distinguished himself in the war with Turkey (in 1810-1811).  Alexander Sergeevich took part in the siege and capture of a number of fortresses, in the crossing of the Danube.  The young man proved himself well, showing courage and completing various assignments, for which he received the Order of St. Vladimir.  After that, he became adjutant to the emperor, thus entering his retinue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Order of St. Vladimir" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1283980.jpg" width="360"></div></h2><h2>  Military career </h2><p>  He distinguished himself during the years of World War II.  During this period, Menshikov was at the main headquarters and participated in all the major battles with the French.  Then he received a promotion, becoming a captain.  Together with the Russian troops, he went on campaigns abroad and at that time managed to establish himself well before the emperor, having fulfilled one very difficult assignment.  Menshikov Alexander Sergeevich was supposed to convey to the Swedish commander that the Allied forces had joined and went on the offensive.  He successfully coped with the task, which earned the almost complete trust of Alexander I. Menshikov fought in several battles, for which he received a new award - the Order of St. Vladimir.  An indicator of the emperor‚Äôs confidence in him is that he accompanied his ruler in all European congresses dedicated to deciding the fate of countries after the Napoleonic wars. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Governor General of Finland" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1283982.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Civil service </h2><p>  In 1816, Menshikov Alexander Sergeevich received a new responsible post in the office at the main headquarters.  But at that time Arakcheyev came forward at the court, who did not like him.  As a result of this, Menshikov‚Äôs position was shaken. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The final break with the court occurred after he decided to create a project to free the serfs of the landlords.  In principle, this issue was relevant at the beginning of the reign of the emperor, but at the end of his reign many liberal projects were curtailed, including various options for the abolition of serfdom.  However, Alexander Menshikov in 1821, together with two other prominent statesmen, presented a plan for the elimination of serfdom, which was perceived by the tsar as too brave.  After this incident, he was even known as a freethinker, which led to his removal from the court, and under these circumstances: he was asked to take a diplomatic post in Dresden, which he took as a personal insult and as a hint of the need to leave the ruler.  Alexander Sergeyevich refused this post and left for his estate. </p><h2>  Fleet Reform </h2><p>  The next stage of his life is connected with the accession of a new emperor - Nicholas I. By his own request, he was returned to service.  The first stage of the reign of the new ruler was marked by a desire to reorganize the fleet, which under his predecessor almost did not reform.  <span>Nicholas the First</span> energetically took up his transformation, he delved into all the details, monitored the construction of ships, the preparation of plans.  Menshikov was not familiar with marine affairs in practice, but during his stay in the village he studied the necessary course in books under the guidance of his neighbor, who was versed in this discipline. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Sergeevich Menshikov 1787 1869" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1283984.jpg" width="377"></div></h2><h2>  New stage of activity </h2><p>  After his return to the capital, Alexander Sergeyevich presented to the emperor a project for the transformation of the maritime department, which was supposed to be changed according to the example of military command.  A special role was given to the main headquarters of the naval department, whose chief acted as an intermediary between the king and the fleet.  Menshikov served as head of the naval headquarters for quite some time - from 1829 to 1855.  Subsequently, his activities led to the fact that the Minister of the Sea, in fact, lost its significance, giving way to his new chief of staff.  As the Governor-General of Finland, Menshikov, however, continued his military career. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="short biography of Alexander Menshikov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1283987.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Participation in wars </h2><p>  Occupying high civilian posts, Alexander Sergeevich, however, continued to participate in combat battles.  Menshikov distinguished himself in the war with Turkey.  He took a number of fortresses, and before the start of the <span>Crimean War he</span> carried out diplomatic missions.  After the outbreak of hostilities led the naval and land forces, but the activities in this post did not bring him fame.  Under his command, the Russian army suffered a number of serious defeats from the allies.  Despite the fact that the first decades of the reign of Nicholas I carried out reforms to reorganize the fleet, however, the Russian sailing ships could not resist the enemy's steam ships.  After the failure of the war, Menshikov was removed from military posts, retaining the rank of adjutant and member of the state council.  After that, he retired to his village, where he died in 1869. </p>
