    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Currently, India is quite a popular country in terms of tourism.  This is due to many factors: rich natural resources, religious centers, oriental practices and much more.  It is not surprising that every year more and more hotels open here, which are ready not only at affordable prices to accommodate tourists, but also offer them original entertainment programs.  The Orange House 1 * is no exception. </p><p>  North Goa (India) is a picturesque place with a subequatorial climate.  The southwestern part of it has access to the sea.  It is here, in the village of Anjuna, that the hotel is located.  You can get to it by taxi or bus from the airport, located near the village of Dabolim.  The distance is approximately 45 km.  This information is relevant for those who travel on their own.  And the cost of tourist tickets, as a rule, includes a transfer from the airport and back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Orange House Hotel was founded in 2013 and got its name for a simple reason.  It has a bright color finish, which stands out sharply in the general landscape.  Although tourists are inclined to a different version, believing that such an unusual name corresponds to its home environment. </p><p>  The two-story building has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã250 square meters and includes only 12 comfortable rooms.  Thanks to its modest territorial scale and spaciousness, this service has received 1 * status.  The rest of the service is quite high quality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the orange house india" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1456381.jpg" width="500"></div>

Here couples or a group of friends can relax in comfort.  For this, double and connecting rooms with one double and two single beds are provided.  The rooms are modestly but tastefully furnished.

Unfortunately, tourists vacationing with children, the hotel cannot offer lullabies and cribs.  But the service of an additional guest in the room is valid. </p><p>  The windows of the rooms offer a magical view of the square, palm trees, the sea and the beach.

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  The list of hotel services for one star is quite wide.

Or all this can be transferred to the ground floor in a specially equipped breakfast room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The entertainment program of the Indian service The Orange House includes active tourist excursions, hiking, wellness practices (yoga, mandala).

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  There is no specific beach area that The Orange House would have.  India from the southwestern part is washed by the Arabian Sea.  The coastline here stretches for tens of kilometers.  It is conditionally divided into private and public areas.  Therefore, tourists who relax at the hotel can freely visit the village beach of Anjuna or the private Baga and Vagator.  There are <span>bars, cafes,</span> umbrellas and deck chairs for rent, lifeguards and boat services on duty. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  India, in the view of tourists, is often associated as a country with a low level of service, unscrupulous, crowded, fussy.  Therefore, going here, people are subconsciously ready to endure various conditions.  However, this is by no means the case at The Orange House.  The reviews about it were overwhelmingly positive.  Moreover, some tourists believe that in terms of its level, this service may well qualify for three or even more stars.  But let‚Äôs leave this to the experts. </p><p>  What advantages have experienced travelers noted for themselves?  And were there finicky guests who, on the contrary, did not enjoy the local service? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the orange house reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1456375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  The first thing that was welcomed was <span>the hospitality of the</span> Hindus.  Guarded territory, friendly staff, quick accommodation by numbers confirm a serious and conscientious approach to business. </li><li>  Next, it should be noted sunny and bright interior.  Everything here is filled with harmony and cordiality.  Not to notice it is simply impossible. </li><li>  Now let's move on to the numbers.  Here, cleanliness, comfort, relative spaciousness and, of course, a comfortable balcony with a wonderful view were noted here. </li><li>  In the Indian resort areas it is difficult to find noisy parties, discos.  People come here in search of maximum relaxation, peace of mind, moving away from everyday hustle and bustle.  Carelessness is given by active and informative walks, excursions, simple relaxation on the beach under the gentle splash of sea waves.  This is the direction of relaxation that couples and athletic youth welcome.  It is also noteworthy that the hotel has a dozen rooms, so you can feel at home here, without the noise, excitement and bustle of many tourists. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Pluses include such trifles as a comfortable bed and shower, the availability of an internal telephone in the room and round-the-clock service, as well as the provision of scooters for rent.  Although by general standards the distance from the hotel to public places is small, but this approach saves time on vanity and leaves it for a long-awaited vacation.  Especially not far from The Orange House runs the track.  Therefore, you can get to the right place without difficulty and danger, bypassing local reliefs. </li><li>  At the reception at the hotel there is a safe where tourists are advised to hand over documents and valuables.  And although no theft was noted, this service is marked by a plus sign. </li><li>  And, finally, the most enjoyable moment in this hotel was affordable prices.  Compared to the exquisite European and Thai resorts, one person‚Äôs vacation here during the week is several times cheaper.  Of course, everything will depend on additional services and entertainment. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Despite the harmonious picture, there were still a few points that were met negatively. </p><ul><li>  These include the fact of a temporary lack of hot water.  According to some tourists, it is uninterruptedly served in the morning and afternoon.  And in the evening there are problems.  However, such comments are sporadic.  It can be assumed that this season, for example, repairs were carried out and this problem was temporary. </li><li>  A visit to The Orange House (Goa) during the summer was spoiled by damp weather.  And this is not surprising!  After all, the influx of tourists here is celebrated from September to May.  Since it is during this period that the weather is favorable for sea vacations.  The average temperature is about 30 degrees.  Warm water.  In the summer season, monsoons and lower temperatures are observed. </li><li>  Reviews of experienced tourists categorically do not recommend handing things to the laundry, arguing that clothes are dried under the scorching sun.  And this method can harm the color and quality of the fabrics. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The beach is a kilometer away.  To overcome it on foot is not to everyone's taste.  For this part of the rental of bicycles and scooters is also provided.  And this is an additional expense. </li><li>  And another drawback was the language barrier.  The fact is that all the staff in the hotel speaks English.  People who do not own it will have to hire a translator and pay extra for their services.  Of course, there is another option - to choose another resort, where there is no such difficulty. </li></ul>
