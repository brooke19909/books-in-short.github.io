Greece is a very friendly and safe country in relation to tourism.  The first thing to do before traveling is to open a visa.  This can be done through the consulate directly, as well as use the services of visa centers or travel agencies.  Most often, Russians buy package tours to this country, which include round-trip flights, accommodation at the chosen hotel, insurance and visa support. </p>

    <p>  When passing customs control at <span>airports (Heraklion,</span> Chania, Diagoras, etc.) they may be asked to present an amount of 50 euros or equivalent in another currency.  A tourist can carry 200 cigarettes and 1 liter of a strong alcoholic drink.  It is recommended to keep all receipts for purchases made during the holidays.  Duty-free, you can export goods from the country for a total amount of 50 euros, in other cases, you will need to pay tax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Greeks are very good visitors.  This is understandable, because the main source of state revenue is tourism.  Travelers are often invited to visit, and denial may be perceived as an insult.  Locals are very friendly, funny, they gesticulate a lot.  The body language of the Greeks is somewhat different from Russian non-verbal communication.  For example, our gesture of a clasped palm and a thumb raised up does not mean ‚Äúall is well‚Äù, but an insulting order to shut up.  There are many differences, so when communicating it is better not to use facial expressions and body language. </p><p>  When visiting public places, it should be remembered that although the Greeks honor Dionysus (the god of winemaking), one cannot drink obscene in bars, cafes and taverns.  There are a lot of churches and temples in the country.  Women should know that being in trousers or clothing with bare shoulders in such places is unacceptable. </p><h2>  Rhodes: climate, nature, characteristics </h2><p>  The resort town is located in the southeast of the island of the same name, whose area is slightly less than 1.5 thousand km, and is its administrative center.  According to ancient Greek mythology, Rhodes is the home of Helios.  That is why the island has 300 sunny days a year.  In the middle of summer (July and August) the weather is very hot and dry.  The best time to visit the island: the end of spring - the beginning of autumn. </p>

    <p>  Tourists who come here can swim in two seas at once: the Mediterranean (in the east) and the Aegean (in the west).  The subtropical climate contributes to the lush growth of cypress and citrus trees, pines.  Windsurfing is very popular on the northwest coast; fans of this active sport are attracted by the large waves of the Aegean Sea.  The east of the island is perfect for a beach holiday, where the coast is covered by mountains.  Here is a quiet and calm Mediterranean. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city originated in the Middle Ages, so tourists are interested in considering the preserved fortress walls, castles and many other buildings from the time of the Knights.
