  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hotels: the need for a careful choice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Going to a foreign city on your own initiative, as a planned trip or as part of a business trip, the priority is to find a good option for temporary housing.  To date, the choice is quite large.  The hotel business is developing quite rapidly, especially in large cities.  Here and there large-scale hotel complexes and mini-hotels appear, hostels and establishments of a budget format are being built. </p><p>  Some prefer rental housing.  But, nevertheless, it is better to carry out the first visit to an unfamiliar city, having secured a reliable option.  And such hotels are most often. </p><p>  In order to minimize your risks, you should turn to trusted sources, give preference to hotels, information about which can easily be found not only on official websites, but also on other portals, forums and among reviews. </p><p>  For example, if you are interested <noindex>  <span>hotels in murmansk prices</span> </noindex>  to rooms in which they would be happy with their correlation with the quality of the services offered, you can ask for help at specialized sites that accumulate relevant information and help to make reservations. </p><p>  Disappointments in the possible discrepancy between the expected picture and reality can be avoided if you carefully approach the process of booking a room in the selected hotel.  To do this, you need to not only study the information provided on the site, consider the photos, but it is advisable to contact the hotel representative by e-mail or by phone.  Focusing on the availability of a bathroom in a room, the features of the room environment, many miss important details of the reservation, which are fraught with additional costs, which you can not count on.  Extreme attentiveness will help to avoid embarrassment, especially when it comes to offers that attract primarily in their value. </p><p>  It is necessary to clarify the time of entry and eviction, features of the service, the availability and format of the proposed breakfast.  In some cases, insufficient attention to these aspects may result in negative experience.  It is also important to study the nearby infrastructure: where are the cafes and shops, the convenience of transport interchange. </p><p>  As noted above, hotels come in different formats.  Sometimes this term refers to a rather non-standard essence of the service.  Such as, <noindex>  <span>social hotels in Moscow</span> </noindex>  .  Essentially, they are a temporary free haven for people who have lost their homes for some reason or are in a difficult situation. </p></div></article>
