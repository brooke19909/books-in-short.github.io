    <h2>  Bella Vista 4 * (Montenegro): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists claim that for a holiday in Montenegro it is not at all necessary to choose a five-star hotel.  In the "Quartet" for a lower fee you will receive the same level of service.  ‚ÄúBella Vista‚Äù can be compared with any Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  Great location relative to the beach, restaurants and shops.  Fifty meters away is a <span>bus stop</span> where you can leave for Budva, Rafailovici, Petrovac, and the airport in Tivat.  Tourists were struck by the fact that people with very young children come to this hotel, in fact with babies.  At the same time, the hotel is very quiet and calm.  You could sleep with an open balcony door - no noise from the discos was heard. </p>
