Even those who, by chance, do not manage to capture a few weeks for complete relaxation, tend to spend a short weekend communicating with nature.  Some pack their bags in anticipation of the warm sand and the hot sun of the tropics.  Others are looking for the best options for relaxing for a day. </p><p>  In order to enjoy the unique nature and unspoilt beauty of the landscape, it is not necessary to travel far.  Maybe in the area next to you is just what you are looking for.  Take Belarus, for example.  On the territory of this small country there are many lakes and rivers, where both the local population and visiting tourists relax with great pleasure.  The Braslav <span>Lakes, Naroch,</span> Minsk Sea, <span>the Pripyat,</span> Neman and <span>Western Dvina</span> <span>rivers</span> are especially popular among them <span>.</span>  However, there are not so famous, but no less picturesque places in Belarus.  These include chalk quarries near Volkovysk.  Photos of these amazing beauties can be found quite often.  Many are surprised to learn that these landscapes are of Belarusian origin, and not at all some Maldives or Seychelles. </p>

    <h2>  Swim in azure water </h2><p>  Cretaceous quarries near Volkovysk (near the urban village of Krasnoselsky) fall in love with themselves at first sight.  Such a beautiful landscape is rarely seen in temperate latitudes.  Water in artificial reservoirs has a bright color: from azure to green-blue.  Moreover, it is very clean, although slightly cloudy.  However, this property is caused by the high concentration of chalk in it.  Swimming in such water is not only possible, but also necessary.  It is very beneficial for the skin.  The lack of benefits of civilization, natural beauties, amazing in their properties of water - all this attracts tourists who come to at least look at the <span>chalky quarries of Belarus</span> near Volkovysk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lack of goods </h2><p>  It would seem that such a place should become a mecca for tourists.  However, no steps have been taken to ennoble this territory.  In addition, at the entrance to the chalk quarries near Volkovysk there are quite often signs "Danger zone" and "Swimming is prohibited."  The thing is that the rocks here are very unstable and can fail.  The local population claims that often during the mining of chalk find deep caves and pits formed in the Neolithic era.  At the bottom of one of the quarries lies MAZ.  He fell under the chalk during the work process.  However, even these horrors do not frighten the public, and every year, as soon as the sun begins to bake, the chalk quarries along Volkovysk become a magnet for tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the chalk from? </h2><p>  Historians believe that during the ice age, a huge layer of chalk was raised from the bottom of the ocean.  Under the pressure of the frozen masses, the rock broke up into large blocks.  One of them is now resting near the village of Krasnoselsky.  The glacier is gone, but the Cretaceous rocks remain.  On the surface of the earth, fragments of the block extend several kilometers in length.  Their thickness and height are also surprising.  It is sometimes difficult to understand that the embankment that has spread underfoot consists of chalk.  Only a thin layer of sand and vegetation hides from the eyes of the true master of the slopes.  The absence of any animal and plant organisms is also a distinctive feature that characterizes the Cretaceous quarries near Volkovysk.  Relaxing in this area is a real adventure.  Smear with useful substance, swim in azure water, sunbathe on the slopes of elevations and enjoy the amazingly beautiful scenery - what could be better on a sultry summer day! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Their number is hundreds </h2><p>  Cretaceous quarries near Volkovysk are located on a rather large territory.  Their number is also very impressive.  Intensive mining allows you to enjoy the beauty of not a dozen, but several hundred quarries.  The path to the wild places takes quite a long time. </p><p>  The public is most interested in new, only recently abandoned careers.  It is there that the water has a bright, saturated hue.  As a rule, over time, the reservoir loses its colors and becomes similar to the usual lakes and ponds.  Therefore, it is not surprising that most tourists come to admire the azure surface of new quarries. </p><h2>  The emergence of artificial lakes </h2><p>  Any process associated with the extraction of minerals such as chalk, clay and sand is accompanied by the appearance of water.  When production in one place ends, the equipment is distilled to another place, and the water remains.  Its bright, eye-charming color is the result of chemical reactions between alkaline metals located in the thickness of the chalk.  The liquid itself is a bit like soap: the same dense and oily.  In this case, the water is quite clear. </p>

    <h2>  How can I get to </h2><p>  Starting from the capital of Belarus - Minsk, get ready for a long (almost four-hour) journey.  However, the long road is worth it.  After the agreed time, a magnificent panorama opens up before the eyes of the traveler - the chalk quarries near Volkovysk.  The map will show that the path should be kept to Volkovysk, and then from it go to the village of Krasnoselsk. </p><p>  At the moment, government structures are discussing what to do with this land.  To refine the territory of quarries or protect it from the attention of tourists?  Today, swimming is officially impossible here, but the lack of protection makes this ban unfounded. </p>
