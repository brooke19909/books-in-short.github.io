    <p>  After graduating from college, Andrei went to work on the Dneprovsky collective farm.  Not having much experience, he managed to develop a new variety of red carnations.  In general, no matter what Andrew undertook, everything worked out well for him.  He knew how to repair equipment and bake pies.  Being drafted into the army, he secretly from his relatives wrote a statement to be sent to Afghanistan, and wanted to be a paratrooper. </p><h2>  What defended </h2><p>  In the army, Private Andrei A. Melnikov showed himself from the very best side.  Only the best would be trusted with a machine gun that used to belong to the Hero of the USSR I. Chmurov.  A platoon of the 9th company of the 345th separate guards regiment was assigned to defend the height of 3234. It was a strategically important object.  Those occupying it would be able to control the road from Gardez to Khost.  From a height of 3234, an overview of the terrain was opened for several kilometers in any direction, which made it possible to see the enemy's movement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  This height was occupied in December 1987 by our fighters.  But the enemies repeatedly tried to recapture her and thus gain an advantage in hostilities.  Fights took place daily.  Our fighters, among whom was Andrey Melnikov, regularly reflected the shelling that the militants fired from artillery weapons. </p><h2>  Bloody battle </h2><p>  The tragic battle took place on January 7, 1988.  Mujahideen, exceeding the number of those who defended the height, went on the assault.  They fired continuously from mortars and other guns.  The space was shrouded in smoke, it smelled of burning dust, visibility was poor.  Despite the fact that the area around the height was mined, Afghan militants began to attack, moving along the corridors left by our paratroopers between the shells. </p><p>  The situation was becoming critical.  The Mujahideen managed to get very close, and if reinforcements had not arrived in time for the 9th company, they would have to yield to the enemy.  The militants were at such a distance that it became possible to use <span>hand grenades.</span>  There were many Afghans.  In total, they launched 12 attacks. </p><h2>  last fight </h2><p>  Melnikov Andrey Alexandrovich died, reflecting the last of them.  He did not leave his post and continued to fight even when the ammunition ran out.  Despite machine-gun fire, the militants came very close.  Remembering his comrades who decided not to surrender, Melnikov Andrei Alexandrovich threw a grenade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  According to eyewitnesses, at this moment there was a lull.  Andrei, having decided that the battle was over, watched as the militants, leading the wounded away and taking away the dead, went back to the gorge.  At this moment, a mine exploded near him, one of the fragments mortally wounded Melnikov. </p><h2>  After death </h2><p>  For <span>Andrei‚Äôs relatives, it is a</span> great consolation to assign him a high rank.  This means that he is not forgotten, and the country remembers his hero.  In addition to the title, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin.  The order of the <span>Minister of Defense of the USSR</span> dated 12/26/1988 included him forever in the 345th Guards Regiment.  The machine gun, which was twice in the hands of the heroes, became an exhibit of the museum.  In the hometown of Mogilev, Melnikov Andrei Alexandrovich also received various honors.  His name is secondary school No. 28. His name is stamped on a stele installed in memory of the soldiers who died in Afghanistan on the territory of the former vocational school No. 1, where the hero studied in the village of Buinichi.  On a grave in Mogilev, on a high stand of black granite, a bronze bust of Melnikov in an amphibious uniform is mounted.  And in Mogilev, annual judo tournaments are held to commemorate him.  Also named after Andrey Melnikov city bus route number 10. </p>

    <p>  While serving in the army, Andrei sent letters home.  Now they, like a piece of history, say that such a person lived on earth, loved his relatives, endured difficulties.  In turn, colleagues sent letters to his parents with words of support and condolences after his death.  In them they speak of him as a kind, sympathetic comrade.  Simple sincere words helped Melnikov‚Äôs family more easily bear the loss.  And our descendants will always remember his feat. </p>
