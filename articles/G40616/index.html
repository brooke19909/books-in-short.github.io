  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Economic problems and their characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any <span>global problems</span> to one degree or another affect the living standards and economies of countries and the entire <span>world community.</span>  Therefore, all states are engaged in their decision, joining forces.  Economic problems have recently begun to manifest themselves most strongly.  Their globalization is associated with some features of the global economy that have appeared in recent decades. </p><p>  <span>The economic problems</span> that arise within one country can get a larger scale and become a problem for the whole world.  Therefore, they require quick solutions and control. </p><p>  Global economic problems have common signs: </p><p>  1. They affect the economy of all countries of the world or their majority. </p><p>  2. They affect the pace of development of countries, both economic and social. </p><p>  3. All economic problems must be resolved as soon as possible. </p><p>  4. They do not exist separately, but have a relationship with each other. </p><p>  5. To solve them, the joint efforts of all countries are necessary. </p><p>  The country's economy, as well as the entire world community, is affected by the demographic situation.  There are two theories for this relationship.  The first suggests that rapid population growth leads to food shortages.  <span>The standard of living is</span> steadily declining. </p><p>  The second approach to understanding this problem is more modern.  It reveals not only the negative aspects of the population growth of the Earth, but also the positive.  This fact also affects the degree of well-being of people and their development. </p><p>  Modern economists believe that the problem is not in population growth itself.  It has deeper roots.  Firstly, it is a weak level of development, backwardness.  Secondly, it is the irrational use of world natural resources, which leads to their depletion.  It also includes environmental pollution.  According to statistics, in developed countries, about 25% of the world's population is concentrated, and they consume about 80% of natural resources. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Economic problems are the result of environmental pollution and environmental disasters.  Leading economists have long recognized the significant impact of <span>environmental pollution</span> on the level of economic development.  It becomes obvious that one of the points of economic development should be the allocation of funds for environmental protection. </p><p>  The problem of resources and energy is also essential for the global economy.  In the last century, mankind has already begun to feel the effects of the energy and raw materials crisis.  In the 70‚Äì80 years, due to lack of raw materials and other resources, a significant economic downturn occurred, which affected the relations between countries, as well as their social and <span>political development.</span>  However, the appearance of these problems confronted humanity with the need to develop new technologies to save energy and resources. </p><p>  Among the main global economic problems, the preservation of peaceful and friendly relations between countries can be noted.  This contributes to closer cooperation in the world market, more fruitful development of countries with a low level of economy, prevention of financial crises that affect the welfare of the entire population <span>of the globe.</span> </p><p>  Assistance to <span>backward countries</span> is a necessary action on the part of more developed states.  The whole world economy is closely connected.  Therefore, the solution of the issues of providing the world‚Äôs population with the necessary amount of food, medicines and other vital means will help solve many problems of the economy. </p><p>  The economic problems of Russia are similar to the problems of the whole world.  Therefore, it is in constant cooperation with other countries in resolving issues of improving the economic situation. </p>
