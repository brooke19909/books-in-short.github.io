  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social inequality and its causes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A distinctive feature of any society is its division according to national, social, class, demographic or some other signs.  This is precisely what becomes the reason why social inequality arises.  In past centuries, it manifested itself in the form of violence, violation of human rights and other actions. </p><p>  Today it is not so obvious as before, it is happening.  But, nevertheless, social inequality does occur, it only manifests itself in a more subtle form, because it is impossible to eradicate it forever.  Let us consider in more detail what it is and what its causes are. </p><p>  In ancient Russia there was a division of people into certain sections of society (nobles, princes, landlords, peasants, etc.).  Each of these groups was on a particular step of the social ladder and had its rights and obligations.  This division is also called <span>social differentiation.</span>  This situation is characteristic of any society. </p><p>  Social inequality is a different level of accessibility, proximity to such social benefits as money, prestige, power. </p><p>  Initially, there was a simplest form of <span>stratification of society.</span>  There were leaders who had the broadest rights, and ordinary people who obeyed them and had some limitations in their actions and capabilities.  With the <span>development of society</span> , new hierarchical steps appeared, and social inequality took on a more complex form. </p><p>  Each society strives to achieve equality at all levels, which means equal opportunities for all people regardless of their gender, age, nationality and other characteristics.  However, this cannot be achieved for various reasons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Firstly, this is an unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities.  This is mainly due to the heterogeneity of labor.  Performing work of different importance and meeting the needs of society in different ways, people receive an unequal assessment of their work.  This is what can be called the main cause of social inequality. </p><p>  Inheritance of certain rights and privileges is the next reason for the unequal distribution of benefits and opportunities.  Sometimes this is why people with high abilities and a good education do not always have the opportunity to get a good job, to occupy a certain position with wages worthy of their intellectual level. </p><p>  There are two primary causes of social inequality.  One of them is the level of accessibility of quality education for different segments of the population.  The second reason is unequal opportunities with an equal level of training. </p><p>  The reasons for the division of society and the signs by which this happens can be very different.  Criteria are both objective and subjective.  In modern society, they are a profession, income level, position held, participation in power, education, ownership and some other signs.  Social inequality creates division into classes. </p><p>  If the middle class predominates in society, then it can be considered stable, with a low level of social inequality.  But so far only the formation of this social stratum is taking place in Russia. </p><p>  Social inequality cannot be completely eradicated for various reasons. </p><p>  In any society, someone must exercise control over the distribution of resources and benefits.  And this sometimes becomes more desirable than possessing the material goods themselves.  A category of officials with great opportunities appears. </p><p>  Each society has its own political, economic and state structure, headed by certain people who have more rights than other people. </p><p>  And the last factor is the person himself and the characteristics of his character.  He always strives to surpass others in order to take more advantageous social positions. </p>
