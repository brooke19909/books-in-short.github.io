The receiver currently costs $ 429, and it belongs to the same class as the Alpine iLX-700 and JBL Legend C1000. </p><h2>  First impressions </h2><p>  At first glance, it becomes clear that the ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù decided to copy the appearance of Apple‚Äôs iOS devices.  Thanks to the silver rim, the Pioneer SPH-DA120 is very similar to the iPad.  The glass 6.2-inch <span>capacitive touch screen</span> has a resolution of 800 √ó 480 pixels - the same as that of Alpine, JBL and most other multimedia centers released in 2016. </p><p>  Compared to Alpine, the display size of the Pioneer SPH-DA120 is smaller, since its left edge of the frame is slightly thickened to accommodate the touch buttons.  The Home key is located in the center.  Above it are volume control sensors, and below it is a button for switching between screens of applications, audio and video, as well as buttons for searching, fast-forwarding and rewinding.  Sensors require a touch, so in winter you will have to remove gloves to make them work. </p>

    <h2>  Pioneer SPH-DA120: installation </h2><p>  The installation of the media center consists in connecting the power cord and the system, i.e., a <span>car antenna,</span> an external microphone, a remote control, a <span>GPS antenna, a</span> separately purchased <span>power amplifier,</span> an Apple or Android device, a rear view camera, an external video module, an HDMI device, a rear display, etc. All you have to do is connect the cables to the corresponding Pioneer SPH-DA120 connectors.  The connection and setup of the car radio are described in detail in the attached installation and operating manuals. </p><p>  After turning on the power, the SPH-DA120 displays the main screen.  According to users, in the era of digital technology and touch displays, it is time for Pioneer to invest in this area.  The menu that it offers seems very archaic.  The ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù design does not even remotely resemble the exquisite style that has become familiar to Apple device owners.  Navigation causes a wandering sensation in the maze when you constantly turn the wrong way and go into a dead end. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Interface and Apple Carplay </h2><p>  Among the main reasons for buying the Pioneer SPH-DA120, user reviews call it compatibility with the CarPlay application.  This is an evolving software platform on Apple iOS devices, not on the receiver itself.  Therefore, no matter how non-original the receiver may be, it will always work the same way, no matter what the seller says about this! </p><p>  Over time, the platform‚Äôs capabilities change through regular iOS updates.  The same can be said about compatible applications, which are also periodically updated by developers, opening up new perspectives and improving CarPlay functionality. </p><p>  Therefore, it makes no sense to talk about the platform here - what is relevant today, with the next update, may become outdated. </p><p>  The Pioneer SPH-DA120 interface is not quite convenient.  The overview is closed by a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãicons and options that immediately clog the main screen.  Fortunately, after connecting an iOS device, CarPlay is located in the upper corner, so Apple users can feel at home, rejoicing in a clean and simple interface.  For Android smartphones, MirrorLink is available. </p><p>  CarPlay is the same as in other multimedia centers.  <span>The capacitive screen</span> helps with scrolling and interaction with the interface, it is sensitive enough, like Alpine, and the location of the control panel can be determined through the settings menu.  The criticism is that when you connect the iPhone, a warning always appears, with which you have to constantly interact before starting work.  Alpine does not have this, and it is not known why the Pioneer forces the driver to undergo this annoying procedure every time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the absence of a CD / DVD drive, the user is limited to radio and multimedia via USB or HDMI, but the simple connection of a smartphone will breathe new life into the center, providing the opportunity to play your own material, not only provided by the Apple or MirrorLink platform.  Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, and more are available. This is great, as CarPlay is prone to frequent interruptions. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless bluetooth audio </h2><p>  If wireless CarPlay is required, then it is not here.  But there is an alternative that the Alpine iLX-700 lacks, and that is built-in Bluetooth.  After pairing with a smartphone, you can broadcast sound to the car speakers without the need to connect cables.  This will not give everything that Apple offers in wireless CarPlay, but the sound is 99% of the device‚Äôs operating time, and AppRadio provides this opportunity, unlike its competitors in the same price range.  Bluetooth audio can be controlled through the built-in music player, which displays meta data such as <span>title,</span> artist, album and genre.  Directories are navigated using either the buttons on the front panel or the controls on the steering wheel, unless, of course, they are compatible. </p>

    <h2>  User settings </h2><p>  For users, adaptation is important, and the Pioneer SPH-DA120 reviews call it a device with a number of features that help fit into the interior of the car.  In the "Themes" section, you can select a background, as well as upload your own images from a USB drive.  In the Lighting section, you can choose the color of the touch buttons on the side panel or define it using the color wheel in accordance with the tone of the interior.  In the "Themes" subsection, you can choose the color of the interface and the color palette of the main screen. </p><h2>  Pioneer SPH-DA120: Overview of Multimedia Options </h2><p>  The SPH-DA120 supports many formats, surpassing its budget rivals in this.  Two USB ports allow you to have one spare connector for connecting a USB drive with many files.  What if I watch videos in DivX, H.264, MPEG4 and MKV formats?  Of course, this can be done using the built-in media player.  Need a slide show of images and photos?  No problems.  And if there is another video source, then you can connect it through the HDMI port on the rear panel. </p><p>  Like other receivers compatible with CarPlay, the Pioneer SPH-DA120 supports a rear view camera, displaying the image on the screen with the help of the parking lot.  However, today this feature has become the standard. </p><h2>  Audio settings </h2><p>  Among the sought-after features that the Pioneer SPH-DA120 car radio has, the feedback from music lovers is called pre-installed and customizable equalizers.  They will allow you to achieve the desired sound or, after connecting the microphone, independently measure the acoustics of the car and automatically adjust the sound level. </p><p>  Another standard feature supported is MIXTRAX, a technology for creating non-stop mixes of excerpts from an audio library with DJ effects.  True, users listening to online audio are deprived of the opportunity to ever experience it. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The choice of budget devices that support CarPlay is quite limited.  It depends on the desires of the owners, as well as on the type of multimedia that you plan to use.  Pioneer has the maximum number of connector types in its price category.  Two USB ports will allow you to connect both iPhone and an additional media with video and graphics.  <span>The HDMI connector</span> opens up more possibilities for multimedia, and the equalizer and graphics settings will please many. </p><p>  At the same time, those who just want to connect their iPhone to use CarPlay may be tempted to purchase the Alpine iLX-700 because of its slightly larger screen, attractive appearance and convenience.  CarPlay already uses the side of the display, so its large width reduces the inconvenience of the Apple interface. </p><p>  The quality of the Pioneer screen seems lower with the same number of dots with Alpine (800 √ó 480) and its smaller size.  Although such permission in the era of retina displays is a crime.  Car radios that cost more than a thousand dollars still come with the same low definition. </p>

    <h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  The main advantage of Pioneer is its support for streaming audio via Bluetooth.  This simple function, which is found today in most media centers, opens up the possibility of wireless sound transmission without the need to get your phone out of your pocket and allows passengers to become a DJ during the trip. </p><p>  It all comes down to individual preferences.  If setting a color theme, watching movies or images is important, and there is a need for Bluetooth audio, then this model is very good for its price and worthy of being a member of Apple CarPlay.  But for many Alpine owners with a wide screen and a clean interface, this is not enough, although the lack of Bluetooth is depressing. </p>
