This country provides a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the art and life of the ancient Greeks, to learn about amazing traditions and customs.  Areopag attracts a lot of attention from tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  This place aroused great respect among the <span>ancient Greeks</span> .  But few people in modern times know what the Areopagus is.  But his story carries away and makes you think. </p><h2>  What is the Areopagus and what were its functions </h2><p>  So what does this word mean?  The Areopagus in Ancient Greece is the supreme court.  The meetings took place on a cliff devoid of any vegetation.  In ancient Greece, this hill was located almost in the very center of the city.  Therefore, judges could easily see pagan temples that inspired them to do justice. </p>

They did this so that no everyday problems and the appearance of a busy city would distract the judges from their work.

    <p>  In order to better understand what the Areopagus is, you need to remember that in those years in ancient Greece, the dominant religion was paganism.  The judges examined cases related to blasphemy.  They had the right to punish those who do not believe in <span>pagan gods</span> and refuse to worship them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Areopagus was a symbol of paganism.  It was he who the Apostle Paul denounced in his sermons, trying to attract the Athenians to his teaching.  But only a small part of the townspeople listened to him.  The rest were glad that a trial was held at the Areopagus over the Apostle Paul.  But even then he did not want to give up his words. </p><p>  There is a legend that after Paul's <span>fiery speech</span> during the court session, Dionysius, who was one of the members of the Areopagus, the woman Damar, as well as several other Athenians, abandoned paganism and believed in one God. </p><h2>  The origin of the word areopagus </h2><p>  In order to start studying the history of this great place, you need to find out what the word "Areopagus" means.  The Athenian court received its name in honor of the hill, on top of which the meetings took place. </p><p>  There are several legends explaining the origin of the name of the hill.  According to one of them, in this place the trial of the <span>ancient Greek god of</span> war Ares took place.  He dared to shed blood of the <span>son of Poseidon,</span> for which he paid. </p><p>  According to another legend, the name was given by the Amazons, who came with the war and set up their camp on this hill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what the word areopagus means" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18970/373378.jpg?1397417310531" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Some believed that the name was given to the hill by Athena herself, the patroness of the city and the goddess of wisdom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Famous people and the Areopagus </h2><p>  In order to better understand what the Areopagus is and what it meant for Ancient Greece, it is worth finding out which world famous people listened to the opinions of the judges sitting on the hill. </p><p>  After Athens submitted to Macedonia, many Athenians suspected the Areopagus members of sympathy for the conquerors.  So, for example, <span>Alexander the Great</span> strongly influenced the decision of the judges <span>.</span>  He forced members of the Areopagus to admit that the famous Greek Demosthenes took bribes and stole precious works of art from Athens.  In fact, he was only to blame for speaking out against Alexander the Great and urging the Athenians to throw off the oppression of the inhabitants of Macedonia. </p><p>  <span>The famous philosopher of</span> antiquity Isocrates spoke positively about the Areopagus.  He believed that the judges were distinguished by great honesty, justice and faith.  Therefore, the philosopher sought to prove that the Areopagus is an ideal court. </p><h2>  Why you should visit the Areopagus </h2><p>  At present, the Areopagus, of course, has not retained the species that it had during its heyday.  But all those tourists who know what the Areopagus cannot help visiting during a trip to Greece. </p>
