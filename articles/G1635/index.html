    <h2>  Method 1. Matchboxes </h2><p>  First of all, we give a fairly simple example of crafts.  It is important that even a child can figure out how to make a sofa for a doll in this way.  So, you will need matchboxes (the quantity depends on the size, however, 6 empty boxes are enough for a small sofa), fabric and glue.  First you need to make a foundation.  You need to put two boxes flat - this will be the place for the doll to sit.  At the back, as a back, you need to put two boxes one after another on a wide rib, and a couple more empty boxes will be needed in order to make pens on which the doll will lean.  All boxes need to be carefully glued and allowed to stand the product for about ten minutes, so that the glue thoroughly dries.  Then it remains only to fit the fabric on the sofa.  This can be done with shreds, sticking them on the boxes.  A more complicated way is to sew the cover exactly to the size of the product.  You can also decorate this furniture with colorful pillows, throw a beautiful plaid, with which the doll can cover her legs while watching TV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Method 2. Shoe box </h2><p>  The next option on how to make a sofa for a doll is to use an unnecessary shoe box or packaging from small equipment.  The principle of operation will be similar to the previous one.  However, here you need to take only the bottom of the package and trim the front wall.  We can say that the sofa is almost ready!  It remains only to cover it with a beautiful cloth (stick shreds or make a cover).  You can also make the doll‚Äôs seating area soft by placing foam rubber under the <span>sofa</span> . </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sofa for dolls" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/431179.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Method 3. Real sofa </h2><p>  Also, let's look at how to make a sofa for a doll so that it looks completely like a real one.  In this case, you will need a flat cardboard box (you can take the finished one, or you can do it yourself), which will become the basis.  Next, you need to think about the back of the sofa.  This can again be a glued cardboard, to which, however, foam rubber must also be attached so that the back is soft (a place for seating will also require these actions).  The same thing should be done with the armrests of the sofa (they can be cardboard, glued with foam, or you can just take a flat box and attach it to the main sofa with glue).  Furniture legs can be made of small magnets of the same size (just stick them to the product).  It remains to cover the sofa with cloth, and the toy is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="furniture for dolls" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/431182.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Other furniture </h2><p>  Having figured out how to make a sofa for dolls yourself, you can try to create other furniture for toy men.  So, why not try to make a beautiful ottoman?  To do this, you just need a pair of matchboxes that stick together with each other on the widest side and are covered with fabric.  That's it, the ottoman is ready!  You can also create a beautiful floor lamp for your favorite.  In this case, you need a regular cocktail umbrella, which will serve as a lampshade, and a small stand.  Again, a matchbox can help, inside which you need to put clay, insert a skewer with an umbrella so that it holds well.  The box itself can simply be painted brown.  A retractable box will serve as a box for dolls.  What other doll furniture is there?  You can make a cabinet for Barbie.  To do this, you need a rectangular milk bag.  First you need to cut its bottom, then it must be horizontally cut strictly in the center.  These will be the cabinet doors.  On the inside of the door you can make a mirror out of foil, and from a simple wire - a crossbar on which hangers will hang (you just need to thread it into the cabinet walls and fix it from the outside).  The product must be painted in the desired color.  Everything, the cupboard is ready! </p>
