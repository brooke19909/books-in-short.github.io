  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric stove. How to choose?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>An electric stove</span> is an integral part of almost any kitchen.  Various home appliance manufacturers have been developing increasingly sophisticated models for many years.  The huge variety of this technique in the modern market suggests certain difficulties associated with the selection of a suitable model.  In order to determine <span>how to choose an electric stove</span> suitable specifically for your kitchen, and not overpay for advertised, but often unnecessary functions, it is worth following some tips. </p><p>  First of all, when purchasing a stove, you need to ask yourself some questions about what and how often do you intend to cook?  What functions will the purchased stove perform, interior or its immediate functional tasks.  The answer to these simple questions is guaranteed to save you from unnecessary financial costs. </p><p>  To begin with, the <span>electric stove</span> should correspond to the dimensions of the kitchen.  Today there are devices with the ability to adjust them to the height of the serving table.  <span>The dimensions of the hob</span> range from 50 to 90 centimeters.  The most time-tested traditional hobs made of enamel.  Low cost, good strength determine the rather high popularity of this type of plates among the population.  But it has some drawbacks: the enamel is quite difficult to clean from various traces formed during cooking, after a while it may appear scratches and chips. </p><p>  In turn, an <span>electric cooker</span> based on a glass-ceramic panel is practically devoid of such shortcomings.  As a rule, such stoves are equipped with electronic type control, subject to simple rules, it is quite easy to keep it clean.  Glass ceramics has a high margin of safety, but at the same time has a low coefficient of strength characteristics with respect to point impacts.  Simply put, you should not hang different kitchen utensils over it, because, for example, a knife dropped by a rib can easily split it.  Since the materials that all firms use in the manufacture of glass ceramic panels are essentially the same and are supplied from France, Germany or the United States, it makes no sense to spend a lot of money on ultra-expensive plates.  It should be remembered that the quality of the <span>hob of a</span> relatively cheap stove is no different from the most expensive samples, and in this case it is not worth overpaying. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A modern electric cooker based on a glass-ceramic panel allows you to safely and quickly cook food using dishes of various configurations in this process.  The heating zones of such stoves allow you to use not only round dishes, but also oval in shape, and the expansion zone allows you to adjust to the pan, or a large pan. </p><p>  Electric stove with oven </p><p>  The presence of an oven very often plays a decisive role in choosing an electric stove.  There are varieties of ovens, which are divided into static as well as multifunctional.  The static version of the oven is traditional, but definitely outdated.  Despite its cheapness, if you intend to cook quite a few dishes in the oven, you better not save money and purchase a stove with a multifunctional type oven.  The fundamental difference from a static oven is to use the properties of convection, that is, the distribution of hot air over the internal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire oven in a uniform manner.  This device will allow you to cook delicious and very healthy food and, of course, will fully allow you to realize all your culinary abilities and talents. </p><p>  In almost any specialized store, as well as in an online store, a huge assortment of electric stoves of famous brands is presented: Beko, Elektrolux, Ariston, Indesit, Hansa.  All electric stoves purchased in stores are accompanied by a warranty card from the manufacturer. </p>
