During this time, three major wars and many minor conflicts have already occurred.  So far, no agreement has been reached; moreover, at the beginning of the 21st century, relations between these states have only worsened. </p><h2>  Causes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.historyofthecoldwarpodcast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conflict of India and Pakistan" class="if uuid-2682659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682659.jpg"></div><p>  The main cause of the conflict between India and Pakistan is the dispute over the Kashmir region.  This is an area located in the northwestern part of the Hindustan Peninsula.  Its section is not actually fixed by any official agreements, it is a key focus of tension between the countries that occupy it. </p><p>  Currently, Kashmir is divided into several parts.  This is the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is home to about 10 million people, the self-proclaimed state of Azad Kashmir, which can be translated as "free Kashmir", about 3.5 million people live in it, it is controlled by Pakistan.  There are also northern territories of Gilgit-Baltistan under the control of Pakistan, where about 1 million people live.  A small territory of Kashmir is located within the borders of China. </p><p>  As a result of the First Kashmir War, India gained control of two-thirds of the region, the rest went to Pakistan.  Because of this region, tension between countries still persists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First kashmir war </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The history of the conflict between India and Pakistan" class="if uuid-2682658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682658.jpg"></div><p>  The conflict between India and Pakistan turned into a plane of armed clashes in 1947.  After the countries gained independence, the region was supposed to move to Pakistan, as Muslims prevailed in it.  But in the leadership of Kashmir were the Indians, who decided to join India. </p><p>  It all started with the fact that Pakistan declared the northern part of the principality its territory and introduced troops there.  The Pakistanis quickly defeated the militias.  It was assumed that the troops would move to the main city of Srinagar, but instead the army stopped in the occupied settlements, proceeding to robberies. </p><p>  In response, Indian troops took up a circular defense around Srinagar, smashing a militia of Muslims operating on the outskirts of the city.  Stopping the persecution of tribal forces, the Indians tried to unblock the Kashmiri forces in the Punch area.  However, this did not succeed, but the city of Kotli was busy, but they could not keep it.  In November of the 47th, a Muslim militia captured Mipur. </p><p>  After an attack by the tribal forces, Janger was captured.  The Indian offensive was called “Operation Vijay.” India made a new attempt to attack Pakistani forces on May 1, 1948. They met fierce resistance from Muslims near Janger, and irregular Pakistani groups joined them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  India continued to attack, starting Operation Gulab.  Their goals were the valley of Gurez and Keran.  At the same time, the besieged in Punch broke through the blockade.  But still, Muslims were able to continue the blockade of this strategically important city.  As part of Operation Bison, the Indians' light tanks were deployed to Zoji-La.  On November 1, they launched an unexpected and swift attack, forcing the Muslims to retreat first to Matayan, and then to Dras. </p><p>  Finally, it was possible to carry out the deblocking of Punch.  The city was liberated after a siege that lasted a whole year. </p><h2>  The outcome of the first war </h2><p>  The first stage of the Indo-Pakistani conflict ended in a ceasefire.  About 60% of the territory of Kashmir came under the patronage of India, Pakistan left control over the remaining areas.  Such a decision was enshrined in a UN resolution.  The truce officially began on January 1, 1949. </p><p>  During the first conflict between India and Pakistan, the Indians lost 1,104 people killed and more than three thousand wounded.  From Pakistan, 4,133 people died and more than 4,500 were injured. </p><h2>  Second Kashmir War </h2><div class="photo" data-original="swarajyamag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Military conflicts" class="if uuid-2682664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682664.jpg"></div><p>  The settled truce was broken in 1965.  The armed conflict was short-lived, but bloody.  It lasted from August to September. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It all started with Pakistan’s attempt to rebel in the Indian part of Kashmir.  Back in the spring of 1965, a border conflict occurred.  Who provoked him remains unknown.  After several armed clashes, the combat units were fully prepared.  The conflict prevented the outbreak of Great Britain, which achieved the conclusion of <span>a ceasefire.</span>  As a result, Pakistan obtained an area of ​​900 square kilometers, although it initially claimed a larger area. </p><p>  These events convinced the Pakistani leadership of the significant superiority of their army.  It soon tried to resolve the conflict by force.  The special services of the Muslim state sent saboteurs, whose purpose was to launch a war in August 1965.  The operation received the code name "Gibraltar".  The Indians became aware of sabotage, the troops destroyed the camp in which they trained the militants. </p><p>  The onslaught of the Indians was so powerful that soon the largest city of the Pakistani part of Kashmir Muzaffarabad was threatened.  On September 1, Pakistan launched a counterattack, from which moment an open war began.  Five days later, the Indian army invaded Pakistan, striking in the large city of Lahore. </p><p>  After that, both sides carried out the offensive with varying degrees of success.  In East Pakistan, the Indian Air Force regularly hit.  September 23 war ended under pressure from the UN. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="study.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Armistice between India and Pakistan" class="if uuid-2682657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682657.jpg"></div><p>  With the participation of the USSR, the Tashkent Declaration of Ceasefire was signed.  In both countries, state propaganda reported a landslide victory.  In fact, it was actually a draw.  The air forces of Pakistan and India suffered significant losses, although there is no reliable information. </p><p>  During the fighting, about 3,000 Indians and 3,800 Pakistanis were killed.  NATO countries have imposed an arms embargo on these countries.  As a result, Pakistan began to cooperate with China, and India was forced to establish close ties with the USSR. </p><h2>  Bangladesh War of Independence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.awaaznation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Armed clashes" class="if uuid-2682656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682656.jpg"></div><p>  A new round of the Indo-Pakistani conflict occurred in 1971.  This time, the reason was the intervention of India in the civil war in <span>eastern Pakistan.</span> </p><p>  The crisis there is long overdue, the inhabitants of the eastern part of the country constantly felt like second-class people, the language they spoke in the West was recognized as the state language after a powerful tropical cyclone, which killed about 500,000 people, the central authorities began to accuse of inaction and ineffective assistance .  In the east, they demanded the resignation of President Yahya Khan.  At the end of 1970, the Freedom League party, which supported the autonomy of eastern Pakistan, won the parliamentary elections. </p><p>  According to the constitution, the Freedom League could form a government, but the leaders of western Pakistan were opposed to appointing Rahman as prime minister.  As a result, the latter announced the start of the struggle for the independence of eastern Pakistan.  The army launched an operation to suppress the rebels, Rahman was arrested.  After that, his brother read on the radio the text of the declaration of independence, proclaiming the creation of Bangladesh.  The Civil War began. </p><h2>  Indian intervention </h2><div class="photo" data-original="leagueofindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Army of India and Pakistan" class="if uuid-2682660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682660.jpg"></div><p>  At first, the <span>Pakistani army</span> confidently moved forward.  According to various estimates, from 300,000 to 1,000,000 residents of the eastern part of the country were killed, about 8 million refugees went to India. </p><p>  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi supported the independence of Bangladesh, thus began a new round in the history of the conflict between India and Pakistan.  The Indians began supporting the partisan units, and also conducted successful military operations, retreating across the border.  On November 21, the Indian Air Force attacked targets in Pakistan.  Regular troops went into action.  After air raids on Indian bases, Gandhi officially announced the start of the war. </p><p>  On all fronts, superiority was on the side of the Indians. </p><h2>  Bangladesh Gains Independence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pastdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indo-Pakistan War" class="if uuid-2682662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2682662.jpg"></div><p>  As a result of the intervention of the Indian army, Bangladesh gained independence.  After losing the war, Yahya Khan resigned. </p><p>  Relations between the countries returned to normal after the signing of the Simla Agreement in 1972.  This was the largest conflict between the two countries.  Pakistan lost 7,982 people killed, Indians - 1,047 people. </p><h2>  Current state </h2><p>  Kashmir is still a stumbling block for Pakistan and India.  Since then, there have been two armed border conflicts (in 1984 and 1999), which were not widespread. </p><p>  In the 21st century, relations between India and Pakistan escalated due to the fact that both states received from their patrons or developed nuclear weapons themselves. </p><p>  Today, the United States and China are engaged in arms deliveries to Pakistan, and Russia to India.  Interestingly, while Pakistan is interested in military cooperation with the Russian Federation, while America is trying to pick up contracts for the supply of weapons to India. </p>
