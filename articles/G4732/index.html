The average annual temperature is eighteen degrees Celsius, and sunny days during the year are at least 320. </p><p>  The resort of Marbella (Spain) has the following borders: in the north - the municipalities of Ojen and Istan, in the north-west - Benahavis, in the east - Mijas, in the west - Estepona.  Several rivers flow through the city - Rio Guadalamina, Rio Real and Rio Verde.

Archaeologists have found evidence of the fact that Marbella was developed in the Paleolithic era.  Among them are stone tools and cave paintings made using red paint and surprisingly preserved brightness to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marbella on the map of spain" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451890.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Before the Phoenicians came to these lands in the eighth century BC, the local Iberian tribes, who lived mainly along the Rio Verde and Rio Real rivers, were under the rule of the kingdom of Tortess. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Phoenicians built metallurgical plants in the occupied territories and created iron mines.  All this is confirmed by the characteristic transformations of the landscape.  In addition, the Phoenicians made purple from marine mollusks. </p><p>  As historians suggest, in the ninth century BC (the period of Carthage) Marbella was a trading post and was called Cerro Torron. </p><p>  It is officially proved that in the place of the Old Town (the historical quarter of Marbella) there was a Roman settlement of Salduba. </p><p>  Since the time of the Visigoth state (existence period 418-718), the foundation of the early Christian basilica Vega de Mar and the necropolis have survived. </p><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  During the reign of Muslims, all Andalusia was part of the Cordoba Caliphate.  Thanks to the Arabs, the city walls of Marbella were seriously fortified and the Alcazaba fortress was erected.  The local population was engaged in the cultivation of mulberries and figs, produced silk and developed agriculture. </p><p>  When the power of the leaders of the Cordoba caliphate began to weaken, small separate kingdoms - typhons formed in the state of Al Andalus.  Marbella for some time was one of them, but soon fell under the influence of typhus Algeciras. </p><h2>  Christian period </h2><p>  On January 29, 1485, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon, the Catholic kings, sent troops from Seville to the Emirates of Granada, the last bastion of Spanish Muslims.  Before the assault, it was planned to take Malaga, which played the role of the main sea gate of Granada.  In front of this intermediate goal were two well-fortified fortresses - Marbella and Ronda.  During the siege of the latter, Ferdinand II sent a message to the defenders of Marbella demanding surrender.  When the Arabs learned that the Christians occupied Arcos de la Frontera and successfully besieged Ronda, they put forward their own conditions for surrender, asking for a month for reflection.  The king gave them half the time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Marbella gave up without blood.  This happened on June 11, 1485 - the day when they honor the memory of St. Bernabe.  Since then, he has been the patron saint of the city.  For many hundreds of years, local residents have been celebrating the liberation of their lands on a special scale. </p><p>  After the departure of the conquerors, Marbella (Spain) began to noticeably transform.  So, new buildings were actively erected, the main square of the city appeared - Orange, the sea fort of San Luis and the Church of St. Christ were built. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Marbella Spain" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451891.jpg" width="305"></div>

    <h2>  Recent story </h2><p>  At the beginning of the nineteenth century, <span>iron ore</span> deposits were discovered in Marbella <span>.</span>  Thus, the era of industrialization began.  In addition, the agricultural sector was developing rapidly. </p><p>  The end of the nineteenth century was a difficult period for the economy of the region.  Due to the high cost of charcoal, the price of local steel was higher than that of competitors who used <span>coking coal</span> in the production process <span>.</span>  In addition, viticulture - the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãagriculture - was affected by the plague of grapes. </p><p>  Against the general background of poverty, a group of oligarchs began to stand out sharply, the middle class did not exist as such. </p><h2>  New direction </h2><p>  In the framework of the total economic crisis, local authorities decided to focus on holidays in Marbella (Spain).  Tourism infrastructure began to actively develop.  The first hotel (Komersial) opened its doors to vacationers in 1919.  Proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic and the Civil War of 1936-1939  stirred up the whole country.  Little Marbella was also unable to stay away from the most important historical events, so the hotel construction process was suspended for some time.  The city entered a new round of development of the tourism sector in the 1950s. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain marbella photo" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/451892.jpg" width="305"></div>
