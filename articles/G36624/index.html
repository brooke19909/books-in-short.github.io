    <h2>  Frost is not a hindrance! </h2><p>  Visitors are not discouraged here in the winter.  Not too much entertainment from November to March can offer Yekaterinburg (recreation center "Sunny Island").  If you first agree with the employees of the establishment, then snowmobiles and ATVs will be prepared for your arrival. </p><p>  For ski enthusiasts, a piste for 5 and 10 km opens.  Guests enjoy rolling between snowy trees and full chest breathing in the fresh frosty air.  Equipment can be rented. </p><p>  Annually pour a high and long slide.  Here they give sledges, "buns" and skates.  In the cold season, an ice rink is opened.  The skating rink (indoor) is well lit and equipped with light music.  Beautiful and rhythmic songs are constantly played in the room.  You can order a site for playing hockey. </p><p>  There is one more reason why almost the whole of Yekaterinburg wants to come here in winter: the recreation center “Sunny Island” is located on the banks of the river.  In the cold season, you can successfully go fishing here.  No less popular are walks in a snowy forest, a game of snowballs and gatherings around a fire. </p>
