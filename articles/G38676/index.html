    <h2>  About location </h2><p>  So, first it‚Äôs worth telling about where the hotel complex known as Princess Seaview Resort Spa is located.  It is located on an island in Phuket, in the city of Karon.  Only 15 minutes drive from Patong Beach.  And only 20 minutes - from the city of Phuket.  By the way, the international airport is not so far away.  45 minutes drive - and the person will already be there.  This is also a plus. </p><p>  If a person thinks that the hotel is too far from the sea, then you can be calm - because every half hour from the hotel there is a free bus that goes directly to Karon Beach.  And about 2 kilometers from the hotel is Kata Beach, next to which there are a huge number of different restaurants and entertainment venues. </p><h2>  About rooms </h2><p>  Now - a few words about what rooms are offered to guests who decided to stay at Princess Seaview Resort Spa.  So, there are ‚Äúdeluxe rooms‚Äù - either with 1 bed, but very large, or with two ordinary ones (but they can easily be confused with the size of 2-bedroom ones, since the standards in Thailand are more oversized than ours).  There are rooms with access to the pool.  You can also reserve family apartments of a class "luxury", but only the name can not be paid special attention, since they are still designed for two people.  And, of course, there is a separate category of rooms, characterized in that from their windows a picturesque view of the sea opens.  And now it‚Äôs worth telling more about the advantages of these apartments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  2-seater "deluxe" </h2><p>  With this category I would like to start the story about the rooms offered by the Princess Seaview Resort Spa.  The cost of reservation for 15 days and 14 nights is at least 70 thousand rubles for two people with breakfast and taxes included in the price.  It should be noted that the price is constantly changing.  It can be higher or lower - depending on the season and discounts offered by the administration. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äã"deluxe" apartments is 40 square meters.  m. This is a bright modern room, the highlight of which are the doors, made entirely of glass.  There is also a private bathroom and a balcony.  There is no Internet, but it can be provided for an additional fee. </p><p>  In addition, there is a terrace, TV with satellite and cable TV, telephone, safe.  It should be noted that the apartments are tastefully furnished.  Pleases marble (in some cases - tiled) floor, private seating area.  Comfort is also on the level - inside there is even a refrigerator with an electric kettle and a coffee maker.  Slippers, bathrobes, hairdryer, linen - all this is also offered to guests.  So if you want to stay on a budget and comfortably, it is worth choosing this category in the Princess Seaview Resort Spa 4 * complex - reviews of tourists make sure that this will be the best option. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The super-deluxe rooms offered by the hotel have almost the same design as in the previous case.  The price includes breakfast and all taxes, so for 2 weeks a reservation will cost 100 thousand rubles at least (for 2 people). </p><p>  This room has direct access to the pool.  In addition, only in this category of apartments is there a bathroom, the walls of which are made of transparent material.  In general, this is one of the main highlights of the hotel complex - so that there is as much as possible transparent and glass.  Many guests really like this. </p><p>  The apartments are all the same as in the usual "deluxe".  But besides this, there is still free Wi-Fi.  And guests, booking this room, can choose the view - the mountains, the garden or the sea. </p>
