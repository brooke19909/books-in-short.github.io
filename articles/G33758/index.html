    <p>  The financial institution easily survived the <span>crisis of 2008</span> , and the main merit belongs to the financier Shishkhanov.  It was necessary to spend at least two years to restore the bank's indicators to the pre-crisis level.  A significant role in this matter was played by the new president of the institution, Lomanov, who was appointed to the post in 2008.  Until 2011, a 99% stake held by the Lomanov spouses.  After the sale of shares, Transport Bank, reviews of which in most situations have a positive connotation, continued to service the broad-based group of companies New Transport Technologies.  At the moment, several influential individuals are the owners of the bank at the same time.  These are Serebryannikova and Sorokin, Mazanova, Genetliu and Fez. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A bit about achievements and ratings </h2>

    <p>  Transportniy Bank in 2013 made a significant financial breakthrough and increased its assets to 23 billion 600 million.  This amounts to almost 2.5 times the increase in capital available at that time.  The expansion was achieved thanks to the active attraction of both private and commercial funds.  In 2012, the financial institution's net profit reached 96 million rubles.  <span>The authorized capital</span> in 2013 amounted to only 800 million.  It was during this period that the RIA Expert rating agency awarded the institution a credit rating of A level.  This characterizes the institution solely on the positive side, speaks of its stability, a high level of reliability and trust.  There was a positive outlook for the future.  According to the latest official data, the volume of assets amounted to 29 321 395 thousand rubles.  Transportniy Bank, whose rating is very good, took 144th place in Russia for this value.  The amount of capital is equal to 2,402,169 thousand rubles, which corresponds to 195 place among Russian banks.  The volume of loans is 20 626 429 thousand rubles, and deposits - 17 633 608 thousand rubles, which corresponds to 122 and 113 places.  The total profit for the last year is 382,027 thousand rubles, which made it possible to reach 144 places in the ranking.  According to the evaluation of the online project BankStars.ru, the financial institution received 4 stars.  As for such well-known rating agencies as Moody's, Fitch and S&amp;P, they did not appreciate the reliability of Transportniy Bank, just bypassing it with their attention. </p><h2>  Latest news or temporary difficulties </h2>

    <p>  The representative of the agency "Expert RIA" reports that the financial institution makes payments on paper, ceasing to use the electronic format.  This is due to the fact that starting from April 21 of this year, it was the Central Bank that disconnected Transportny Bank, the reviews of employees about which are always presented in a positive way, from the system of bank electronic payments of urgent type.  As the agency‚Äôs specialist suggests, this may indicate a lack of liquidity within the financial institution.  A little earlier, it was Expert RIA agency that reported that the credit rating of the institution is gradually decreasing, and today it is already equivalent to category ‚ÄúA‚Äù, but ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  The decision to lower the rating was based on the use of paper media by the bank, which significantly prolongs the terms of banking operations. </p><h2>  Recent work changes </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that by the end of 2014, Transportny Bank, whose feedback from depositors always testified to its fulfillment of its obligations, was deemed reliable, today some malfunctions can be observed in its operation.  In particular, some clients talk about delays in payroll, which no one talks about.  There is a cessation of accepting deposits, including replenishment of existing ones.  This order was issued by the Central Bank on April 16 for a period of up to 6 months.  All contracts, according to representatives of the financial institution, which were signed before April 16, will be executed in accordance with the regulations.  This includes the calculation of interest on deposits and their withdrawal. </p><h2>  What do customers and bank employees say? </h2><p>  Transportniy Bank faced certain difficulties, but this did not affect its fulfillment of its obligations.  Most of the reviews about the financial institution still speak about it from a positive side.  According to employees of the institute, nothing in their work has changed.  Timely accrual of labor fees and full fulfillment of obligations in accordance with the employment contract take place.  It will not be possible to find a flurry of responses in which people complain that the institution does not pay.  Based on the analysis of this information, we can talk about the bank's performance, despite certain obstacles that, in principle, had to be faced by almost every institution offering its services within the financial sector in 2015. </p><h2>  Forecasts for the future and level of reliability </h2><p>  Transportniy Bank, whose rating has recently been downgraded to category B, is on the scale of Expert RA agency within the framework of a satisfactory level of creditworthiness.  The forecast in accordance with this rating sounds like ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù.  This promises a high probability that in the near future the performance of a financial enterprise will not change.  Transportniy Bank received the mark ‚Äúrating under supervision‚Äù, and analysts pointed to low profitability indicators.  Talking now about what awaits a financial institution in the near future is very difficult.  All that remains to be done is to follow the latest news and constantly keep abreast. </p>
