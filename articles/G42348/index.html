    <p>  The scientific literature contains many definitions of the concept of "society."  So, in a narrow sense, it is a group of people who have united to carry out any activity and communication, as well as a specific stage in the historical development of a country or people.  Broadly, it is a part of the material world that is isolated from nature, but closely connected with it, consisting of individuals with consciousness and will, including <span>forms of association of people</span> and ways of their interaction. </p><p>  In the 20th century, R. Aron put forward the theory of <span>industrial society,</span> which was then improved by American sociologists and political scientists A. Toffler, D. Bell, Z. Brzezinski.  It describes the ongoing process of developing a backward society to the forefront.  A total of 3 stages were distinguished: agricultural (pre-industrial), industrial and post-industrial. </p><p>  Agrarian society is the first stage of civilized development.  In some sources it is also called traditional.  It is characteristic of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.  However, it is inherent in some states at the present time.  To a greater extent, the countries of the "third world" (Africa, Asia). </p><p>  The following features of an agricultural society can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  The economy is based on primitive crafts and subsistence farming.  Mostly hand tools are used.  Industry is either very slightly developed or completely absent.  Most of the population lives in rural areas, engaged in agriculture. </li><li>  Dominance of state, community ownership;  and private is not inviolable.  Material wealth is distributed depending on the position occupied by a person in the social hierarchy. </li><li>  <span>Economic growth</span> is low. </li><li>  <span>The social structure is</span> almost unchanged.  A person is born in a certain estate or caste and does not change his position throughout life.  The main social cells are community and family. </li><li>  Conservative society.  Any changes occur slowly and spontaneously. </li><li>  Human behavior is governed by beliefs, customs, corporate principles and norms.  Independence and individuality are not encouraged.  <span>The social group</span> determines the norms of behavior for the individual.  A person does not analyze his position, he seeks to adapt to the environment.  He evaluates everything that happens to him from the perspective of the social group to which it belongs. </li><li>  Agrarian society implies strong power of the army and the church; an ordinary person is excluded from politics. </li><li>  A limited number of educated people, the predominance of oral information over written. </li><li>  The priority of the <span>spiritual sphere</span> over the economic, human life is perceived as the implementation of divine providence. </li></ul><p>  As a result of economic, political, social and spiritual development, agrarian society in most countries has moved to the industrial stage, which is characterized by an increase in labor productivity in agriculture and industry, an increase in fixed capital, and an increase in household incomes. </p><p>  New classes are emerging - the bourgeoisie and the industrial proletariat.  The number of peasants in the population is declining, and urbanization is taking place.  The role of the state is growing.  Agricultural society and industrial society opposed each other in all directions. </p><p>  The post-industrial stage is characterized by the development of the services sector, their promotion to the forefront, the increasing role of knowledge, science and information.  Class distinctions are erased, the share of the middle class is increasing. </p><p>  From a Eurocentric point of view, agrarian society is a backward, closed, primitive social organism, to which industrial and post-industrial civilizations are opposed by Western sociology. </p>
