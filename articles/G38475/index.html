But still elite houses in Moscow were under construction and will be under construction, offering buyers smart solutions. </p><h2>  Types and Features </h2><p>  To begin with, let‚Äôs say that all elite real estate is presented in four classes - ‚ÄúA‚Äù (Luxe), ‚ÄúA-‚Äù, ‚ÄúB‚Äù and ‚ÄúC‚Äù.  Realtors, whose task is to help customers navigate in the variety of apartment solutions, build on such a classification.  In general, the elite real estate of Moscow is represented either by pre-revolutionary houses and mansions from the old housing stock or by modern residential complexes and new buildings. </p><h2>  Overview of modern complexes </h2><p>  Elite homes in Moscow, class "A" (luxury) must be located in the most prestigious area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city - the Central Administrative District.  Among the advantages of choosing a home here can be attributed the homogeneity of the social environment, an architectural project created by a famous bureau, and only new buildings built by a developer with a high reputation belong to this class.  Class "A" implies the existence of an integrated management service for the entire building. </p>

This category includes buildings that were built in the 90s, when the real estate market in the country was just beginning to emerge.  And a separate category can be noted at home, which were erected before the 90s.  This category includes pre-revolutionary mansions, Stalinist houses and the houses of the Central Committee.  Now we offer to evaluate the most popular complexes in Moscow. </p><h2>  Fusion Park </h2><p>  Elite houses, the best in <span>Moscow, were built</span> in the Fusion Park residential complex.

    <p>  On Plyushchikha street is a stylish residential complex BUNIN, which is positioned as a club house.  The construction of luxury homes in Moscow of this type began not so long ago.  And in this case we are talking about a comprehensive renovation of a historic building.

The ceiling height, by the way, reaches 6 m in some apartments. </p><h2>  Elite country houses </h2><p>  Along with ordinary apartments in new buildings, high demand remains for elite suburban homes in Moscow.  Their addresses indicate the villages, but they are located in the closest proximity to the city and differ in well-developed access roads and excellent infrastructure.  For example, in the village of Zhukovka-3 there is a cottage with a basement where you can place premises for recreation or technical purposes.  There are three residential floors, each of which can be planned in accordance with their needs and depending on the number of residents. </p>

    <p>  On Novorizhskoe highway, suburban real estate is represented by a huge number of mansions.  The new house is decorated in Art Deco style and stands out from the rest of the building.  The infrastructure is well developed here, round-the-clock protection of elite houses in Moscow is carried out - for this, trusted private security companies are hired. </p><h2>  What to consider? </h2><p>  Elite class housing, as a rule, is located in prestigious areas of the city.  It is the location that affects the high cost of objects in such complexes.  On the other hand, old mansions that have undergone internal and external alteration can also be considered elite.  Note that approximately 250,000 rubles is a square meter of housing in apartments of class "B", and in the rest - the cost is very, very high.  So if you still want to purchase luxury real estate in Moscow, read our review, see photos and choose the solution that is most suitable for you. </p>
