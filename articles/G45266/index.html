However, despite all the testing of the new software, often the channels disappear partially or completely from users.  There are several reasons why the channels disappeared after the Tricolor update, several, below we will figure out what actions to take in order to return the broadcast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uzh-horod.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lack of tricolor channels" class="if uuid-2500632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500632.jpg"></div><h2>  Most common problems </h2><p>  Each subscriber knows perfectly well that if the software update process is in progress, it is strictly forbidden to turn off the equipment.  If the procedure is interrupted, an error will occur that will restrict access to all satellite operator services. </p><p>  However, even if everything went according to the rules, there is always a certain probability that Tricolor does not work after the update.  Most complaints are: </p><ul><li>  total or partial absence of channels; </li><li>  loss of sound; </li><li>  that the console does not see the smart card. </li></ul><p>  In each case, it is necessary to adhere to a certain algorithm in order to return full broadcasting of television channels. </p><h2>  Quick fix </h2><p>  If after updating the Tricolor channels are lost or there is no sound, you must immediately try the universal method.  We act as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  completely turn off the equipment; </li><li>  wait 10 minutes; </li><li>  turn on and go to channel 333; </li><li>  we start the update process. </li></ul><p>  Most often, after restarting the console, all errors disappear.  However, re-updating the software does not hurt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kartaklada.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tricolor menu" class="if uuid-2500589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500589.jpg"></div><h2>  Settings Issues </h2><p>  If the usual reboot did not help, the Tricolor TV packages remain unavailable, you need to return the receiver to the factory settings.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ul><li>  open the main menu of the console; </li><li>  we go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù category, depending on the model of the receiver, the name may be slightly different; </li><li>  we find the item "Factory settings"; </li><li>  confirm the operation, enter the pin code, if it has not changed, then four zeros; </li><li>  We are waiting for the completion of the procedure. </li></ul><p>  Next, set the time, language, and region.  If broadcasting is still missing, you need to search for channels.  You can do this manually or use the automatic search. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ketis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto channel search" class="if uuid-2500579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500579.jpg"></div><h2>  We set up channels ourselves </h2><p>  It often happens that after the Tricolor update the channels disappeared, and in their place an alert is displayed that recommends searching for available broadcasts.  First of all, we‚Äôll use automatic configuration, for this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  go to the console menu; </li><li>  open the item "Applications"; </li><li>  we find the section "Setup Wizard"; </li><li>  select "Search"; </li><li>  set the search parameters, for this we will use the recommended option; </li><li>  waiting for the end of the search. </li></ul><p>  Usually broadcasting is restored, but not all Tricolor TV packages may be available, but only certain channels, some may remain encoded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.domica.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="start channel search Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2500563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500563.jpg"></div><p>  To get rid of this problem, you will need to additionally conduct a manual search.  This will require: </p><ul><li>  head to the subcategory of the sources of the received signal, where to choose the antenna; </li><li>  activate manual tuning; </li><li>  enter the parameters, they can be found on the official portal of the satellite operator; </li><li>  adhere to prompts that are regularly displayed by the system; </li><li>  save the result. </li></ul><p>  Lost channels on Tricolor TV?  If all of the above is done correctly, such a problem will disappear pretty quickly. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is necessary to regularly search for channels, as the operator regularly adds new broadcasts, removes old ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.androidmafia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="update installation" class="if uuid-2500584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500584.jpg"></div><h2>  How to return channels after update </h2><p>  It is most difficult to correct the situation if defects arose after the interruption of the update installation.  In such a situation, it is almost impossible to solve the problem yourself.  Most likely, the software is badly damaged and needs to be fully replaced. </p><p>  In such a situation, you will need to use the services of specialists, since without the proper skills such a procedure will be difficult to carry out.  On the Tricolor portal, we find the nearest service center and include equipment.  Repair will be paid, because the problem arose not through the fault of the equipment manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="--." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satellite dish Tricolor TV" class="if uuid-2500598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500598.jpg"></div><h2>  What else to do to restore broadcasting </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to identify the reason why the channels disappeared after the Tricolor update.  Sometimes problems arise not due to the installation of new software.  Therefore, you should check: </p><ul><li>  smart card; </li><li>  current balance whether payment for a service package has been made; </li><li>  the state of the satellite dish, its direction to the satellite; </li><li>  remove ice and other debris from the plate. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.skelbiu.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart card Tricolor" class="if uuid-2500606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2500606.jpg"></div><p>  Smart card problems often occur after incorrect installation of new software.  However, before taking any serious action, carefully remove the card, reinstall it, and restart the equipment.  It is possible that contact has disappeared.  We also check the validity period of the card.  Many people forget about this nuance, so he reminds himself at the most inopportune moment.  In such a situation, a complete replacement will be required. </p><h2>  Error 4 </h2><p>  Often, error 4 occurs after the Tricolor TV update. What to do in this situation is of interest to many satellite TV subscribers.  An error occurs due to problems with the set-top box software.  As a result, the equipment cannot decrypt the received signal. </p><p>  Error 4 is fixed by the following actions: </p><ul><li>  Check the status of the smart card.  If a certain channel does not function, then access to it may be closed due to its absence in the paid service package. </li><li>  Returning to the factory settings.  If the channel is present in the list of available, but error 4 is displayed, reset the settings.  To do this, go to the equipment menu and use the appropriate section for these purposes. </li><li>  After restarting the receiver, set the basic settings, activate the automatic channel scan. </li></ul><p>  If after all the manipulations all the channels are available, then everything is done correctly.  However, if there is no result, most likely the problem lies in the firmware.  It is not worth changing it yourself, it is better to contact specialists.  Although quite recently for users who are interested in how to configure Tricolor after the update, a new functionality has appeared - automatic firmware update.  To activate the process, proceed as follows: </p><ul><li>  the launch of the Telemaster info channel; </li><li>  confirm the start of the procedure; </li><li>  overload the console. </li></ul><p>  You can use this method if the software is updated to the latest version. </p><h2>  What if there is no sound after the update? </h2><p>  Most often, complaints that the sound disappears after installing the software turn out to be unfounded.  The problem lies in pressing the Mute key, or the cable connecting the TV and receiver has come off. </p><p>  If everything is normal with the remote control and wires, then we restart the equipment.  If there is no result, return the device to the basic settings in the way presented above. </p><h2>  We contact support </h2><p>  Installing new software, although a regular procedure, but after it, many users have any problems.  They are solved in most cases on their own.  So, if there is no program guide on the Tricolor after the update and standard actions have not resolved the problem, be sure to contact support. </p><p>  You can contact a specialist in many ways.  The easiest is to call the hotline number.  Describe the problem, and the operator will recommend how best to act to quickly fix the defect.  If you can‚Äôt restore access to the channels, you can immediately call the wizard. </p><p>  By the way, the official resource of Tricolor presents all the ways by which you can contact support. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If the channels on Tricolor TV disappeared after updating the software, immediately restart the equipment.  If there is no result, return the device to the factory settings.  All subsequent manipulations associated with installing the firmware and checking the technical condition of the equipment should be entrusted to specialists immediately. </p>
