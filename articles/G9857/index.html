    <p>  An obligatory point in the excursion program should be the ancient town of Nessebar, which is full of ancient buildings and cobbled streets.  It is interesting for its architecture.  There are a lot of great places.  However, tourists chose the town not only because of its attractions, they fell in love with numerous local shops and cafes, which reigned in a special atmosphere.  You can come to Nessebar again and again. </p><p>  In addition, lovers of water activities will certainly enjoy the water park.  If you want a surge of emotions and adrenaline - you definitely need to visit this attraction.  For families with children, a trip to the amusement park and karting can be an interesting entertainment. </p><p>  There are places that, while relaxing in Bulgaria, you should definitely visit.  The pearl of the country is the Rila Monastery.  It is able to surprise even sophisticated tourists.  Of interest is primarily its beautiful architecture. </p><p>  Continuing the conversation about local beauties, it is worth recalling the town of Shumen.  It will delight guests simply with a huge number of historical sights and the measured, calm life of a small city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maria revas 5 bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1427353.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Almost all the <span>sights of Bulgaria</span> can be reached independently by bus.  How to choose the right route, a guide will tell you in the hotel Villa Maria Revas 5 * (Bulgaria).  In addition, the resort has a tourist office, which will prompt you the necessary information. </p><h2>  Maria Revas 5 * (Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  To form an objective opinion about the hotel, I would like to discuss the reviews of tourists who visited it.  It should be emphasized that Maria Revas 5 * Sunny Beach is a wonderful family hotel.  Since the villa is a very quiet and peaceful place, it is possible that lovers of noisy parties may not like it very much.  The hotel has practically no animation, but for many visitors this moment is absolutely not important, because you can always visit one of the local famous discos if you wish. </p><p>  An advantage of the Maria Revas 5 * Sunny Beach complex is the availability of rooms with kitchenettes equipped with all necessary utensils.  Such apartments can be a great option for those families who do not want to feed their children for some reason in a public place.  Products can be purchased at local supermarkets (for example, "Janet").  The ability to cook food for many is the main argument in favor of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maria revas 5 sunny beach" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1427355.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Does the hotel restaurant Maria Revas 5 *?  Reviews of tourists regarding food are a bit controversial.  Not everyone is satisfied with the local cuisine, considering that breakfast, for example, is very scarce and monotonous.  Also, tourists note high prices in a local restaurant.  Food problems can be avoided by living in apartments with a kitchen.  In addition, there are a lot of bars and restaurants around, the services of which can be used, because they serve good dishes at reasonable prices. </p><p>  All rooms in the hotel are equipped with good, quality furniture, new linens, no stains.  Apartments are cleaned a couple of times a week, but garbage is thrown away every day.  Beach towels and linen are replaced every other day.  Unfortunately, not all rooms have a good view, some of them overlook the backyard. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the coast </h2><p>  The pool at the hotel is very good and clean, people always relax near it, but there is no crowding, everyone has enough space. </p><p>  The beach deserves special attention.  It is located next to the Maria Revas 5 * hotel (Bulgaria), at a slow pace the road to it will not be more than five to seven minutes.  The sea coast is clean.  Beautiful fine sand and the hot sun just attract sunbathing on the beach.  The warm, clean sea in the region of Sunny Beach is rather shallow.  Entry into the water (about one hundred meters) is gentle, which is very convenient for kids.  There is plenty of room for their swimming.  Therefore, as a children's resort, it is difficult to find a better place than Sunny Beach. </p><p>  The only drawback may seem to be the fact that you need to pay for an umbrella and sunbeds on the beach.  Many vacationers prefer to use their umbrellas, taking them with them to the beach (they are sold in local stores).  But sun loungers, in principle, are not very necessary, because lounging on a fine hot sand is a pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maria revas 5 sunny" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1427356.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Relaxing in Bulgaria, you definitely need to see local attractions, many of which are within walking distance of the Villa Maria Revas 5 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists about excursions and walks to local interesting places are full of enthusiasm and experience.  I would like to note that the complex is located not in the center of the resort, but at the same time there is everything necessary for relaxation nearby.  Tourists love to go for a walk in Nessebar, since it is very close.  The old town is full of interesting places, a special atmosphere reigns on its streets, and local cafes attract guests to their tables. </p><p>  The youngest guests of the complex will be interested in visiting the water park and amusement park. </p><p>  Holidays in Bulgaria for our compatriots are good because they are not associated with language barriers.  There is absolutely no need for knowledge of the English language.  Oddly enough, but everyone understands each other, a lot of people who know at least a little Russian.  Perhaps, for this reason, vacationers feel comfortable. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel Maria Revas 5 * can be recommended as a good place for a family holiday on the sea.  Perhaps spoiled tourists will not find the chic inherent in some five-star complexes here, but here you can have a great time surrounded by sun, sea, sand and local attractions. </p>
