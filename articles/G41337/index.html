MegaFon Login 3 Tablet: Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Four years ago, on a tablet, it was possible to determine the viability of a person and his approximate income.  They were expensive and the range was small.  The products of only well-known manufacturers of mobile gadgets were then found on the shelves.  But over time, tablets have become more accessible, and today it is already one of the essential attributes of modern comfortable life.  Now you can count more than a thousand manufacturers who produce these devices. </p><p>  The situation in our country is not at all the same as in the whole world.  The most popular tablets in Russia are those that have a relatively low price.  For this reason, giants such as Samsung and Apple occupy the smallest segment of the market, and cheap "Chinese" scatter like hot cakes.  One of these is the Megafon Login 3 tablet, the reviews and technical specifications of which we will review today. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Usually tablets of the lowest price category are acquired by caring parents for their children.  And this is understandable, because it‚Äôs not a pity to let them go to the ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù: you won‚Äôt lose too much money, and at least there will be some benefit.  Also, cheap devices can often be seen as a working tool for couriers, forwarders and people on a business trip.  Naturally, this is done because of the low cost.  In case of loss or damage, the device is not so pathetic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Judging by what the Megafon Login 3 tablet received from customer reviews, we can say that this gadget, in addition to low cost, is also quite functional.  Let's look at its specifications to make sure of this. </p><ul><li>  operating system: Android version 4.4.4; </li><li>  screen: IPS matrix with a diagonal of 7 inches with a resolution of 1024 √ó 600 pixels, dot density 169 ppi; </li><li>  processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 brand MSM8210, two cores, frequency 1.2 GHz; </li><li>  GPU: <span>Adreno 305</span> ; </li><li>  RAM capacity: 1Gb; </li><li>  internal memory: 4Gb; </li><li>  expandable memory: support for memory cards up to 32Gb; </li><li>  camera: main - 3.2 megapixels (resolution 2048 √ó 1536), front - 0.3 megapixels (resolution 640 √ó 480); </li><li>  Communications: 2G / 3G, EDGE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS; </li><li>  battery: Li-Ion 3500mA / h; </li><li>  dimensions: 192x118x10 mm; </li><li>  weight: 300g. </li></ul><p>  Judging by the technical <span>specifications, the Megafon Login 3 tablet</span> should be worthy of good reviews from the owners.  And this is understandable, because it can be purchased for only 1990 rubles.  I would like to note a very important feature in the form of the ability to write SMS and make calls via GSM communication.  At its core, our tablet is a simple smartphone that has a seven-inch screen.  But now even a weak budget gadget for such a price is difficult to find, but here for 2000 rubles you can get two in one.  In general, such a decision by the company is a huge plus. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The tablet comes in a dense cardboard box with a characteristic color print.  The lid depicts the tablet itself and its name.  On the sides are brief technical specifications that the Megafon Login 3 tablet boasts. It received good reviews about the package itself.  Everything seems reliable and durable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Opening the lid, we will see a small seven-inch gadget, which neatly lies in a special recess.  It is packed in a protective transport film, which guarantees the integrity of the device.  Under the stand are documents, a guarantee, a USB cable for connecting to a computer and a network adapter, and the adapter itself.  Unfortunately, the headset is not included in the standard set.  But the <span>Megafon Login 3</span> tablet would get the same <span>reviews</span> even if it were available. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  If you do not look at the price of the tablet, which clearly demonstrates its budget, then at first glance it looks quite prestigious.  The reason for this is the presence of an aluminum back cover, which is surrounded by plastic on the sides.  Also very pleased with the assembly of the gadget.  Nothing creaks and staggers here.  Real monolithic construction.  Let's consider in more detail the Megafon Login 3 tablet, reviews, photos of all the main external elements. </p><p>  The plastic on the sides is of poor quality, but it has <span>an oleophobic coating</span> and is not so dirty so quickly.  As for the front panel, everything is done in gloss.  Factory protective film is practically useless, and users immediately change it to a more reliable purchase option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Let's look at what the Megafon Login 3 tablet has reviews and appearance characteristics in more detail.  So, the front panel is almost completely occupied by the touch screen.  On the sides, if you hold the tablet in a horizontal orientation, there is a fairly wide frame.  Above and below it is a little narrower.  Users note that this solution allows you to hold the tablet in a vertical orientation with one hand and at the same time the touch cannot occur accidentally on the sensor. </p><p>  If you hold the tablet upright, then above the screen, near the earpiece, is the front camera.  There is nothing more on the front panel.  All soft keys are touch sensitive and are located on the display. </p><p>  The Megafon Login 3 tablet (see the photo of the back side above) shows in all its glory the available 3.2 MP main camera eye, the inscription of the manufacturer's company and the call speaker.  Its volume is decent, but when you set the volume to a level above average, it starts to produce low-quality, hoarse sound. </p><p>  The upper end has a special plastic plug.  Under it are slots for SIM cards and a microSD flash drive.  MicroUSB output, headphone jack and reset button are located nearby.  In principle, judging by user reviews, these elements do not create discomfort in using the gadget. </p><p>  The left edge contains a shutdown and lock button.  Under it is a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume control.  Honestly, the left-side layout of these important buttons is rather unusual.  Usually the power button itself is on top, but the manufacturer decided to break all the stereotypes and monotony.  Tablet Megaphone Login 3 reviews would have been better if not for such courage of the developers.  Naturally, you can get used to the left-side arrangement of buttons, but taking this device for the first time, you start to get lost a little. </p><p>  The right edge does not have any function keys.  The lower edge has only a microphone for conversation. </p><p>  In general, this tablet makes mostly a good impression.  Naturally, there are a few minuses.  But the state employee cannot be perfect. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Megafon Login 3 tablet we are reviewing has a small screen with a diagonal of 7 inches.  It is made on the basis of IPS matrix with a pretty good resolution of 600x1024 pixels.  It should be noted that thanks to the use of high-quality components, the screen itself has very large viewing angles and practically does not fade when they change.  But due to the use of special coating in some modes, working with the tablet is uncomfortable. </p>

    <p>  In bright sunlight, the information on the screen is almost imperceptible.  This is, of course, minus the low contrast of the image.  The lack of a light sensor is a little depressing, and the brightness is adjusted only manually. </p><p>  In general, in comparison with other gadgets of this price category, the screen is good for Megafon Login 3. The w3bsit3-dns.com tablet was appreciated well precisely because the manufacturer took into account the wishes of users regarding the second version of the gadget. </p><p>  As for the sensor, it is capacitive here.  It responds well to touch and can support up to five points at a time. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The normal working capacity of the tablet is ensured thanks to the latest version of the Android OS at the time of release.  In appearance, it is completely similar to the classic tablet OS.  The right menu provides the ability to configure quick access to applications and functions on their own. </p><p>  It is also possible to work simultaneously with multiple desktops in screen lock mode.  They are recommended to make shortcuts of those applications that are most often used.  At the same time, the speed of their launch increases significantly. </p>

    <h2>  Preinstalled software </h2><p>  Let's look at the main "wired" software that has a Megaphone Login 3 tablet. The reviews of those who have already tried this gadget are not very encouraging.  The fact is that instead of the standard programs that come with a clean OS, a lot of unnecessary junk is installed here.  Most users immediately delete them, since the benefits of these programs are few.  Instead, they install more functional software, but in smaller quantities.  The GooglePlay client, which the manufacturer didn‚Äôt think of deleting, is a little discharging. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  The multimedia <span>capabilities of the tablet are</span> not too amazing.  Everything is standard here.  It will not be difficult to replace with new and more functional video and audio players those that already have a Megaphone Login 3 tablet. The reviews and characteristics of these programs are not particularly encouraging.  In particular, the standard video player does not read all formats and conducts audio encoding a little ‚Äútightly‚Äù.  In addition to the video player, there is an <span>image viewer.</span>  There are no other multimedia programs here.  For this reason, their installation lies on the shoulders of users. </p>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The quality of shooting with the 3.2 megapixel main camera was also not very pleasing to those who purchased the Megafon Login 3 tablet. We will not review its capabilities in detail.  We can only say that the camera does not have autofocus and flash.  Pictures of normal quality in good light can be obtained.  But this is still not something that can be further viewed on the big screen. </p><p>  The front camera also does not shine with image quality.  It is used for making video calls and for this reason has not received much complaints from users because of its functional purpose. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The heart of the Megafon Login 3 tablet is a dual-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  For a state employee, this figure is good.  1 GB of RAM provides a normal response when launching applications.  Naturally, the Megafon Login 3 tablet received fairly good reviews.  The fact is that few expected him to have such a ‚Äúquick‚Äù reaction. </p><p>  There is very little internal memory.  But thanks to the ability to expand it with a flash drive up to 32 GB, the problem itself disappears. </p><h2>  Offline mode </h2><p>  The battery capacity in this tablet is 3500 mAh.  Together with an energy-efficient chipset, it allows the gadget to work offline for about a day with average usage.  To be honest, this is a very good indicator, and the Megafon Login 3 tablet received positive reviews about how it holds a charge. </p>

    <p>  It was noted: if you just look at mail and correspond in messengers, then the battery life can reach 4 days.  Agree, this is a very good indicator. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Tablet Megaphone Login 3 reviews in general received good.  This result was achieved due to the fact that no one expected functionality from a budget employee of the lowest price category.  And this is true, because it is not always possible to simultaneously get a smartphone for calling and a tablet at a price slightly lower than 2000 rubles.  A little manufacturer let us down with the location of the keys and the contrast of the display, but this is a trifle. </p>
