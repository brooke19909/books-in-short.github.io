The price is the same - 1500 rubles. </li><li>  Double + Extrabed.  The most expensive number is 1700 rubles.  As a rule, adults with a child settle here.  There are two beds: one is large, the other is not. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel berison kazan address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1429763.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If a guest arrives at <span>Kazan-1 station,</span> then in half an hour you can reach the Astronomical station.  However, it will be more difficult to get from another place of arrival. </p><p>  With Kazan-2 it is easiest (and cheaper) to use the usual metro.  You need to choose the Tukaya Square station, as the hotel is located right next to it.  You can get to it from the "North Station".  After leaving the metro, you need to go to Bauman Street and go until the guest rests in the "House of Tatar Cuisine".  At the local traffic light, you need to turn right and go without turning anywhere.  After a hundred meters there will be a complex. </p><p>  Hotel "Berison" in Kazan has its own telephone number, by which you can book a room: 8 (960) 056-22-23.  You can call at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Hotel Moskovskaya </h2><p>  The hotel, located on the street of the <span>Paris Commune,</span> house number 13, is located on the picturesque coast of <span>Lake Kaban.</span>  The Kazan Kremlin is just 2 km away.

You can register at the hotel at any time.  Just five minutes from it is a restaurant with a cafe.  The metro is located 500 m, the railway station - 1.5 km, and the airport - 25 km. </p><p>  Consider the rooms that the second hotel "Berison" (Kazan) offers.  It is not located on Moskovskaya Street, but it is located next to the Paris Commune Street, therefore the hotel received this name. </p><ol><li>  Double  Double room with one giant bed.  There is also a bathroom, TV and other household appliances.  Cost - 1300 rubles. </li><li>  Twin (standard).

It is much larger than the standard, although it looks about the same.  The average cost is 1400 rubles. </li><li>  Double + Extrabed.  Families with a child come here.  The price of this option is 1,500 rubles. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel berison in kazan" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1429767.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The second hotel "Berison" (Kazan), the photo of which is in the article, is located very close to the station.  If the landing occurred on the first, then you can walk on foot very quickly.  However, in case of arrival to Kazan-2, it is necessary to do all the actions that followed during the trip to the complex on Astronomicheskaya Street.  This is a metro line called Tukaya Square.  When the guest leaves it, it is necessary to turn left on Bauman Street.  Then get to Pushkin and walk to the federal university.  Before it, turn right, and after the intersection, turn left. </p><h2>  Hotel Kamala </h2><p>  The complex is located on the street <span>Galiaskara Kamala,</span> 5a.  This hotel ‚ÄúBerison‚Äù (Kazan), whose address will tell you how to find it in the city, is 800 meters from the world-famous mosque. </p><p>  Each room has a TV, the bathroom has a shower.  The reception is open 24 hours a day.  The hotel is 900 meters from this complex, while the airport is 23 km away. </p><p>  Consider the numbers: </p><ol><li>  Double  For 1300 rub.  You can stay in a beautifully decorated room with a large double bed per day. </li><li>  Twin (standard).

If the disembarkation occurred at station No. 2, then after the train (train) you need to get on the bus.  It should go to the "collective farm market."  At the intersection, get up from it, and turn left a little later. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan there are many hotels and hotels.  After some of them raised the cost of their services several times, many customers moved to the Berison Hotel (Kazan).  Reviews of people about him are quite pleasant, which is important. </p><p>  Top quality lingerie, service deserves applause, tap water flows with good pressure.  Everyone likes the fact that parking is located right next to the hotel.  No need to leave the car, God knows where, and then another twenty minutes to go to the new apartment.  It surprises the guests that the walls are quite thin, but you will not hear any sounds, day or night, while in the room.  This is really a great advantage of the complex. </p><p>  Small, but quite comfortable, you can call the hotel "Berison" (Kazan).  The phone number where you can book the room is listed above.  The rooms have everything that the administration says on the official website: TV, refrigerator and other appliances.  On the second floor there is a kettle, sugar, microwave. </p><p>  Service is marked by all guests as a separate item.  All staff are friendly and responsive.  Price and quality are in an excellent ratio, which can‚Äôt be destroyed by small flaws. </p><p>  Hotel ‚ÄúBerison Kamala‚Äù (Kazan), reviews of which are often only positive, was noted by the fact that some of its rooms look onto the street near the pedestrian walkway.  Guests will be happy to gather for a walk every morning and evening in a good company of friends. </p><p>  The rooms are at least small and simple, but quite clean and unrealistically beautiful, this is noted by each guest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel berison kamala kazan reviews" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1429765.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, it is worth noting that some at night a little blowing from the windows.  In the summer, this is even on hand, but in the autumn - not really.  Certain guests tried to write down the lack of household chemicals (shampoos, etc.) in serious disadvantages, but this is more an exception than a rule.  It can be seen that the administration is constantly trying to correct all the shortcomings, even the most insignificant ones.  Several complaints of noise were noted, but they were isolated cases.  In general, judging by the silence, it largely depends only on the neighbors.  In the parking lot, sometimes the seats run out, in which case what should a person who did not have time to leave his car do?  This question, unfortunately, remains unresolved.  Some guests had a smell in the bathroom, water on the floor.  However, such cases are isolated, and almost no one writes about this. </p><p>  The pricing policy of this hotel is liked by everyone.  Cheap rooms that are always clean and comfortable.  What could be better?  Perhaps the only drawback is the lack of a large amount of space, but it is strange to get a room for 75 square meters for one and a half thousand rubles.  m. That is why few people bring this issue up for discussion and try to draw special attention to it. </p><p>  Considering all the reviews, I must say that everyone is 100% advise this hotel to stay.  Almost every former guest focused on the fact that the complex is small, but the administration and staff try to maintain coziness and comfort in the rooms, as well as to maintain maximum cleanliness.  Visitors also say that the Hotel ‚ÄúBerison‚Äù is located near Bauman Street.  There are a huge number of attractions that you can admire without going far beyond the city.  If a person has not managed to reserve a parking space, those who have already been here are advised to go to the underground, there is usually enough space for everyone at any time.  Moreover, here the machines do not heat up, which means that their engine is not affected by sunlight and works much better afterwards. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, I must say that ‚ÄúBerison‚Äù is one of the best hotels in Kazan.  The fact that the guest lived here, he never regrets, as evidenced by the mass of reviews on the forums. </p><p>  The main advantages are a low price category, a high level of cleanliness, good service, and some free services. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, the following can be emphasized: in some rooms the windows are blowing, the parking is too small, the rooms do not differ in large dimensions. </p><p>  In this article, three Berison hotels have been described, which have gained wide popularity.  I really want the administration to continue to work at the same pace tirelessly.  After all, it is here that I want to return every time a free week is issued.  Have a good rest and pleasant emotions! </p>
