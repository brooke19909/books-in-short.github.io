  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Voluntary insurance</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Insurance is a special type of relationship between the insurer and the insured, based on an agreement to protect the interests of both individuals and organizations at the time of the occurrence of specific events.  At the same time, material interests are protected.  The insurance contract is essentially a document certifying the sale of an insurance product, and is executed in the form of a policy. </p><p>  The specificity of insurance products is that the contribution made by the insured is always much less than the <span>insurance amount (the amount</span> to which property interests are assessed and which the insurer undertakes to pay upon the occurrence of certain insured events prescribed in insurance contracts).  Therefore, the market attractiveness of insurance products provides just such a ratio. </p><p>  Insurance has its own classification.  In accordance with the form of involvement in insurance relations distinguish: </p><p>  - compulsory insurance carried out in accordance with the law; </p><p>  - voluntary insurance. </p><p>  Voluntary insurance implies the voluntary <span>conclusion of an</span> insurance contract.  Insurance rules for such insurance products are developed by the insurer.  The specific conditions under such an agreement are determined individually in accordance with the wishes of each insured individually. </p><p>  Voluntary insurance can protect the material interests of a particular person in various spheres of life.  We will analyze some of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Voluntary motor third party liability insurance.</span>  This type of insurance is carried out along with compulsory insurance - CTP and in no case does not replace it.  The need for this type of voluntary insurance is due to the fact that OSAGO, as a rule, does not cover real losses if <span>an insured event</span> occurs <span>.</span>  <span>For OSAGO, the</span> limit of liability for iron is only 120,000 rubles, and for victims - 160,000 rubles.  Voluntary motor third party liability insurance (DSAGO) is designed to expand the liability limit by maximally approximating the amount of payments to real costs, since it is possible to extend motor third party to 3 million rubles.  This advantage in comparison with compulsory motor liability insurance is further enhanced by the fact that <span>insurance premiums</span> on DSAGO are significantly lower. </p><p>  <span>Voluntary accident insurance is</span> designed to protect you and your loved ones from unpleasant surprises, such as illness, disability, injury and death.  The positive point is not the high cost of the policy (insurance contract), even with the most complete package of risks.  Each policyholder individually chooses for himself those risks that, in his opinion, are most relevant.  Under this program, it is quite possible and necessary to insure children, since they are as susceptible to various dramatic situations at such a great age due to their high activity and curiosity.  Voluntary accident insurance will allow you to remain financially independent even if an insured event occurs, since the insurance company is obliged to reimburse all expenses for the necessary treatment and rehabilitation if the incident is an insurance event, protection against which is provided for by this type of insurance. </p><p>  Voluntary insurance can be concluded not only by individuals, but also by legal entities, allowing you to provide protection for your employees.  But it is worth noting that voluntary insurance, regardless of who the insurer is, is necessarily in favor of a specific individual: family members or employees of the organization. </p>
