  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big screen on Android devices - the main reason for the envy of iPhone users?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is believed that only true connoisseurs of "apple" products are completely delighted with the iPhone, while completely unable to recognize some of the obvious advantages of Android.  However, recently on the Aport website mobile phones based on the Android OS have been more popular, and many of these users have changed their attitude towards the iPhone.  So, the residents of Moscow and other Russian regions were particularly impressed by the large screen of Android devices, because there is no such thing on the iPhone.  Thus, even such a parameter gives reason to argue that the iPhone is gradually ceasing to be considered the height of perfection, and <noindex>  <span>buy phone</span> </noindex>  from Apple is far from being an opportunity to emphasize your status and material well-being.  Many experts on the mobile market argue that at the moment, cheapness is not the main advantage of Android, because this operating system has a lot of its unique qualities, which the iPhone lacks. </p><p>  Now the mobile market is full of all kinds of devices that look incredibly seductive.  So, smartphones based on the Windows Phone OS, according to most users, are attractive for their design, but they lack some popular applications, while Google Android is a customizable and open platform.  Android device users say the iPhone seems too small.  However, there are some users who are confident that a smartphone with a large screen is somewhat awkward and easy to read.  However, observers are confident that there is irony in this situation, because it was Apple that ushered in the era of large-screen mobile phones.  Recall that earlier the iPhone screen was considered large enough, which distinguished it from competitors' devices, in particular, from Samsung.  And now, after a few years, the "apple" company has established itself as a manufacturer that is actively promoting small phones. </p><p>  However, current trends in the mobile device market are forcing Apple to reassess its priorities.  For example, this year it is expected that the company plans to introduce iPhone users with an enlarged screen. </p><p>  Of course, the theme of large screens, according to experts, is one of the most controversial.  However, the large display size of Android devices is a clear advantage of this operating system. </p><p>  However, the opinions of experts were divided, as users have completely different tasks.  For example, one phone is needed exclusively for voice communication or text messaging, and the other - for constant navigation on the Internet, in which the large screen is incredibly relevant. </p></div></article>
