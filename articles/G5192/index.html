  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paying taxes: tax period as a mandatory element of tax</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The main part of the <span>revenues of the state</span> budget and extra-budgetary funds is made up of tax payments.  Taxes are <span>mandatory payments,</span> in fact, they are free of charge, unlike fees.  The tax code of Russia contains an exhaustive list of taxes and other payments that are not included in it cannot be introduced in our state.  But, in addition to this, the tax must also contain all the necessary elements.  One of them is the tax period.  Close to it, but not of the same type, the concept of the reporting period is already an optional element of the tax. </p><p>  A tax period is a period of time, the time allotted for determining another element of the tax - the tax base, and, directly, the tax itself.  Do not confuse the tax period with the <span>tax payment deadline.</span>  As a rule, the tax period is one calendar month or one calendar year - this will depend on the specific tax.  But the reporting period is most often equal to the quarter, that is, three months.  The reporting period is also an optional element because its tax legislation may or may not.  Yes, and the regions themselves and municipalities are independent in resolving the issue regarding the reporting period - they want, they install - they want, they don't install. </p><p>  When calculating taxes and fees in payment documents indicates the indicator of the tax period, consisting of ten digits.  This indicator also specifies the existence of the reporting period.  That is, we are talking about the fact that the tax is paid not once, but by periodic payments, and at the end of the tax period the final amount of tax is determined minus advance payments.  This indicator can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each tax has its own tax period stipulated by the tax code.  Not only the tax itself is established by federal legislation, but also its mandatory elements: subjects and objects, tax bases and rates, tax period and calculation procedures, as well as the procedure and terms of tax payments.  All other <span>elements of the tax</span> are optional. </p><p>  Federal taxes are established and enforced simultaneously.  But for regions and municipal units, it is necessary to introduce already established federal taxes as a separate own act.  Moreover, the authorities of the subjects and local authorities have competence only to the extent limited by the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The tax period for <span>income tax is</span> established (and introduced) precisely at the level of the Russian Federation, since this tax is federal and must be paid to the federal treasury.  All taxes in our state are accepted and approved by the Federal Authority - the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (the State Duma and the Federation Council). </p><p>  Income tax is charged on organizations, not individuals.  This <span>tax is direct.</span>  The tax period for this tax coincides with the calendar year.  Further, the taxpayer - the organization - must calculate profit tax on the basis of the tax base during this year.  The tax base is the economic basis of the tax, in this case, all the income of the enterprise will be taken into account, minus all expenses, that is, we are talking about net profit.  Tax legislation provides for <span>advance payments</span> for this type of tax - every three months.  But a monthly tax report is also possible throughout the entire reporting year.  After that, until the 20th day of the next year, the organization submits to the body at the location of the enterprise a declaration (statement of the established form) in which it calculates the tax payable.  Based on this application, income tax is paid.  The deadline for payment is before the 25th day of the year following the reporting year. </p>
