Admittedly, she is not the only one.  After the collapse of the USSR, a lot of military equipment remained in small republics.  It became too expensive for the new authorities to keep it, so they simply wrote it off and left it to rust on the street.  But with this cemetery a completely different story.  In this case, the equipment was specially thrown into the danger zone in order to protect people from the <span>effects of radiation</span> that these machines were contaminated with. </p><h2>  Chernobyl accident </h2><p>  The equipment cemetery in Chernobyl is one of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, which we can observe today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chernobyl equipment cemetery" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1973303.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the date of <span>April 26, 1986</span> was remembered by the whole world.  It was on this day that the largest technological disaster in the world occurred.  The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant immediately claimed many lives, but its consequences in the long run turned out to be much more destructive.  For many years, those who were somehow connected with this accident or its liquidation, struggled with diseases and ailments caused by radiation.  The harm to human health caused by this accident, according to scientists, will fully affect the next several generations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Liquidation of an accident </h2><p>  To eliminate the consequences of the accident, more than half a million people and a huge amount of equipment were involved, which now can not even be counted.  As soon as possible, more than 100 thousand residents were evacuated from the territory of 30 kilometers surrounding the nuclear power plant.  These places have become uninhabitable forever. </p>

    <p>  The authorities promptly decided to build a sarcophagus, which was supposed to bury the remains of radioactive substances, as well as the ruins of an exploding nuclear reactor.  For this, a large number of construction equipment was involved, which also turned out to be contaminated. </p><h2>  Technique in Chernobyl </h2><p>  <span>The cemetery of military equipment</span> in Chernobyl is one of the largest in the territory of the former Soviet Union.  Of course, before the accident, so many cars weren‚Äôt here.  They began to be actively brought here from all over the USSR in order to quickly evacuate residents and eliminate the consequences of the accident.  The equipment that received the highest dose of radiation was immediately disposed of in a repository.  They simply buried her.  And some engineering vehicles that directly worked at the epicenter of the accident were walled up in a sarcophagus.  They literally became supports for him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All buses that delivered brigades of liquidators to the nuclear power plant were promptly buried.  They also received a huge dose of radiation and were dangerous to humans.  The basis of the cemetery of equipment in Chernobyl was machines that took part in construction work.  In this case, it was either impossible to deactivate or too expensive.  The equipment was thrown in a restricted area away from people. </p><h2>  What equipment was in the cemetery? </h2><p>  Today, a large number of photographs are available, which depict the cemetery of equipment in Chernobyl.  These are buses, trucks, military armored personnel carriers and even airplanes.  The personal cars of local residents were also abandoned, since during the evacuation only the most necessary things had to be taken.  In addition, most people believed that very soon they would be able to return home again. </p>

    <p>  The cemetery of <span>abandoned equipment</span> in Chernobyl clearly demonstrates that everyone who could be involved in the shortest possible time participated in the liquidation of the accident.  First of all, this applies to military and power structures, for example, to fire services.  There were many volunteers who came on their vehicles.  Today, disassembled cars look especially eerie in the cemetery of radioactive equipment in Chernobyl.  It turns out that people, risking their lives, took them apart for parts to resell, without thinking about the fact that individual parts are most likely radioactive. </p><h2>  Ghost town </h2><p>  Today, the Chernobyl equipment cemetery, the photo of which is in this article, is concentrated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ghost town - Pripyat.  There are real apocalyptic landscapes everywhere that excite everyone‚Äôs consciousness.  From many cars there were only skeletons.  Everything else went to parts.  The innards are stolen and sold by marauders.  These places, like all the mysterious and mysterious, today attract many tourists.  Some dream of seeing mutants in the exclusion zone, others dream of taking photos of a lifeless world.  Excursions to Pripyat are carried out, but only in those places where work was done to deactivate the soil, as well as the surrounding buildings. </p>

    <p>  Everyone coming to Chernobyl must visit Pripyat, as well as the surroundings of the power plant where the explosion occurred.  Another important point of the program is the cemetery of abandoned equipment. </p><h2>  Impact of the Chernobyl accident </h2><p>  How did the Chernobyl disaster affect people and the environment?  It is difficult to answer this question even 30 years after the tragedy.  Obviously, many diseases are younger today - heart attacks are increasingly occurring with very young people.  It is possible that this is one of the consequences of an accident at a power plant.  An even more obvious consequence is a surge in cancer.  After all, radiation seriously affects oncology.  In addition, she had a negative impact on the animal world.  In the restricted area, the population of individuals has declined significantly. </p><p>  The cemetery to which this article is dedicated perhaps best illustrates the helplessness a person experiences against atomic energy.  Having estimated the amount of equipment that remains in Chernobyl, one can realize what efforts were directed at evacuating people and eliminating the consequences of the accident.  Around today remains only emptiness and terrifying destruction. </p>

    <p>  Not so long ago, the news appeared on the Web that a technology cemetery had disappeared from Chernobyl.  In evidence, they even cited images taken from modern space satellites; various theories were expressed.  Some even claimed that the infected equipment was used in the conflict in southeastern Ukraine.  In reality, these messages turned out to be fake.  Technique still remains on the territory of Chernobyl. </p>
