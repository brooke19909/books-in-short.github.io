    <p>  Secondly, the rules for receiving and paying for medical care during your stay abroad must be found out before the contract is drawn up.  They specifically indicate that in the event of an insured event, it is necessary to fill out an application by phone and wait for the arrival of a specialist.  If there is a need for emergency medical care, then the client pays all expenses.  To receive compensation, upon arrival in the Russian Federation it is necessary to provide copies of checks with translation into Russian or English. </p><h2>  eOSAGO </h2><p>  The Russians are very popular electronic insurance policies.  Among the major players in the market, they were offered by only two companies, Rosgosstrakh and RESO-Garantia.  But the first one recently closed the eOSAGO service.  Now you can apply for an electronic policy not only at RESO, but also through second-tier companies, for example, RSO Euroins LLC.  The entire registration procedure is executed directly through the company's website.  The developed interface is considered by many users to be the most convenient of the existing ones. </p>

    <p>  The number of persons who can simultaneously issue a policy on the site has been limited by the Euroins insurance company.  User reviews confirm this.  Most often, the first attempt to issue an electronic policy is unsuccessful.  The error "KIAS Web is blocked" appears on the site.  If you don‚Äôt give up and click the ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button a couple of dozen times in a row, then, sooner or later, the registration form will open. </p><p>  Service users highlight an important advantage in work.  All information is entered and verified in stages.  First enter the data about the car.  At the next stage, they are checked.  If the information is entered correctly, the user proceeds to fill out a diagnostic card, etc.  It is better to follow such a scheme than to fill in all the fields, and then find out about the error.  The service on the Euroins website indicates in detail what specific information is filled in incorrectly. </p><p>  Tourists can also get e-health insurance.  This product is intended for customers who spend their holidays in different regions of the Russian Federation and abroad.  An electronic policy is accepted at all visa centers and consulates. </p><h2>  Instructions for the design of eOSAGO </h2><p>  User registration is carried out through a mobile phone.  Password in the form of SMS comes immediately after filling out the form.  In the event of a system failure, just click the "Reset Password" button and the procedure will resume. </p>

    <p>  When you first enter your personal account, you need to fill out information about the car owner.  All lines must be checked carefully, since editing information in the next steps is blocked.  In the application form, you must indicate the name, registration address and phone number.  The big advantage is that the address line can be entered manually, and not select from the drop-down list.  You can register data in the policy in the same way as in the PCA database.  After filling all the lines you need to save the form. </p><p>  At the next stage, data about the car is filled in the Euroins policy.  Information for verification needs a minimum: VIN, car power, series and registration document number.  Inspection data is automatically verified with the EAISTO database. </p><p>  At the next stage, data on the policyholder from the registration form, which cannot be changed, is automatically pulled up.  The penultimate step is payment of the policy with a plastic card.  In the special form you need to enter the account details and name of the payer in Latin letters. </p><p>  According to this algorithm, a policy is purchased through the service that Euroins Insurance Company presented on its website.  User reviews confirm that very often the server freezes at the stage of insurance payment.  The problem is solved by refreshing the page.  In most cases, you can get an eOSAGO policy without leaving your home the first time. </p>
