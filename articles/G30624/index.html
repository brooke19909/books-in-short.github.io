    <h2>  Village on the banks of Psezuapse </h2><p>  P. Lazarevskoye in the Krasnodar Territory was named after the famous Russian naval commander, admiral, the man who was one of the first to set foot on the lands of Antarctica.  Russian-speaking residents appeared in the village in the 19th century.  Who lived before in the territory of a modern tourist center? </p><p>  Where the Lazarevskoye settlement of the Krasnodar Territory is located, only Circassians once lived - people who speak a language that has nothing to do with Russian.  They called this place ‚ÄúPsitshepe kal‚Äù, which means ‚Äúa city at the mouth of a good river‚Äù.  P. Lazarevskoye is located on the right and left bank of the Psezuapse.  This is one of the largest rivers in Sochi. </p><p>  Psezuapse originates from the southern slopes of the Main Caucasian Range.  Its length is about forty kilometers.  Adygs lived here until the beginning of the Crimean War.  Later events took place, after which the settlement, which the former residents called the city in their own language, began to gradually change its appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  From the village to the spa center </h2><p>  Today, the Lazarevskoye settlement (Krasnodar Territory) is the district center of Sochi.  Its length is more than a hundred kilometers.  In the second half of the 19th century, the future resort village began to be settled by the Pontic Greeks - immigrants from the Ottoman Empire.  At first, no more than forty families lived here.  In the 80s of the XIX century, Russians began to move here. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, there were about sixty yards in the Lazarevskoye settlement of the Krasnodar Territory.  In one of the guides, the village was called a quiet village settlement with the prospect of becoming a visited resort due to its excellent geographical location.  The brochure, intended for Russian tourists, was published at the beginning of the 20th century.  The words spoken by the compiler of the guide were justified.  P. Lazarevskoye (Krasnodar Territory) really became a major resort center. </p><p>  Due to the wide variety of types of entertainment, thousands of tourists relax here in season.  Which, of course, affects prices.  The private sector in Lazarevsky among vacationers is very popular.  After all, the cost of a hotel room is quite high.  True, private tenants also tend to inflate prices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mikhail Lazarev </h2><p>  In the 1840s, the construction of the navy began.  Lazarev led the process.  Admiral organized the protection of the coast.  The fortification on the site of modern Lazarevsky was founded in 1839.  Thirty years later, a settlement appeared here, named after the admiral who showed heroism in the defense of the Caucasus. </p><p>  Lazarev was not only a famous navigator, but also an honorary member of the geographical society.  In addition, he made several trips around the world.  For seventeen years, Mikhail Lazarev led the Black Sea Fleet.  In 1954, a monument was erected to him in the village.  In the nineties they wanted to remove the monument.  Fortunately, the locals understood that the story could not be changed, no matter how much it was not wanted.  In 2003, the monument, by then partially destroyed, was restored.  It is located in the station. </p>

    <h2>  From the history of the village </h2><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, after the end of the Crimean War, local residents were evicted to Turkey.  They were replaced by the Pontic Greeks.  Such an exchange was not accidental.  It was an agreement between Russia and Turkey.  The village gradually developed, although quite slowly.  Before the February Revolution, there were already hospitals, a post and telegraph office, a pharmacy, two schools, a restaurant, several shops and a water mill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One of the sights of the village is the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Built at the beginning of the 20th century.  Then Lazarevskoye was not yet a resort village.  Residents were mainly engaged in the cultivation of tobacco, corn, gardening, viticulture, and the collection of chestnuts, fruits, and nuts. </p><p>  Lazarevskoye was a quiet, sparsely populated settlement until the middle of the 20th century.  The status of the district center acquired in the thirties.  After the Second World War, the village received a second wind, turned into a large settlement with a whole complex of boarding houses, sanatoriums, rest houses.  In its vicinity, there are well-known natural monuments, for example, Boxwood and <span>Svirskoe Gorges,</span> Forest Fairy Tale Waterfalls, Laura's Tears. </p>

    <h2>  Lazarevskoye today </h2><p>  Most of the population is involved in the tourism business.  Eight months a year the village is half asleep.  Local residents are gaining strength to receive guests, because for a short holiday season they need to give all the best to failure.  Every year here, according to reviews, everything is getting better.  The hotel business is slowly but surely developing.  So far, its level, of course, is far from European, but the tourism industry at foreign resorts was built over several centuries.  Lazarevskoye is still at the beginning of the journey. </p><p>  It is worth saying that this is the cleanest area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater Sochi.  The village was not affected by the Olympic construction and the lawlessness that accompanied it.  The embankment in Lazarevsky can serve as proof of this - the sea is clean and there are no industrial emissions. </p><p>  Today, the village has everything that is necessary for a good rest.  Namely, the climate unique to Russia, the variety of palm trees, acacia trees, cypress trees and, of course, well-developed infrastructure.  It employs about a hundred resorts, many hotels.  There are opportunities in the village for a "wild" vacation.  In Lazarevsky every year there are more and more private beaches.  This does not mean that in the village you have to pay for everything.  No one has canceled the municipal beach here.  However, gradually people get used to comfortable conditions, and at the same time learn to pay for decent service. </p><p>  Lazarevsky presents all levels of accommodation.  However, the vacationer should plan the budget correctly.  If you save on housing, there will be money for entertainment.  Why pay for an expensive room for those who plan to spend all day on the beach, and evenings in a cafe or at a disco?  By the way, many vacationers prefer to swim at night.  The sea temperature in Lazarevsky in July and August allows this. </p>

Near the entrance to the gorge you can buy homemade wine, souvenirs and Caucasian sweets. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  "Berendeevo kingdom" - the name of one of the popular tourist routes.

Turning to them, you can quickly find housing.  But as a rule, these are intermediaries and the prices they usually inflate.  According to reviews of people who have repeatedly rested in Lazarevsky, it is better to walk in search of housing along the streets of the village.  Almost every second house you can see information about the delivery of housing.  The farther from the sea, the cheaper, of course. </p><p>  In June or September you can find cheap housing.  At the peak of the season there are few decent places to relax.  In July and August it is difficult to find a room even in a hotel.  In villages located near Lazarevsky, prices are lower, but the choice of housing does not differ in variety.  Usually these are not particularly attractive rooms in private homes with courtyard amenities. </p><h2>  The cost of rental housing in the private sector </h2><p>  In general, prices in the village of Lazarevskoye are high: for housing, and for food, and for entertainment.  How much does it cost to rent a room in this resort?  It all depends on the month.  Owners who rent rooms change prices in the same way as hotel owners.  In 2017, the cost varied between 1200-3500 rubles.  The most expensive month is August.  At the end of summer, prices for some apartments reach four thousand rubles a day.

Electric train, train - the most economical options.  However, they are not suitable for everyone.  Electric trains run to Lazarevsky quite rarely, you have to wait two or three hours at the station, which is not very convenient for families with children.  It is more convenient to get by taxi.  The road will take about two hours, but it leads along a serpentine road, and therefore traffic jams cannot be avoided.
