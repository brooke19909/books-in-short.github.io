    <h2>  What can be said about St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Many say that St. Petersburg is the most beautiful city in Russia.  It is difficult to say whether this is true or not, but one thing can be stated with 100% certainty - there is something to see here, regardless of your financial capabilities and time of year.  Here you will find huge drawbridges, imperial architecture, which has been perfectly preserved to this day, as well as a lot of museum streets, cathedrals and much more.  You will also learn <span>what the white nights of</span> St. Petersburg are.  However, for a tourist who does not know what and where is located, it will be very difficult to coordinate their actions.  Therefore, we will now consider the most unusual <span>places in St. Petersburg.</span>  Of course, it will not be possible to list everything, since there are a lot of them, so we will consider only the very best. </p><h2>  Museum of Illusions </h2><p>  On the Moscow Avenue there is a Begemot photo studio, where this interesting place actually is located.  Having visited the Museum of Illusions, you find yourself in a completely different dimension, where there are visual as well as sound illusions.  There are basketball players with the growth of a 6-year-old child, and you can also sit on a chair with just one leg.  "How?"  - you ask?  Everything is based on optical illusion.  Hollywood directors use these techniques to create gnomes and giants, unicorns and dragons.  In this place you will find a full-fledged exhibition with holographic 3D objects, which partly drive our subconscious into a dead end, because it is sometimes difficult to understand how this can be, because in our usual life we ‚Äã‚Äãpractically do not encounter this.  If we consider the most unusual places in St. Petersburg, then the Museum of Illusions is one of them.  You must definitely go here.  In addition, here you can touch the exhibits with your hands, test them, and take pictures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most unusual places in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/574251.jpg" width="600"></div>  Mirror Maze </h2><p>  If you like extreme sports to some extent, then why not visit the mirror attraction on 61 Nevsky Prospekt. You need to be here if only because it is the world's largest mirror maze with a length of more than 500 meters.  It is located underground.  You will be a true treasure hunter.  Your goal is to find a precious treasure.  On your way there will be more than a hundred tips, but they are all hidden in antique cabinets, chests and chests of drawers.  And who knows what dwells there: skeletons, ghosts or some other monsters.  But you will not be alone in your journey.  Heroes from a wide variety of fairy tales will come to the rescue, for example, Alice, <span>Cheshire Cat,</span> Red Queen and many others.  Especially memorable will be the path with colored ribbons, which can be anything.

The Botanical Garden was founded in 1714 by Peter I and was called the ‚ÄúPharmaceutical Garden‚Äù.  Today, this place in terms of the number of collections, as well as their importance, can be compared with the largest botanical gardens in Europe.  In summer and autumn, visitors can observe the flowering of some of the most gigantic flowers in the world.  Petals of water lilies can reach 2 meters in diameter and can withstand a weight of more than 60 kilograms.  In late spring, you can see how the ‚ÄúQueen of the Night‚Äù is revealed - an exotic and very rare flower.  Since such beauty can be observed only a few hours around midnight, the opening hours of the botanical garden are specially extended.  Here you can take great memory photos that will remain with you forever.  If you want to capture the color of camellias and azaleas, then you should definitely visit this place. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual places spb for photo" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19732/574261.jpg" width="600"></div>  Ghost Village in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  If you are looking for unusual sensations from your travels, then be sure to visit ‚ÄúRussian America‚Äù - this is the second name of this unusual place, which is located in the vicinity of the village of Nazia.  The history of this village is amazing and exciting in its own way.  In 1930, American specialists came here to establish peat extraction.  During the war, work was stopped and many left this place.  After some time, part of Nazia was restored, and the other half was left destroyed and empty.  Already in the 1960s, production was resumed here and peat was mined again, but after 20 years, reserves were exhausted, and most of the population left.  In 2012, only 240 people lived in Nazia.  If you are looking for interesting places for photos (St. Petersburg), then you need to visit the ghost village.  Here you will find abandoned soldiers‚Äô huts and towers, civilian houses, old factories, as well as storage facilities.  In some places furniture is still lying, labels and newspapers are scattered. </p><h2>  Church of the Savior on Blood </h2>
