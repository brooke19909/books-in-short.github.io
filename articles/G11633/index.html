Each doll is individual in its own unique outfit.  The only thing that unites them is the porcelain from which they were created. </p><h2>  Biography of the famous DeAgostini </h2><p>  DeAgostini begins its activities in 1901.  After 58 years, he releases the first encyclopedias that are gaining popularity in Italy.  He also works on a series of historical journals, studying a lot of literature.  After that, the author prints more than 250 publications and distributes them in 40 countries.  His work will reach Russia only in 2004.  The most famous works of DeAgostini are dolls in folk costumes. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It all starts back in 1901.  In Italy, a company opens under the leadership of DeAgostini and the production of new and amazing dolls begins.  Each was made of porcelain, and was dressed in national clothes of different nations of the world.  They were named after the creator - "DeAgostini". </p>

    <p>  At first, the <span>dolls of the peoples of the world</span> "DeAgostini" were not very popular.  Until 2004, little was known about them in the world market.  However, after the appearance of porcelain beauties in the Russian market, demand for them began to increase.  Since DeAgostini created unusual dolls, their price was much higher than that of ordinary plastic Barbie.  For example, in 2005, Barbie could be purchased for 40 rubles, and a porcelain fashionista - for 250-300 rubles.  At the same time, there were those who could afford to buy a gorgeous doll, even at such a high price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  DeAgostini: work on publishing the first doll magazine </h2>

    <p>  Soon after the birth of porcelain beauties, work began on publishing the magazines of the collection "Dolls in Costumes of the World of DeAgostini."  Each issue described the history of a certain people, its customs, traditions, holidays.  Particular attention was paid to photographs and paintings. </p><p>  On the cover of the magazine was a porcelain fashionista dressed in a national outfit of the people, which was discussed later.  DeAgostini described the outfit on the front pages of the magazine, and also did not forget to indicate not only women's, but also men's national costume.  All information was combined with paintings, which clearly depict everything that the author wrote about. </p><p>  Short list of published numbers: </p><ol><li>  India. </li><li>  Chile. </li><li>  Greece. </li><li>  Netherlands. </li><li>  Morocco. </li><li>  Hungary. </li><li>  New Zealand. </li><li>  Finland. </li><li>  Thailand. </li><li>  Switzerland. </li></ol><p>  This is not the whole list.  In total, DeAgostini created 33 magazines called "Dolls in Costumes of the World". </p><h2>  DeAgostini: Publishing House of the Second Magazine </h2><p>  The population‚Äôs interest in dolls was constantly growing, so the publishing of a new collection of DeAgostini magazines ‚ÄúDolls in Folk Costumes‚Äù began.  Here, the author also placed on the cover a picture with a doll in a <span>national costume.</span>  The story about this outfit began on the second page.  Again, the author did not forget to introduce readers to both women's and men's national clothes.  Further information was provided about the holidays, games, customs and traditions of this people.  DeAgostini selected the most colorful illustrations for each page. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the magazine began to be released with a "surprise."  DeAgostini made a bold decision - to put in each issue of the magazine a miniature copy of the famous porcelain dolls.  Each copy of the dolls was handmade. </p>
