It was <span>Steve Jobs who</span> first came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a touch screen in order to interact with a computer without a mouse or keyboard.  He decided to apply this technology on a mobile phone. </p><p>  For more than two years, the first iPhone has been developed in strict secrecy.  The <span>phone</span> went on <span>sale</span> in the summer of 2007, quickly taking the leading position in the US smartphone market.  As expected, this gadget combines the functions of three devices.  It became not just a telephone, but could also be used as a handheld computer or music player. </p><p>  It should be noted that the very first iPhone had a number of disadvantages.  He received a lot of criticism, for example, due to the lack of 3G support, as a result of which less fast technology was used to access the network.  In addition, the phone did not support the MMS service.  However, the latter was easily fixable, since in the end a special application was created that eliminated this drawback. </p>

    <p>  The smartphone‚Äôs advantages include a successful design, user-friendly interface and some specific features that only this device had at that time.  Currently, the fifth <span>iPhone model</span> has already been released <span>,</span> after which rumors began to circulate that the first-generation phone is outdated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Apple has confirmed these assumptions.  Officially, the manufacturer in June 2013 is going to announce that the gadget is going out of consumption, and therefore its service support stops.  However, fans of the smartphone are not only not discouraged, but are also looking forward to new items - the sixth model, about which there are a huge number of rumors and legends. </p>

    <p>  The first iPhone has an aluminum back panel, as well as a plastic cover at the bottom of the device, which covers the antennas.  The successful design of this model for a long time determined the appearance of such devices.  In less than a year of existence, this gadget was ahead of the sales of all its competitors, leaving them far behind. </p><p>  And now fans of high-quality and stylish mobile devices remain faithful to the manufacturer, choosing new models that are offered to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone first" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3216/46955.jpg" width="460"></div>  Today, the world cannot be imagined without this phone, and only 6 years ago its performance was considered a revolutionary breakthrough in the technology market.  The first iPhone did what it seemed to be fantastic before.  The features that the gadget had at that time seemed somewhat surprising.

    <p>  It should be noted that the company holds the brand, so it continues to occupy a leading position.  Each model has its own advantages, which distinguish it from the novelties of other manufacturers.  Despite the fact that the cost of the gadget is much higher than other similar devices, it is chosen by those who value quality and reliability. </p><p>  Having ushered in a new era in the development of smartphones, the first iPhone officially goes on sale.  And this may mean that Apple decided to surprise its fans with another device that will not disappoint them. </p>
