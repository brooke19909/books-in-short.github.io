Alas, so far the re-equipment of the fleet is going at a very slow pace.  So far, the "old people" who were laid and built in the USSR have to stay afloat.  These include the project 1144. </p><h2>  Basic information </h2>

Their uniqueness lies precisely in the nuclear "heart", since there are no more such surface ships in the Soviet and Russian fleets and never were.  NATO also appreciated these vessels: their size and armament inspired respect for any potential adversary.  The designer in charge of project 1144 was Boris Izrailevich Kupensky.  The post of his deputy was Vladimir Yukhin.

    <p>  No matter how standard this may sound, these ships really have no analogues in the world shipbuilding.  They are fully universal, allow you to perform tasks on the destruction of surface and submarine ships of the enemy.  On these ships, missiles of such a class were installed that it was possible with a high degree of probability to guarantee the complete destruction of almost any group of probable enemy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Project 1144 is also known for the fact that these ships were the largest in the world, not counting aircraft carriers.  The closest American counterpart, the Virginia cruiser, is 2.5 times smaller in displacement.  These vessels are multifunctional: they can carry out long-term combat missions in almost all parts of the World Ocean, provide support and cover for both surface ships and coastal fortifications.  In general, they were armed with almost all the latest tools created by that time in the USSR.  The main striking force was the Granite missile system. </p><h2>  A brief history of the series </h2><p>  At the end of March 1973, the first nuclear-powered cruiser of the 1144 Kirov project was laid down, which in 1992 became the Admiral Ushakov.  At the end of December 1977, he was already launched, and exactly three years later the ship, having passed all sea and combat tests, was solemnly handed over to the USSR Navy.  At the end of 1984, Tark Frunze entered service.  In the same 1992, he was renamed "Admiral Lazarev."  Finally, in 1988, strictly according to plan, the fleet received TARK Kalinin, known since 1992 as Admiral Nakhimov.  In 1986, project 1144 came to its logical conclusion: the last project ship Peter the Great was laid at the shipyards. </p>

In the midst of construction, the country ceased to exist in which this ship began to be built, and therefore could only be completed in 1996.  Thus, the fleet received the last ship of this series only ten years after its laying on the slipways.

This gave an impetus to domestic research in the field of the use of <span>nuclear reactors</span> as a power plant for ships.  In principle, this was the expected decision: the USSR was at the peak of its development, and therefore it was in great need of large warships, which could operate for a long time in isolation from their main forces. </p><p>  The nuclear power plant was very conducive to the successful completion of such tasks.  In 1964, the country was already conducting active scientific research in this area.  Initially, industry and scientists received the task of designing a ship with a displacement of up to eight thousand tons. </p><h2>  Battle couple </h2><p>  Designing was carried out from that point of view, each future cruiser of the project 1144 should have the opportunity to confront all types of weapons that the fleet of the probable enemy has.  In addition, the Soviet military was well aware of the threat posed by enemy aircraft, and therefore requested the creation of the most effective naval missile defense.  Initially, the designers suggested that one Project 1144 cruiser would simply not be able to carry such a quantity of weapons.  And therefore, initially they wanted to create two <span>ships at</span> once <span>: type</span> 1165 and type 1144. They had to cover each other, acting as one. </p>

They should have received anti-aircraft weapons in equal proportions, which ensured the creation of a powerful air defense.  However, further successes of Soviet science and technology predetermined the possibility of reducing many ship systems, and it was decided to abandon the unnecessarily energy-intensive project of two ships.  All work of type 1165 was discontinued, part of the work was transferred to the nuclear-powered cruisers of Project 1144 Orlan.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Arms and displacement increase </h2><p>  In the course of work, the ship received an increasing amount of weapons, which caused a rapid increase in its displacement.  As a result, no one already remembered the ship‚Äôs original anti-submarine mission, since engineers were completely free to create a huge universal cruiser with a displacement of up to 20 thousand tons.  It was decided to introduce into his "stuffing" all the most modern technologies that the Soviet Union could create at that time.  It was then that a new type of ship was identified - the heavy nuclear missile cruiser (TAKR).  The new Orlan project 1144 missile cruisers promised to become the most promising and powerful trump card for the entire Soviet surface fleet. </p><p>  The requirements for the new car were finalized in 1972.  The development of the project at an accelerated pace was carried out in Leningrad.  As in all such cases, scientists and engineers worked under the guidance of not only their immediate superiors, but also the curator of the fleet.  This time he was a captain of the 2nd rank A. A. Savin.  This approach allowed the Navy to receive exactly those ships that they needed, making appropriate adjustments as they progressed. </p><h2>  Improvements and improvements </h2><p>  It should be remembered that the second, third and fourth nuclear missile cruisers of project 1144 were to be built according to the new, improved project 11442. It was supposed to replace the systems that had already become obsolete with new types of weapons: the six-barrel turret guns of 30 mm were replaced by the perfect Dagger.  Instead of the Osa air defense system, a Dagger was installed, the caliber of the universal artillery mount was increased to 130 mm, the Metel anti-submarine complex replaced the improved Waterfall, new bombing systems (depth charges) were also installed, etc. </p>

So in reality (almost without reservations) only ‚ÄúPeter the Great‚Äù refers to project 11442, and the second and third ships occupy an intermediate, transitional position.  This is how the Orlan project (1144) came about, the modernization of the ships of which continues to this day.

    <h2>  Key design features </h2><p>  The body of each "Orlan" is distinguished by a noticeably elongated forecastle.  In the case there are 16 main compartments, which are separated from each other by waterproof partitions.  Along the entire length of the hull are five full decks.  In the bow mounted sonar complex "Polynomial".  Aft there is a hangar (under the deck), which allows the deployment of three Ka-27 anti-submarine helicopters at once.  There are also lifts for helicopters, as well as storage tanks for helicopter fuel. </p><p>  At the stern there is a compartment from which the towed antenna of the Polynom complex descends.  Almost all of the body‚Äôs power structures are made of magnesium-aluminum alloys.  The layout of the weapons is classic - most of the combat systems are located at the stern and bow. </p><h2>  Protective characteristics of the ship </h2><p>  Each Project 1144 missile cruiser carries a powerful anti-torpedo reservation, a double bottom is provided throughout the hull.  Vital parts of the ship are locally protected by armor.  The belt armor in its classical form is absent (as on most modern ships).  The main protection is located in the back of the case.  The difference from other cruisers of that time is that the TAKR has a thickened lining from the stern to the bow 3.5 meters high.  Meter - under the waterline, 2.5 meters - protection of cars and crew. </p>

Engine rooms, reactor and rocket rooms are protected by armor 100 mm thick.  The combat posts and command post of the ship are protected in the same way.  There is armor around the helicopter hangar, the ammunition depot is similarly protected.  Tiller compartments are covered locally.

    <h2>  Power point </h2><p>  The design used the reactor KN-3 (with core VM-16).  This installation is a direct descendant of the OK-900 icebreaking reactors, but it is very different from them.  The main differentiating factor is uranium with a high degree of enrichment.  At one gas station, the cruiser can operate for at least ten years.  Two-loop reactors, in each circuit water is used as a heat carrier (more precisely, bidistillate).  This is special water of a very high degree of purification, circulating through the core under a pressure of 200 atmospheres.  This provides almost instant boiling of the second circuit and high efficiency of the entire installation. </p><p>  The power plant uses a circuit with two shafts, with each of them "working" for 70,000 liters.  from.  The entire installation is located in three aft compartments.  The total number of nuclear reactors is two, their total capacity is 342 MW.  For comparison, the Perm State District Power Plant delivers 2,400 MW, so the ship consumes energy, which is enough for a city in which 100-150 thousand people live.  In the turbine compartments there are (in addition to the main ones) two reserve boilers. </p><p>  It must be remembered that Project 1144 "Orlan" has a backup power plant (not nuclear), which allows the ship to reach a speed of 17 knots.  Diesel reserves are such that a cruiser can travel up to 1300 <span>nautical miles.</span>  When using nuclear reactors, the vessel can reach speeds of up to 31 knots, and the range is unlimited.  Thoughtful contours of the hull provide these ships with excellent seaworthiness, allowing them to cover huge distances in the shortest possible time. </p><h2>  Crew Details </h2>

    <p>  A two-level unit is responsible for medical needs, including an outpatient room and a fully equipped operating room, isolation wards, a dentist's office, and also a pharmacy.  The crew can maintain physical fitness in the gym, fully equipped with all possible simulators.  There are three cabins, a separate lounge for relaxation, as well as a real movie theater. </p><h2>  The main armament of the cruisers 1144 </h2><p>  As we have already said, the role of the main armament is played by the P-700 Granite anti-ship missiles.  These are the third generation missiles, supersonic, the hallmark of which is the approach to the target at an extremely low altitude.  Their mass is up to seven tons, and when approaching, they reach speeds of up to 2.5 Machs (2.5 times faster than the speed of sound), can carry a standard explosive charge of up to 750 kilograms.  The second option is a nuclear charge with a capacity of 500 Kt at a distance of up to 625 kilometers.  The length of the rocket is ten meters, the diameter is 85 cm. In one complex there are 20 such shells mounted at an angle of 60 degrees to the surface of the deck.  Launchers were manufactured in Leningrad. </p><p>  It should be noted that the "Granites" were originally intended to be launched from submarines, and therefore, before a combat launch, their cavity is filled with sea water.  To shoot down such missiles is extremely difficult.  Designers have made it possible that even when Granite is hit by an interceptor missile, it retains a kinetic momentum of such force that it can reach the target. </p><h2>  Air defense </h2><p>  The basis of missile defense on these ships is the S-300F (Fort), whose spinning drums were located under the deck of the ship.  The total number of anti-aircraft missiles is 96.  An updated S-300FM Fort-M, which exists in a single copy, was installed on Peter the Great.  At the same time, such a complex can neutralize up to six targets, simultaneously accompanying another 12. A missile is aimed at each of the ‚Äúside‚Äù targets, and this is not hindered by possible interference on the air that a potential adversary can set. </p><p>  Project 1144 heavy cruisers Orlan currently carry 94 of these missiles.  The decrease in their number is due to an increase in weight and size characteristics.  Initially, this unique complex was created on the basis of the S-Z00PMU2 Favorit, a purely land army defense system.  Its advantages over the standard ‚ÄúFort‚Äù are that it can hit targets at a distance of up to 150 kilometers, and the minimum interception height is only 10 meters, which is extremely important in the conditions of anti-ship missiles, which ‚Äúadore‚Äù flying up to the target at extremely low altitude.  It was possible to increase the coverage of <span>the affected area</span> due to a sharp improvement in the characteristics used in the electronics complex. </p><h2>  Second tier missile defense </h2><p>  SAM "Dagger" - the second "highlight" TAKR.  Theoretically, it should have been installed on all ships of the improved project 11442, but actually the same Peter got this weapon.  The purpose is to detect and destroy targets that managed to break through the first line of the layered missile defense.  The main striking force in this case is 9M330 solid-fuel rockets, which are absolutely unified with the famous Tor-M1 land complex. </p><p>  The peculiarity of these shells is that they are ejected from the launch shaft by a special catapult, and only then the marching engine starts.  This approach has significantly reduced their overall weight and size characteristics while maintaining the full range of targets. </p><p>  The complex is recharged automatically, volleys go every three seconds.  In automatic mode, targets can be detected over 45 kilometers, reaction time - up to eight seconds.  The number of simultaneously fired and tracked targets is up to four.  This installation works fully automatically, without the need for personnel support.  According to the manufacturer, there should be 128 missiles for the ‚ÄúDaggers‚Äù on board one ship. </p><h2>  Third tier missile defense </h2>

He replaced the very obsolete six-barrel installation.  As in the previous case, this system can detect and track the target in a fully automatic mode.  The defeat of the target is provided by modernized six-barreled installations (two pieces), the total rate of fire of which is 10 thousand rounds per minute.  They ‚Äúinsure‚Äù them two blocks of four 9M311 missiles in each.  They are distinguished by a fragmentation-rod combat filling and a contactless fuse.  This allows missiles to hit the target, just being close to it, which dramatically increases the likelihood of an enemy shell being destroyed.

    <p> In the turret space of each installation, there can be 32 of these missiles in containers.  They are unified with the land complex 2C6 "Tunguska".  They can carry out the tasks of destroying <span>anti-ship missiles,</span> guided bombs, aircraft, helicopters and drones of the enemy.  Missiles "Dagger" can reach the target at a distance of one and a half to eight kilometers, fire from six-barrel installations is conducted at a distance of 50 to 150 meters from the side of the ship. </p><p>  Targets flying at altitudes of five to four thousand meters can be hit.  The total ammunition of the Kortikov is 192 missiles and 36,000 shells.  Currently, project 1144, the modernization of which has not yet been completed, is receiving improved versions of these installations. </p><p>  Alas, today there is no information whether a complete modernization of ships of this class will be carried out, which involves the replacement of electronics with modern analogues.  It is hoped that this will be done.  New cruisers of this project are clearly no longer expected, so the remaining should be watched especially carefully. </p>
