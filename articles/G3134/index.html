Samsung mobile devices are designed with very useful security features that you can configure to protect your device from prying eyes.  But sometimes the user forgets the key and cannot turn on the phone.  To help forgetful Samsung users, there is special software.  Pattern Lock is available in older versions of Android.

Moreover, users do not want the attacker to gain access to information if the phone is stolen.  But sometimes this security feature prevents forgetful owners from entering the device on time and requires an unlocking procedure. </p><p>  Previously, using a memory card, copy both program files to the root of the card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The unlock procedure for the graphic key on the "Android" consists of the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Insert a memory card into an Android device. </li><li>  Turn off the device. </li><li>  Turn up the volume, press Home + Power together to start recovery. </li><li>  In this mode, the touch will not work, therefore, use the volume up and down keys and select them using the home button. </li><li>  Select ‚Äúupdate zip from sd card‚Äù before unlocking the Samsung pattern. </li><li>  Select "cwm.zip". </li><li>  A clear color menu appears. </li><li>  Select ‚Äúinstall zip from SD card‚Äù. </li><li>  Click ‚Äúzip from sd card‚Äù. </li><li>  Select ‚Äúdelete_passward.zip‚Äù and click ‚Äúyes‚Äù. </li><li>  The process will complete after a while. </li><li>  Go back and select "Reboot device". </li></ol><h2>  Additional updates to the Sony Xperia system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.android.gs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Additional updates to the Sony Xperia system" class="if uuid-3032730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3032730.jpg"></div><p>  Sony has taken the liberty of adding additional security updates with the latest Android firmware, including Sony protection at various levels.  In addition, it provides a built-in application that helps protect screen locks with passwords, a PIN code or pattern.  But the main problem occurs when the user forgets the password and cannot restore access to the device. </p><p>  There are good solutions for unlocking the graphic key on Android: </p><ol><li>  Via Factory Reset. </li><li>  Bypass Sony lock screen password using a Google account. </li><li>  Unlock Sony screen by removing Android password. </li></ol><p>  Unlock Sony Xperia Pattern Key via Factory Reset: </p><ol><li>  If you need to reset the factory version of your Sony Xperia, then make sure that the password or pattern is removed from the lock screen. </li><li>  Turn off the Sony Xperia and reboot it by pressing the Home + Power + Volume buttons down.  In this case, the recovery mode will be activated. </li><li>  Use the volume up and down buttons as arrows and select ‚ÄúFactory Reset / Wipe Data‚Äù from the options. </li><li>  Press the home button to make your choice, and wait for the phone to switch successfully. </li><li>  Now you can access Sony without any pattern or screen lock. </li></ol><p>  The disadvantages of this method of unlocking the graphic key on Sony: </p><ol><li>  This method will completely delete all files, documents and privacy settings from the phone. </li><li>  It is not recommended if the smartphone has important data that cannot be lost. </li></ol><p>  Bypassing your Sony lock screen password with your Google account: </p><ol><li>  Each lock screen application allows you to reset your password by entering your Gmail login credentials. </li><li>  You need to activate this feature on a locked phone. </li><li>  Do not enter the wrong password until the ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù link appears on the main screen. </li><li>  Click on it once, and the application will ask you to enter your Gmail account information. </li><li>  Enter your login credentials and access your account. </li><li>  The application will send a new password or lock pattern to the email address. </li><li>  Now you can use the new password to access your smartphone. </li></ol><p>  Cons of this option to unlock the graphic key on the phone: </p><ol><li>  A stable network connection is required. </li><li>  Useless method if the user did not have Gmail as a recovery option. </li></ol><h2>  Password Removal on Xiaomi Phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="makeradvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlock Password on Xiaomi Phone" class="if uuid-3032743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3032743.jpg"></div><p>  Since deleting the screen lock password can lead to the loss of user data, you must remember to save important data before proceeding.  If a user has opened a cloud service, you need to check its status on i.mi.com to determine whether the data has been synchronized with the cloud or not. </p><p>  It is recommended that you use the unlock pattern option to clear user data.  Phones that support ROM firmware via cable must perform the following steps in sequence: </p><ol><li>  Enter Fastboot and connect to Xiaomi assistant. </li><li>  After the phone has opened the Xiaomi account, press the ‚ÄúFind phone‚Äù function and find the interface of the search device, then select the ‚Äúerase‚Äù function on the phone. </li><li>  If the phone is associated with a Google account or an MI account, you can find the ‚Äúforget password‚Äù option on the lock screen interface by trying a few incorrect passwords. </li><li>  Click it and enter the required Google / MI account and unlock password.  Using an account will require a data network connection. </li><li>  If the phone is not tied to a Google or MI account, you can enter recovery mode to clear user data. </li><li>  To do this, you need to connect the MI phone assistant, and then enter recovery mode to clear the data. </li></ol><p>  This action will destroy personal information such as SMS, contacts, call history and account information.  Therefore, caution is required when unlocking the Xiaomi pattern key. </p><h2>  PhoneRescue Software Unlocker </h2><div class="photo" data-original="getintopcv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PhoneRescue Unlock Program" class="if uuid-3032749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3032749.jpg"></div><p>  This is a professional Android device management software to easily unlock your phone without code and recover lost or deleted data on your Android phone.
