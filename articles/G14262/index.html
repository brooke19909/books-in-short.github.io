Using favorable natural conditions, Greeks, Phoenicians and Punians (their common descendants) built colonies here.  As you know, the last settlers were expelled from here by the Romans.  But after 9 centuries, the Romanesque population <span>of Gabes Bay</span> itself suffered from Berbers and Arabs. </p><h2>  Turning a fishing area into a resort </h2><p>  Former nomads from the bloodthirsty inhabitants of the desert first turned into fishermen, and in the last century - successful hoteliers and restaurateurs ... Fishing ports (in Gabes 60% of Tunisia's fishing industry are concentrated) attract thousands of tourists. </p><p>  At the service of Western travelers and residents of the former Soviet Union - one of the prominent guest establishments that southern Tunisia can offer is the Palais des Iles 4 * hotel. </p>

    <h2>  The day life of the Roman Meninks </h2><p>  Tour operators recognize its northern part as the main resort of the bay.  Among other islands, Djerba is located here.  It is the largest in the North African state.  For several centuries, it served as the most reliable shelter for the Berber-Libyan corsairs. </p><p>  The island capital (Houmt Souk - ‚Äúfortress bazaar‚Äù) is the work of the Jews who lived here once.  It is with them that the main object of excursions is connected - the synagogue of La Griba (its age is more than 2500 years).  Today the temple is the oldest monument of Jewish religious architecture.  It remains to add that the Israeli community ceased to exist in the middle of the last century, leaving numerous traces in the local dialect ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Near the synagogue is Bordj el-Kebir - the "Big Tower" (from it the natives fired from the Ottoman invaders).  You can also explore the Tegermess lighthouse (preserved on the territory of the Dzherba Explor ethnic village) and the Gellala pottery quarter (with a museum of folk crafts). </p><p>  Among the other interesting things of Djerba, all the cafes that serve rice cooked according to the local recipe, as well as shops selling the famous cupcake blanket, should be highlighted.  Nature lovers will not pass by a population of pink flamingos.  Thanks to them, the Romans called the nearby lagoon the word "meninks." </p><p>  After the vacationers explore the whole island, they will be taken directly to the Sahara from the hotel ... </p>

    <h2>  Palais des Iles: from Veraclub to 4 * </h2><p>  The hotel Palais des Iles 4 * <span>(Tunisia, Djerba)</span> received its name in a reminder of the good old days when all the countries of the Western Maghreb were a solid French colony.  From the language of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Napoleon, the Palais des Iles roughly translates as "a palace among the islands."  Until 2014 (the time of the last reconstruction of the hotel and its acquisition of a 4-star status), the word Veraclub was added to the name.  This has been called the fashionable shelter since 1998. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The name ‚Äúpalace among the islands‚Äù is quite justified - from the windows of the Palais des Iles hotel you can see other isolated pieces of land.  They lie very close to the shores of the resort area "Djerba Medun", surrounded by picturesque date palms scattered here and there, as well as a dense olive plantation.  From the airport here go 25 kilometers, from the town of Midoun - only 5 kilometers.  The huge guest villa was built on the 1st line of the above urban area - 50 meters from the sea, surrounded by a souvenir shop, three shopping centers and an upmarket restaurant.  Convenient hotel accommodation is noted in their positive reviews by many tourists. </p><p>  By the way, an isolated section of the beach awaits guests on the coast (sun loungers, sun loungers and sun awnings are provided for guests of the Palais des Iles free of charge, renting beach towels costs only 10 dinars). </p><p>  Around the large oval-shaped pool (with sunbeds and umbrellas), a park landscape was designed.  In its center is a 4-level modern building with 3-story extensions.  The rest of the infrastructure is spread out on their sides, including also a spacious car parking. </p>

    <h2>  Wherever you go, you‚Äôll find yourself in the lounge bar, then in the ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù </h2><p>  Guests of the hotel Palais des Iles 4 * (Djerba) receive the right to food on a buffet basis.  It is served in the main restaurant - Palmeraie.  Chefs are familiar with dishes of pan-European and Italian cuisine.  The waiters offer visitors any drinks.  According to the reviews of the Russians resting, the room is a bit cramped, and the staff is clearly not enough ... But this is smoothed out by a memorable vintage decoration, as well as amazingly tasty freshly prepared food. </p><p>  The drinks restaurant (√† la carte) hospitably opens its doors nearby. </p><p>  Gourmet services include lounge-snack bars (located in the barbecue and snack areas).

    <p>  Hotel Palais des iles 4 * - one of the main places in the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island.  This is an institution in connection with which the Russians had only positive impressions and many pleasant memories (constantly refreshed by watching the photo session ‚Äúclicked‚Äù here).  People find the hotel staff attentive and very good-natured.  The hotel is always happy with its guests.  Any questions can be resolved without delay, and in favor of the guests.  Have a nice rest! </p>
