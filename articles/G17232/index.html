    <h2>  Where is the Smolninskaya Hotel </h2><p>  The address of the hotel complex makes you flinch and recall the formidable years of dispossession and other achievements of the October Revolution.  The hotel is located on Proletarian Dictatorship Street, house 6. Indeed, the hotel is located in the area that is the cradle of the October Revolution.  The rooms offer views of the Smolny Cathedral.  Nearby is also the Government House of St. Petersburg.  From the proximity to the boarding house of noble maidens, which was the headquarters of the revolutionaries, the Smolninskaya hotel got its name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to get to other main sights of St. Petersburg?  The hotel is located at an equal distance from two metro stations: Vosstaniya Square and Chernyshevskaya.  Nevsky Prospekt, the Hermitage, the Summer Garden and the Russian Museum can be reached by bus number 22 in ten minutes.  From Tulskaya Street, which is located near the hotel, trolleybuses of routes 5, 7 and 11 go to the center. It is seventeen kilometers to Pulkovo Airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Smolninskaya address" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1304733.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What does the hotel complex look like? </h2><p>  Despite the formidable name of the street on which the hotel is located, it looks modern.  And when you enter the luxurious lobby, make sure that capitalism ultimately triumphed.  All the interiors of the modern six-story building are designed in the Empire style.  The hotel has its own courtyard, where there is a free secure parking for cars of hotel guests.  Many tourists recommend booking rooms that look exactly there, because there will not be noise from the street.  Although the view of the openwork blue-white Smolninsky Cathedral is worth it to listen to the voice of Peter. </p><p>  Check-in occurs from 13.00.  This is perhaps the only inconvenience that reviews say.  For early check-in, the hotel requires an additional charge of half the price of a room per day.  The reception desk works without interruption.  Hotel staff speak English. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Interactive tv" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1304724.jpg" width="373"></div>
