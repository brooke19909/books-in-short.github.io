Do-it-yourself school sundress</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A few dozen years ago, absolutely all students were required to wear the prescribed uniform, which greatly facilitated the life of parents.  Buy a dress or <span>sundress for the girl</span> at that time was not difficult.  All <span>children's clothing</span> stores had a special department where they could pick up uniforms of absolutely any size, for both boys and girls. </p><p>  Today, the generally accepted style does not exist.  There was only an agreement regarding the combination of colors.  A light top and a dark bottom are classic.  And just such a combination asks the parents to adhere to the administration of any school.  In addition to the standard combination of blouses with a skirt or trousers, girls are allowed to wear sundresses over a light blouse.  But today it can be quite difficult to choose a thing of a suitable size, especially when it comes to clothes for first graders.  Often, babies entering the school trail simply do not correspond to the generally accepted size line of the form produced today.  And even the smallest models turn out to be great. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="school sundress patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1109901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, it will not be amiss to learn how to sew a school <span>sundress with your own hands.</span>  The patterns of this garment presented in the article will help the craftswomen to understand the principle of creating a base pattern and modeling various styles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps, work on a new outfit for a little schoolgirl should begin with determining the cut length of the material and measurements. </p><h2>  Calculation and taking measurements </h2><p>  To pattern <span>school sarafans</span> and calculate the fabric, you should measure the child‚Äôs height, chest, waist, hips, back width, height from shoulder to chest, as well as length from shoulder to waist and the length of the finished product.  For any model, whether it is a straight silhouette or an option with <span>a pleated skirt</span> with a canvas width of 150 cm, you will need a cut equal to the length of the finished product + 10 cm for the design of the seams and the hem of the hem.  If the width of the material is 110 or 80 cm, its consumption will increase by about 20 cm. </p><h2>  What material is not worth taking? </h2><p>  Select fabric for school sundress should be based on such requirements for the canvas: </p><ol><li>  The fabric should not be pricked, which means that wool should immediately be removed from the materials in question.  And do not be seduced by her naturalness.  To the child‚Äôs body, she will be very rude and uncomfortable. </li><li>  Garbage should not cling to the fabric, and therefore velor, velvet and velveteen for school uniforms are not an option. </li><li>  The canvas must be wear-resistant, whether it be knitwear or dress fabric. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns of school sundresses for girls" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1109907.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  What is better to sew a sundress? </h2><p>  The so-called school fabric, as well as caton, gabardine, will be an ideal option both in price and in quality.  But you can use other costume fabrics.  Knitted fabrics can be used for diving and jersey.  In any case, the patterns of school sundresses discussed in this article are suitable for the manufacture of products from any fabric, the difference will only be in the fastener. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to fabric, work will require sewing equipment, matching threads, 50 cm zippers or buttons.  But, as practice shows, the child will be more comfortable with a clasp. </p><h2>  Building a template </h2><p>  The main pattern of a school sundress for a girl of 7 years old, on the basis of which absolutely all styles are modeled, is built in accordance with the measurements taken from the figure.  To develop a drawing, you need to draw a rectangle on paper or on construction film.  One side is half the circumference of the chest, the other is the length of the product.  Further, the construction can be divided into several stages: </p><ol><li>  On the first you should draw a grid.  Namely, in accordance with the measurement of the height of the chest, determine the additional horizontal line on which the armhole will be based. </li><li>  Half of the width of the back recedes from one edge of the rectangle on the resulting line, and then divide the half-circumference of the chest by 4, add 2 cm and postpone this value from the previously obtained point.  This will exit the armhole zone, and everything else is half the front shelf. </li><li>  In the upper corners of the rectangle outline the neck.  For the back from the side where half the width of the back was measured, for the front in the opposite corner. </li><li>  The pattern of a school sundress for a girl of 7 years old is good because there is no need to draw tucks for the chest.  Therefore, it remains to draw shoulder seams 7 cm long and draw armholes to the chest line from the back and front half. </li><li>  The last stage is the flaring of the side seams to the bottom.  Its size depends on the difference in girth of the chest and abdomen of the child. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern school sundress for a girl of 7 years" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35781/1109912.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all the tricks of building the main pattern of school sundresses.  All of its changes relate to design and modeling.  And on this topic it is worth talking separately, because by changing the number of cut elements and their shape, you can achieve amazing results. </p><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  If you slightly change the basis, then new patterns of school sundresses will come out.  For example, in the drawing, relief seams can be identified from the shoulder and to the bottom, sections of which are flared to the hem.  A six-piece product will look like a bell and is perfect for a little skinny girl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself school sundress patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1109773.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  You can also make the top detachable, and make the skirt out of a strip of fabric collected by bow or regular folds.  The place of combining both parts can be decorated with a satin ribbon and a bow.  In this case, it is best to lower the waist by about 7 cm. </p><p>  Patterns of school sundresses for girls can be improved.  For example, it is not difficult to slide it on the back and make a real ladies' sheath dress for the baby in this way. </p><p>  Also interesting options will be models with a tulip skirt and a peplum at the waistline. </p><h2>  Armhole and neck design options </h2><p>  Sewing a school sundress, whose pattern is built so easily, is not at all difficult.  The most difficult thing that can lurk during assembly is the <span>processing of the neck</span> and armhole.  They can be decorated <span>obliquely</span> in the main fabric or a selection of lining material, duplicating the main fabric of the product to the waist line. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew school sundress pattern" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1109763.jpg" width="600"></div>
