    <p>  If necessary, you can pay a visit to the medical office. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  Many holidaymakers leave wonderful reviews about their time at Tej Marhaba 4. </p><p>  As a rule, tourists note exotic natural features.  The fact that Medina (the ancient city) is located nearby is very convenient, since tourists do not have problems with walking.  A lot of good is also said about the beach.  Almost transparent fine sand - you can only dream of such a thing!  It is also very good for vacationers that the beach area, which belongs to the hotel, is fenced, no strangers are allowed into this territory.  The ability to use free umbrellas and sunbeds creates a pleasant experience.  And on the beach there is no need to crowd. </p><p>  Tourists have great impressions regarding excursions, since not far from the hotel there is an ancient city surrounded by fortified walls, which in the past should have reliably protected the city from the sea.  Inspect the observation tower of Khalef al-Fata - history buffs can only dream of it!  Tourists show interest in mosques.  In Sousse, where the Tej Marhaba 4 hotel is located, there are many.  Even those who are not Muslims can enter the Great Mosque, as it is officially recognized as a landmark in the city.  Tourists can admire other mosques outside.  Nevertheless, even an external inspection allows you to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe grandeur of these wonderful structures.  Near them, no doubt, the breath of history is felt.  One has only to listen to the inner sensations, and before the eyes of travelers will appear pictures of the magnificent past. </p><p>  Tourists with an interest in history invariably note a vivid impression of the collection of antique mosaics that are stored in the local Archaeological Museum.  Very interesting information can be obtained in the private museum Dar Essid, which is designed as the house of a wealthy official of the XIX century. </p><p>  But the ethnographic museum is a unique opportunity not only to see unusual objects, but also to feel and, therefore, to understand the worldview of people who live in Tunisia - in a very unusual place from the point of view of a European. </p><p>  Despite the fairly inexpensive prices for tourist packages and a fairly developed tourist infrastructure, vacationers often emphasize that not everything possible has been done at the Tej Marhaba 4 hotel to make the vacation unforgettable for very picky travelers.  Sometimes there are reports of insufficiently varied food, included in the price of the permit.  But this problem turns out to be solved, since there are many restaurants, bars and cafes near the hotel.  You can also visit the local bazaar and buy everything you need. </p><p>  The quality of service and the work of the staff as a whole are not satisfactory.  Moreover, reviews often emphasize that a not-too-picky tourist can relax here, enjoy the wonderful natural conditions and the opportunity to visit ancient and modern attractions. </p><p>  By the way, a positive attitude is a great opportunity to get the maximum of impressions and try to minimize the precipitate from annoying misunderstandings! </p>
