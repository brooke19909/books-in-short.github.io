    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  This question in most cases causes fierce debate among guests, even in five-star hotels.  However, the Kamelya World Holiday Village 5 * we are considering has avoided such a fate.  So he can be called a pleasant exception to the rule.  So, the vast majority of tourists were very pleased with the variety of menus and the quality of their meals.  Many were pleased with the fact that it was always possible to eat meat, poultry, fish, various snacks, salads.  Delicious sweets and fresh fruits were always available.  In addition, you could treat yourself to fast food in snack bars.  Our compatriots also had no claims to the quality of drinks. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item in the reviews of tourists also earned only positive ratings.  So, according to our compatriots, the beach here is very large, sandy and very well-groomed.  Even despite the fact that it belongs to three hotels at once, there is more than enough space for everyone.  None of the guests complained about the lack of sunbeds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kamelya world holiday village 5 side" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/985701.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  A large percentage of tourists preferred to spend time not on the beach, but on the terrace by one of the several pools located on the territory of Kamelia World Holiday Village.  However, a number of our compatriots in their reviews complain about the fact that there are objectively fewer sun loungers here (as opposed to the beach) than those who wish to accommodate them.  Therefore, some guests were forced to get up early in the morning and even before breakfast to occupy a sunbed.  Otherwise, you are unlikely to be comfortable sitting by the pool.  Many considered this situation a minus and expressed hope that the administration will soon solve this issue. </p><p>  However, in addition to relaxing by the pools, a lot of other activities can be found on site.  So, guests note excellent sports grounds, a good water park with water slides for children and adults, a spa. </p><p>  Animation in Kamelya World Holiday Village 5 * also received mostly positive reviews.  So, according to tourists, the animators do their job well here.  In the afternoon they invite everyone to take part in sporting events, play team games.  In the evening, both animators and guest artists make great entertainment shows.  Many guests enjoyed these events. </p><p>  Travelers who have come to rest with their entire families are also pleased to note that the hotel also thought about the smallest guests.  So, for them there are equipped with small pools, water slides, a mini-zoo.  In addition, the hotel has a children's club, where, according to the parents, their children went with pleasure, and in the evenings there is a mini-disco.  Also, the restaurant always has the opportunity to use a high chair for feeding. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the staff at the Kamelia World Holiday Village hotel complex deserves the highest praise.  So, in their opinion, the staff here are very professional, friendly and attentive.  However, our compatriots note that most of the hotel employees do not speak Russian.  The fact is that the main contingent of vacationers here falls on tourists from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries.  But if necessary, you can always find an employee who speaks Russian. </p>
