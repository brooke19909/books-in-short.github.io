Fishing in Karelia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone likes to relax, especially if it is possible to spend a vacation not at home, but on a trip.  This is used by <span>travel agencies,</span> which set quite high and often unreasonable prices for tours.  This is especially true for the service.  There are no special complaints to the agency and its employees, but the hotel and the excursion program leave much to be desired.  This becomes the reason that people are increasingly organizing leisure activities on their own.  If you are a supporter of extraordinary travels, then rest in Karelia with a savage by car is designed just for you! </p><h2>  Edge of opportunity </h2><p>  In the northwestern part of Russia, in the territory of 180 520 km (this makes up just over 1% of the federation), the Republic of Karelia is located.  The beauty of its untouched nature attracts tourists from all over the world.  This region is famous for its rich mushrooms and berries, forests, thousands of fishing places and amazingly picturesque landscapes.  The innocence of the earth and the purity of the reservoirs will relieve the tension that the big city and its bustle have placed on their shoulders.  There are all conditions for <span>ecological tourism.</span>  The region is worth visiting for all those who love evening conversations with friends around the campfire, are a supporter of hunting and fishing. </p>
