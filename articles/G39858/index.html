    <p>  The appearance of the device imitates even in small details its predecessor M4.  Actually, it will be simply impossible to distinguish a fellow from the M5.  This is not to say that such a solution is bad, because the appearance of the Xperia M5 smartphone was attractive. </p><p>  Plastic and metal in the body of the device give solidity.  And given that the device is waterproof, there is no doubt about the quality of the assembly.  The company used the materials as efficiently as possible, so the phone looks expensive. </p><p>  In front of the device is a display, camera, conversational and main speakers, sensors and a company sign.  The familiar touch buttons are on the display.  The back panel, covered with glass, got a camera, company logo and flash.  The top end sheltered the headphone jack, and the bottom - the USB jack and microphone.  On the right side is the shutter, volume control and power button.  The opposite side was allocated for the cells of a flash drive and a SIM card. </p><p>  The device accepts exclusively nanoSim.  There are two variations of the device: with one SIM card and with two. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the smartphone turned out to be stylish, although with a design already implemented earlier.  The use of cheaper materials is a little disappointing, but, most likely, the strength did not suffer from this. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Equipped the phone with a diagonal of 5 inches.  The resolution of 1920 by 1080, set in the Sony Xperia M5, will also please.  An overview of the advantages of the screen does not end there.  In addition to using <span>the IPS matrix, the</span> company used its own Mobile BRAVIA technology.  The development of the company allowed us to make the screen more saturated and bright. </p><p>  The display is much better than its predecessor.  If pixels were noticeable in M4, then in M5 as much as 441 ppi, and, accordingly, graininess is not observed.  The applied IPS matrix gives excellent viewing angles to the Xperia M5.  Owner reviews report the only flaw, namely, not the best display behavior in the sun. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  It is impossible to ignore the main advantage of the Xperia M5.  A review of the camera should begin by mentioning as many as 21.5 megapixels.  Although this option has always been a strong point of Sony.  The smartphone camera has an Exmor RS matrix, which is often used by the company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The front camera of the device does not lag behind in quality.  Made using the same technologies as the main one, the front camera has 13 megapixels.  In addition to good resolution, the device has a lot of shooting modes and useful functions. </p><p>  I would also like to note the video recording.  The smartphone has an incredible 4K resolution.  This characteristic allows the device to compete as a filming even with video cameras. </p><h2>  Filling </h2>

    <p>  Equipped the device with a premium MTK chipset called Helio X10.  The phone has eight cores running on a 64-bit platform with a frequency of 2.2 GHz each.  The video accelerator is also not bad, namely Power VR G6200. </p><p>  The RAM will also please users of the Xperia M5.  A review indicates as much as 3 GB.  Actually, the filling allows the device to cope with all tasks without any problems. </p><p>  The native memory of 16 GB did not fail either.  Of course, approximately 13 GB will be available, the rest is occupied by the system.  You can increase memory up to 200 GB. </p><p>  The smartphone works very quickly and without braking.  In addition to speed, minor flaws that were present in the M4 were fixed. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  A significant problem is the battery of the Xperia M5 phone, a review of which will be of interest to all potential buyers.  The battery capacity of only 2600 maH does not cause much enthusiasm.  In principle, this is the minimum capacity for such a filling.  The problem is that the battery is not removable and it will not work to expand the capacity.  All hope rests on Stamina's battery-saving technology. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  M5 runs on the basis of the "Android" new version 5.0.  Registration of the company also migrated to the new system.  The appearance of the system underwent almost imperceptible changes, but overall remained familiar.  There will be no need for updates, because the device comes immediately with version 5.0. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the device will somewhat cool the ardor of those wishing to purchase the Xperia M5.  A market review makes it clear that the price of the device fluctuates around $ 400.  It is much more expensive than its predecessor, but a smartphone is definitely worth the money. </p><h2>  Positive sides </h2><p>  The device has a huge number of advantages.  Just want to highlight one of the best cameras among mobile devices.  The quality is so good that the smartphone is able to replace medium-sized cameras and camcorders. </p><p>  Do not deprive the device and stuffing.  Such hardware is quite capable of competing with many flagships.  Although the phone is located in the middle category, all parameters bring it closer to the premium class. </p><p>  The excellent display will also delight owners.  Saturated colors and high resolution are suitable not only for entertainment, but also for comfortable work. </p><p>  Despite the use of inexpensive materials, the build quality and protection of the device turned out to be solid.  In fact, the M5 is not inferior in this regard to its predecessor. </p><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  The disadvantages are much smaller, in principle, they may not even be noticed. </p><p>  The most painful part of the device is its battery.  Of course, the technology of economy will significantly increase the duration of the work, but I want more capacity. </p><p>  There is a double impression about the appearance of the <span>Sony Xperia M5.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> some owners are full of dissatisfaction with the similarity of design with a number of models. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Japanese manufacturers have once again replenished their lineup with a successful novelty.  The device turned out to be excellent and almost has no shortcomings.  The only thing that can scare away the buyer is the high price. </p>
