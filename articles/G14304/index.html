    <h2>  Along the promenade </h2><p>  The embankment deserves special attention: along the river bank there are mansions and the Church of the Entrance of Jerusalem, built in the 18th century.  Churches and monasteries in the city of Torzhok (Tver region) - special attractions.  There are so many that would be enough for several large cities! </p><h2>  Not by bread alone ... </h2><p>  The oldest of them is the Borisoglebsky Monastery, founded back in 1038.  The fate of the monastery is very sad: it survived the fire, in the Soviet years it was a prison, but today it is again being served.  On the territory of the monastery is the tallest building in the city - the Church of the Holy Savior.  Its height reaches 50 meters. </p><p>  The combination of simplicity and magnificence of decor brings architecture connoisseurs to the Church of the Introduction of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the Temple.  Erected at the beginning of the XVII century, a stone building with an octagonal spire to this day collects parishioners under its roof. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Amazingly beautiful, the Church of the <span>Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary,</span> located on a hill near three streams, captivates the view with blue domes with a scattering of stars.  The church is famous for its iconostasis, the best in the whole region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torzhok Tver region attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12504/222688.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City center </h2><p>  And on the ‚ÄúJanuary 9‚Äù square of Torzhok, special sights, for example, the Chapel of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.  Built already posthumously according to the design of Lviv, the chapel initially had only one source of natural light - the dome.  In the basement of the building, a source was discovered whose waters were considered healing.  Now the chapel is transferred to the Borisoglebsky monastery. </p><p>  In the suburbs of Torzhok in numerous estates and estates there are also many architecturally significant objects. </p><h2>  Beloved Pushkin </h2><p>  On the Pogostnya Prutnya, which has existed for more than 700 years, the famous Anna Kern is buried, whose spell once struck Pushkin.  By the way, about Pushkin himself: he stopped many times in Torzhok on the way from Moscow to St. Petersburg, and in 1972 it was decided to open a museum named after the famous writer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãtorzhok sights" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12504/222689.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Where the kings rested </h2><p>  <span>Manor Znamenskaya-Raek,</span> built for the rest of the royal family, hospitably opens its doors to guests today: a picturesque park with ponds, buildings connected by a single colonnade that leads to the front yard - all this allows you to touch the old days and feel the spirit of grandeur of this architectural masterpiece. </p><h2>  Miracle Bridge and Wooden Fire Station </h2><p>  In the estate Vasilyevskoye, located near the town of Torzhok, attractions are no less interesting.  For example, the Devil's Bridge, erected from huge stones without fastening solutions.  The Museum of Wooden Architecture, created on the territory of the Lvov estate, contains monuments of rural architecture as exhibits: chapels, barns, a residential building and even a fire station. </p><h2>  Gold embroidery and legendary cutlets </h2><p>  Torzhok is famous for its gold sewing.  The ancient craft, which came from the Middle Ages, is still preserved in the city, and the factory now on a large scale produces products from gold threads.  But that is not all.  The famous fire patties invented in this small town of Torzhok are sights known among meat gourmets. </p>
