And if the weather is outside, the trip on vacation will be the best solution.  If lying on the beach is not at all interesting, you can arrange yourself a truly extreme vacation.  And the best underwater cameras that are not afraid of water, bumps and falls will help to leave memories for life. </p><p>  The underwater sea world is incomparable.  Bright colors, exotic algae and fish - how not to share such beauty with others?  Maybe it‚Äôs your photos and videos that will push friends and acquaintances on the same sea adventures.  Going on an extreme vacation?  Underwater cameras are a daunting task.  But we will try to do it.  It's time to explore the top 10 cameras for underwater shooting.  So, we will begin to study this indispensable technique today. </p><h2>  What are underwater cameras? </h2><p>  A huge number of different models of different price categories and with different characteristics are presented on the market.  All this seriously complicates the choice.  And even professionals have a hard time.  Usually, experts in the field of extreme photography distinguish two categories of underwater cameras: </p><ul><li>  Chambers for shallow water.  Those with which it is not recommended to shoot at a depth of more than 10 meters, the time the camera operates under water varies from 20 to 60 minutes.  Their mission is to capture an intense rest.  The case of such devices is sealed, which saves the equipment from moisture, dust and shock.  The camera is suitable not only for underwater shooting, but also for work in rain, snow and wind.  The disadvantage of shallow water machines is that in order to get high-quality and clear pictures, the water must be crystal clear.  Otherwise, the photos will be blurry and not sharp. </li><li>  Cameras for depth.  This technique belongs to the professional and is as much as possible protected from moisture and blows.  Designed for depths of up to 60 meters, however, some cameras are capable of more.  The advantage of such cameras is their long operating time in extreme conditions.  On average, the duration of the shooting can be from an hour to two.  Due to the high technical characteristics, the pictures are obtained in high quality and with high resolution.  Professional underwater cameras come with specialized filters, flashes and lighting equipment.  Such devices are well protected not only from water pressure, but also from mechanical damage. </li></ul><p>  If the purpose of buying a camera is to capture a bright vacation, then take a closer look at cameras designed for shallow water. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to look for when choosing? </h2><p>  First of all, you should decide for what purpose the device is bought.  When choosing, you should pay attention to such factors: </p><ol><li>  The most important thing is depth.  It depends on this parameter how deeply it will be possible to immerse the camera in water. </li><li>  The second most important parameter that affects the quality of images is the lens.  Orientation is at the capture angle.  In order to regulate the process and pamper your loved ones with high-quality images, it is recommended to purchase a camera with removable lenses or pay attention to models that differ in a wide range of capture angle values. </li><li>  In order for the photos to turn out to be of the highest quality at a depth exceeding 15 meters, you will have to stock up on additional flash.  Stationary flash output is only suitable for shooting at depths of up to 10 meters.  With all this, shooting is recommended in the daytime or spend money on a professional flash. </li><li>  The quality of photographs depends on the optics and resolution of the camera‚Äôs matrix.  For example, for amateur photos at shallow depths, a value of 10 megapixels and ordinary glass lenses are suitable.  If you need professional images, then the appropriate resolution is from 16 megapixels, and the optics should be professional. </li><li>  Pay attention to such a parameter as the strength of technology.  After all, extreme photo shoots carry the risk of a device falling, for example, from a two-meter height.  It is important that the camera continues to work stably.  You can learn about the strength of the camera from the technical passport, which indicates the strength coefficient. </li><li>  The interface, as a parameter, is important only for convenience and does not carry any practical benefit.  Choose a camera with a simple interface, because shooting under water is very dynamic, which is why you will have to quickly respond and set the necessary parameters. </li><li>  For shooting under water, an image stabilizer is vital. </li><li>  A fairly important parameter is the battery operation.  Even when shooting on land, it is very disappointing when the battery sits at the most inopportune moment, what can we say about shooting the underwater world.  Do not forget that when using an additional flash, the battery will drain many times faster, so the battery power is quite important when choosing a high-quality camera.  If anything, a spare battery will always come to the rescue. </li><li>  In addition to depth, it is important to pay attention to temperature indicators at which the camera will function perfectly. </li></ol><p>  Making a list of the best cameras that can give high-quality images is not an easy task.  Leading positions are occupied by world giants: Nikon, Olympus, FUJIFILM.  An overview of cameras for underwater shooting begins with these models. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tenth place - Xiaomi Yi Action camera </h2><p>  He is rightfully recognized as one of the best cameras designed for extreme shooting in 2018.

You can dive with the Sony camera to a depth of 10 meters.  And if the immersion depth is quite low, then the advantage of the camera is image stabilization and an LED flashlight that perfectly illuminates objects when shooting close up.  Therefore, you can refuse to purchase a flash. </p><p>  The most important advantage of the Sony underwater camera over other cameras is the IntelligentAuto function, which is responsible for recognizing the format of pictures and automatically adjusts the device to environmental conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony camera" class="if uuid-2383807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76877/2383807.jpg"></div><p>  To create stunning pictures, it is not necessary to have expensive professional equipment.

The basic kit is not equipped with a GPS navigator, but there is an improved version, which costs significantly more. </p><h2>  Sixth place - Panasonic Lumix DMC-FT4 camera </h2><p>  Externally, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FT4 is more like a toy camera than a shockproof and waterproof camera.

There are real legends among photographers about Nikkor lenses.  They have high resolution and powerful aperture, which allows you to take bright and sharp photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nikonos camera" class="if uuid-2383833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76877/2383833.jpg"></div><p>  The body of the camera is metal, so this device has gained confidence even among US Navy scouts.  For a waterproof camera for underwater shooting, you can choose any accompanying technique in the form of lenses and flashes for specific purposes. </p><h2>  First place - the camera in boxing </h2><p>  The most common aquabox takes the deserved first place.  The easiest option for underwater shooting is a water box, in which you can put an existing camera.  Covers provide the opportunity to take with you absolutely any camera that will satisfy all your needs.  Even a professional SLR camera has a suitable case.  However, this method has a significant minus - the severity and bulkiness.  Aquaboxes allow you to immerse the camera to a depth of 30 to 100 meters.  For example, Canon underwater cameras are only used in special cases.  For example, the CanonG10 model will do its job perfectly.  In addition to aquaboxes, you can use the so-called disposable cameras for underwater shooting.  Despite the fact that these cameras are recognized as invulnerable, they also require careful care. </p>
