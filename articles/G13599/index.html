Dzhubga on the map of the Krasnodar Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the summer, many vacationers go to the Black Sea - in the Krasnodar Territory.  Rest (Dzhubga - one of the most popular resorts) has recently been organized very well.  Small quiet towns of the Black Sea coast are becoming more and more popular with tourists.  The village of Dzhubga is located 108 km from Tuapse and is attractive mainly for motorists.  The fact is that this is the first settlement by the sea on the highway Krasnodar - Sochi.  Many come here just for the weekend.  Others do not want to overcome the steep Caucasian mountain serpentines, which begin behind the village, and stop there. </p><h2>  The story of Dzhubga </h2><p>  This small city was founded in 1864 as one of the villages of the Shapsug battalion.  Translated from the Adyghe word "dzhubga" means "windy place."  Indeed, a refreshing cool breeze often blows in the village.  The fact is that the Dzhubgi river valley goes far into the mountains and represents a convenient "path" for air masses. </p><p>  There is a more romantic version of the emergence of such a name.  According to legend, in this place once lived a beauty named Dzhubga, drowned in the river because of unhappy love. </p>

    <p>  On weekdays, the village is more or less quiet and calm.  The weekend is usually very noisy.  A huge number of motorists from all over the Krasnodar Territory come to the village to relax after work by the sea on Friday.  Like the entire Black Sea coast, the holiday season in Dzhubga lasts from May to October. </p><h2>  How to get to the village </h2><p>  So, the Black Sea resorts that Russia is famous for became your choice for a vacation.  Krasnodar Territory (Dzhubga, as well as other towns and villages of the coastal zone) are always welcome guests.  Here you will find a warm welcome and a lot of entertainment.  But how to get to the same Dzhubga?  Let's look into this in more detail. </p><p>  By train, tourists usually travel to Tuapse Station.  Next, you can buy a bus ticket to Dzhubga itself.  Having bought a ticket to a boarding house with the same name, you need to go out on the street.  Cooperative.  If desired, a bus can also be reached from Krasnodar.  Motorists usually travel along the same highway. </p><p>  Of course, since Dzhubga (Krasnodar Territory) is a noisy village, traveling by train, most of the country's tourists still travel further towards Sochi.  Mostly motorists still prefer to visit this particular town.  Their reviews of Dzhubga are mostly good.  Of the negative aspects, only not too clean streets of the town and its beach are noted. </p><p>  Also, tourists who have already visited Dzhubgu are not advised to order something in the coastal cafes.  The dishes here are very expensive and also prepared from not very high-quality products.  But, perhaps, in the holiday season of 2015, the administration of the town will nevertheless allocate time and energy to improve the conditions of stay of tourists in this regard.  In the rest, the village of Dzhubga (Krasnodar Territory) - a place for a vacation or a weekend is just perfect. </p>
