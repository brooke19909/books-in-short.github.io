    <p>  Of course, in the first place it is worth asking about the location.  Where to look for the hotel complex Pavlina Beach Hotel 4 *?  Peloponnese, the picturesque resort village of Niforeika - it is here, on a hill, just a few meters from the beach that tourists spend their holidays. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the place is quite convenient, since it is easy to get from here not only to the beach, but also to the most interesting cities from a historical point of view.

By the way, the nearest airport is nearby - it is located in the city of Araxos, at a distance of about 10 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel area itself is very beautiful - there are small two-story buildings here, between which walking paths are laid.  Greenery pleases the eye almost everywhere - there are palm trees, bright flower beds, neat lawns, shrubs, in a word, all in order to enjoy the beauty of nature and silence. </p><h2>  Hotel complex Hotel Pavlina Beach (Peloponnese): description and photos of rooms </h2>

    <p>  As already mentioned, the cozy Pavlina Beach Hotel is located on a hill almost by the sea.  You can go down to the shore using a special staircase.  The beach is covered with sand and pebbles, so it is worth taking special shoes with you.  The entrance to the sea is cleared, and cleaned ashore daily.  By the way, the coast is rocky, and you can hide from the heat in the shadow of the rocks. </p><p>  Of course, tourists can use sun loungers, mattresses and sun umbrellas.  If you wish, you can rent a boat, ride a water bike or take a romantic boat trip. </p><h2>  Additional service </h2><p>  Despite the remoteness from the city, Pavlina Beach Hotel can offer an additional service that will make your vacation much more comfortable.  Here, most tourists travel by rented vehicles, which can be left in the hotel underground parking. </p><p>  You can rent a small safe from the administrator - here your things will be in complete safety, as there is constant video surveillance behind the counter.  By the way, the service costs a little.  You can use free internet in the lobby, but you already have to pay for access to the World Wide Web in your room.  A laundry service, as well as a shop where various souvenirs and household items are available to guests, offer their services on site. </p><p>  By the way, there is also a computer corner, where at the same time you can use some office equipment, as well as send (or receive) a fax. </p><h2>  Hotel Pavlina Beach Hotel 4 * (Greece): entertainment </h2>
