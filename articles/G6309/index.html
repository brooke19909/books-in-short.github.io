This is a northern country where the summer is extremely short.  Russian tourists have long discovered for themselves the charm of Finnish relaxation.  And although we all mostly love to soak up the sand and sunbathe in the sun, sometimes you want a harsh climate.  In addition, hotels in Finland attract with their excellent service, and resorts - with developed infrastructure.  This country is famous for its water recreation complexes.  Spa hotels and water parks are especially popular here.  Naturally, such a large number of water activities is connected with rather cold climatic conditions.  Hotels in Finland's spa are causing frenzied interest not only among Russian tourists, but also guests from other countries.  There are several dozen such complexes in the country, but we will talk about the most popular ones. </p><p>  Spa-hotels in Finland is represented by Naantali <span>Spa Hotel,</span> which is one of the hundred best European institutions of this kind.
