Despite its modest tourist popularity, it is, nevertheless, the oldest cultural and industrial city in the country.  Our article will tell about this city. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Ridder is the third largest city in eastern Kazakhstan after Ust-Kamenogorsk and Semey.  The latest census showed that about 50 thousand people of various nationalities live in it.  Founded in 1934, Ridder was the city where exiles from the central regions of Russia sent.  That is why the lion's share of the population, about 80%, is represented by Russians. </p><p>  In <span>East Kazakhstan, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ridder has industrial status.  In its depths lies a huge reserve of gold, arsenic, silver, tin, iron and sulfur.  The mining of related elements is also ongoing. </p><p>  The climate is sharply continental.  Under such conditions, significant temperature fluctuations occur.  In summer, the maximum figure is fixed at around +37 degrees Celsius.  In winter, the most severe frost was -47 degrees on the same scale. </p><div class="photo" data-original="e-wiki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ridder Entrance" class="if uuid-3005244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005244.jpg"></div><h2>  Natural landscape </h2><p>  The natural landscape of the Kazakh city of Ridder is difficult to conduct full-scale economic activity.  The region has a large number of different rivers, lakes and streams.  All rivers originate in the mountains, so they have a rapid, rapid flow.  The water is muddy, carries a large amount of sand, stones and mountain debris, so independent river crossings are prohibited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the woodland, farming is difficult.  The mountains of the city of Ridder can be seen from the window of each house. </p><p>  Recent studies of landscape and soil have shown the presence of large amounts of radon water, which can be used as an auxiliary therapeutic agent. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The history of the city of Ridder is rich in events, despite the fact that the city itself is small and provincial.  His story begins in 1786.  This year, a royal decree was issued on the need to search for new deposits of metal-bearing ores. </p><p>  Several detachments were sent to search and research new lands.  One was led by officer Philippe Ridder, the grandson of a Swedish military doctor and the son of a manufacturer.  He managed to discover the field, which is the largest to this day.  Found ores containing gold, silver, sulfur, iron.  In the same year, residential and technical premises were quickly built and field development began.  The mines are called the Ridder Mine.  Photos of the city of Ridder of that time, unfortunately, were almost not preserved. </p><p>  The uniqueness of the field has been confirmed by numerous commissions.  The fame of the mines spread far beyond the borders of the country.  In 1850, ore samples were presented at the London World Exhibition.  And in 1879, the ores were included in the collection of the Museum of the Stockholm Royal Technical Institute. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century for several decades, the city changed its name.  From the settlement of Riddersky, he became a village, and then the settlement of Riddersky.  In January 1932, the city again became a Ridder.  By the beginning of World War II, it was renamed Leninogorsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="varandej.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ridder factories" class="if uuid-3005248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005248.jpg"></div><h2>  High Altai Mountains </h2><p>  The Kazakh city of Ridder grew up in the mountains.  These are the historical mountains of the Ore Altai.  Despite the fact that speaking of Altai, we mean mainly the Russian city of Barnaul, Ridder fits perfectly into the big picture.  The name "Ore Altai" was once proposed by the archaeologist V.K. Kotulsky. </p><p>  The highest points of Altai Mountains are located at a maximum height of 2,000 meters.  To the west, the height gradually decreases and turns into low mountains.  The main minerals of Altai are halite, pyrite, gold, silver, iron and sulfur.  Copper-lead-zinc ores prevail, the main mining of which is carried out in the mines of the city of Ridder in Kazakhstan.  Processing and concentration plants are also located there.  Thus, the cost of transportation and staffing of freight trains is reduced. </p><p>  The first expeditions in search of ores began in the 17th century, and was lucky to find minerals Akinfiy Demidov, the great-grandfather of the famous brothers Demidov, who was popularly called the ‚Äúiron king‚Äù of the Urals.  Thanks to the availability of all the necessary tools, ore development began a few days later.  In addition, local residents who were known as craftsmen in ore and blacksmithing were valuable resources.  Demidov did not like foreigners.  The minting of state coins of Catherine the Great was immediately carried out, since the mint was not far from the mining, and the ready-minted coin was delivered to the treasury.  With the death of Demidov, the process temporarily stopped, but quickly found a new owner in the person of the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="foto-planeta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="forest belt Ridder" class="if uuid-3005347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005347.jpg"></div><h2>  Industrial activity and economics </h2><p>  Many ordinary citizens have no idea where the city of Ridder is located in Kazakhstan.  However, people associated with industrial production are well aware of its location.  A wide wave of industrial construction swept through Leninogorsk during the years of Soviet rule.  The first non-ferrous metallurgy plant in Kazakhstan was built here - lead.  At the same time, a zinc plant was under construction.  Along with the main construction, housing estates were erected, mines and mines were developed.  It is worth mentioning the only hydroelectric power station in Kazakhstan.  At that time, she was only the second in the Soviet Union. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.33822139999999" data-lng="83.50625480000008" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/8/4/6/12846.png"></div><p>  The economy of the region is closely related to the development of ore deposits.  Kazakhstan is a state with the richest deposits of natural resources, and the industrial development of the region and the country as a whole is of global importance. </p><p>  About 15 enterprises are represented in the region, whose work is related to non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy.  Instrument-making, machine-building, heat and power plants, as well as secondary enterprises providing services in the service sector. </p><div class="photo" data-original="myotpusk.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ridder mine" class="if uuid-3005238" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005238.jpg"></div><h2>  Regional enterprises </h2><p>  The infrastructure of eastern Kazakhstan consists of large-scale industrial enterprises.  Firstly, Kazzinc LLP.  This is the largest nature user in the country.  He manages six city-forming production complexes: the Ryder concentration plant, a zinc plant, two mines and two concentration plants.  The main production activity is the production of products from copper, lead, zinc and their alloys. </p><p>  Secondly, Ridder is a producer of food products such as sausages, bread and bakery products, as well as beer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kazzinc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tishinsky mine" class="if uuid-3005358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005358.jpg"></div><h2>  City transportation device </h2><p>  Despite the provincial location in Kazakhstan of the city of Ridder, it has close connections with other settlements and regions of the country.  The main transport arteries are the railway and automobile roads.  The total length of roads in the city is 630 kilometers.  And to the regional center - Ust-Kamenogorsk, only 130 kilometers.  You can use the services of intercity transport and taxi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sergeysmirnov.kz" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ridder Mines" class="if uuid-3005365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005365.jpg"></div><h2>  Sporting events </h2><p>  The city of Ridder is a center of winter sports not only in Kazakhstan.  Here are held competitions in skiing, ski jumping, ski orienteering, biathlon.  Half of the athletes from the national team of Kazakhstan in these disciplines are the indigenous inhabitants of the city of Ridder, which they are very proud of. </p><p>  In March 2013, the World Ski Orienteering Championships were held in the eastern region.  Prizes were won by immigrants from Ridder Daria Korneva and Dmitry Adamovich. </p><p>  In 2006, the first car races took place in Ridder.  The event was warmly received by residents, and since 2009, car races have been held several times a year, each time attracting new participants. </p><h2>  Sights of Ridder </h2><p>  The city of Ridder, although small, but old, and it also has something to see the tourist, so to speak, for general development. </p><p>  For example, the local history museum, which was opened in 1960.  In this unique place, evidence is gathered of how hard, with a degree of fanaticism, people worked, laying the foundations of production and building life on completely empty, not yet settled ground.  In addition to samples of ore and metals, mirrored cabinets contain preserved cutlery, crockery, and household containers.  There are many items of production, old-fashioned machine tools and products.  Even the old photos of the city of Ridder (Kazakhstan) have been preserved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="photogoroda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ridder city" class="if uuid-3005355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3005355.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the Palace of Culture, which was built in 1961.  The building has never undergone reconstruction and retained its original appearance.  It was considered the most beautiful in the city.  The Palace of Culture is a prime example of the Soviet architectural style.  Currently, meetings and city events are held there. </p>
