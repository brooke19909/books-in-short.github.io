  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where are the kidneys in humans and their importance in the body</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In man, all organs are closely interconnected with each other, making together a single system, thanks to which the functioning of the whole organism as a single whole mechanism is ensured.  Everyone knows about the important role of the heart and liver, stomach and intestines, lungs and pancreas.  However, the main treatment system of our body, the main organs of which are the kidneys, plays an equally important role. </p><p>  Surely everyone knows <span>where the kidneys are located</span> in humans, but not everyone understands their importance.  The kidneys are the main organ of the genitourinary system, through which about 1,500 liters of blood pass daily.  Thanks to these important internal organs, the <span>blood</span> is <span>cleansed</span> of harmful toxic substances that go out with the urine.  In addition <span>, the kidneys</span> are responsible for maintaining the acid-base balance in the body, as well as for regulating the water-electrolyte balance, equalizing blood pressure due to changes in environmental conditions and weather. </p><p>  Where a person‚Äôs kidneys are located can be shown by every student who has undergone anatomy.  They are located in the lower body, closer to the lumbar, on both sides of the spinal column.  Each kidney is an internal bean-shaped organ whose length is about 12 cm and width is about 6 cm. Despite the fact that the kidneys are quite dense, since they are covered with many vascular tubules (nephrons), they are quite light and weigh less together. than a heart.  In each of the kidneys there are more than 1 million nephrons that converge into a malpighian tangle, lowered into a special bowl-shaped Bowman-Shumlyansky capsule.  This ball of capillaries is enclosed in a dense renal corpuscle, which passes into a thin loop connected to the <span>renal pelvis,</span> where the ureter originates.  Thus, the places where a person‚Äôs kidneys are protected from above by the ribs, and by the lateral abdominal muscles in front and behind, protecting this organ from external influences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Children need to know where the kidneys are located in humans, as this can play an important role in identifying various diseases in the early stages of development.  Unfortunately, today in the world there are about 500 million people who suffer from kidney failure.  In our country, this indicator is also growing at a high speed, which indicates the threat of the development <span>of kidney diseases</span> into the category of world problems.  The main problem is the formation <span>of kidney stones,</span> which may even require surgery in the future.  For a long time, it was believed that the quality of water and its hardness played a leading role in the formation of kidney stones, but recent studies in this area have proven that a person‚Äôs genetic predisposition plays a leading role in impaired kidney function.  Thanks to modern surgery, it is possible to carry out operations to treat kidney stone disease.  There is both a contact and non-contact method of exposure, both successfully used to treat this disease. </p><p>  Thus, the place where the kidneys are located in humans, like the kidneys themselves, are quite vulnerable, since they take on all the pollution and toxins.  That is why a lot of attention in this matter should be given to proper nutrition, since on the one hand environmentally friendly and wholesome foods are well absorbed by our body, and on the other they cleanse our organs of toxins and toxins.  And periodic kidney cleaning is vital for each of us. </p><p>  In those places where the kidneys are located in humans, there are other equally important organs that also contribute to the purification of blood.  That is why you should be careful about your body. </p>
