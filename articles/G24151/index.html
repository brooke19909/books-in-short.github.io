At the same time, they are in no hurry to completely withdraw from “state affairs”, using this lever to lobby their own interests.  Power and business in Russia have been inextricably linked for more than ten years.  A vivid confirmation of this is the Russian businessman Mamut Alexander Leonidovich, who could easily enter the corridors of the Kremlin of the Yeltsin era.  He was called the gray cardinal of domestic business.  Today he is considered the largest philanthropist, despite the fact that his personality is shrouded in veils of secrets, secrets and intrigues. </p>

    <p>  In 2001, he presented a project to modernize the banking system to Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs, a few years later he organized the merger of the Atticus Publishing company with the ABC print house.  As a result, a structure with printing equipment appeared - this allowed us to engage in publishing business more efficiently.  He now heads the company Rambler &amp; Go. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  It should be noted that Mamut Alexander Leonidovich, whose personal life is remarkable in that he took in his wife a woman (Nadezhda Lyamina), who was married to the grandson of the Soviet Secretary General, was not a womanizer in his youth.  He studied at school with his first wife.  He repulsed hope for Lyamin from his grandson Brezhnev himself and soon married her.  However, a tragedy soon occurred: Alexander’s wife died of pneumonia.  She left behind her three children (two of them adoptive children), whom he is currently raising.  After some time, he became interested in the young model <span>Alena Akhmadulina,</span> whom the businessman simply spoiled with luxurious gifts: what is the price of a pompous boutique in the center of the metropolis.  These are the wide gestures Alexander Mamut is ready to go for love.  "The second wife of a famous businessman!"  - they said surrounded by the oligarch, referring to Alena Akhmadulin.  However, later the businessman’s feelings for the girl cooled, and he lost all interest in her.  Here he is, Mamut Alexander Leonidovich.  He officially has no wife today. </p><h2>  How rich is the oligarch </h2><p>  According to reputable print media, including the magazine Finance, its financial well-being is growing steadily.  Following the results of the year before last, he steadily occupied the fortieth position in the list of the richest entrepreneurs in Russia.  Then experts estimated that he owns 2.1 billion dollars. </p>
