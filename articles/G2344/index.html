    <p>  The original model, which costs a little more than 1900 rubles, immediately became popular.  At the same time, customers get a full-fledged device that has telephone features.  By its technical characteristics, the model, of course, is inferior to expensive analogues, but the equipment, design and construction still made Beeline tablets so popular.  Reviews about the very first model converged on one thing: it is made efficiently and equipped with unique characteristics. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The plastic device attracts attention <span>with its appearance.</span>  The aluminum back is top and bottom complemented by plastic inserts.  Manufacturers have chosen high-quality materials that have a pleasant to the touch surface and do not get dirty.  There is a speaker on the case, which for such a budget model is quite powerful and sonorous.  The first Beeline Tab was built on the Android 4.4 operating system, which provided sufficient performance.  This Beeline tablet (for 1990) received good reviews because of its low cost, although it was noted that its work was rather slow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tablet for 1990 reviews" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14505/819302.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><p>  The Beeline Tab is based on a fairly powerful <span>MediaTek MT8312 processor,</span> but the RAM for such a device is still not enough.  Standard cameras of 2 megapixels and 0.3 megapixels complement this model, however, you still should not count on high-quality images due to a poor matrix.  Data can be stored on 4 GB of internal memory, and it can be expanded if necessary. </p><h2>  Equipment of the first "Beeline Tab" </h2><p>  The first Beeline Tab tablet received a lot of reviews.  A Bluetooth 3.0 module was used as equipment; Internet access is possible through a Wi-Fi module or a 3G network.  The SIM card of the model is standard, so there will be no problems with trimming it.  The 7-inch device display has a resolution of 1024 x 600 px and supports multi-touch.  Battery powered.  In reviews, it is often noted that this model is not perfect. </p><h2>  What are the differences? </h2><p>  The Beeline Tab tablet is very popular among buyers, reviews of which note the difference between both models.  Firstly, the device has become even more compact and equipped with a 7-inch display.  <span>The touch screen</span> has a high resolution of 600 x 1024 pixels.  The model has a TN + Film matrix, but the color solutions are faded, especially when compared with similar models from other brands.  Users note that the display in such a budget device is quite good, since the touch screen responds quite clearly and accurately to touch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Among the disadvantages of the display, users note poor visibility of the small print, as well as the density of the screen, which does not allow you to comfortably search for the necessary information on the Web.  On the other hand, the Beeline tablet for 1990, reviews of which are mostly good, despite the shortcomings, is easy to set up on the mobile version, where the font is legible. </p><h2>  How is the Beeline Tab tablet equipped? </h2><p>  The reviews suggest that the central processor of the updated model is a dual-core MediaTek chip, which is complemented by 512 MB of RAM and a 4 GB drive.  If necessary, you can always replenish the amount of memory using a microSD card.  As for comfortable work, users note: the fast Android 4.4 KitKat OS and good software optimization allow web surfing at a fairly high level.  A review of the Beeline Tab Internet tablet suggests that the device still does not cope with complex sites.  Especially if you open multiple tabs at the same time. </p><h2>  Dimensions and appearance </h2>

Sufficient thickness gives the model weight, and the gadget lies well in the palm of your hand.  Beeline Tab 2 is a budget solution, however, the device cannot boast of a superdisplay or a productive processor.  On the other hand, the gadget works stably and efficiently, allowing you to watch videos, read books, surf the Internet, listen to music.  If you select the Beeline tariff, a tablet, reviews about which are very common, the total cost of the device will be no more than 3000 rubles. </p><p>  Manufacturers position the model as a <span>budget tablet</span> that will appeal to undemanding users or children who like to play games.  The display can operate in an economical backlight mode, which allows rational use of energy consumption.  There is a mysterious mode "Economic backlight".  Experts note that this incomprehensible mode is not needed at all for this tablet model. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  In a standard set, the tablet is supplemented with a charger, connecting cable, user manual and warranty card.  At the same time, the device comes without a wired headset, as well as without a memory card.  Beeline tablets (reviews about them are common) are ideal for a novice user, because they have everything you need. </p><p>  A tablet feature is an adapter for output current, as the battery may not last for a couple of days of use.  The design solution attracts attention with its appearance, in which manufacturability is clearly visible.  The color scheme of the tablets is different - from black to dark gray. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Beeline tablets (user reviews talk about many important points) have a non-separable case where a SIM card is inserted into the upper slot, and there is no latch for it.  The memory card can be inserted into the open slot on top, and it is better to put it right away to avoid clogging the slot.  The power button, volume control are located on the right, they protrude slightly above the body, so it‚Äôs convenient to control them. </p>

    <p>  The power button and the volume rocker are located on the right side.  They perform just right, the move is clear, the gap between the buttons is sufficient.  In the opinion of some users, the buttons are taut, but this is subjective.  In any case, it‚Äôs better than the other way around - there is less chance of accidental clicks. </p><h2>  Features Features </h2><p>  A multimedia speaker is what the Beeline tablet certainly cannot boast of in 1990. Many users agree that the volume is enough, but if the gadget is on the table, the speaker is not audible.  The microphone is located in the lower right corner, which is convenient.  The LED event indicator is one of the highlights of the model. </p><p>  The main camera has a size of 2 megapixels and does not have autofocus, and an honest VGA is used as the <span>front camera</span> .  Of the shortcomings, cold shades of pictures, that is, unsaturated color combinations, can be noted.  Autofocus, of course, is needed, because macro photography is not very high quality.  You can always choose the best Internet tariff for the Beeline tablet.  Reviews often mention that the device works well with any traffic.  This is its undeniable advantage. </p><h2>  "Beeline M2": reviews, descriptions, specifications and firmware of the tablet </h2><p>  Today, tablets are functional and modern gadgets that allow you to solve several problems at once.  Beeline M2 is the first operator-branded tablet in the world.  The model is based on the ZTE V9 platform and is quite expensive - almost 13,000 rubles.  True, it is believed that the device is inexpensive, if you compare its equipment: </p><ul><li>  Android 2.1 (i.e., without Flash 10.1 support); </li><li>  touch screen - 7.2 inches with a resistive screen; </li><li>  camera - 3.2 megapixels; </li><li>  modules - Wi-Fi, GPS; </li><li>  connector - 3.2 mm. </li></ul>

    <p>  The only negative is that the Beeline M2 tablet does not have conversational dynamics.  Reviews say that this is a significant drawback.  The tablet is also tied to the operator, but it can always be unlocked to use on other networks. </p><p>  Externally, the tablet looks traditionally, since the very features of modern gadgets dictate the basic requirements for both design and ergonomics and structural details.  The case is completely made of plastic, there are no metal or glass inserts.  In the reviews, it is noted that the model is well assembled, does not loft and does not creak if you click on it.  Using plastic provides a light weight device, which is very convenient if you plan to take it on the road. </p><h2>  Compact and modern </h2><p>  The Beeline M2 tablet is a good handheld computer that attracts attention with its small weight and dimensions, excellent balance of the case, and small thickness, which affects the compactness and ergonomics of the model.  A removable battery of sufficient capacity, it is possible to add memory cards to increase the usable space on the tablet.  Among the disadvantages of the display, users note the location and shape of the touch buttons located on the front panel immediately below the screen.  The touchscreen also leaves much to be desired: it does not work very stably, and the viewing angles of the screen and the brightness are not at the best level. </p><p>  The Android-tablet is equipped with a simple camera without a 3.2 megapixel flash with autofocus, while the shooting quality is average.  It‚Äôs easy to set up the camera - it‚Äôs, in general, standard.  You can shoot <span>video resolution</span> up to CIF. </p>

    <p>  Wi-Fi module works smoothly, there is also support for 3G Internet.  In addition, you can make calls using the Beeline tablet.  True, because of one speaker, the interlocutor‚Äôs speech will be heard by everyone around him, so it‚Äôs better to communicate through the headset.  Bluetooth supports stereo profile, that is, you can choose the appropriate headset.  Of the positive aspects, users note a good customization, which was carried out by the company.  This is noticeable in the proprietary keyboard, widgets and even applications.  The lock screen has undergone changes, the gadget is also supplemented with links to popular services of the country.  The gadget involves the use of graphics and additional services in the form of jokes or horoscopes. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Beeline tablets - Tab and M - are interesting, if only because they were created as an experiment in branding a new type of device.  Despite the standard design and equipment, the models are good in work and have all the necessary technical characteristics sufficient for the average user.  In combination with an affordable price, the devices are a profitable solution.  Of the weaknesses of the models, the middle screen and not the latest operating system can be noted, and the remaining characteristics are enough to qualify for success among devices of their class. </p>
