Or maybe you were sent on a business trip, where after difficult negotiations you want to relax. </p><p>  In any case, we advise you to spend time basking in the sun of Vietnam and letting him paint a chocolate tan on his skin to the envy of acquaintances and friends. </p>

    <p>  And the third, but not least, point is the choice of a hotel.  Believe me, it is from him that 50% depends on whether your trip will be happy and memorable.  Well, let's stop at the Ocean Stars Resort and talk about it in more detail. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is the owner of an exotic sandy beach located on the shores of the South China Sea.  It is in the shade thanks to a tropical garden surrounded by evergreen coconut trees.  It is an ideal place to relax on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Ocean Stars Resort you will not see coral beauties, as, for example, in Egypt, and you will not be able to swim with a mask, you will not even be able to feel like an athlete and swim a rabbit.  Big waves are always there.  Well, maybe sometimes they are too big. </p><p>  In order to swim in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Phan Thiet (you will definitely like the weather here), it is worth making a lot of effort.  Stronger women tie knots in swimsuits.  Coming out of the sea, you feel like a winner, feel a charge of vivacity and happy go to relax on your deck chair, already working out a new game plan or already fighting the sea.  As for surfers, for them there is simply expanse, because on the waves they feel like seagulls with huge wings. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The proximity of the Ocean Stars Resort to the airport: only 206 km from the city of Ho Chi Minh City and 12 km from the city of Phan Thiet. </p>
