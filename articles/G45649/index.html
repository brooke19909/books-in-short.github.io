    <p>  Regarding excursions: according to the reviews of many tourists, they are quite expensive.  However, there is a way out!  Our recommendation to tourists on the organization of a real excursion program and, accordingly, a reasonable waste of money is to rent a car for this purpose.  Then the trip of the whole family will cost only $ 150.  Otherwise, each family member will pay $ 100 for a two-day stay in Pamukkale. </p><h2>  Four-star holiday option in Side (same operator) </h2><p>  If you still want to save a few dollars on your spa vacation, preferring at its decent level to slightly reduce the range of services offered as part of all inclusive services, then a four-star hotel of the same operator is quite suitable for you.  Our unbiased review of TT Hotels Pegasos World 4 * <span>(Turkey, Side)</span> testifies to the zealous support by the staff of the "reputation of the company."  A well-groomed territory with an oriental garden and figured pools through which intricate bridges are thrown, fly-away slides were built, among which there are also intended for the smallest. </p><p>  The paths of the alleys are paved, clean (they are washed daily).  The beach is gorgeous and equipped with equipment: on its territory there are not only sunbeds and umbrellas, but also facilities for changing clothes, hand and foot wash basins and showers.  The food is very decent.  Even gourmets of spa holidays say that this level is at ‚Äú4+‚Äù. </p><h2>  Price reduction without loss of comfort </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, as well as due to low competitive prices for vacations (one holidaymaker pays less than 700 dollars for 7 nights), tours at TT Hotels Pegasos World 4 (Turkey, Side) fly like hot cakes.  Therefore, we recommend buying them ahead of time. </p>
