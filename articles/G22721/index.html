But they gave their lives so that others can do it.  The heart of the Hero of Russia Dmitry Evgenievich Gorshkov stopped in the morning of September 1999, but he is still alive, because his memory is alive in his native Tula.  And not only... </p><h2>  The beginning of the biography </h2><p>  Dmitry Gorshkov was born in 1971, February 21.  A native of Tula, the boy lost his father early.  From 3 years old he was raised by one mother, Zoya Ivanovna.  Since childhood, the boy used to do everything with his own hands.  Zoya Ivanovna, for example, still uses a table assembled by her own son. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.izh.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorshkov Dmiotriy, photo" class="if uuid-3004387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/3004387.jpg"></div><p>  Short, with mischievous eyes, Dmitry did not let his mother down in anything: he studied diligently, was fond of radio business, and helped with the housework. </p><p>  O. V. Sergeeva, the class teacher, after so many years even remembers the desk at which her student was sitting, because it is impossible to forget the one who knew how to do everything.  Dmitry was honest, never cunning and never hid behind the backs of his comrades. </p><p>  At the end of 8th grade, in 1986, Gorshkov continued his studies at the Electromechanical College.  In 1990, he was drafted into the ranks of the SA.  He served in Germany, then in the Urals.  He returned to his homeland to work in his specialty at one of the transport enterprises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in 1993, Dmitry Gorshkov decided to drastically change his biography, having entered the service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dmitry Gorshkov, Hero of Russia" class="if uuid-3004431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/3004431.jpg"></div><h2>  Communications engineer </h2><p>  He began with an internship at the TPS of the special police of the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Tula Region.  In February 1994, he was transferred to the post of policeman, then - a policeman-fighter of an operational platoon.  In February 1996, Dmitry Gorshkov was appointed an engineer, and a little later - a senior communications engineer and special equipment OMON. </p><p>  In the same year he took part in the First Chechen War, and in June-July 1999 he performed a combat mission in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic.  In extreme situations, he acted skillfully, calmly, competently.  The September trip to Dagestan as part of the OMON special police department of the Tula region was far from the first, but was the last in the biography of Dmitry Gorshkov. </p><h2>  Feat </h2><p>  On the morning of September 10, riot police were alerted and sent to the village of Chabanmakhi, occupied by Wahhabis.  His assault group number 5 was faced with the task of capturing a local mosque.  The militants acted cunningly.  They lurked and allowed the federal troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to enter the village, and only then began shelling.  The mosque was turned into a real fiery fortress.  Dmitry Gorshkov was almost immediately injured.  A sniper bullet hit a bulletproof vest and hit the stomach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="filpersona.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://filpersona.ru/picture.php/3773/category/244"><img itemprop="image" alt="artist A. Drobyshev" class="if uuid-3004429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/3004429.jpg"></div><p>  A friend rushed to him, who was injured in the leg.  Gorshkov saw a grenade launcher bleeding, and the senior lieutenant (Dmitry served in this rank) decided to bring fire on himself and allow two fighters to move to a safe place.  Covering his comrades, pulling them out of the fire zone, Gorshkov was mortally wounded by a sniper bullet. </p><p>  After a while, Alexander Vybornov managed to pull his friend out from under the shelling, but he died from his wounds.  It is curious that among the documents found in the pocket was a certificate from which it follows that Dmitry donated blood for sick children.  On December 30, 1999, for the salvation of their comrades, Gorshkov was presented with the highest military award - the Gold Star medals (posthumous). </p><div class="photo" data-original="ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gorshkov Dmitry Evgenievich, memory" class="if uuid-3004397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/3004397.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  On the evening of the same day (September 10), the news of the death of her husband and son was received by Elena, wife, and Zoya Ivanovna, mother of the senior lieutenant.  Mother lost consciousness from the tragic news. </p><p>  Dmitry Evgenievich Gorshkov was buried on the Walk of Fame in the city cemetery.  Tula OMON honors the memory of his comrade by installing a memorial plate in the village of Kosaya Gora.  The name of the Hero of Russia was given to the school where Gorshkov once studied.  Today it is called the Humanities and Mathematics Lyceum. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="f9EabDFJ_DA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9EabDFJ_DA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/7/8/1/12781.jpg"></div><p>  Every year on September 10, memory lessons are held at the school, in which riot policemen, Gorshkov‚Äôs family and relatives take part.  His son Eugene is growing up, who is rightfully proud of his father.  A little higher is a video prepared by students of the school, bit by bit collecting information about their heroic countryman. </p><p>  In April, Russian Post issued stamps in honor of the heroes who died today.  One of them is dedicated to Dmitry Gorshkov, an ordinary guy from the Russian hinterland with an open, friendly face.  So he will remain in the memory of his generation. </p>
