Most users were interested in the Sense proprietary shell.  Its interface was the most convenient in comparison with other devices.  But time goes on, and developers are constantly improving Android, so HTC smartphones have gradually lost their uniqueness.  Demand for them began to decline.  The fact is that the manufacturer kept a rather high cost when competitors regularly produced functional devices with decent characteristics and, most importantly, with an affordable price. </p><p>  In the spring of 2017, HTC introduced a new flagship.  Many believe that the manufacturer using this model wants to regain its former glory.  Of course, time will tell what will happen next, and now the novelty has definitely interested advanced users.  And it is worth noting that the gadget can really surprise.  When choosing equipment for the device, the manufacturer did not stint.  What is really worth attention in the HTC U11? </p><ul><li>  <em>Price.</em>  After studying the characteristics, the cost of 45-50 thousand rubles looks quite adequate. </li><li>  <em>Design.</em>  The company abandoned the usual style, preferring an experimental appearance. </li><li>  <em>Camera.</em>  Excellent optics with top performance. </li><li>  <em>Performance.</em>  Heavy duty processor in conjunction with a large amount of RAM. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Innovative gadget look </h2><p>  The HTC U11 review needs to start with the design.  The company has radically changed its style.  This model is experimental with a completely new design direction.  The flagship has a glass case iridescent with different colors.  This effect was achieved due to the reflective mirror surface. </p><p>  Have buyers been surprised?  Definitely yes.  But whether this decision was successful, eloquently described in the reviews.  All owners claim that the beauty of the case can be enjoyed until it is in the hands.  In just a few minutes, the mirror surface of the glass becomes completely blurred.  It was not so easy to wipe fingerprints and greasy stains, which is why it is better to carry the HTC U11 smartphone in a case.  More easily soiled options are blue and black.  In addition to these colors, the manufacturer also introduced copies with a white, blue and red body.  As for the latter, he really liked the weak half of humanity.  It looks fresh, bright and original. </p><p>  The shape of the phone is elongated.  With a width of 75 mm, its height reaches almost 154 mm.  Unfortunately, the developers did not abandon the screen frames, which are quite thick.  According to many users, they are the "fat" minus.  Bearing in mind that the screen has a width of only 68 mm, the thickness of the frames was 3.5 mm.  The manufacturer tried to do everything possible in order to avoid similarities with other flagships. </p><p>  Using a smartphone was not very convenient.  Because of the slippery body, you only have to operate with two hands.  If you take a chance, then the probability of dropping the device increases significantly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is one more point worth paying attention to.  The case of the device is moisture resistant.  Here, the manufacturer implemented the IP67 standard.  What does this mean?  Theoretically, a smartphone can be immersed in water to a depth of one meter for no more than 30 minutes.  He is not afraid of dust.  Therefore, if you suddenly find yourself in the sand, then you should not worry that small particles penetrate inside. </p>

    <h2>  Display Features </h2><p>  What screen is installed on HTC U11?  The display features are uniquely impressive.  With a diagonal of 5.5 ∫, the resolution is WQHD (2560 √ó 1440 pixels).  Such indicators are worthy of a flagship.  The display is based on a Super LCD matrix.  The resolution is amazing.  The pixel density is 534 ppi.  The picture is displayed clearly and in detail.  Even armed with a magnifying glass, it is impossible to consider the "squares". </p><p>  As protection, tempered glass <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 5 (3D) was used.  It is worth noting that the manufacturer completely abandoned the use of plastic gaskets.  It is not known exactly what it is intended for.  But users believe that it is she who is able to soften the force of the impact during the fall.  The effectiveness of such a solution is doubtful, so the lack of such a gasket did not bother the owners of this model.  Glass comes right up to the metal rim, which looks amazing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The supply of brightness is enough for comfortable work even in direct sunlight.  The colors on the screen are displayed realistically.  The viewing angles are chic, with a strong slope, the changes are minimal. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  On HTC U11, camera specs are worthy of respect.  The main one is based on a 12-megapixel matrix.  The sensor is UltraPixel 3. There is optical stabilization and flash.  The camera focuses well thanks to the UltraSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãAutofocus system.  There is no doubt in its effectiveness.  Everything happens accurately and in seconds.  Surprisingly, even poor lighting is not a hindrance to focus. </p><p>  In good conditions, the pictures are obtained in high quality: the detail is excellent, the exposure level is correct.  Sharpness, unlike the Samsung flagships, is optimally selected.  Also there is no oversaturation of colors and distortion at the edges.  Video recording is carried out in 4K quality.  In tinctures, you can lower the resolution.  In video mode, acoustic focus is used. </p><p>  The front camera also did not disappoint the owners.  It is based on a 16 megapixel module.  There are no comments on the quality of the photos.  Pictures are excellent in any light.  The only thing that could be improved was to increase a bit of sharpness.  Shooting movies with a resolution of 1080p. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  According to the performance criterion, HTC U11 has top-end specifications.  It runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 powerful 8-core chipset. The process technology is 10 nm.  The set of commands is carried out according to the architecture of ARMv8-A.  This processor in one second will perform a huge number of actions, which confirms the clock frequency of 2450 MHz.  The system is 64-bit, capable of processing 8 bytes per cycle. </p><p>  What is the amount of "RAM" set by developers to such a powerful processor?  In total, there are two versions on sale.  The first has 4 GB.  This modification has built-in storage of 64 GB.  This version is conditionally called "younger".  The ‚Äúolder‚Äù modification will provide users with 6 GB of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù.  And how much internal memory is in this version of HTC U11?  128Gb!  This amount will be enough for even the most demanding users. </p><p>  In addition, the developers installed a hybrid tray.  Instead of a single SIM card, you can insert a memory card into it, which increases the amount of storage up to 256 GB. </p><p>  There are no comments on the speed of the gadget.  We can safely say that he is able to "fly" even in the most difficult games. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Continuing to describe the characteristics of HTC U11, you need to talk about the operating system.  Without it, a gadget is just a "brick."  The device is based on the current version of Android.  We are talking about the "seven" (Nougat).  Of course, the proprietary Sense UI shell is installed on top of the system. </p><p>  Those buyers who constantly use the phones of this brand will not notice any changes.  The design is simple, the settings are flexible.  All owners liked this. </p><p>  Separately, the reviews highlighted the presence of three assistants: Amazon Alexa, HTC Companion and Google Assistant.  A special Boost + application is also preinstalled, which allows you to optimize the system and clear the memory.  Under Armor service appealed to those who like to actively spend time doing fitness. </p>

    <h2>  Edge sense </h2><p>  The review of HTC U11 will be incomplete, if not to talk about one proprietary "chip".  It's about Edge Sense.  The side faces of the phone are equipped with special sensors that respond to clicks.  For example, in order to activate the flashlight, you need to press the edges once.  You can turn it off by repeating this step.  Configuring this feature is very easy.  The manufacturer provided for the adjustment of the degree of pressure, the installation of any applications and functions.  Definitely, users liked this solution. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  HTC U11 (128Gb / 64Gb), unfortunately, was not pleased with the battery life.  The model has a 3000 mAh battery.  In principle, the battery life is enough for 20 hours of operation of the gadget.  It is worth highlighting the possibility of fast charging, using which you can charge the phone to 100% in just 1.5 hours. </p>
