    <p>  Sinks are in high demand due to significant water savings, compact size, competent equipment, which opens up great opportunities for the operation of equipment.  As a rule, this <span>equipment is additionally</span> equipped with wheels and a convenient handle, so the process of washing something becomes easier.  A modern high-pressure washer for a machine or for domestic purposes can be adjusted according to the degree of pressure and switched depending on the detergents used. </p><h2>  How does it work? </h2><p>  Any washing is equipment in which the pump is installed.  It is he who increases the <span>pressure of water</span> that enters out.  Heading through the hose, water enters the gun and is sprayed with a certain pressure.  Moreover, the jet can be adjusted independently depending on the area that needs to be cleaned. </p><p>  All sinks are electric, gasoline or diesel.  The former are convenient and compact, but they work exclusively from the network, and they can be single-phase or two-phase - more powerful and mobile.  Gasoline models are also mobile, they can be used for any purpose - both for washing a car, and for work on a personal plot, and no wires under your feet will be confused. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which one to choose? </h2>

    <p>  The rating of high pressure washers allows you to evaluate the features of many models, but still you should pay attention to their technical characteristics.  So, to perform small-volume work, compact electric sinks, which do not take up much space, are sufficient for light weight and ease of operation.  For more serious work, you need a powerful, albeit massive device.  Thanks to the equipment with wheels, they are easy to move around the site.  The big resource of work is distinguished by stationary sinks. </p><p>  An important role is played by the nozzle for high pressure washing.  In the standard version, there is a conventional nozzle with a gun, which can regulate the flow of water by changing the diameter of the outlet.  If you plan to wash floors and facades, you will need a nozzle without a spray.  When cleaning buildings from brick, concrete, stone, you will need a sandblasting nozzle, which can easily cope with old paint and rust. </p><p>  A special nozzle for high-pressure washing is used to clean pipes, for example, with a clogged sewer or drainage system.  Thanks to the jet jets that strike back at a certain angle, the nozzle pushes itself into the pipes, cleaning them.  Brush heads are needed for washing cars and their components. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The heart of the pressure washer is a pump, which can be made of plastic or metal.  The overall life of the equipment depends on the strength of the material: plastic and semi-metal products are able to last about four years when used for a maximum of one hour per day.  A metal pump allows you to work much more - about four hours a day. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  Modern models of high pressure washers delight with numerous variations and special technical characteristics.  Before choosing a specific equipment, you should consider a number of points: </p><ol><li>  Decide what material the pump pump is made of, since this element wears out the fastest.  The most unreliable option is plastic, which wears out over time, aluminum products oxidize, and from the composite they are too fragile.  The material of the pistons also plays a role: it is better if they are made of cermet. </li><li>  Decide on the pressure.  For domestic use, models with a maximum pressure of 13-14 MPa are suitable. </li><li>  Choose the power consumption - it can be taken with a margin.  The less power, the more often you will have to take breaks in work. </li><li>  If the sink shuts off automatically upon termination of operation, it will be more durable and reliable, and will also save energy. </li><li>  The presence of a water purification filter allows you to protect equipment from the ingress of various particles. </li><li>  If you choose a professional car wash, pay attention to the possibility of engine cooling.  This affects the increase in the service life of the power unit. </li></ol><p>  If you plan to work with equipment away from the network, consider the length of the hose: it should be enough to work with maximum comfort.  In addition, pay attention to the additional equipment in the form of nozzles: very often they allow you to expand the range of ongoing work, as well as reduce energy costs. </p>
