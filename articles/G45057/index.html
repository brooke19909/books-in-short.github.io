Rest here is always colorful, rich, memorable with vivid impressions.  But there are places in Thailand where life flows calmly and measuredly, where there is no crowding, where tourists get absolute relaxation.  This is an inexpensive but unusually comfortable 4-star Hotel Amora Beach Resort located on Phuket Island.  This piece of land in the <span>Andaman Sea</span> has a number of features. </p><p>  Firstly, Phuket is the largest island of the country by area, secondly, it lies quite close to the mainland, and thirdly, it is easier to get to it by road than by boats, since the island and the continent are connected by three modern bridges.  In addition to convenient transportation, Phuket is famous for its protected mangrove forests, which cover about 60% of its area.  They, plus the sea around, create a special climate here, slightly different from that which dominates the mainland. </p><p>  The relief and geographical characteristics of the island are ‚Äúguilty‚Äù of the fact that almost all of its hotels are built on the west coast.  Among them there are modest and quiet, with low prices and with minimal service, there are very noisy, where active life boils round the clock, there are luxurious, respectable and very expensive, but with impeccable service.  But can any <span>Phuket hotel</span> combine all the advantages <span>?</span>  Amora Beach Resort is, perhaps, exactly what you need.  Here the beauty of nature reigns, which any man-made gardens are inferior to, there is a very friendly staff and excellent service, there is exhaustive comfort, so necessary for a good rest.  Here are just noisy, enchantingly vivid entertainment in this hotel.  After them you need to go to a nearby city, which is also easily solved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amora Beach Resort Phuket" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435045.jpg" width="526"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  The four-star Amora Beach Resort (Phuket), as follows from the explanation in brackets, is located on the island of Phuket.  Like most hotels in this province of Thailand, it is built on the west coast of the island, approximately in the central part of the coast and approximately in the middle between the cities of Patong and Phuket, which are 25 and 27 km respectively.  The nearest and only airport of the island is located 32 km southwest of the provincial capital and 19 km from the hotel.  From Russia, getting here on vacation is possible only by plane.  Organized tourists are delivered to their hotels by transfers of travel agencies.  Unorganized (booked rooms bypassing the travel agency) get to the place on their own in tuk-tuk or in a taxi. </p><p>  Amora Beach Resort is a little apart from its fellow tourist business.  Next to it there is only one of them - the Sunwing Hotel, whose animation programs can be visited.  No discos, no nightclubs, or other outdoor activities near the considered Amora Beach Resort.  To have fun, guests should go to Phuket or Patong.  Taxi and tuk-tuk stops are located right at the hotel, the cost of the trip is from 100 baht.  If you walk along the road for about 1,500 meters, there will be a small center of civilization with a large supermarket, McDonald's, a couple of shops, a pizzeria, and a pharmacy.  Here in the evenings (from 4 p.m.), a fairly large local market opens twice a week, where you can buy exotic fruits and food. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Amora Beach Resort (Phuket) is a rather large hotel consisting of 14 three-story buildings.  Its entire territory is delightfully beautiful.  Here you really feel that you have fallen into the tropics - everywhere lush greenery, dozens of species of palm trees and other trees, solemnly hanging creepers, lots of never-withering flowers.  In this kingdom of flora, brisk and bright representatives of the fauna live, such as tropical lizards (small), outlandish birds, lovely butterflies.  Some of them not only pleasantly complement the overall impression of the hotel‚Äôs landscape design, but also make visits to the rooms. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage and the main highlight of the territory are two large pools.  Some bodies seem to be standing at the very edge of the water.  There are other reservoirs on the territory in the form of narrow rivers, through which small bridges are thrown. </p><p>  The reception of the Amora Beach Resort 4 * hotel is located in the main building in a spacious and elegant lobby.  There are televisions and comfortable armchairs in which guests can relax comfortably.  Wi-Fi in the lobby works well, and it‚Äôs free.  At the reception you can use the safe, exchange currency, buy a tour, order the service ‚Äúroom service‚Äù, which consists in the delivery of breakfast, wake-up, cleaning out of schedule (if necessary).  There is also a small shop selling clothes, accessories for a beach holiday, exclusive Thai cosmetics, personal care products and a group of other goods.  The main building is equipped and well equipped with 3 conference rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amora Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435043.jpg" width="529"></div>

Please note - upon arrival here they take a deposit of $ 100, which is returned on the day of departure, but if tourists used any paid services (minibar, telephone, etc.) during their vacation, the corresponding amount is charged. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Amora Beach Resort (Phuket) is able to offer guests 255 rooms.  All of them, including those located on the first floors, have a spacious balcony.  A great advantage of the hotel's layout is the very close location of many buildings to the pools, which are more like small lakes than man-made ponds.  Tourists in the reviews note that the windows offer a beautiful view of the expanse of water, and leaving the room, you can immediately get into the recreation area.  At the same time, crowds of people there almost never happen. </p><p>  All rooms have a similar design in Thai style.  Their characteristic features are space, light colors, large panoramic windows, comfortable furniture, cleanliness. </p><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  <em>Standard garden view</em> up to 28 squares.  From the name it‚Äôs clear that their windows overlook the hotel‚Äôs garden.  Equipment - a set of furniture, including comfortable chairs and a small table, air conditioning, a modern flat-screen TV (there are channels in Russian), a refrigerator in which there is a mini-bar compartment (so that there are no problems upon departure, you can ask the workers to remove everything from there on the day of check-in drinks and be sure to note this at the reception), an electric kettle with tea / coffee sets, a hairdryer, a safe (free), telephone.  The hygiene rooms at this hotel are also spacious.  For maximum convenience, guests are required to provide bathrobes, slippers, and hygiene kits.  Hygiene rooms are equipped with a shower or bath, washbasin and toilet, and in some rooms the bathrooms are separate. </p><p>  <em>Superior pool view</em> with <em>pool</em> views and an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 28 squares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket in August" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435042.jpg" width="535"></div>

The hotel has two tastefully decorated restaurants.  One of them serves a daily buffet breakfast.  On their quality, opinions differ.  Some believe that the food, in principle, is not bad and quite varied, while others report that the food in the hotel does not correspond to the 4 * category.  One thing can be said about this: everyone has different tastes. </p><p>  Muesli or cereal, milk, yoghurts, preserves (jams), rice, toasts, egg dishes, pastries, and coffee, juices, and tea are always served for breakfast. </p><p>  For dinner, you can choose from international or Thai dishes, as well as fish and seafood. </p><p>  In addition to restaurants, the hotel has two bars - in the lobby and by the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Standard garden view" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435046.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  Amora Beach Resort 4 * is aimed at tourists who prefer a relaxing holiday, so they do not have animators on staff and do not conduct absolutely any shows.  All you can do at the hotel is relax by the pool.  There are two of them, as mentioned above.  One of them is quite deep, the second is smaller, but larger in size and with a jacuzzi.  Sun loungers in the recreation area are always enough, so it makes no sense to occupy them from the early morning.  Those who wish can be given Thai or classical massage at a hotel (for a fee), but nobody imposes this service on anyone.  As some kind of entertainment, billiard tables are installed in the lobby of the hotel, there is a library, which few of the guests are aware of.  Those who wish can rent a car or a bicycle at the hotel (for money), and a kayak on the beach (free of charge). </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  For kids, this is a very comfortable hotel, as there is always a very relaxed atmosphere.  This is closely monitored by employees who do not allow the noisy fun of individual citizens, if it interferes with other vacationers.  In the brochures it is stated that the hotel has a playground and a mini club, but, according to tourists, in reality these facilities are inoperative, there is only one sector with a very small depth in one of the pools.  For their kids, parents can order a cot in the room, and take a high chair in the restaurant.  There is no information about any discounts for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comfortable hotel" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435044.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  It is better to go to rest in this hotel from the end of November to the beginning of April, since it is during this period that the maximum number of fine days is here, and the sea is more or less calm and clean.  Most often, it rains in July and September.  These months, they are not just stormy, but protracted, but the prices for rooms are the lowest.  It is not particularly suitable for a beach holiday in Phuket in August and June, when it rains a little, but the sea has a red flag almost every day, which means a ban on swimming.  The point here is not so much in rather impressive waves, but in underwater currents that are invisible to the eye.  You can feel them well, even having entered the sea ankle-deep, and these currents very powerfully carry you to the depths.  Therefore, rescuers are constantly on duty on the beach, not allowing anyone to swim, neither children nor adults. </p><p>  April, May and November are considered favorable for outdoor activities.  At this time of fine and rainy days, they were almost equally divided, showers were mostly transient, and underwater currents were not noticeable.  Therefore, those tourists who choose to Phuket in spring or autumn will be able to successfully alternate beach and sightseeing vacations.  But regarding the temperature of water and air, there is no difference when to go to Phuket, since these two climate indicators are approximately the same throughout the year.  Water off the coast here is always warmed up to + 24-26, and air - up to + 32-36 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Amora Beach Resort" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435052.jpg" width="525"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  When planning a beach vacation, it is very advantageous to choose Amora Beach Resort 4 *.  Phuket, Thailand as a whole has good beaches, characterized by white sand and a wonderful sea.  But, without exaggeration, the place where the hotel in question is located can be called the best.  The beach with white soft sand here is called Bang Tao - just like the bay, along which it stretches for more than 10 km.  It belongs to the waters of the Andaman Sea, unusually blue, with clean clear water and shallow depth near the coast, which is always appreciated by vacationers with small children.  From the hotel to the beach, as they say, a stone's throw, in other words, only a half dozen meters.  Sun loungers here are free, but sometimes they are not enough for all tourists, although not hotel guests are not allowed here.  There are no umbrellas on the beach.  Instead, they use gorgeous coniferous trees that grow near the water's edge and give a wonderful diffused shadow.  Another distinguishing feature of Bang Tao is its low population even in high season. </p><h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  It is difficult to come to Thailand and spend the whole vacation at the hotel, depriving yourself of the pleasure of exploring unusually interesting sights.  It is especially convenient to devote excursion days to those who arrived in Phuket in August.  The weather at this time is not just warm, but sunny.  Even after the rain, the sky always quickly settles in, which is perfect for excursions.  You can buy them at the hotel or at the Patong and Phuket travel agencies, which is much cheaper.  And there is where to go.  The island of Phiphi, Lake Cheo Lan, the unusually beautiful city of Phuket with its exclusive museums, parks, Buddhist temples and much more. </p><p>  Hotel guests will certainly enjoy not only excursions, but also shopping.  The market is very popular on Thursdays and sometimes (not all year) on Mondays.  It is located 1500 meters from the hotel.  Outlandish fruits and local dishes are especially popular on the market among Russians, many of which are cooked in front of customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Phuket Amora Beach Resort" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1435048.jpg" width="528"></div>
