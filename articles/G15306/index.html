    <p>  Since inside any premises of the Kremlin shooting with photo and video equipment is strictly prohibited, you can purchase discs with a video tour that describes a particular attraction.  This will allow you to subsequently enjoy all the masterpieces more carefully and in detail than you could afford during a personal visit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the first time, you probably won‚Äôt be able to carefully inspect everything, so get a guided tour of the Moscow Kremlin.  Tickets are not cheap, but you will enjoy the details and learn from the guides a lot of interesting facts.  Prices for excursions vary depending on which attraction you prefer.  For example, the cost of visiting the Armory will be 700 rubles (for pensioners - 300 rubles), tickets to the Ivan the Great Bell Tower for all categories of citizens cost 250 rubles, and Cathedral Square can be seen for 500 rubles (for students - 250 rubles).

    <p>  It often hosts exhibitions of contemporary art, public <span>mass events,</span> all kinds of presentations.  The internal architecture of GUM makes it a palace of commerce, where it is impossible to resist shopping. </p><h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  In Moscow, more than 150 years ago, near the Presnensky reservoirs where fish were bred, the first menagerie was arranged in the capital.  In those days, he was not much like today's splendor, but he successfully pleased the residents and visitors of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The animal habitat in the metropolitan zoo is as comfortable as possible for pets.  This is confirmed by the recent birth of the baby elephant and the replenishment in the gorilla family.  In total, the zoo in Moscow contains more than 6 thousand inhabitants, requiring care, love and affection from the staff.  174 species of mammals are waiting for visitors in the enclosures.  In addition, here you can see: </p><ul><li>  180 species of reptiles; </li><li>  57 species of amphibians; </li><li>  286 species of birds; </li><li>  240 species of fish and 186 species of invertebrates. </li></ul><p>  All this diversity covers 21 hectares of land in almost the <span>center of Moscow.</span>  In addition, the 193 hectare zoo provides a natural habitat for many animal species.  If you use the metro to travel to the Moscow Zoo, you need to get to the Krasnopresnenskaya or Barrikadnaya stations. </p><h2>  Moscow Metro </h2><p>  Metro stations are considered one of the most beautiful in the world.  These architectural monuments of the Soviet era continue to serve man today.  When traveling around the capital and choosing what to see in Moscow in 3 days, pay attention to the metro station.  Muscovites have long been accustomed to the magnificent decoration of the stations and treat them quite mundane. </p>
