When a user loses confidential data, exclusive photos or an electronic key in a single copy, it‚Äôs time to think about the meaning of the word ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù.  However, even with the most adverse events, there is always room for hope.  In our case, the role of the latter is the resuscitation of a flash drive.  All the dejected and those who once neglected the elementary rule of safe removal of the device are waiting for a pleasant miracle.  Really working recovery technologies will become available and understandable to you immediately after you read this life-saving code of information.  Stop trembling and get rid of excitement - your flash drive will work again! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash Drive Resuscitation" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/608748.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Memory that fails people </h2><p>  In order for the flash drive resuscitation to become a successful recovery process, you need to understand what exactly caused the digital sabotage that has arisen, and you also need to know the model of the memory device exactly (often it is enough to have information about the manufacturer).  Perhaps you can help relieve some guilt from the fact that the manufacturer‚Äôs promised reliability and security of data storage on USB flash drive storage devices are more relative concepts than proven truths.  Confirmation of this may be a number of reasons that significantly affect the efficiency and long-term use of specified drives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key technological limitations </h2><ul><li>  The average data storage period varies from 5 to 10 years (meaning ‚Äúpreservation‚Äù of information). </li><li>  Reanimating a flash drive may not be possible if it has been exposed to <span>radiation</span> or high temperatures. </li><li>  The number of write cycles is limited.  Usually the resource of use is exhausted when reaching the value of 10,000 cycles for MLC devices and 100,000 for SLC (principle of operation). <h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resuscitation USB flash drives" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/608744.jpg" width="600"></div></h2></li></ul><p>  There are several more specific limitations.  However, in the context of this article, the mention of them will be just superfluous information - let‚Äôs miss the difficult to understand terminology ... </p><h2>  Under what conditions does resuscitation become inevitable? </h2><p>  In the process of using a Flash drive, an often unlucky user makes a mistake that is quite common for a beginner - he retrieves the storage device, so to speak, on the go, forgetting that it must first be disabled using the OS software.  This ultimately leads to a complete or partial inoperability of the flash drive, which is expressed in the following: </p><ul><li>  The storage device is recognized by the OS as unknown. </li><li>  Flash drive file system changed to RAW. </li><li>  When opening the flash drive, the folder is empty. </li></ul><p>  Otherwise, there is a tendency to standardize risk factors, since mechanical damage or the critical effect of water will negatively affect absolutely any electronics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Resuscitation of a USB stick, or Ways to restore it </h2><p>  Depending on the above "symptoms of electronic ailment" there are several algorithms for action.  It is worth noting that some recovery methods may either not work at all, or give a positive result only after a certain time.  However, if you follow the recommendations described, your chances of success are incredibly high.  Believe in luck, and she will certainly smile at you! </p><h2>  Method number 1.  Resolution of the situation </h2><p>  A single copy of archived information is a significant reason to try to extract data hidden in the digital bowels.  The main rule in this situation is to do nothing with the Flash drive before starting the direct recovery process (meaning attempts at rash experiments: formatting, recording, etc.). </p><ul><li><p>  You will need a special program.  Flash drive resuscitation (data recovery process on it) will be carried out using R-Studio software.  Why exactly this program?  It is free and, despite its simplicity, it effectively enough returns information that was lost (even formatted!) From digital nonexistence.  Among the "free" software - this is the best tool for data recovery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div></li><li><p>  After you have downloaded and installed R-Studio, it is recommended that you close all active applications before starting the software. </p></li><li><p>  On the left in the main window of the program, highlight your USB drive. </p></li><li><p>  Then activate the Scan tab. </p></li></ul>

    <ul><li>  In the next window of the program, in the block where the <span>size of the flash drive</span> is written <span>,</span> specify the initial value "0" in the "Start" check box, and in the area below "Size" - the nominal capacity of the restored flash memory. </li><li>  Make sure that the ‚ÄúKnown files‚Äù item is checked. </li><li>  Then feel free to click the "Scan" button. </li><li>  After some time, the program for resuscitating a flash drive R-Studio will finish the recovery process and require some action from the user. </li><li>  In particular, you need to re-specify your USB drive in the area on the right and use the right mouse button to call the context menu. </li><li>  In the list, select "Show contents ...".  A list of resuscitated files will appear on the right, among which you will definitely find lost data. </li><li>  Right-clicking and selecting ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù is the penultimate stage of digital reincarnation. </li><li>  The final is choosing the directory to save. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, such a program for resuscitation of a flash drive is used once, because after some stress the user becomes prudent and in the future always duplicates valuable information on the computer‚Äôs hard drive. </p><h2>  Method number 2.  Software crash </h2><p>  When the flash drive is not correctly detected by the OS or the operating system refuses to work with the device, a specialized utility for resuscitating a flash drive can help.  Depending on the type of controller used in the storage device, an individual microprogram is used that works with the specific identifiers of the control chip.  Due to the specificity of this method, a phased action plan is proposed for your attention. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash drive resuscitation utility" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/608751.jpg" width="338"></div></h2><h2>  Step number 1.  Definition of VID and PID controller </h2><ul><li>  Go to the start menu. </li><li>  Point the marker at the "Computer" section and long-press the right mouse button to call up the context menu - select "Device Manager". </li><li>  In the list of displayed system components, select "Universal Serial Controllers ...". </li></ul><p>  Note: it makes absolutely no difference when a flash drive is reanimated, a Transcend USB drive, or some other modification of the storage device that requires identifiers.  Literally for all types of Flash-memory the described scenario will be identical. </p><ul><li>  So, the next step is to open the branch of the section "Universal controllers ...". </li><li>  Among the displayed devices, select "Storage ...", which, in general, is the designation of your flash drive. </li><li>  Using all the same manipulations (right button + long press), call up the pop-up menu in which activate the "Properties" item. </li></ul>

The search algorithm for the required program corrector is quite simple: drive the copied Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID) identifiers into the search bar and download the found utility.  But the most acceptable option is to contact the manufacturer‚Äôs official website in the technical support section. </p><p>  Nevertheless, there are many diverse Internet resources, the specialization of which is precisely related to this kind of recovery issues.  The incredibly popular iFlash service has a truly amazing base of low-level utilities.  The best software solutions, most of which are from manufacturers of flash drives, - and all this in completely free access!  Having spent only a few minutes of your time, you will certainly get a positive result in the form of the necessary software. </p><h2>  Method number 3.  Effective resuscitation </h2>

    <p>  Transcend <span>flash drives</span> , however, like many other <span>types of Flash drives,</span> can be brought back to electronic life by using the universal Flash Memory Toolkit program or the equally functional HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool.  Today they are the best digital resuscitators.  However, we make a reservation: such software solutions are aimed at the total restoration of storage <span>devices of a known</span> type, that is, directly through the inevitable formatting process.  So if all your attempts to extract lost data from a digital abyss turned out to be futile, and the price of information is not so significant as to contact a specialized center, then it is likely that the performance of the flash drive itself will be a comforting prize. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you know, the incredibly multifaceted process of restoring flash drives was presented in a rather capacious version.  At the same time, the question of which utility is better can be clearly answered with a short phrase: ‚ÄúThe one that works!‚Äù  However, relying on the material in the article, you will definitely achieve the desired result.  Good luck and absolute reliability in data storage! </p>
