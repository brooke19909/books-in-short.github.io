With its help, decorate men's and women's clothing, create paintings and carpets.  But not everyone can afford such embroidery, a tapestry takes up a lot of time and strength of a craftswoman.  In some cases, the work of several masters is used to perform one large work.  The drawing of the future canvas is divided into several pieces with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 1 sq.m.  And they are given to work for embroiderers.  After each of them does its part, the scattered pieces are neatly stitched together. </p><p>  Currently, there is a certain technique for embroidering tapestries.  But, before dwelling on it, it is necessary to clearly determine what the tapestry is and what it is.  The following definition is universally recognized: "One-sided carpet, which is manually woven using the weaving of threads."  Because of this vague definition, many people also consider cross-stitching to be one of the types of tapestries.  In fact, this is true, because in modern Russian, the term tapestry is understood to mean any type of manufacture of a woven work, including upholstery for furniture.  But if you compare this terminology with other languages, now the tapestry embroidery technique is represented by two completely different ways of doing work. </p><p>  Antique Tapestry Today </p><p>  Tapestry weaving, common in the <span>Middle Ages,</span> reminds us a little of how embroidery is made, a tapestry is really created by weaving threads, their number can reach 10 per 1 sq. Cm.  To complete this action, the master needs: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ a special machine (it is a wooden frame on which carnations are stuffed or in which holes are made on top with a certain pitch); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ threads of various colors and shades; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a thicker thread for the warp; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ cardboard, with a work painted on it, which they are going to embroider; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ special tools. </p><p>  The quality and the final cost that embroidery will have depends on how closely the threads of the warp fit together, on how many colors and shades the master will use in the work, it is estimated according to these criteria. </p><p>  In accordance with this technique, the most expensive and famous tapestry studios in Europe are working.  The craftsmen who work there, not only weave new paintings, they also restore old paintings.  Each embroidery is a work of art, because even using the same cardboard twice, the master will not be able to weave completely identical pictures. </p><p>  Modern tapestry embroidery </p><p>  Now, most people use the term "tapestry embroidery" to mean the use of "tapestry seams" when creating paintings.  That is, the master also needs a machine for work, but it already has a different functional purpose.  Threads are not stretched onto its frame; the woven basis of a future work of art is attached to it. </p><p>  Thanks to the development of computer equipment and specialized software, each craftswoman has the opportunity to create cardboard (a pattern for embroidery) of any picture.  In this case, it remains only to choose the right colors and shades of the threads.  There are works in which up to 300 are used. <br>  If you choose the technique of cross-stitch, then your painting in Russian will also have a name - tapestry.  Although this is not quite the right definition for her. </p><p>  In the work of the master, several options for cross-stitching are used, thanks to this they achieve a smooth color transition, get the opportunity to emboss a separate section of the canvas (for example, convey the roughness of the stone). </p><p>  If you need a beautiful and unique embroidery, a tapestry is exactly what fully meets these criteria. </p>
