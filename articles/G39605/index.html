If you follow the step by step instructions, difficulties with knitting booties will not arise, and the process will bring a lot of pleasure.  So that the reader does not have to review many different master classes, we offer you the best.  We hope that they will help to tie charming booties for their kids. </p><p>  For beginners, knitting needles, types of yarn, a method of calculating the size and number of loops, options for decorating the product and many other useful information will be considered in our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting booties description for beginners" class="if uuid-2870264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870264.jpg"></div><h2>  What to use knitting needles </h2><p>  In the needlework store it is very easy to get confused.  There are so many products that it‚Äôs not so easy for a beginner to choose the right tool.  But after all, it is on him that the success of all work depends in many respects.  Professional knitters are convinced that for booties it is best to choose hosiery iron knitting needles.  They provide the desired slip, which allows you to knit a uniform fabric.  This is especially important if the product has a drawing. </p><p>  Some craftswomen use only two knitting needles.  However, it is immediately worth noting that knitting booties in this way is not always convenient, especially for babies.  For them, the booties should be very small.  On such a product, the seams that are obtained after stitching parts connected on two knitting needles are too rough.  Therefore, it is better to complete the booties with knitting needles, knitting the product in a circle.  To do this, you must have five knitting needles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Wool and knitting needles" class="if uuid-2870276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870276.jpg"></div><h2>  What threads are required </h2><p>  There are no strict recommendations on this issue.  However, beginners should not choose too thin or fleecy threads, for example, angora.  If at some point something goes wrong, the product will need to be dissolved and bandaged.  In this case, the yarn can become tangled, and the angora will lose its appearance.  In addition, the needlewoman may over tighten the canvas or ruin it. </p><p>  Also, for baby booties with knitting needles, beginners are not recommended to purchase woolen threads.  Contact with baby skin can cause allergies.  The kid may refuse to wear such a thing because it will be pricked.  Professional knitters note that the most optimal version of yarn for babies is a soft hypoallergenic thread.  Now a huge number of manufacturers offer special children's yarn.  Here is a range of colors.  You just need to choose your favorite! </p><h2>  How to choose knitting needles for yarn </h2><p>  As for adult booties with knitting needles, for beginners knitting in this case is an unlimited scope for creativity.  Therefore, you can choose almost any thread.  The main thing is to choose the right knitting needles for them.  Ideally, the diameter of the tool should be one and a half times the thickness of the thread.  In order not to get confused, you should pay attention to yarn.  Manufacturers usually indicate recommended spoke numbers on the label. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to correctly determine the size </h2><p>  Another important point in knitting booties can cause a lot of questions for beginner needlewomen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting booties with knitting needles for beginners" class="if uuid-2870285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870285.jpg"></div><p>  Only with experience is it possible to determine practically by eye how many loops and rows are required to complete one or another part of the product.  But with the help of simple calculations, you can also determine the size of the legs.  It is not so important who is planning to knit booties with knitting needles.  Beginners, as well as professional ones, in any case, with the help of a soft centimeter, you will need to measure the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  A is the distance from the tip of the thumb to the heel. </li><li>  In - girth of the foot through the rise. </li><li>  C is the distance from the thumb to the lower leg. </li></ul><h2>  How to calculate the number of loops and rows </h2><p>  Based on the data obtained, we make simple calculations.  But first, we knit a fragment of the selected pattern.  In this case, it is important to use exactly those knitting needles and yarn that are purchased for the performance of the product.  Too large a sample should not be made.  It is enough to dial ten loops and knit as many rows.  This is an important part of the workshop on how to describe booties with knitting needles for beginners.  Therefore, it should be taken seriously. </p><p>  After that, measure with the help of a centimeter the length and width of the resulting fragment.  Then divide ten stitches by width, and ten rows by length.  If necessary, the numbers can be rounded.  The result should be two values: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  X is the number of loops in one cm. </li><li>  Y is the number of rows in one cm. </li></ul><p>  Now again we return to the parameters obtained when measuring the foot: </p><ol><li>  Divide the value of A by U. And we get the number of rows equal to the length of the foot. </li><li>  We divide the value of B by X. And we find out the number of loops in the widest part of the foot. </li><li>  We divide the value of C by U. And we determine how many rows need to be tied to the place from which the wedge of lifting the foot begins. </li></ol><h2>  How to tie the sole </h2><p>  There are many ways to knit booties with knitting needles for beginners.  Photos in the article reflect only the most popular.  There are two of them.  We will consider both in this material.  The first involves a separate knitting of the insole, sole.  In the second case, the product is knitted whole.  Consider a two-stage option.  It requires first tying an insole or sole.  It is very simple to do this, because we will focus on the received calculations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting needles for beginners on 2 knitting needles" class="if uuid-2870297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870297.jpg"></div><p>  We collect four loops on the knitting needles.  We knit the first row.  In the second, add one new loop after the edge.  In the third, add one more (also after the edge).  Now we knit an even cloth, based on a calculated number of rows.  When the last three remain, we begin to reduce two loops on each side in the third and second rows.  We also do this after the edge loops.  We knit the first row, and then close it.  By analogy, we knit the second part.  This method involves knitting booties on 2 knitting needles.  Knitting needles and threads, as we mentioned earlier, should not be used too thin. </p><h2>  We outline the main part </h2><p>  Many needlewomen will need a hook to complete the next step because they will need to lift the stitches around the edge of the sole.  That is, take a skein of yarn and, prying the thread, stretch new loops around the entire circumference.  It is important not to overdo it and add the same number of loops on two parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting booties for beginners with step-by-step description" class="if uuid-2870293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870293.jpg"></div><p>  When these manipulations are completed, we proceed to the simplest one - we knit in a circle.  To do this, we need to take five hosiery knitting needles.  On four, we will have loops (the canvas should form a certain square), and the fifth we will work, gradually gaining loops on it from one knitting needle.  When the last loop ends, already this spoke will become free.  Repeat the action, knitting the canvas in a circle.  We rise in this way for 7-10 rows and measure the height of the lift from the sole.  If the result obtained is equal to 2/3 of the circumference of the foot, which we determined earlier, then we proceed to the final part of the master class on the implementation of booties with knitting needles for beginners (with a step-by-step description). </p><h2>  We complete booties </h2><p>  This step involves an interesting knit.  After all, we need to make a toe.  To do this, we again use two knitting needles.  In fact, we knit a continuation of the sole, but we grab a new loop from each edge.  When we get to the wedge of raising the foot, we stop.  We get new loops around the circumference and again move on to five spokes.  Now it‚Äôs still easier.  After all, it remains for us to simply lift the bootleg.  At this stage, you can fully trust your wishes and taste.  There are no strict recommendations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Two-spoke booties for beginners" class="if uuid-2870710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870710.jpg"></div><h2>  Elementary booties in a single cloth </h2><p>  The second embodiment of the studied product is even simpler.  However, he does not allow to make beautiful and original booties.  For example, decorated with faces of funny animals.  But it is great for knitting simple household socks, tracks, booties.  The technology is pretty simple. </p><p>  We start knitting with a toe.  We collect ten loops and distribute them into 3-4 knitting needles.  We knit two rows.  After that, we make simple calculations: subtract from the number of loops in the widest part of the foot, the current ten loops on the knitting needles and divide the resulting value by the number of rows, which must be tied up to that time.  As a result, we find out how many loops we need to add in each row of our knitting.  Now just knit.  The main thing is to add new loops at regular intervals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting needles for beginners photo" class="if uuid-2870310" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2870310.jpg"></div><p>  After that, we start knitting booties on two knitting needles.  For beginner needlewomen, this process will not be difficult at all!  Determine the middle and knit again with a single fabric.  When we knit the entire length of the booties, add another 1-2 rows, and then close the loops.  Sew the heel and try on the product.  If it completely fits, we knit a second pair by analogy. </p><p>  As you can see, to please dear and beloved family members with original handmade booties is not difficult at all.  You just need to put a little effort and spend a bit of time. </p>
