Business on the legend</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is not so rare to encounter a peculiar phenomenon when people are interested not in real history, but in their ideas about it.  Even when it is impossible not to understand that this is nothing more than a legend.  Dracula's Castle in Romania annually receives many thousands of visitors.  The broad masses of the tourist community, traveling here from many countries and continents, studied this episode of Romanian history in the main way in Hollywood thrillers and in the famous novel by Bram Stockker. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="romania drages castle" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269187.jpg" width="306"></div>  But people want to see some semblance of familiar scenery for their favorite horror movies.  And the castle of Dracula in Romania does not deceive their expectations.  It fully corresponds to the image that has developed in advance with the public.  And not everyone knows that the real owner of this castle, nicknamed Count Dracula, by his atrocities greatly surpasses all his Hollywood images combined. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle of dracula in romania" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269184.jpg" width="499"></div>

In addition to the war against Turkey, he became famous for the fierce ferocity of both enemies and his subjects.  His name alone terrified the whole district.  In addition to manic, often completely meaningless cruelty, he had a peculiar satanic sense of humor and loved to have fun over his subjects, putting them on a stake for no apparent reason.  Or nailed caps to foreign ambassadors to his head for refusing to remove them from his head at an official government reception.  But impaling was his favorite form of execution and his favorite pastime.  And his nickname - ‚ÄúImpaler‚Äù - he received precisely because of this, it is translated exactly that means ‚Äúimprisoning‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="romania castle dracula tours" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269185.jpg" width="490"></div>  One can only imagine how Vlad Tepes would react to the fact that in five hundred years he would become a cult figure, and Dracula's castle in Romania - an official tourist attraction.  Most likely he would have treated the tour operators with his inherent humor.  But today, the life, fate, deeds of this outstanding historical character and the legends around him have become a good-selling product on the tourism market.  And the concepts - <span>Romania, sights,</span> Dracula's castle - have long been lined up in one semantic row.  People willingly travel, sometimes from the other end of the world, to this splendidly preserved medieval castle in the mountains of Transylvania, on the walls of which five hundred years ago decaying corpses hung on stakes. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="romania landmarks castle of dracula" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/269188.jpg" width="495"></div>
