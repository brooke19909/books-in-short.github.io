There were many of them in our country.  The success of any military operations depended entirely on the experience and skill of the military commanders.  Who are they, the great commanders and naval commanders of Russia, who brought victory to their Fatherland in hard battles?  We present to you the most striking domestic military leaders, starting from the times of the Old Russian State and ending with the Great Patriotic War. </p><h2>  Svyatoslav Igorevich </h2><p>  Famous Russian commanders are not only our contemporaries.  They were in the period of the existence of Russia.  The historians call the Prince of Kiev Svyatoslav the brightest military leader of that time.  He ascended the throne in 945, immediately after the death of his father Igor.  Since Svyatoslav was still not old enough to rule the state (he was only 3 years old at the time of the succession to the throne), his mother Olga became regent with him.  This heroic woman had to lead the Old Russian state even after her son grew up.  The reason was his endless military campaigns, because of which he practically did not visit Kiev. </p>

    <p>  Svyatoslav began to rule his lands on his own only in 964, but even after that he did not stop the campaigns of conquest.  In 965, he managed to defeat the Khazar Kaganate and annex a number of conquered territories to Ancient Russia.  Svyatoslav conducted a series of trips to Bulgaria (968‚Äì969), capturing one by one its cities.  He stopped only after he captured Pereyaslavets.  The prince planned to move the capital of Russia to this Bulgarian city and expand his possessions to the Danube, but due to raids on the Kiev lands of the Pechenegs, he was forced to return home with the army.  In 970‚Äì971, Russian troops led by Svyatoslav fought for the Bulgarian territories with Byzantium that claimed them.  The prince failed to defeat the powerful enemy.  The result of this struggle was the conclusion between Russia and Byzantium of advantageous military-trade agreements.  It is not known how many conquests the Svyatoslav Igorevich managed to carry out if he had not died in the battle with the Pechenegs in 972. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alexander Nevskiy </h2><p>  Outstanding commanders of Russia were also in the period of feudal fragmentation of Russia.  These political figures include Alexander Nevsky.  Being the prince of Novgorod, Vladimir and Kiev, he went down in history as a talented military leader who led the people in the fight against Swedes and Germans claiming to the north-western territories of Russia.  In 1240, despite the predominance of enemy forces, he won a brilliant victory on the Neva, delivering a crushing blow to the <span>Swedish army.</span>  In 1242, he defeated the Germans on Lake Peipsi.  Merits of Alexander Nevsky not only in military victories, but also in diplomatic abilities.  Through negotiations with the rulers of the Golden Horde, he managed to achieve the liberation of the Russian army from participation in the wars conducted by the Tatar khans.  After death, Nevsky was canonized by the Orthodox Church.  It is considered the patron saint of Russian soldiers. </p>

    <h2>  Dmitry Donskoy </h2><p>  Continuing to talk about who the most famous commanders of Russia, it is necessary to recall the legendary Dmitry Donskoy.  The Prince of Moscow and Vladimir went down in history as the man who laid the foundation for the liberation of Russian lands from the Tatar-Mongol yoke.  Tired of enduring the arbitrariness of the Golden Horde ruler Mamaia, Donskoy with the army opposed him.  The decisive battle took place on the <span>Kulikovo field</span> in September 1380.  The troops of Dmitry Donskoy were 2 times inferior in size to the enemy army.  Despite the inequality of forces, the great commander managed to defeat the enemy, almost completely destroying his numerous regiments.  The defeat of the army of Mamaia not only accelerated the moment of the liberation of Russian lands from the Golden Horde dependence, but also contributed to the strengthening of the Moscow principality.  Like Nevsky, Don after the death was canonized by the Orthodox Church. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Mikhail Golitsyn </h2><p>  Famous Russian commanders also lived during the time of Emperor Peter I. One of the most prominent military leaders of this era was Prince Mikhail Golitsyn, who became famous in the 21-year-old Northern War with the Swedes.  He rose to the rank of Field Marshal.  He distinguished himself during the capture in 1702 by the Russian troops of the Swedish fortress of Noteburg.  He was the commander of the guard during the Battle of Poltava in 1709, which resulted in a crushing defeat for the Swedes.  After the battle, together with A. Menshikov, he pursued the retreating enemy troops and forced them to lay down their arms. </p><p>  In 1714, the Russian army under the command of Golitsyn attacked the Swedish infantry near the Finnish village of Lappole (Napo).  This victory was of great strategic importance during the Northern War.  The Swedes were forced out of Finland, and Russia took possession of the bridgehead for the further offensive.  Golitsyn distinguished himself in the naval battle at the island of Grengama (1720), which put an end to the long and bloody Northern War.  Commanding the Russian fleet, he forced the Swedes to retreat.  After that, Russian influence was established in the <span>Baltic Sea</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Fedor Ushakov </h2><p>  Not only the best Russian commanders glorified their country.  The naval commanders did this no worse than the commanders of the ground forces.  Such was Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, whom the Orthodox Church ranked as saints for numerous victories.  He took part in the Russian-Turkish war (1787-1791).  He led the <span>naval battles</span> of Fidonisi, Tendra, Kaliakria, Kerch, led the deposition of the island of Corfu.  In 1790-1792 he commanded the Black Sea Fleet.  Ushakov spent 43 battles during his military career.  In none of them did he receive defeat.  In battles he managed to save all the ships entrusted to him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Alexander Suvorov </h2><p>  Some commanders of Russia have become famous throughout the world.  Suvorov is one of them.  Being the generalissimo of the naval and ground forces, as well as the knight of all military orders existing in the Russian Empire, he left a noticeable mark in the history of his country.  He proved himself as a talented military leader in two Russian-Turkish wars, Italian and Swiss campaigns.  He commanded the Kinburn battle in 1787, and in 1789 - the battles at Fokshany and Rymnik.  He led the assault on Ishmael (1790) and Prague (1794).  During his military career he won victories in more than 60 battles and did not lose in any battle.  Together with the Russian army marched to Berlin, Warsaw and the Alps.  He left behind the book "The Science of Victory", where he outlined the tactics of successful warfare. </p>

    <h2>  Mikhail Kutuzov </h2><p>  If you ask who the famous Russian commanders are, many people immediately remember Kutuzov.  And this is not surprising, because for the special merits of this man was awarded the Order of St. George - the highest military award of the Russian Empire.  He bore the rank of Field Marshal.  Almost all of Kutuzov‚Äôs life passed in battles.  He is the hero of two Russian-Turkish wars.  In 1774, in the battle of Alushta, he was wounded in a temple, as a result of which he lost his right eye.  After long-term treatment, he was appointed Governor-General of the Crimean Peninsula.  In 1788, he received a second serious head wound.  In 1790 he successfully led the assault on Ishmael, where he proved himself as a fearless commander.  In 1805 he went to Austria to command the troops opposing Napoleon.  In the same year he took part in the Battle of Austerlitz. </p><p>  In 1812, Kutuzov was appointed commander of the Russian forces in the Patriotic War with Napoleon.  He held a grand battle of Borodino, after which, at a military council held in Fili, he was forced to decide on the withdrawal of the Russian army from Moscow.  As a result of the counterattack, troops under the command of Kutuzov were able to drive the enemy back from their territory.  Considered the strongest in Europe, the French army suffered huge casualties. </p><p>  Kutuzov‚Äôs leadership talent ensured our country a strategic victory over Napoleon, and he himself brought worldwide fame.  Although the military leader did not support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpersecuting the French in Europe, it was he who was appointed commander in chief of the combined Russian and Prussian forces.  But the disease did not allow Kutuzov to give another battle: in April 1813 he, having reached Prussia with his troops, caught a cold and died. </p>

    <h2>  Generals in the war against fascist Germany </h2><p>  The Great Patriotic War revealed to the world the names of talented Soviet military leaders.  Outstanding Russian commanders put a lot of effort into the defeat of Nazi Germany and the destruction of fascism in European lands.  There were many courageous commanders of fronts on the territory of the USSR.  Thanks to their skill and heroism, they were able to adequately stand up against the German invaders, well trained and armed with the latest technology.  We offer to get acquainted with the two greatest commanders - I. Konev and G. Zhukov. </p><h2>  Ivan Konev </h2><p>  One of those to whom our state owes victory was the legendary marshal and twice hero of the USSR Ivan Konev.  The Soviet commander began his participation in the war as commander of the 19th Army of the North Caucasus District.  During the battle of Smolensk (1941), Konev managed to escape captivity and remove the army and liaison regiment from the enemy‚Äôs encirclement.  After that, the commander commanded the Western, Northwest, Kalinin, Steppe, First and Second Ukrainian Fronts.  He participated in the battle for Moscow, led Kalinin operations (defensive and offensive).  In 1942, Konev headed (together with Zhukov) the first and second Rzhev-Sychevsky, and in the winter of 1943 - the Zhizdrinsk operation. </p><p>  Due to the superiority of enemy forces, many battles conducted by the commander until mid-1943 were unsuccessful for the Soviet Army.  But the situation changed dramatically after defeating the enemy in the battle of <span>Kursk</span> (July-August 1943).  After that, the troops under the leadership of Konev conducted a series of offensive operations (Poltava-Kremenchug, Pyatikhatsky, Znamenskaya, Kirovograd, Lvov-Sandomirsky), as a result of which most of the territory of Ukraine was cleared of the Nazis.  In January 1945, the First Ukrainian Front, under the command of Konev, together with the Allies launched the Wisla-Oder operation, liberated Krakow and <span>the Auschwitz concentration camp</span> from fascists <span>.</span>  In the spring of 1945, the marshal's troops reached Berlin, and he personally took part in his assault. </p>
