    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  A regular pastime in the hotel may prefer to get acquainted with the surrounding attractions.  It is informative, interesting and memorable for a long time. </p><p>  <em>Waterpark Alanya</em> .  Great place for fun.  Kleopatra Arsi 3 is located 1.3 km from it.

You can satisfy your hunger in one of the restaurants and cafes; you can enjoy sweets at the local pastry shop. </p><p>  <em>Damlatas cave</em> .  Located in the center of Alanya, 100 meters from the sea.  Known for its healing properties due to the presence of natural minerals.
