In small settlements and towns, the role of the police was played by the thousand and five hundred, who were appointed by the police officer. </p><h2>  County Review </h2><p>  Interestingly, the police officer is also an inspector.  His duties included reviewing the county, which he had to do twice a year.  That is, he had to inspect all the services subordinate to him, the bailiffs and the entire county.  Inspection must be carried out strictly according to the charter. </p>

    <p>  For the county, the police officer is a very important person.  All three years, he almost single-handedly resolved all issues of citizens' security independently.  They appealed to him as the last resort.  In his power it was possible to stop any lawsuit, which sometimes lasted for years, to correct any injustice.  How much this corresponded to reality is another conversation.  Now we <span>know the meaning of the word</span> "police."  He can be considered the most important person in the county after the governor. </p><h2>  Reform of 1862 </h2><p>  It could be called enlargement, since the district police, according to the decree, was combined with the city police and became subordinate to the zemstvo police officer.  This was the first person in the county with unlimited powers.  The value of the police has increased markedly.  Now he was not elected, but appointed by the provincial government, headed by the governor.  This appointment was necessarily agreed with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.  But, as we understand it, this was a formality, since the governor's word was decisive.  The attitude of the people towards the police officers was intolerant.  Therefore, after the February Revolution of 1917, this post was abolished. </p><h2>  Mountain police </h2><p>  Since 1880, there has been a mountain police in Russia, which controlled the mining industry.  It consisted of mountain guards, they were in charge of the mountain police districts. </p>

    <p>  In addition to purely police duties, mountain police officers performed special functions assigned to them by the state.  The most important included: receiving applications from industrialists for the discovery of gold placers and ore deposits;  control of gold hiding or other abuses.  But the main duty was to monitor the mining workers.  Under the command of the police was a detachment of Cossacks. </p>
