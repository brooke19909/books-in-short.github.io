  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple decoration for children's party</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone can make jewelry from apples with their own hands.  Such a dense fruit with a bright skin is simply created for a variety of works of art.  The pulp of apples is light and looks favorably against a contrasting peel.  So that it does not darken, the masters wipe the surface of the slices with lemon juice. </p><p>  Ornaments from apples can be laid on a dish and put on a festive table for children.  Often parents are faced with the problem of unwillingness of babies to eat fruits and vegetables.  However, no child will refuse to taste the beautifully presented figurine of a bear or a hare, a turtle or a swan. </p><p>  Funny faces, carved with a sharp knife, will be able to cheer up even a crying baby.  Many do not dare to make jewelry from apples on their own, considering it an overwhelming task, however, after reading our article, you will understand that it is absolutely not difficult. </p><h2>  Simple turtle </h2><p>  To work on creating a tortoise figure, prepare a sharp knife, one green apple, a grape of the same color, pieces of chocolate for the eyes, and a toothpick to attach the head to the body.  If the craft is not immediately served on the table, then you will need a lemon to treat the surface of the slices, otherwise they will darken. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple turtle" class="if uuid-3097573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3097573.jpg"></div><p>  Wash the apple well and wipe it dry with a towel.  On one side of the head, cut a circle (about 1/3 of the fruit), which will serve as a tortoise shell.  In the widest place of the apple, cut off the plate with a sharp knife, put it on the plate and get rid of the central part with the seeds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resulting 2 semicircles need to be divided in half.  These will be the paws of the animal.  They need to be placed on a plate at some distance from each other and cover the workpiece with a "shell".  Further work is done on the head.  Select a large oval green grape and cut off the end where the twig is located.  With a toothpick, make 2 holes at the eye location and insert small pieces of dark chocolate into them.  The head joins the body with a toothpick.  Everything, apple decoration is ready, you can serve it on the table! </p><h2>  Crab </h2><p>  The craftwork in the form of a crab cut out of red apples looks spectacular.  The figure consists of several parts: these are large front claws, the body of a crab and many hind legs.  We start manufacturing by cutting thin plates.  To do this, cut out the circles closer to the head, so that the details are large.  Then cut out the part where the seeds are located, and lay out 5 semicircles on top of each other as shown in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kknews.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple crab" class="if uuid-3096048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096048.jpg"></div><p>  For the front pincers, prepare two thick slices of apple and cut two sharp corners with a sharp knife on the flesh.  It remains to cut a third of the fruit to make a "shell", and lay this part on top of the prepared parts.  The eyes are made in the manner described above, so we will not repeat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Apple decoration "Swan" </h2><p>  Figures of this beautiful bird are often used by craftsmen in their crafts, they did not ignore the fruit of the apple tree.  To make the figure lie flat on a dish, cut a large piece, not reaching a bit of a head.  The tail can be left in place or cut off with forceps.  Visually, the resulting part must be divided into a narrow strip for installing the head and the same parts for cutting the corners of the wings.  To make the slices beautiful and smooth, the knife must be sharpened well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gio.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apple swans" class="if uuid-3096052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096052.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on the size of the fetus, 3 to 5 angles are cut, then they need to be slightly shifted towards the tail.  From the cut part of the apple, a head with a pointed beak and a tail part, which is interesting to decorate with carvings, are cut out. </p><p>  On the central part of the swan, make an oblong hole with the knife and insert the neck with the head, free up space for the tail from behind.  Fasten all the elements with toothpicks so that the figure does not fall apart when carrying it. </p><h2>  Funny faces </h2><p>  Funny jewelry made of apples, photos of which can be viewed below, is either made with a special carving knife, or details of the future image are painted on the peel with the point of a toothpick, and then they are carefully cut along the contours with a sharp kitchen knife. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igrovoetv.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="funny faces from apples" class="if uuid-3096062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096062.jpg"></div><p>  Such crafts can be done together with the child, giving him the opportunity to dream.  Be sure to treat the slices with lemon juice, otherwise the appearance of a funny figure will quickly fade. </p><h2>  Owl made of fruits and vegetables </h2><p>  To work on an owl, prepare red and yellow apples, two large radishes, two olives, a triangular carving knife and a small, sharp sharp kitchen knife.  To connect the elements, as usual, use toothpicks.  If the apples are large, then the central part of the body can be pierced with a wooden skewer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tubemotion.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an owl from apples" class="if uuid-3096081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3096081.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, the eyes of an owl make out.  It is better to use the template by drawing even circles in selected places.  Then, the sharp corner of the carving knife makes cuts to the center.  Try to press on it with equal force.  In the center, insert slices of olives, attach with toothpicks. </p><p>  On a red apple in front draw the corners of the "feathers".  Divide the radish in half and cut one edge with corners.  These are the claws of a bird of prey.  It remains to connect the entire craft together and attach the hooked beak. </p><p>  As you can see, making jewelry from apples is simple and fun.  Be sure to try your hand at a new art form.  Good luck </p>
