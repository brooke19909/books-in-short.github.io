What are orbital space stations?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We know so little about space, about how many unknown secrets he keeps.  No one can even approximately grasp the secrets of the universe.  Although gradually humanity is moving towards this.  Since ancient times, people wanted to understand what is happening in space, what objects, except our planet, are in the solar system, how to unravel the secrets that they keep.  Many mysteries that the distant world hides, led to the fact that scientists began to think about how a person can go into space to study it. </p><p>  So the first orbital station appeared.  And behind it - many more, more complex and multifunctional research objects aimed at conquering outer space. </p><h2>  What is an orbital station? </h2><p>  This is an extremely complex installation designed to send researchers and scientists into space for experiments.  It is in Earth orbit, from where it is convenient for scientists to observe the atmosphere and surface of the planet, and conduct other studies.  Artificial satellites also have similar goals, but they are controlled from Earth, that is, the crew is absent there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orbital station" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686553.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <p>  Periodically, crew members at the orbital station are replaced by new ones, but this is extremely rare due to the cost of transportation in space.  In addition, ships are sent there periodically to move the necessary equipment, material support and provisions for the astronauts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which countries have their own orbital station </h2><p>  As noted above, the creation and testing of installations of this complexity is a very lengthy and costly process.  It requires not only serious means, but also scientists capable of coping with such tasks.  Therefore, only major world powers can afford to develop, launch and maintain such devices. </p><p>  Orbital stations are owned by the USA, Europe (ESA), Japan, China and Russia.  At the end of the twentieth century, the above states united to create the International Space Station.  Also, some other developed countries are taking part in this. </p><h2>  Station "Mir" </h2><p>  One of the most successful space equipment construction projects is the USSR Mir station.  It was launched in 1986 (before that design and construction were carried out for more than ten years) and continued to function until 2001.  The Mir orbital station was created literally in pieces.  Despite the fact that its launch date is considered to be 1986, then only the first part was launched, during the last ten years six more blocks were sent to orbit.  For several years, the Mir orbital station was commissioned, the flooding of which took place much later than planned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orbital station world" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686557.jpg" width="600"></div>

During the existence of the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù four such ships were created.  To <span>transmit data</span> from the station to Earth, there were also special installations of their own - ballistic missiles called the Rainbow.  In total, over the period of the station‚Äôs existence, more than a hundred cosmonauts visited it.  The longest was the stay on it of the Russian cosmonaut <span>Valery Polyakov.</span> </p><h2>  Flooding </h2><p>  In the 90s of the last century, multiple problems started at the station, and it was decided to stop the research.  This is due to the fact that she existed much longer than the expected term, initially she had to work for about ten years.  In the year of flooding of the Mir orbital station (2001), it was decided to send it to the southern region of the Pacific Ocean. </p><h2>  Flooding reasons </h2><p>  In January 2001, it was decided to flood the station in Russia.  The company became unprofitable, the constant need for repairs, too costly maintenance and accidents did the trick.  It was also proposed several projects for its conversion.  The Mir orbital station was of value to Tehran, which was interested in tracking the movements and missile launches.  In addition, questions were expressed about a significant reduction in <span>jobs</span> that would have to be eliminated.  Despite this, in 2001 (the year of the flooding of the Mir orbital station), it was eliminated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  International Space Station </h2><p>  The ISS Orbital Station is a complex created by several states.  To one degree or another, fifteen countries are developing it.  For the first time, the creation of such a project was discussed back in 1984, when the American government, together with several other states (Canada, Japan) decided to create a super powerful orbital station.  After the start of development, when a complex called Freedom was being prepared, it became clear that the cost of the space program was too large for the state budget.  Therefore, the Americans decided to seek support from other countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orbital station flooding year world" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  First of all, of course, they turned to a country that already had experience in conquering outer space - to the USSR, where there were similar problems: lack of funding, implementation of projects too expensive.  Therefore, the cooperation of several states turned out to be a completely reasonable decision. </p><h2>  Agreement and launch </h2><p>  In 1992, the United States and Russia signed an agreement on the joint development of outer space.  Starting from this time, countries organize joint expeditions and exchange experiences.  Six years later, the first element of the ISS was sent into space.  Today it consists of many modules, to which several more are planned to be gradually connected. </p><h2>  ISS Modules </h2><p>  The ISS includes three research modules.  This is the American laboratory Destiny, which was created in 2001, the Columbus Center, founded by European researchers in 2008, and Kibo is a Japanese module delivered to orbit the same year.  The Japanese research module was the last to be installed on the ISS.  It was sent in parts to orbit, where it was mounted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orbiting space stations" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686555.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Russia does not have its own full-fledged research module.  But there are similar devices - ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù and ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù.  These are small research modules, which in their functions are slightly less developed in comparison with devices of other countries, but are not much inferior to them.  In addition, a multifunctional station called ‚ÄúScience‚Äù is being developed in Russia.  It is planned that it will be launched in 2017. </p><h2>  "Salute" </h2><p>  The Salyut orbital station is a long-term project of the USSR.  There were several such stations in total, all of them were manned and intended for the implementation of the civilian DOS program.  This first Russian orbital station was launched into low Earth orbit in 1975 using a Proton rocket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="orbital station world flooding" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686559.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In 1960, the first developments of the orbital station were created.  By this time, the Proton rocket already existed for transportation.  Since the creation of such a complex device was new to the scientific minds of the USSR, work went extremely slowly.  A number of problems arose in the process.  Therefore, it was decided to take advantage of the developments created for the "Union".  All Salutes were very similar in design.  The main and largest compartment was the worker. </p><h2>  Tiangong-1 </h2><p>  The Chinese orbital station was launched recently - in 2011.  So far, it has not been fully developed; its construction will continue until 2020.  As a result, it is planned to build a very powerful station.  Translated, the word "tiangong" means "heavenly chamber."  The weight of the device is approximately 8500 kg.  Today the station consists of two compartments. </p><p>  Since the Chinese space industry plans to launch next-generation stations in the near future, the tasks of Tiangong-1 are extremely simple.  The main goals of the program are to work out docking with ships of the Shenzhou type, which are now delivering cargo to the station, debug existing modules and devices, modify them if necessary, and create normal conditions for long-term stay of astronauts in orbit.  The following Chinese-made stations will already have a wider range of goals and capabilities. </p><h2>  Skylab </h2><p>  The only American orbital station was launched into orbit in 1973.  She focused on research on a wide range of aspects.  Skylab conducted technological, astrophysical and biological studies.  There were three long expeditions at this station; it lasted until 1979, after which it collapsed. </p><p>  Skylab and Tiangong had similar tasks.  Since <span>space exploration</span> was only just beginning <span>, the</span> Skylab crew had to investigate how the process of human adaptation in space was going on and conduct some scientific experiments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salute orbital station" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686558.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first Skylab expedition lasted only 28 days.  The first astronauts repaired some damaged parts and practically did not have time to conduct research.  During the second expedition, which lasted 59 days, a heat-insulating screen was installed and hydroscopes were replaced.  The third expedition aboard the Skylab lasted 84 days, and a number of studies were conducted. </p><p>  After the completion of three expeditions, several options were proposed on how to proceed with the station in the future, but due to the impossibility of transporting it to a farther orbit, it was decided to destroy the Skylab.  Which happened in 1979.  Some fragments of the station were saved; now they are exhibited in museums. </p><h2>  Genesis </h2><p>  In addition to the above, at the moment there are two more stations without crew - the inflatable Genesis I and Genesis II, which were created by a private company engaged in space tourism.  They were launched in 2006 and 2007, respectively.  These stations are not aimed at space exploration.  Their main distinguishing ability is that, once in orbit when folded, they, when laid out, begin to significantly increase in size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian orbital station" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/686554.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The second model of the module is better equipped with the necessary sensors, as well as 22 CCTV cameras.  According to a project organized by the company that created the ship, anyone could send a small item on the second module for $ 295.  There is also a bingo machine on board the Genesis II. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Many boys in childhood wanted to become astronauts, although few of them understood how difficult and dangerous this profession was.  In the USSR, the space industry aroused pride in every patriot.  The achievements of Soviet scientists in this area are incredible.  They are very important and remarkable, since these researchers were pioneers in their field, they had to create everything on their own.  <span>The first orbiting space</span> stations were a breakthrough.  They ushered in a new era of conquering the universe.  Many astronauts who were sent to low Earth orbit, managed to reach incredible heights and contribute to space exploration, revealing its secrets. </p>
