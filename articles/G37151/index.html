  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carpathian resorts of Ukraine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ukraine is an interesting and diverse country, providing a lot of opportunities for tourism.  At the mention of the phrase "resorts of Ukraine" the first thing that comes to mind is Crimea.  This is a unique place, and almost every one of us has some kind of fond memories, but the list does not end there: in Ukraine there are still many other places where you can have a good rest. </p><p>  First of all, we will talk about the resorts of Western Ukraine.  This is an amazing, original, unlike any other land, worthy to visit.  In connection with the prevalence of mountainous terrain, the main ski resorts of Ukraine are located here.  First of all, it is Lviv, Transcarpathian and Ivano-Frankivsk regions.  In Soviet times, there were sanatoriums for the treatment of many diseases, because local mineral waters have unique healing properties.  Today, modern complexes have been built on the site of the old sanatoriums, and SPA procedures have been added to the traditional therapeutic and preventive procedures.  As before, the most popular <span>balneological resorts in</span> Ukraine are Truskavets, Khmelnik, Morshin, and there are also many other sanatoriums in the region of lesser importance, but the mineral waters there also have pronounced healing properties. </p><p>  There are numerous ski resorts in Ukraine.  The largest, most famous and most developed is Bukovel.  It is located in the Ivano-Frankivsk region among three mountains that cover it from the wind, one of which gave it a name, at an altitude of more than 860 meters above sea level.  The length of routes of varying complexity is 50 kilometers, and the longest route is more than 2 kilometers.  The administration carefully monitors the state of the snow cover, and if necessary, snow cannons and snow groomers are used, so it remains in perfect condition until mid-spring.  It has a very developed infrastructure, comfortable cottages for living, a rich entertainment program, but many complain about the prices - they are really quite high here. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Recently, new resorts of Ukraine are rapidly gaining popularity, among them Play in the Lviv region.  It was founded only in 2007, but is developing rapidly.  It is planned to arrange a year-round <span>recreation center here,</span> but for now it is an inexpensive ski resort with modern technology and excellent long slopes. </p><p>  It is completely natural that rest in Ukraine is inconceivable without acquaintance with its original culture.  Here, culture is simply striking in its uniqueness.  Arriving <span>in the Carpathians, you</span> definitely need to visit mountain villages, get acquainted with local crafts and cuisine, hear local music and songs that are so different from everything that we heard, and you will discover a completely different Ukraine.  By the way, it‚Äôs not only the inhabitants of mountain villages that are original - in the cities the people are also surprising.  Especially famous for this Lviv.  Lviv residents are famous for their amazing sense of humor, although it can sometimes be very difficult for an untrained person to understand it.  You need to be prepared for everything and everything to be easy to relate to - no one intends to offend anyone here. </p><p>  Lviv is also known for its strange institutions.  What is the "Kryivka" stylized as a dug-out UPA!  Even if you find it, you will be asked for a password at the entrance and will try to interrogate you.  Or one more wonderful place ‚ÄúGalician Jewish Kneipp‚Äú Pid Gold Rose ‚Äù, where you can find out the price of dinner only when calculating.  Naturally, you will be called something beyond, and you have to seriously bargain, otherwise you can go to work out the debt by washing the dishes. </p><p>  So not all Ukrainian resorts are located on the Black Sea - there are still many amazing places.  Ukraine is an unusual country, breaking our stereotypes about it at every step, it is multifaceted and multifaceted, and it is worth coming here to understand this. </p>
