    <p>  <span>The United Nations</span> as a system has evolved over a fairly long period.  The birth of the UN began even more than a hundred years ago.  It was created as a mechanism for effective management of the <span>world community.</span>  The UN history of creation went in stages. </p><p>  The first intergovernmental and international organizations began to form in the mid-nineteenth century.  This phenomenon was caused by the formation after the revolution of states seeking independence, as well as the successes of scientific and technological development, which led to the interconnection of states.  The UN history of creation is largely determined by precisely these factors. </p><p>  <span>Integration processes</span> began to penetrate the economies of the most developed countries in Europe.  In this regard, such a new form of interstate relations as intergovernmental organizations arose. </p><p>  The UN story of creation has many mysteries.  Many questions about its occurrence remain controversial to this day.  The history of the twentieth century began with wars, including two world wars.  This led to the desire of countries to create an international organization, not of economic, but of political orientation in order to prevent possible wars in the future.  The first draft of this plan was implemented during the creation of the League of Nations (1919).  However, it has not proved its effectiveness.  This became apparent with the start of World War II.  This war gave a strong impetus to the public and government initiative to organize security and peace. </p><p>  They still argue about which of the allies was the first to propose the creation of the UN.  The UN history of creation from the point of view of Western historians began with the <span>Atlantic Charter of</span> Roosevelt and Churchill, signed in 1941, on August 14.  Soviet scientists justifiably refer to such a document as the Soviet-Polish declaration of 1941, dated December 4. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no disagreement over the issue of the fact that the year 1943 became the most important stage in the creation of the UN.  On October 30 of the same year, a declaration was signed by representatives of the USA, USSR, China and Great Britain.  The declaration recognized the need to establish a universal international organization whose goal is to maintain security and peace on an international scale.  The declaration spoke of the equality of all peace-loving states and their right to participate in the creation of an international union of countries. </p><p>  The decision to create the UN was made at the <span>Yalta Conference</span> in Crimea by the leaders of the countries of anti-Hitler coalition.  It was signed by Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt and <span>Winston Churchill.</span>  It was at this conference, held on February 4-11, 1945 that the basic principles of the United Nations activity were formulated, its structure and functions were determined. </p><p>  The UN history of creation and structure were developed gradually.  Already under the UN charter, the main organs of the world organization were established.  These are the General Assembly, the Trusteeship Council, the Security Council, the Secretariat and the UN International Court of Justice, the Economic and Social Councils. </p><p>  In addition, the charter permitted, with the consent of the General Assembly, the establishment of other self-governing organizations.  Under this item, the Security Council has created peacekeeping forces. </p><p>  In April 1945, a UN conference was held in San Francisco with the goal of developing a charter.  This was attended by delegates from 50 countries.  Officially, the charter entered into force on October 24, 1945, so this date is considered the birthday of the UN. </p><p>  Since 1946, a special body has been operating - UNESCO (UN World Organization for Science, Culture and Education), which is located in Paris. </p><p>  In 1948, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which spelled out all the rights of every person, including the basic rights to life, liberty, security of the person, private property, etc. </p><p>  In 1948, the UN created a special Commission for the Protection of Endangered Animals and Plants, with which the history of the creation of the Red Book began. </p><p>  Today, the UN includes 192 countries. </p>
