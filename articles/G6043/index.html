    <h2>  Key characteristics of the Altai climate </h2><p>  <span>The climate of Altai</span> has its own characteristics.  Its formation is influenced by several factors.  First of all, it is necessary to note the geographical location of the Altai Territory, as well as the difficult terrain.  The height here ranges from 350–4500 meters.  In general, for this area is characterized by a sharply <span>continental temperate climate.</span>  In this case, there is a pronounced contrast between the cold long and warm short seasons of the year. </p><p>  In addition, there are completely different climatic conditions for the plains, low mountains and foothill territories.  Such differentiation is due to differences in the exposure of the mountain slopes and in absolute altitude, as well as the peculiarities of atmospheric circulation. </p><h2>  Why is the climate on the western and eastern slopes of Altai different? </h2><p>  The climate formation in this area is influenced by several main factors: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The nature of the underlying surface. </li><li>  The circulation of air masses. </li><li>  The amount of solar radiation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the climate on the western and eastern slopes of the Altai is different" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1113908.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  Do not forget that the Altai Territory is located in the middle zone of the temperate northern climatic zone.  Throughout the year, light and heat come in unevenly.  To determine the <span>type of climate in</span> Altai, it is necessary to consider all the features of its location. </p><p>  In summer, the height of the sun reaches 60–66 degrees.  In this case, daylight hours last about 17 hours.  In winter, the <span>height of the sun above the horizons</span> is not more than 20 degrees.  At the same time, daylight hours are reduced several times.  Naturally, as a result of such phenomena, changes in the amount of solar radiation occur throughout the year.  The northern regions of the Altai Territory receive only 90 kcal per square meter, and the southern - about 120 kcal. </p><h2>  Sun and climate </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the same amount of total solar radiation is received by regions of Russia with a warm climate.  In addition, if we compare the time of sunshine in the Altai Territory with the same indicators in the southern parts of the country, then in Altai this figure is much higher.  In this case, the area can be compared with the North Caucasus or Crimea.  The climate of Altai is unique. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The northern slopes of mountain ranges and deep valleys receive the least amount of sunlight and heat.  It is for this reason that choosing a parking place should be correct.  Indeed, the eastern slopes of the <span>Altai mountains are</span> illuminated about an hour and a half earlier than the western ones.  It should also be borne in mind that in the morning, cloud cover is negligible.  With a sufficiently high intensity of radiation emitted by the sun, severe burns can be obtained.  The probability increases when you are on glaciers and snowfields. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai climate type" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1113909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Altai climate and air masses </h2><p>  The climate of Altai Territory is strongly influenced by air currents.  After all, the process of atmospheric circulation is one of the main natural factors.  Many different flows come to Altai.  They collide, mix, interact and form unstable and dramatically changing weather. </p><p>  The climate of Altai for months is very difficult to paint.  Several air currents collide over this area.  The main is continental-moderate.  It has pronounced properties.  In summer, hot and dry air prevails here, and in winter, marine, temperate and cold, passing thousands of kilometers from the Atlantic Ocean.  To the south from the north, in the opposite direction, air masses also move.  In this case, continental arctic air prevails.  Often flows come from Central Asia.  Tropical continental air masses prevail here.  If this happens, then spring comes in Altai early, and summers are always arid and very hot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Relief and climate </h2><p>  The climate of Altai also depends on the terrain.  In this case, several vertical zones are formed: </p><ul><li>  The low-mountain climate zone is up to 600 meters. </li><li>  The zone of mid-mountain climate is 500–500 meters. </li><li>  The high mountain climate zone is more than 2500 meters. </li></ul><p>  The relief of the region is simply unique.  In the southeast and south of Altai there are high mountain ranges, from which the amphitheater gradually decreases to the northwest and north.  At the same time, a free path opens up for Arctic air flows that go far south, to the valleys located between the ranges, through the territory of the whole Altai. </p><h2>  Moisture and relief </h2><p>  The climate of the Altai mountains depends on many factors.  The relief has a strong effect on the nature of soil moisture.  From the west to the territory of Altai flows of sea air.  However, mountain ranges block their path.  As a result of this, most of the precipitation falls on the western slopes.  On the east side, as well as in the interior of the Altai Territory, moist air practically does not penetrate.  It is for this reason that an arid climate forms here. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that such air masses bring cyclonic weather to the plains.  It is for this reason that the Bie-Chumysh Upland and the Priobskoe Plateau receive significantly less rainfall than other territories, including the Kulundinskaya Lowland. </p><h2>  Rainfall </h2><p>  What climate is it in Altai?  Photos of this region are simply amazing in their beauty.  It’s hard to believe that the climate here is unstable and the weather can change dramatically.  It is worth noting that in such an area there is an uneven distribution of precipitation.  However, in this case, there is a certain pattern.  Rainfall is gradually increasing in the direction from east to west.  The most humid area is the basin of the Western Altai.  Over 2,000 millimeters fall here per year.  Significantly less moisture goes to the north-eastern territories of the region.  Minimum <span>precipitation falls in the</span> region of the intramontane basins of the Eastern and Central Altai.  This total figure per year does not exceed 200 millimeters.  The most arid place in the Altai Territory is the Chui steppe.  From 100 to 150 millimeters of precipitation falls annually. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the distribution of moisture does not depend on the season, and this indicator is also uneven.  In winter, about 40% of all precipitation falls in the western regions of the region.  As a result of this, the thickness of snow cover can reach up to 3 meters in some places, and about 5 meters in the central part.  In this area there is a danger to climbers.  Snow cover here is easily redistributed and rewind.  As a result, on the slopes and ledges, which are located on the leeward side, cornices and blows are formed.  Climbing in such places carries a danger for climbers.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that in the Altai mountains there are avalanche gorges and canyons in which avalanche gathering increases in spring.  March in this case is the most dangerous month. </p><h2>  Temperature in Altai </h2><p>  The climate of Altai in summer and winter has certain differences for different regions of the region.  And there are explanations for this.  Altai Territory is located almost in the center of the Eurasian continent.  It is thousands of kilometers distant from the ocean.  In the warmer months, the soil heats up much more strongly.  The air temperature in Altai is very high, and summers are hot.  In winter, the opposite is true.  During this period, a significant and fairly rapid cooling of the mainland is observed.  As a result of this, a Siberian anticyclone is formed in the north-east of Siberia - an area of ​​high pressure.  Air flows are moving westward, passing through the territory of the entire region.  Altai winter is characterized by low temperatures, as well as frosty and clear weather. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  On the plain and in the mountains, climate elements have quite specific features.  With height, a decrease in temperature and pressure occurs, but the amount of precipitation and cloudiness, on the contrary, increase.  Over the Altai Territory, as a rule, several types of climate are formed at once, as well as diverse microclimatic conditions.  After all, here not only a complex arrangement of mountain ranges is noted, but also significant fluctuations in heights.  Moreover, the air masses over the mountains are very different from the air masses over the plain.  A unique feature of the Altai Territory is the warm climatic “oases”.  In such places there are no very severe frosts, as well as stable snow cover.  After all, the wind is constantly blowing here. </p>
