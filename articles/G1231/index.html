All fields of this form must be filled in, including the TIP field, in which incorrect information can cause the transfer of funds to another account.  This may cause late payment. </p><h2>  The concept of documents used for payment </h2><p>  Payment documents are used to confirm payment for products.  They can be cash and sales checks, strict reporting forms, payment requirements and payment orders. </p><p>  Cash and sales checks are issued to customers upon the purchase of a product.  <span>A strict reporting form</span> is issued to a client receiving a certain type of service instead of a cash receipt. </p>

    <p>  A payment order is used when it is necessary to make non-cash payment using a bank account.  This document is a confirmation to the person who made such a payment. </p><h2>  The concept of UIP in the payment </h2><p>  UIP - what is it in a payment order?  This is one of the most important details of this document.  Literally, it means a <span>unique identifier for a payment.</span>  In the absence of information on this code, the field corresponding to it must be filled with zeros.  If the code is incorrectly generated, the money can be credited to another account, and if paid to state organizations, this can lead to additional penalties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In this regard, you need to take into account some subtleties when filling out the code in the field. </p><h2>  The purpose of the UIP </h2><p>  With its help, the transfer of funds is streamlined. </p><p>  Government agencies have the ability to track payment documents, which is used for statistical research purposes. </p><p>  Provides the holding of the amount necessary to complete a particular transaction. </p><h2>  UIP and UIN </h2><p>  In the payment order, in addition to the UIP code that is not related to budget transfers, the UIN code is given, which is decrypted as a unique identifier for charging.  Under this code, all types of transfers are made to the budget.  The numbers entered in this field should also be checked for correct input, otherwise the funds may not be where they were planned to be transferred.  In this case, it will be necessary to return the money, and then transfer it again with new details, which will take a certain time. </p>

    <p>  There are two such cases: </p><ol><li>  If this number was assigned by the recipient and the payer was informed about it <span>in fulfillment of the</span> terms of the contract.  The procedure for generating the code and its verification by the bank are regulated by the Central Bank. </li><li>  When paying taxes, fees, various contributions.  Since the above payments should be performed by everyone, it is useful to know everyone about the UIP and where to get it.  However, it must be borne in mind that for these types of TIP is required not for ordinary payments, but for payment of arrears, penalties, fines imposed by the Federal Tax Service. </li></ol><h2>  UIP regulatory framework </h2><p>  The legal regulation of the UIP is carried out using two documents: </p><ol><li>  Appendix 2 to the Order of the Ministry of Finance No. 107n, which defines the mandatory indication of the UIP in case this identifier is present. </li><li>  Provisions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation No. 383-P, according to which the bank should not accept a payment order if the UIP column is not filled.  Mandatory code is indicated, in the absence of an identifier in field 22 must be 0. </li></ol><h2>  Code Writing Rules </h2><p>  Besides the fact that you need to know what it is - UIP in a payment order, you also need to be able to write it down correctly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The next way to find out the necessary code is to use special directories.  At the same time, the codes are given with the decryption in them, so it is necessary to carry out the identification correctly, which will avoid problems when transferring the payment. </p><h2>  What to do if the payment went with the wrong code </h2><p>  If the code in the field of the payment order, which corresponds to the UIP code, is missing, it may not be filled out, but zeros can be entered there.  If the wrong code was written, then it is necessary to perform a series of sequential actions: </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to rewrite the payment order in which to indicate the correct TIP, and then make the payment again. </li><li>  To the organization to which the payment was made with the wrong details, you need to write a statement stating the reason why she should return the money to the sender.  In this case, the reason for the return is indicated as erroneously entered details. </li></ul><p>  The application must indicate the details of the current account where the funds will be returned. </p><p>  Waiting for a refund may be delayed for a sufficiently long period of time.  It depends on where exactly they got. </p><h2>  Remember to check the UIP codes </h2><p>  With the annual dynamics of document forms, codes can also undergo changes, including UIP.  Therefore, when making a payment, it is best to always check not only the correctness of the code at any particular point in time, but in order to know for sure that there were no changes, you need to check for amendments made to the codes. </p><h2>  "1C: Payments" and other software </h2><p>  The 1C: Enterprise program stores data on contractors and employees.  It is possible to enter specific information based on other documents.  The complex includes the 1C: Payment Documents software product. </p><p>  Information on the issued payment orders using this system is transmitted to specialized programs that serve to exchange information through electronic channels with banks. </p><p>  The printing forms in this program comply with unified requirements. </p>

    <p>  Using the 1C: Enterprise program, you can change forms by varying the width of the columns, inserting a logo, etc. Documents are registered in magazines. </p><p>  Following the instructions of the Bank of Russia regarding the transfer of funds to 1C, a UIP appeared in the list of payment order details. </p><p>  The formation of new payment systems with UIP was available in the 1C: Accounting version starting from version 3.0.30. </p><p>  Also, for ‚Äú1C: Enterprise 8‚Äù, version 11.1.5 of the ‚ÄúTrade Management‚Äù configuration was released, which added the ability to add UIP to payment orders. </p><p>  In addition to using this software package, UIP can be specified using other programs.  Thus, in particular, Raiffeisen Bank uses the Elbrus program to prepare payment orders, which can also be used to enter the value of the PIN and TIP in the Code field. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, to the question what is this UIP in a payment order, it can be answered that since 2014 this is an important attribute that needs to be filled in if submitted by the seller.  And also if this identifier needs to be considered as a UIN, when it is indicated in payment orders for payment of fines, penalties for taxes and fees.  This code is indicated in field 22 of the payment order.  It can be filled both manually and with the help of special software, the main of which is 1C. </p>
