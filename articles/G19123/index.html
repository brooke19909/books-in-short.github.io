    <p>  This is done in order to increase the reliability of the system, by analogy with the means of protecting Windows system directories from file modifications.  For example, smartphones from Samsung, which run the TouchWiz shell-add-on in its basic version, do not allow their owners to adjust the functionality too much.  However, it is possible to overcome this limitation. </p><h2>  Flexibility provided </h2><p>  The undoubted advantage of Google's systems over iOS and WinPhone is the ability to relatively easily replace the original operating system with an alternative solution.  Custom firmwares of Android are the same packages of control programs, but features have been added to them and various optimizations have been made.  Their preparation and assembly is carried out not by the developers, but by the teams of the users themselves who possess the necessary knowledge.  In addition to these improvements, Samsung <span>custom firmware</span> , for example, allows the gadget owner to use a new version of the operating system, even one that has not been officially introduced.  In fact, everything is simple.  Here they are - custom firmware.  What does this give the average user? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  samsung" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1076542.jpg" title="" width="500"></div>

Since the basis of the systems from "Google" is "Linux", the installation process is no different from the updates performed in versions running on computers. </p><h2>  What you need to know before installation </h2><p>  In order to install custom firmware, you must follow a certain procedure.  First of all, you need to unlock the boot block.  The owner of the Android gadget does not need to learn the instructions - everything has been automated for a long time.  All that is required is to download, install and run the program to obtain root access rights.  There are many of them, so the choice of a workable option is entirely up to the user.  Examples include Super Su and King Root.  For the second program to work, you need Internet access, ideally via Wi-Fi. </p>

    <p>  After the successful completion of rutting, it is possible to install some specialized application designed to save all user data.  In particular, you can ‚Äúbackup‚Äù already installed programs along with settings, a phone book with current calls, etc. A very useful feature that should not be ignored.  Here they are - custom firmware.  What is this program that saves all the data?  One of the best is Titanium backup.  It works if the system has root-rights.  Note that even if there is no plan to change the firmware, it is recommended to save data in any case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And finally, one of the last stages is the search for a resource from which you can download custom firmware.  What are these software packages, we have already indicated.  From the existing abundance it is very important to choose the one that is designed for the desired gadget model.  Possessing at least some knowledge in Linux systems, you can independently correct the firmware from the twin device, but for beginners it is better to refrain from this. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the "iron" component, then the gadget owner needs to prepare a computer with a free USB port, a cable for connecting devices, an SD memory card. </p><p>  Consider some of the most popular custom firmware.  ‚ÄúWhat, for example, is this CyanogenMod everyone is talking about?‚Äù  - the attentive reader will ask.  And it will be done right. </p><h2>  MIUI </h2><p>  Chinese developers are known for constantly releasing new models of gadgets and firmware for them.  Not surprisingly, they have achieved a lot in software optimization.  So, a distribution called MIUI has incorporated the best solutions from the classic Android and CyanogenMod.  Even more - some of the ideas implemented in MIUI are completely absent in the original Google firmware.  Externally, this system is similar to Apple's solution in its iOS (one working screen).  MIUI features stability;  ease of transfer to other gadgets, which explains its distribution;  economical use of resources;  convenience of the interface;  many settings and, of course, an impressive appearance.  Back in 2012, custom firmware 4 from MIUI was introduced, which became incredibly popular.  Now version 7.x.x already exists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are four collector teams for these firmwares: Miltirom, Miuipro, Xiaomi, and MIUI.  Although there are no global changes within the same version, you cannot equate them.  The solutions from each of the teams have their own, so to speak, innate shortcomings and advantages.  Select to user.  For example, Miuipro offers only coded options;  Xiaomi does not allow you to put themes using patches, etc. </p><h2>  LEWA </h2><p>  A direct competitor to the aforementioned MIUI is another solution from the Chinese.  We are talking about firmware, called LEWA.  Outwardly, these two systems are very similar. </p>

    <p>  The same one main screen and the missing application menu.  A similar interface.  It is worth noting less RAM requirements and more productive work.  A worthy replacement for the basic programs from Google.  Voice Search and Play Market work great.  From all other solutions, Lewa compares favorably with the balance between the number of settings and the initial performance.  That is, there is no need to understand dozens of switches, as in MIUI, and the functionality of those that are present is obvious. </p><h2>  Great CyanogenMod </h2><p>  Custom firmware for Samsung Galaxy and other smartphones, of course, are not limited to MIUI and Lewa.  One of the most famous alternatives to the basic software is CyanogenMod (aka ‚ÄúCyan‚Äù, CM).  The advantages of this solution are obvious: the lack of "extra" programs;  many settings;  performance optimization;  reduced battery power consumption;  ART mode by default.  In addition, it is possible to activate root access without using third-party applications.  It is worth noting that thanks to the efforts of developers, CyanogenMod firmware can be used even on devices with MTK processors.  In addition, there are versions based on Android 5.1.1 that can work with the Linux 3.4.67 kernel (Kit Kat). </p><p>  Automatic adjustment of the color temperature of the glow of the screen, set depending on the time of day;  color gamut adjustment;  optimal memory handling and much more.  All these features are initially present in CyanogenMod 12.1, built on the basis of Lollipop.  For owners of devices running on "Android 4.4.2", whose official support has been discontinued, this is the only way to update the software, postponing the need to replace the gadget with a new model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/1076543.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If we talk about the Samsung Galaxy, especially the latest models, their owners, we can say, were lucky, since the installed CyanogenMod firmware automatically selects the current version, downloads it and offers to update.  You can be sure that the gadget is running the most modern version. </p><h2>  Vibe </h2><p>  Many smartphone-building companies are introducing some of their ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù practices into the classic Android.  This is what happened with Lenovo.  The owners of these devices have long known <span>what Vibe</span> UI is.  This is an add-on over the standard interface, a kind of shell.  Now anyone can appreciate all its advantages - for this it is not necessary to buy the appropriate gadget.  All you need to do is install custom firmware.  One of the advantages of this software solution is that its internal structure involves the assembly of a single interface from independent components, which makes it easy to change any of them.  Among the unique features, one cannot fail to note the ‚Äúsmart button‚Äù, when clicked, a menu for selecting applications appears;  smart wi-fi, which implements binding to any one station, which saves battery power in case of loss of connection;  a means of transferring files between devices over a wireless network, etc. It is important to understand that in a custom firmware based on Vibe, not all functions can be present, as in the original version. </p><h2>  Basic set </h2><p>  Among the whole variety of custom firmwares, there is a special group that cannot be ignored.  It is about finalizing the basic software. </p>

    <p>  The craftsmen take the existing ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù firmware from a gadget as a basis, add certain lines for optimization to its configuration files, delete all ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù applications, replace some basic programs with analogs, etc. As a result, a modified original firmware is obtained. </p><h2>  Custom iOS firmware </h2><p>  Apple devices do not always allow you to install modified software.  In part, this explains their higher reliability.  So, iPhone owners of 1-4 revisions were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù (except for 4S).  But in all subsequent ones, this opportunity is blocked.  When deciding to install a ‚Äúcustom‚Äù in the iPhone, you need, first of all, not to rush, but to visit many Internet resources on this subject.  Otherwise, there is a risk of device failure (as, for example, this happens with 3GS, in which the modem part is updated).  In general, we repeat, custom firmware is not installed on new Apple gadgets. </p><h2>  Dilemma </h2><p>  Very often, mobile device owners cannot decide which firmware is better.  In fact, one should proceed from whether everything suits the existing base?  The risk of problems associated with installing third-party software is not always justified.  Sometimes it‚Äôs more rational to install a new launcher, remove ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù programs, and learn how to work with <span>Clean Master.</span>  And to resort to such a cardinal step as installing custom firmware, it is only necessary in case of any malfunctions that are ‚Äútreated‚Äù by updated software. </p>
