For some reason this castle was the residence of the rulers of Shirvan.  The palace is located in the very center of the capital of the state.  It seems that the history of this attraction is no longer of any interest.  But it is this object that is most explored in the country.  Many architects and scientists are engaged in its study.  Millions of tourists visit this place every year.  The complex is incredibly beautiful.  His appeal did not fade over the years, despite the fact that he experienced many historical events. </p>

    <h2>  History of Attraction </h2><p>  There are no inscriptions on the date of its construction on the citadel building.  Historians set the time for its construction, using the headers on architectural objects belonging to the palace complex.  So, at the minaret of the Shah‚Äôs mosque and at the tomb two such inscriptions were completely preserved.  This information suggests that these buildings were built by order of Shirvan Khalil-ulla I. The tomb indicates that it dates back to 839, and the minaret is designated 845th. </p><p>  According to one of the theories put forward by the historian Leviats, the palace of the Shirvanshahs was erected in the first decades of the 15th century.  Until 1501, there are generally no sources mentioning this attraction.  In one of the Persian annals, it is said that the army of Shirvanshah Farrukh Yessar was defeated in 1501 by the forces of Shah Ismail I. Farrukh Yessar was killed.  The army of Ismail I took Baku and partially destroyed the palace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no evidence of what the palace of the Shirvanshahs was until the first half of the 16th century.  In 1578, Baku came under the rule of the Turks.  The gates that were built during the reign of the Ottoman Empire were preserved on the territory of the attraction.  Since the 17th century, the palace building was empty.  Only some representatives of the authorities lived in it. </p><p>  In 1723, the army of Peter I bombarded Baku.  And the palace of the Shirvanshahs was partially damaged.  In the middle of the XIX century, the landmark in ruin was transferred to the Russian department.  During this period, the palace is being renovated, some of its premises are being converted into warehouses.  Until 1992, the object was transferred from department to department, rebuilt, reconstructed.  The next repair work was completed only in 2006. </p>

    <h2>  The objects that make up the palace complex </h2><p>  The Shirvanshahs Palace (Baku) consists of many buildings: the palace itself, the mosque, baths, Ovdan and others.  Excursions are regularly arranged to each of them.  And first of all I would like to talk specifically about the palace building.  It did not arise at the same time.  The earliest building is considered the central part.  The area adjacent to the western facade was erected a little later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Initially, the palace had 52 rooms, which were interconnected using three spiral staircases.  On the first floor there were 27 rooms, and on the second - 25. The layouts of both floors are almost identical.  In the central part of the wall were made thicker.  The main entrance to the palace is arranged in the western facade.  And it is decorated with a high portal.  All rooms located on the second floor look more solemn.  There are also rooms for the family of the Shah and himself. </p><p>  Guided tours throughout the palace.  In addition to architecture, you can see a variety of household items found during excavations on the site.  So, exhibited jewelry and weapons dating back to the 19th century, coins dating back to the 12th-15th centuries, Shemakha carpets (XIX) and other exhibits. </p>

    <h2>  Another object of the palace </h2><p>  Divan Khan is also part of the Shirvanshahs Palace.  This object is a closed courtyard framed on three sides by a pointed arcade.  In the center of the architectural composition Divan Khan, on a tall stylobate, an octagonal-shaped rotunda-pavilion is placed.  Her hall is surrounded by an open arcade.  The western facade is highlighted by a portal decorated with arabesques.  Through it passes the path to the canopy.  They connect a hall, a crypt located in the stylobate, and office rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is no unambiguous version regarding the purpose of Divan Khan.  There are several opinions.  It was assumed that this object was used to receive guests, the state council, legal proceedings, or in general it was a mausoleum.  There are also theories that this room was called the courtroom or the reception apartments of the palace.  The sofa han dates from the end of the 15th century.  Such conclusions are made on the basis of the analysis of the features of the building style.  Features of the architectural plan, a lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall and a crypt dungeon testify to the memorial significance of Divan Khan. </p>

    <h2>  Tomb of the rulers </h2><p>  The Shirvanshahs Palace (Azerbaijan) also has a family tomb.  This is a rectangular building topped with a hexagonal dome.  Outside, it is decorated with multi-beam stars.  Above the entrance there is an inscription that eloquently speaks about the purpose of the object.  In the center of the building is a funeral room with a dome.  Under it is a crypt with five burials: children are buried in two graves, and adults are buried in three. </p><h2>  Mausoleum of the "dervish" </h2><p>  The mausoleum of Sayyid Yahya Bakuvi, or the mausoleum of the ‚Äúdervish‚Äù, is located in the southern courtyard, next to the palace.  It was built in the second half of the XV century.  Known for the burial of the court scholar Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi.  He served Halil-ulle I. The scientist specialized in astronomy, mathematics and medicine. </p><p>  The mausoleum has an octagonal housing, ending with a pyramidal tent.  Inside there is an underground crypt, in which is located the tomb of Bakuvi, and a chamber is located above the tombstone.  In the limestone slabs located on the sides of the mausoleum, three small windows are carved.  They are stone through lattices.  In the arched part there is an opening that used to combine the mausoleum and the older mosque. </p>

    <h2>  The "old" mosque </h2><p>  In ancient times, a shrine called the "old" was added to the mausoleum of Sayyid Yahya Bakuvi.  The attraction was also known as the Kay-Kubad Mosque.  It was erected on the site of a very old building.  It happened at the turn of the XIV-XV centuries.  The object was blocked by a dome resting on four columns of stone.  The masonry of the mausoleum and mosque were tied together.  The ‚Äúold‚Äù shrine burned down during the fire of 1918.  Today, at the site of the Kay-Kubad Shrine, there are a couple of columns that were once in the middle of the facility.  A fragment of a wall with a roof was also preserved. </p><h2>  Baths of the palace complex </h2><p>  In the palace ensemble there are also baths of Shirvanshahs.  They are located at the very bottom of the structure.  The attraction was discovered in the late 30s of the last century.  As a result of excavations, a huge bathhouse consisting of 26 rooms was found.  It was covered with soil, and on top of it was a garden.  The object was partially cleared in 1953, and in 1961 it was mothballed.  The surviving fragments of the walls indicate that the bath rooms were blocked by domes.  They provided openings for light. </p><p>  The semi-underground placement of the bath made it possible to keep cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The structure of the object included two large square-shaped rooms.  Four pylons dismembered them into smaller rooms.  The outer group of the room was provided for undressing, and the inner one was for swimming.  In the second compartment there were ponds for hot and cold water, a large furnace chamber was equipped.  Heated the water and the room with the help of yellow stones from white condensed oil.  Today, excursions to the Shirvanshah citadel are held daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Ticket prices start at one dollar.  Admission is free for children. </p>

    <h2>  The most ancient symbol of Baku </h2><p>  <span>The city of Baku,</span> whose sights we are considering, is a place that is replete with various cultural and historical sites.  One of them is its oldest symbol - <span>Maiden Tower.</span>  This is a huge, impressive-sized structure, which is located on a rock.  According to scientists, the attraction was built in a couple of stages: half of the building was erected in the V century, and the other half in the XII.  There is no consensus that would accurately describe the purpose of the object.  He is credited with the role of the lighthouse, and the defensive structure, and the observatory, and the temple of the goddess Anahita, and the Zoroastrian Dahna. </p>

    <h2>  Five-kilometer boulevard </h2><p>  The city of Baku, the sights of which are found at every step, is a resort.  Therefore, it would be surprising if there wasn‚Äôt a beautiful place connected with the sea.  Seaside Boulevard is a park that runs along the bay.  It has a length of almost five kilometers.  It began to be built at the beginning of the last century.  The work has not been completed to this day. </p><p>  At first, the boulevard was conceived as a single-tier.  But since in 1977 the level of the Caspian Sea dropped, it was decided to build a lower terrace.  Today, a huge number of cafes, attractions and restaurants are open on the boulevard.  Several tens of thousands of various plants grow here, among which there are giant cacti and baobabs.  There is a puppet theater and a yacht club on the boulevard. </p>
