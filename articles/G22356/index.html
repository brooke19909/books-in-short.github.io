    <h2>  We begin the tour </h2><p>  As mentioned above, Syzran is a multinational city, therefore, the sights here belong to different cultures.  So, I would like to mention the Syzran mosque.  There are four similar religious buildings in the city.  But we will talk about that, which is located on the street.  Decembrists.  This building was built in 1990.  Later, the house was purchased by Alexei Rakhmatulin.  But, heeding the request of his parent, Alex handed over the house to Nail Amirov.  He was an imam-khatib and had to transform the building into a mosque. </p><p>  Many sights of Syzran have an amazing history.  And the mosque was no exception.  For the Muslims of this city, its discovery was a real celebration and a great event.  After all, before the foundation of this institution, they were forced to conduct their services in their own homes.  A mosque can simultaneously accommodate about five hundred people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Another religious building </h2>

    <p>  Kazan Cathedral is no less important cultural and religious object than a mosque.  The temple was erected in 1872.  It was built on the site of the former Mother of God Convent (Syzran).  Sights of the city, many begin to explore from here.  The settlement received a cathedral thanks to the funds of citizens and donations of a private nature.  In a word, with the world on a string. </p><p>  The main throne of the church was consecrated in 1872, and it bears the name of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God.  After five months, they also consecrated the second throne, which was given the name of Alexander Nevsky.  This five-chapter cathedral was considered the most beautiful local building.  In 1906 trouble came to Syzran.  The city was engulfed in fire, but the majestic temple was not damaged at all.  And all thanks to the guard who managed to extinguish the flame, his tongues barely touched the fence of the holy place.  But some destruction nevertheless occurred.  The gatehouse and bell tower burned down.  In the thirties of the last century, the temple was closed.  During the war, believers defended him, and he was rediscovered. </p><h2>  Kremlin, but not Moscow </h2>

Many strive to get into this town and admire the local "celebrities".  One of these stars is the Kremlin.  Yes, Syzran also has its own complex under that name.  And the existence of the city began with him.  <span>By the decree of Peter I</span> in the XVII-XVIII centuries this monument of architecture was founded.  The territory where the town today is located, in former times was regularly attacked by nomadic tribes and robbers.  The village was weakly fortified.  Therefore, the Kremlin was bound to become a kind of fortification. </p><p>  Initially, there were five towers in it: four of wood and one of stone, which alone managed to survive to the present.  Many sights of Syzran were destroyed and failed to preserve their pristine grandeur to this day.  This remaining tower is called Spasskaya, and it served as the main gate of the Kremlin.  It has an unsurpassed hipped roof.  In 1717, the Church of the Nativity of Christ arose.  After a short period of time, they decided to rebuild it.  Today she is contemplated as she was reborn in 1730.  <span>The Syzran Kremlin</span> only once participated in combat battles.  This was when he was captured by the army of Emelyan Pugachev. </p><h2>  Song hits originally from Syzran </h2><p>  Tourists know that this is a beautiful and comfortable city.  And the sights of Syzran here are very different: from world famous to those that only locals know about.  If you turn off from the main city street into Proletarsky Lane and go down to the Krymska River, you will see an old and rather battered house.  There are no markings on it. </p><p>  Before the revolution, this house was the property of Hertz Simonovich Kristalinsky.  He was the grandfather of the famous singer <span>Maya Kristalinsky.</span>  Even during the First World War, Herz Simonovich moved to Syzran from Mogilev.  He handed over the apartment of his house to the tuner of musical instruments, Ilya Ilyich Ostrovsky.  After many years, Arkady, the son of Ilya Ilyich, will become a famous author of such hits as ‚ÄúThe Solar Circle‚Äù, ‚ÄúTired Toys Sleep,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Song Stays with a Man‚Äù and others.  It was in this inconspicuous house that the famous composer spent his childhood, under the lullaby of which more than one generation of children fell asleep. </p><h2>  All mansions mansion </h2>

    <p>  The amazing city of Syzran!  Sights, photos of which are in our review, can not remain indifferent.  But he is known for another architectural masterpiece.  Its name is the Sterletkin mansion.  Its construction took place during the years 1908-1914.  This is the most beautiful monument of Syzran architecture.  The customer of the construction was the merchant Sergei Sterlyadkin.  During construction work, the most innovative materials of the time were used: facing bricks and multi-colored tiles. </p>
