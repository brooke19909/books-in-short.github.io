    <p>  It is worth saying that all the fortresses and <span>castles of Ukraine</span> were built for defensive purposes and occupied a special place in the life of settlements and cities.  They were a support and hope in defense against enemies. </p><h2>  Belgorod-Dniester.  History </h2><p>  How early medieval settlements appeared on the site of the current Ukrainian city remains a mystery to scientists to this day.  Some of them believe that Slavic tribes built their homes on the site of the ruins of ancient Tyra.  Others suggest that the settlement was part of the <span>Bulgarian kingdom.</span>  But unequivocally ancient documents confirm the special importance of Belgorod for the defense of Kievan Rus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The heyday of the city came at the end of the 14th century.  At this time, it was part of the Moldavian kingdom as the main port and capital of the southern provinces.  At the same time, the construction of a powerful citadel was completed, which is currently an interesting monument of medieval defense architecture. </p><h2>  Fortress history </h2><p>  The fortification was erected in connection with the political instability that existed in this region.  What time was the Belgorod-Dniester fortress built?  The exact answer to this question does not exist.  Various versions are currently put forward.  Some scholars believe that the citadel is of Turkish origin, others - that it is Moldavian, and others - that it is Genoese.  They built the Belgorod-Dniester fortress for almost two hundred years.  The beginning of its construction dates back to the thirteenth century.  The construction was completed in the 15th century. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Throughout its history, the Belgorod-Dniester fortress amazed and delighted everyone with its impregnability and power.  The walls of the citadel are made of limestone.  There is a fortress on a rocky high bank of the Dniester estuary.  Its entire territory, which has the shape of an irregular polygon, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãjust over nine hectares.  The construction is located forty-six kilometers from Odessa, twenty kilometers from the Black Sea, on the right bank of the Dniester River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Belgorod Dniester fortress site" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/472766.jpg" width="595"></div>

At the same time, the architectural and structural features of its defensive line will become visible. </p><h2>  Dominated by the Turks </h2><p>  From the estuary and land on the Belgorod-Dniester fortress in 1484 an attack was carried out by the fifty-thousandth army of Mengli-Girey - the Crimean Khan.  Enemies filled the moat, dug trenches for the installation of artillery.  After that, the Turks went to storm the citadel.  The soldiers defending the fortress, despite desperate resistance, were forced to surrender the defensive structure to the enemy. </p><p>  The Belgorod-Dniester fortress fell under Turkish rule for three hundred and twenty-eight years.  During this period, the city was renamed.  His new name, Ackerman, meant "white stone." </p><p>  <span>The Akkerman fortress</span> in Belgorod-Dniester and during this period did not lose its great strategic importance.  The new authorities maintained the fighting condition of all the facilities located on its territory, reconstructed the existing defensive system, adapting it to the new requirements of military art. </p><p>  During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ukrainian Cossacks repeatedly made campaigns, during which attempts were made to drive the Turks out of the Akkerman fortress. </p><h2>  Fight for the city </h2><p>  <span>The history of the Belgorod-Dniester</span> fortress entered a new course only in the eighteenth century.  During this period, Russia became a major world-class power.  She has occupied an important place in the existing system of international relations.  The territory of Russia in the south was affected by events that occurred during the three wars with the Turks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Belgorod-Dniester was first captured by the troops of I.A. Igelstrem (brigadier general) in 1770. Russia made attempts to liberate the city in 1779 and 1806.  The assault of the fortress was carried out by the troops of G. Potemkin, part of the Black Sea Fleet F.F. Ushakov.  The citadel stormed M. Kutuzov.  However, the Belgorod-Dniester fortress provided opportunities for all-round defense and was practically impregnable.  To protect the castle, underground shelters and secret passages arranged in it were served, which until today have not been studied by anyone. </p>

    <p>  In 1812, the Bucharest Peace Treaty was signed.  According to this document, the entire territory located in the south of Bessarabia, went to Russia. </p><p>  The fortress lost its military purpose in 1832. In 1896, it gained the status of a historical and architectural monument. </p><h2>  Political and cultural life of the citadel </h2><p>  The Belgorod-Dniester fortress occupied a provincial position, being part of Russia.  However, at the same time, she did not stand aside from the cultural and <span>political life of the</span> country.  The city of Ackerman was visited by Pushkin in 1821. During this period, the poet was in southern exile.  Ackerman's guests were A. Mitskevich, M. Gorky, L. Ukrainka.  Many other artists have also visited this city. </p><p>  Ackerman was part of royal Romania (from 1918 to 1940).  During the Second World War, he was occupied by the Nazis.  On August 9, 1944, the city was renamed Belgorod-Dniester. </p><h2>  Architectural complex </h2><p>  The Belgorod-Dniester fortress, a tour through the territory of which will allow you to get acquainted with the history of military architecture, is a complex system with a huge number of building layers made from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century.  This structure is characterized by two rows of defensive walls. </p>

    <p>  On the map of the citadel, the division of the entire territory with the help of defensive walls into three courtyards is visible.  There are two gates in the fortress, three more are located inside between the courtyards. </p><p>  In the old days, thirty-five towers were built around the perimeter of the defensive structure, which were interconnected by curtains.  Currently, the Belgorod-Dniester citadel is a unique monument that introduces us to the defense architecture of the Middle Ages.  Fortress structures are distinguished by a wide variety of architectural solutions.  They were erected using construction equipment perfect for those times.  All this allows the citadel to be considered a valuable source of information about the past. </p><h2>  Genoese castle </h2><p>  It is believed that this structure was erected on the site of a wooden defensive post.  Genoese castle was the first object built in the fortress.  In terms of this citadel has the appearance of a quadrangle.  There are protruding towers in the corners of the castle.  One of them, northwest, collapsed as early as 1888. The walls of the citadel have an interesting location.  They are oriented to the cardinal points. </p>

    <p>  The surviving towers of the Genoese castle are multi-tiered; they have basements.  The roofs of these structures are hipped, tiled. </p><p>  Slit-like narrow loopholes are located in the towers, as well as in the walls of the citadel.  Along the entire perimeter of the castle in the old days there were three-tier battle galleries made of wood.  The completion of the walls were merlons. </p><p>  Each of the towers was assigned a role.  The prison was southwest.  The command was served by the southeast, the largest.  In it, in 1788, the Turks handed over to M. Kutuzov the keys to the fortress.  In the past, an emergency exit from the defensive structure was dug from the basement of the north-eastern tower.  The northwestern tower was given the role of a treasury. </p><h2>  Return to original appearance </h2><p>  Since 1960, systematic work has been carried out on the restoration of the Belgorod-Dniester fortress.  During this time, a protective belt of concrete and stone was built on the east side of the citadel.  He protected the walls from the destructive action of the waters of the estuary.  In addition, restoration work touched the main gate, minaret and two towers. </p>
