It literally imprinted all those eras through which he passed, and froze in the form of architectural monuments, in the ruins of ancient palaces and in the greenery of nature, which enveloped all this. </p><p>  We offer now to learn about the brightest and most popular sights of Tbilisi.  Our virtual tour will prepare you for a real trip, which will be incredibly interesting and exciting.  We note right away that our tour will consist of separate sights of Tbilisi and its environs, and of specific routes, which will be described in detail at the end of the article.  Go! </p><h2>  Narikala Fortress </h2><p>  If you came on an excursion to the Georgian capital or are visiting relatives and friends here, be sure to visit this wonderful place.  This attraction of Tbilisi is located in the very center of the city on the Holy Mountain, it is rightly considered the main pride of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="in.musafir.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fortress Narikala" class="if uuid-2444542" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444542.jpg"></div><p>  The fortress is an ancient architectural monument, the first mention of which dates back to the 4th century AD, although many historians claim that it stood there long before this date.  Here you will come across not only the unearthly beauty of an old building, but also with a unique energy, a kind of magical atmosphere, which is nowhere else on Earth.  As a bonus, a unique and bewitching view of the city of Tbilisi opens from the walls of the fortress.  The sights that you will see after Narikala, you will see from here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ethnographical museum </h2><p>  This place contains the entire centuries-old history of the people, architecture, life and <span>customs of Georgia.</span>  The attraction of Tbilisi with the modest and inconspicuous name "Ethnographic Museum" includes models of traditional houses of this people, interior items, tools and weapons that belonged to different eras.  All this is combined into a museum complex, the exhibits of which are located both indoors and outdoors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ge.igotoworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ethnographic Museum of Tbilisi" class="if uuid-2444610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444610.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, if you want to get to know better the Georgian people, their culture, traditions and way of life, then you should definitely visit this place in Tbilisi.  The attractions that are exhibited in the museum are really interesting and exciting.  By the way, the complex itself is located in Vake Park, which is located directly on the shore of Turtle Lake.  Therefore, having enjoyed the exhibits from the distant past, you can rethink everything by taking a walk along the clear water. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Of all the countries of the world that can boast a unique and breathtaking nature, Georgia is not in the last place.  There are <span>plenty of attractions</span> in <span>Tbilisi</span> that demonstrate, so to speak, the natural beauty of the city.  But the center of natural violence is the capital's botanical garden.  It presents over 3,500 rare plants that are collected in an incredibly harmonious and uniform ensemble, complemented by fountains, streams, ponds and even rocky cliffs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tbilisilocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tbilisi Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2444611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444611.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to look into the garden on hot summer days to breathe in the cool air and free your ears from the bustle of the city.  Here you can also walk along the beautiful bridge of <span>Queen Tamara,</span> which sags between the rocks, and feel like a piece of wildlife.  This unique landmark of Tbilisi is located in the city center, just behind the Narikala fortress.  The garden is open from Tuesday to Sunday, from 10 am to 6 pm. </p><h2>  Tsminda Sameba Cathedral </h2><p>  Let‚Äôs unanimously answer the simplest question: what to see in Tbilisi?  Sights of this city, however, as well as of the whole country, consist mainly in majestic and unique temples.  One of these is the Cathedral of <span>Tsminda Sameba,</span> or the Holy Trinity, which is located in the ancient district of Avlabari, which can be reached by metro or bus.  This building has long been the main symbol of the Georgian capital and, in combination, is the highest temple in the country - as much as 101 meters in height. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advantour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sameba Cathedral in Tbilisi" class="if uuid-2444615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444615.jpg"></div><p>  The temple itself is a work of art.  At first glance, its carved arches and portals catch on; the facades have a unique architecture, decorated with carvings and patterns.  All the walls of the cathedral are painted by ancient masters, and the most sacred here is the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was written by Patriarch Elijah II.  The altar presents a modern bible, hand-written in an ancient manner.  In a word, the temple has something to see.  The sights of Tbilisi and Georgia, we can say, are assembled here in a single whole, together with the history and religion of this people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lisi Lake </h2><p>  In the noisy, but very atmospheric and beautiful city, there is a mini-resort for summer holidays.  Indeed, why not organize a civilized vacation in a quiet, picturesque and very nice corner of nature?  You can simply come here to enjoy the beauties of the lake, take a break from the hustle and bustle, look at the calm water and think about the universe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.asthma.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lisi Lake, Tbilisi" class="if uuid-2444618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444618.jpg"></div><p>  But for those who prefer to relax actively, all conditions have also been created here.  There is a park on the Lisi shore, and a bath complex is attached to it.  Here you can go karting, play tennis or rent a boat to drive around the pond. </p><h2>  Sulfur baths Abanotubani </h2><p>  All routes of guides to the sights of Tbilisi do not lose sight of this interesting place.  Sulfur baths provide an opportunity not only to gaze at the old buildings, but also to relax both soul and body.  This is not a relic of the past, not ruins and not a rarity.  Baths, despite their age, still function perfectly and serve not only the residents of the city, but also tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trekearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sulfur baths Abanotubani" class="if uuid-2444609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444609.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚Äúchip‚Äù of the institution, of course, is the healing sulfuric springs, which, as you know, have beneficial effects on health and treat various ailments.  Among other things, the complex has many entertainment programs.  The facade of the buildings is made in oriental style, it is equipped with huge, high windows that illuminate all the interior. </p><h2>  Betania Monastery </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting sights near Tbilisi (about 16 km from the capital), which you need to visit to raise your spirituality.  The monastery was built in the XI century and is the personification of the temple architecture of that period.  Here you will see ancient frescoes depicting members of the royal family, icons with painted biblical scenes, a very artsy and beautiful altar, on which verses from the Psalter are crowded out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ge.igotoworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Betania Monastery" class="if uuid-2444636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444636.jpg"></div><p>  The building itself is located in a beautiful place - among the green mountains.  Therefore, pacification and tranquility here gives not only divine energy, but also nature itself. </p><h2>  Metekhi </h2><p>  This ancient district of the capital of Georgia attracts tourists from all over the world.  It was erected on the rock of Metekhi and spread out on the banks of the Kura River.  Of particular note is the old citadel - the castle in which the kings and their descendants had previously lived.  By the way, the walls of this fortress offer stunning views of the city and its surroundings.  Nearby is a no less beautiful temple, which, according to tradition, presents the whole history of God's word in murals and icons.  Entrance to the territory of the old complex is free, but keep in mind that it works from 9 am to 5 pm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="memontrip.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://memontrip.com/tours/one-day-sightseeing-tour-around-tbilisi/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Metekhi Temple" class="if uuid-2444645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444645.jpg"></div><h2>  Bridge of Peace </h2><p>  Well, we got to the modern sights of Tbilisi.  The reviews of travelers who have visited here prove that the Georgian capital is a city of contrasts.  And if earlier it was the embodiment of antiquity, now it has turned into a real "colossus", which contains everything in itself. </p><p>  The Bridge of Peace is thrown across the main river - Mtkvari.  This futuristic modern building connects the old city and the new apartments of Tbilisi.  From the bridge itself you can see a stunning panorama on which all the main attractions are clearly visible.  Most often, great photos are taken against such a background, especially in the evening. </p><div class="photo" data-original="agazaclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="peace bridge" class="if uuid-2444655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444655.jpg"></div><p>  An important feature of the bridge is its interactive illumination, which is located on the parapets of the structure.  With the help of Morse code, every hour there is a demonstration of one of the elements of the periodic table, which is contained in the human body.  So the creators wanted to demonstrate the unity of all people on the planet. </p><h2>  Rustaveli Avenue </h2><p>  If you are looking for a simple route to the sights of Tbilisi, then go to the famous Rustaveli Avenue.  Why exactly this street? </p><p>  Firstly, it is covered with spreading plane trees that give the desired coolness on hot summer days.  Secondly, the most popular bars, cafes and restaurants of the Georgian capital are concentrated here.  In them you can not only have a tasty lunch, but also get acquainted with the national cuisine, learn a lot of interesting things from the life of the local population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shota Rustaveli Avenue" class="if uuid-2444930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444930.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the sights of the old city of Tbilisi are concentrated here, such as the Opera and Ballet Theater, the Art Gallery and the National Museum, the Academy of Sciences, the Parliament building and much more.  It is also recommended to look into the local Borjomi store - you will be pleasantly surprised. </p><h2>  Funicular </h2><p>  This attraction cannot be called ancient, but it no longer draws on the modern one.  The funicular was built in 1905 and has been functioning perfectly to this day.  He carries people for 1 lari from the center of the capital to Mount Mtatsminda (Mount St. David).  The attraction gained wide popularity among the Soviet population after the release of the film "12 Chairs".  Now new trailers go along the route, so it has become comfortable to enjoy both the daylight, the sunshine of Tbilisi, and its night lights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tbilisilocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="funicular in Tbilisi" class="if uuid-2444931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444931.jpg"></div><h2>  Puppet theater </h2><p>  On Shavteli Street there is a real corner of a fairy tale - the Rezo Gabriadze Puppet Theater.  A visit to this institution will be interesting for both children and adults, it all depends on the performance you have chosen.  A feature of the theater is also considered its repertoire.  Even the simplest and most fun productions are filled with lyrics, sentimentality and, at the same time, deep meaning and morality.  All of them are like little magic that unfolds against the backdrop of a large and noisy city.  You can get there by buying tickets at the box office or by pre-booking them by phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tbilisilocalguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="puppet theater" class="if uuid-2444972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444972.jpg"></div><h2>  Cableway </h2><p>  There is no better way to spend the evening than to take a <span>cable car</span> ride <span>.</span>  This transport-attraction runs between Rike Park and <span>Narikala Fortress.</span>  Of course, a stunning panorama opens from the windows of the cabin - a city flooded with evening lights, and even reflected in a perfectly smooth river!  It is noteworthy that you can ride the "air" road in the afternoon, if you are suddenly tired of wandering the streets and want to see all the sights with one glance.  The attraction operates from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and a ticket for it costs only 1 lari. </p><h2>  Juma Mosque </h2><p>  The attraction, of course, is not entirely Georgian.  It is not the personification of the people or culture of this country.  But it is located in the city center and looks so beautiful that it is simply impossible to avoid.  Alas, you cannot get inside, so you have to inspect the building only from the outside.  The building is made of red brick, crowned with a minaret and a domed roof, which is completely covered with oriental patterns.  The most advantageous point for viewing the mosque is the observation deck by the mountain river with a waterfall, which are located nearby.  There you can enjoy nature and admire the eastern building in the middle of the Georgian city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Juba Mosque" class="if uuid-2444994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2444994.jpg"></div><h2>  Agmashenebeli Avenue </h2><p>  This place is not as popular among tourists as <span>Shota Rustaveli Avenue, which</span> is why it has its own special highlight.  By right, Agmashenebeli Avenue is considered one of the most beautiful man-made places in Georgia.  It is surrounded by houses that were built in the XVII-XIX centuries.  Narrow ‚Äúpurely Georgian‚Äù streets, which consist of cozy and cool courtyards, are adjacent to the avenue.  An indescribable atmosphere of antiquity reigns here, but not as distant as in cathedrals and palaces, but close, which, it seems, was only recently. </p><p>  By the way, experienced travelers know that Agmashenebeli is a great place for shopping.  You can find much more unique things here than in central stores, and they will cost an order of magnitude cheaper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Agmashenebeli Avenue" class="if uuid-2445055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/2445055.jpg"></div><h2>  Market "Dry Bridge" </h2><p>  At first glance, it might seem that this is a typical flea market where it‚Äôs hard to find a worthwhile and beautiful thing for yourself.  But it‚Äôs worth going into it, as you immediately realize that you‚Äôve got into a real open-air museum.  Moreover, only the most valuable exhibits are not deliberately presented here.  This, one might say, is a living exhibition of all Tbilisi life, life, traditions.  You can find everything on the shelves of the "Dry Bridge", from simple trinkets and souvenirs that are taken home as a keepsake, and ending with real antiques that can be sold abroad for a fortune. </p><p>  Tourists also note that you can not buy anything at the market, but just sit on a local bench and be imbued with the noises and conversations of a real, living Tbilisi.  It is here that the real atmosphere of the city reigns; its life, customs and manners of people are literally turned inside out. </p><h2>  Build a route </h2><p>  Tbilisi sightseeing guides offer tourists to use one of the standard routes.  This technique allows you to explore the main places of the city and enjoy its beauty with the least expenditure of energy, time and money. </p><ul><li>  Start - metro "Rustaveli", Freedom Square. </li><li>  Leselidze Street. </li><li>  Vakhtang Gorgasali Square. </li><li>  Abanotubani - Sulfur baths. </li><li>  Juba Mosque. </li><li>  Metekhi. </li><li>  Rike Park. </li><li>  <span>Cableway.</span> </li><li>  The fortress of Narikala. </li><li>  Bridge of Peace. </li><li>  Puppet theater. </li><li>  Baratashvili street. </li><li>  "Dry bridge". </li><li>  Tsminda Sameba. </li><li>  Avlabari Square. </li></ul><p>  This is one of the standard routes in the Georgian capital, which shows us the main central attractions of the city, its old streets and buildings.  And with a little orientation in the city, everyone will be able to build individual tours for themselves, based on what is interesting. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Tbilisi is an incredibly diverse, atmospheric and truly unique city.  It is like a violent clash of European and Asian cultures.  There are incredibly ancient castles and cathedrals that still retain their grandeur and beauty.  Along with them, objects designed by modern architects flaunt, which seem to push the city into the future.  All this is surrounded by incredibly beautiful nature and atmosphere, which can only be inherent in the Georgian city. </p>
