    <p>  Terry towels and a set of personal hygiene products are mandatory in the bathroom of each hotel room.  Suites and junior suites also include comfortable bathrobes and slippers.  Pets are allowed.  But only for a fee. </p><h2>  Guest reviews about rooms </h2><p>  Quite ambiguous opinions of guests - this is what the Algorithm Hotel is characterized by.  Kazan is a large metropolis with a huge number of hotels.  And for many of them, in terms of convenience, the Algorithm is inferior.  But the prices for accommodation here are very low. </p><p>  Some guests believe that a modern hotel, even an economy class, should look a little different and be more comfortable.  Other rooms are quite comfortable.  Most guests of the Algorithm Hotel do not like the dim lights in the rooms, dusty balconies, a small number of TV channels, and not particularly fast Wi-Fi.  Scolding many guests and noisy refrigerators in the rooms. </p>
