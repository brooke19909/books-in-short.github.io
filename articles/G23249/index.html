Talented patrons and connoisseurs of real Russian art decided to approach the object for storing water in a special way.  Today, the tower in Polybino enjoys great attention from lovers of beauty and history. </p><h2>  Unique place </h2><p>  The village of Polybino in the Lipetsk region is a unique historical place, a real islet of Russian culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gosobzor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor in Polybino" class="if uuid-2677822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677822.jpg"></div><p>  In this place on September 8, 1380, a battle took place between Prince Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy and the Golden Horde Khan Mamai, which went down in history as the Battle of Kulikovo.  Also here is a unique beauty park and the main attraction of the city - the Nechayev-Maltsev estate.  At one time, it was the main museum of the history of the Battle of Kulikovo.  Lev Nikolayevich <span>Tolstoy, Ivan</span> Konstantinovich Aivazovsky, Viktor Mikhailovich Vasnetsov, Ilya Efimovich Repin and others stayed and created their unforgettable masterpieces here. </p><h2>  About the owner of the tower </h2><p>  Nechaev-Maltsev Yuri Stepanovich - a real Russian philanthropist, diplomat, one of the twelve richest people in the second half of the XIX century.  He owned the estate until 1913. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="photobook33.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Stepanovich Nechaev-Maltsev" class="if uuid-2677826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677826.jpg"></div><p>  Yuri Stepanovich went down in history not only with his good deeds in politics, agriculture and everyday life, but also with a significant contribution to the development of Russian culture and art. </p><h2>  From the history </h2><p>  The tower was first presented at the All-Russian Exhibition on May 28, 1896 in Nizhny Novgorod.  The creator of the unusual design was Russian architect and engineer Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--80auud2a.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hyperboloid tower at the Russian exhibition" class="if uuid-2677834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677834.jpg"></div><p>  Yuri Nechaev-Maltsev was at the exhibition and immediately fell in love with this beauty as soon as he saw it.  There are historical photos of the Shukhov tower from the exhibition.  In Polybino, she was transported on October 1 at the request of the patron. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The Shukhov Tower in Polybino had no analogues of its kind.  Its structure is made up of three parts: a hyperboloid shell, a water tank and an observation tower.  The highest part is the mesh frame, the design of which is made according to the single-cavity hyperboloid principle of joining beams.  Eighty straight steel profiles are attached to the ring bases to the foundation.  The curved structure of the Shukhov Tower in Polybino is attached by 8 horizontal rings.  All elements of the mesh shell are connected by rivets.  A steel spiral staircase rises from the ground level where the foundation is located to the water tank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.photosight.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spiral staircase tower" class="if uuid-2677839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677839.jpg"></div><p>  A tin tank, which serves as a reservoir, connects the wireframe and the viewing tower.  Along the tank, a staircase and a cylindrical passage were designed for access to the top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.treefrog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shukhov Tower Reservoir" class="if uuid-2677853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677853.jpg"></div><p>  The viewing platform has two levels that are separated by a similar hyperboloid superstructure.  The first and second levels are connected by a straight vertical staircase. </p><h2>  Technical specifications </h2><p>  The height of the metal beams in the hyperboloid shell is 25.5 meters.  The total height of the Shukhov Tower in Polybino, together with the foundation, a water tank and a superstructure for viewing, is 37 meters.  At the base, the diameter of the ring is 10.9 m and the uppermost ring is 4.2 m. The diameter of the water tank is 6.5 m and the height of the tank itself is 4.8 m. The volume of the tank holds up to about 9.5 thousand buckets of water.  The observation deck in two levels, excluding protection and overlap, is 7 m. </p><h2>  About the constructor </h2><p>  Shukhov Vladimir Grigorievich - a famous Russian and Soviet architect and inventor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eschool.center" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shukhov Vladimir Grigorievich" class="if uuid-2677857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677857.jpg"></div><p>  With his work, he made a huge contribution to the development of the Russian oil industry.  He owns new methods of delivery and oil production in Russia - airlift.  Creation of the greatest pipelines in the country, oil hydraulics, tubular steam boilers.  In architecture, VG Shukhov‚Äôs single-cavity hyperboloid tower became a favorite design of representatives of the Futurism movement. </p><h2>  Known throughout Russia, the younger brother </h2><p>  Inspired by the success in the village of Polybino, Vladimir Grigorievich was preparing for a new triumph.  On February 14, 1922, in Moscow, on Shabolovka, under his leadership, a new Shukhov Tower was built, but it was no longer a water tower, but a radio communication tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ucrazy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The construction of the tower on Shabolovka" class="if uuid-2677885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677885.jpg"></div><p>  The new facility was built very hard, and in the process of its creation a terrible accident occurred.  But the fate of the giant was approved.  The height of the new tower was three hundred and fifty meters (it is 15 m higher than the Eiffel), and the weight is more than two thousand tons. </p><h2>  Restoration and restoration work </h2><p>  Both monuments were defenseless against the forces of nature and time.  But in Polybino, the Shukhov tower has survived even though it is much older. </p><p>  In 2012, the Ministry of Culture allocated funds for a new foundation, cleaning and painting.  The wood flooring was replaced with stone blocks, the rust was removed, and many fasteners were significantly strengthened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anechaev.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shukhov Tower in Polybino today" class="if uuid-2677875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677875.jpg"></div><h2>  Legends of the famous tower </h2><p>  Around the Shukhov Tower in Polybino there are various rumors and conjectures, but none of this has been documented.  Some historians claim that its design is so unique that the tower can be repeatedly assembled and disassembled.  If the Lipetsk tower can be disassembled and assembled, then this experience can be done again, including with the Shabolov design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum-msk.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shukhov Tower on Shabolovka" class="if uuid-2677862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98439/2677862.jpg"></div><p>  In 1896, the tower, bought by the philanthropist Nechaev-Maltsev at the exhibition, was dismantled and transported to Polybino.  But someone claims that the tower by V. G. Shukhov for Yuri Stepanovich was built from scratch already in the village. </p><p>  These disputes received wide resonance, because the construction on Shabolovka needs a good repair, but so far it has not been possible to find an effective method for replacing defective structures due to its enormous size. </p>
