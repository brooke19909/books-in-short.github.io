    <h2>  Who is he? </h2><p>  The question is quite logical, because I want to know who the real sea robber Charles Wayne was and how he deserved such attention to his person. </p><p>  So, in those days, the documents were not bad, so the date of birth of this person is unknown.  It is believed that this happened around 1680.  About his childhood and how he outlawed himself, no information was also preserved. </p><h2>  "Career" </h2><p>  The inhabitants of the New World spoke of Charles Wayne for the first time in 1716, after he and his comrades attacked Spanish ships, which were engaged in lifting silver from their galleons, which had sunk off the coast shortly before this during a terrible hurricane.  After a brutal slaughter organized by pirates, sailors from different countries began to feel horror when the brigantine “Ranger” appeared on the horizon, which became the flagship of the robber. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Charles Wayne knew how to make friends and choose companions, and the famous pirates <span>Jack Rackham</span> and Edward England were his quartermasters at different times.  The unquestioning submission of such notorious thugs only further increased the authority of the brigantine captain “Ranger” among adventurers of all stripes who fled to the colony, fleeing the rope waiting for them at home. </p><p>  When during the so-called War of the Spanish Succession, the English fleet and its command were forced to leave their base and fort in New Providence in the Bahamas, it was occupied by sea robbers.  One of the most influential among them was Wayne.  For several years, his team committed bloody attacks on merchant ships and residents of coastal cities.  After three years of a successful “career,” the pirate was captured.  The court was adjourned for various reasons, but in 1721 he was nevertheless executed by hanging at Gallows Point in Jamaica. </p>

    <h2>  The plot of the series </h2><p>  Events in the pirate television saga "Black Sails" takes place on the island of New Providence in 1715. </p><p>  After the departure of the British, he turned into a base of sea robbers of all stripes.  From time to time, the daughter of the important colonial official Eleanor Guthrie arrives there, who buys stolen goods from pirates for subsequent resale. </p><p>  The most influential person in New Providence is Captain Flint.  He is distinguished by cruelty and cunning, as well as the ability to weave intrigue.  Together with Eleanor, the pirate is developing a plan to create an independent state on the island that is not subject to the <span>British Empire.</span>  To do this, Flint needs to capture the Spanish galleon carrying innumerable treasures.  The other captains of Fort New Providence, including Charles Wayne, help him, and sometimes even enter into a cruel confrontation with him.  He is not inclined to always be on the sidelines, therefore he is waiting for an opportunity to declare himself. </p><p>  According to the authors of the picture, some episodes of the series were shot on the basis of the real "exploits" of Flint, Wayne and the like.  True, they were somewhat embellished and added special effects.  By the way, the work of those members of the Black Sails crew who were involved in ensuring the entertainment of the series did not go unnoticed by specialists.  In particular, the film received four nominations for an Emmy and won in two of them: for outstanding visual effects of the second plan, as well as for excellent sound editing. </p>
