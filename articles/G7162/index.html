  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magnificent Rome hotels welcome guests from all over the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Italy is a magnificent country, a visit to which cannot but be remembered.  This state provides great opportunities for relaxation - skiing in the Italian Alps, visiting the fun <span>Venetian carnival,</span> tasting the most delicious traditional dishes and wines in the Italian provinces, walking through Milan's fashionable boutiques and swimming in the azure <span>waters of the Adriatic Sea.</span>  But the most interesting way to spend a vacation in Italy is to visit the "eternal city", located on seven hills, the great Rome. </p><p>  Purpose of the trip </p><p>  In Rome, tourists will always find an exciting pastime.  This city is full of historical and cultural monuments, evidence of the highest level of development of the most ancient civilization.  Rome is one of the <span>most beautiful cities in Europe.</span> At first glance, it amazes its guests with the incredible contrast of its old streets and modern architecture.  Not far from each other there are cozy cafes decorated in a historical style, and modern business centers, ancient ruins from the times of the Great <span>Roman Empire</span> and fashion boutiques, as well as numerous hotels in Rome.  It is not surprising that many tourists who come to the capital of Italy once, certainly come back here, because, as the saying goes, "all roads lead to Rome." </p><p>  This amazing city hosts many excursions: from the ancient Colosseum to the ruins of the Temple of Venus, from the heart of this ancient city at the ruined building of the Roman Forum to the Pantheon, the great temple of all the gods.  The best way to get to know Rome is to take long and leisurely walks, which may include visits to some of the attractions - the Basilica of Emilia, the famous Thermae, Palatine Hill and the temple of one of the founders of the heart of Italy - Romulus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where to stay </p><p>  Even if you come to Italy for only a few days, it is worth thinking about visiting some of Rome's hotels and staying in one of them.  Believe me, this trip will not be limited to weekends - the capital of the country is so large and diverse that it will take several weeks to get to know it.  <span>Italian cities</span> generally provide a wide selection of hotels for every taste and budget.  If you don‚Äôt have enough money for expensive establishments, you can visit and evaluate the small family hotels in Rome, accommodation in which is not only much cheaper, but also much more comfortable. </p><p>  Unlike many others, hotels in Rome receive the most positive reviews, because in them, despite the high prices, excellent quality of service and, most importantly for tourists, the proximity to the most interesting corners of the city.  As a budget option, ‚ÄúBed &amp; Breakfast‚Äù - ‚Äúbed and breakfast‚Äù rooms can be suitable for spending the night when coming to the capital of Italy for the weekend. </p><p>  <span>The best hotels in Rome</span> are D'Inghilterra and Gladiatori Palazzo Manfredi.  The first is located most successfully - not far from the Spanish Steps and the fashionable Via dei Condotti, known far beyond the city limits.  It is here that guests can find the highest quality service, stylish surroundings and comfort.  It is very convenient that tourists, not far away from the hotel, can visit the most elegant restaurants in the Italian capital and stroll through designer boutiques.  The second most popular hotel - "Gladiatori Palazzo Manfredi" - is distinguished by the fact that it is located in the building of an old elegant villa and is, in fact, one of the many attractions of the "eternal city". </p><p>  So, a <span>vacation in Italy</span> can be truly fabulous.  The atmosphere of its great capital, the history that every building and every street breathes, and at the same time, the fast life style, the emotionality of the locals and the high comfort of accommodation provided by Rome hotels.  You still do not want to visit this city? </p>
