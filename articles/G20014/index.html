  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Yekaterinburg: photos with names and descriptions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yekaterinburg is a city on the eastern slope of the Middle Urals.  It is washed by the Iset River.  It was founded in 1723 by Catherine I as a factory for the manufacture of iron parts.  Already in 1781, it was a real city with the status of a county under the Perm province.  Today it is the fourth city in terms of population in the country.  Scientific and industrial center of the Urals.  Naturally, over the several centuries of existence in Yekaterinburg, many sights have appeared. </p><h2>  The brainchild of Peter's reforms and Soviet constructivism </h2><p>  It is not for nothing that the city is called so: Peter I invested a lot in it in order to strengthen the power of the Russian Empire, both military and commercial.  The need for metal was constantly increasing in the state, and even at that time Yekaterinburg had a large metallurgical base and huge potential. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prousadbi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stone treasure" class="if uuid-2331290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331290.jpg"></div><p>  In the Soviet period, the city was actively rebuilt, new enterprises and residential neighborhoods appeared.  It also introduced a characteristic feature of constructivism into the architectural appearance of the village.  Today, there are about 600 attractions in Yekaterinburg, and 43 of them even have federal status. </p><p>  In the city you can see architectural creations in the Baroque style, although he did not really take root in Yekaterinburg.  There are buildings in the style of classicism, English parks, electric and neoclassical creations.  Naturally, there is a typical monotonous development inherent in the Soviet period.  Now there are houses in the style of high-tech and neoclassicism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stone treasure </h2><p>  Few travelers come from the city of Yekaterinburg without a photo of the attraction - Sevastyanov‚Äôs Palace.  On the map, the palace (angular rotunda) appeared in 1829.  Only in 1960 did the building become the property of N. I. Sevastyanov, who was a college assessor.  After 6 years, Nikolai Ivanovich begins the reconstruction of the house, Paduchev A.I. acted as the architect of the work.Not only the details change in the building, but also a second gazebo, balcony, three-story loggia, front suite and a number of other changes that turn an ordinary house into a palace.  Sevastyanov was very fond and proud of his housing, there are many legends about this. </p><p>  One of them says that Nikolai Ivanovich several times filed a petition for applying gilding to an angular rotunda.  However, they refused him and for the last time they issued an order to attend church every day in cast-iron boots as a punishment for insolence and arrogance.  It‚Äôs good that the church was across the road.  Another myth says that Sevastyanov often sat on a bench across the road, admired his creation and asked passers-by: "Whose house is such a beautiful house?"  How true this is is not known. </p><p>  After the promotion, Nikolai Ivanovich moved to St. Petersburg.  The building houses the court, then the commissariat and offices.  Today it is listed in the cultural heritage of the country.  And in 2008, the relief of the house was minted on commemorative silver coins of the Central Bank.  The building is located at: Lenin Avenue, 35. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The estate of Rastorguev-Kharitonov </h2><p>  Most often, it is in the description of the sights of Yekaterinburg that the Rastorguev-Kharitonov estate is in the first place.  And not in vain, because this is the most outstanding building of the city, located on the Ascension Hill.  This is a whole complex of buildings with amazing shapes surrounded by beautiful vegetation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ekmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate of Rastorguev-Kharitonov" class="if uuid-2331329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331329.jpg"></div><p>  The estate was erected from 1794 to 1824 in the style of classicism.  And Mamin-Sibiryak D.N. called this structure an acropolis or the Kremlin.  The estate is famous not only for the building itself, but also for the palace and park ensemble.  The name of the building architect has not yet been established. </p><p>  The estate received its name due to the fact that at first it belonged to Lev Rastorguev, then P. Ya. Kharitonov, who was his son-in-law.  In those days, great balls were held in the house, weddings and other celebrations were celebrated.  At the same time, terrible things happened in the cellars - rebels were killed in their walls.  Later, the building was leased, in the 30s of the last century the estate was transferred to the Children's Home of Creativity.  At the end of the last century, numerous social events were held in the park.  In the park area there is a lake where ducks now live. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proehal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The estate of Rastorguev-Kharitonov" class="if uuid-2331343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331343.jpg"></div><p>  Another feature of the estate - the park is the only preserved object of garden park art in the city of the first half of the XIX century.  Now the object is assigned the status of federal significance.  Located on <span>Karl Liebknecht</span> Street 44. </p><h2>  House of the merchant Zheleznov </h2><p>  One of the most mysterious and attractive sights of the city of Yekaterinburg is the Zheleznov house.  It was built over 3 years, from 1892 to 1895.  Around this building are many legends.  They say that it is here that you can see ghosts that are hiding in the underpasses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ekb.tour52.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House of the merchant Zheleznov" class="if uuid-2331296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331296.jpg"></div><p>  The building itself was erected in a pseudo-Russian style.  On the facade there is a carving on bricks, very similar to wooden tiles.  In general, the house is very similar to a tower.  The name was given to the landmark in honor of the second owner, nothing is known about the first.  The building is listed as a cultural heritage site and is located on Rosa Luxemburg Street, 56. </p><h2>  Monastery in the tract Ganina Yama </h2><p>  Such photos of the sights of Yekaterinburg are practical for every guest of the city.  The Monastery of the Holy <span>Royal Martyrs</span> is one of the youngest shrines of the city - the main building was erected and consecrated in 2000. </p><p>  In Ganina pit, tragic events occurred - the royal family was destroyed.  At the end of the 20th century, pilgrims began to gather in this place, and in 1991 the first Poklonnaya Cross was erected and consecrated.  In 1992, the bishop procession was held here.  Thus, not only the monastery was born, but also the days of memory of the Royal Passion-Bearers.  The facility is located in the tract Ganina pit. </p><h2>  Area 1905 </h2><p>  This is the main street and a landmark of Yekaterinburg.  The area has existed for as many years as the city.  In its present form, it was formed by 1930.  In former times, it was the most central point of the city, on the eastern side was the building of the Mountain Chancellery, erected in 1739.  Almost 100 years later it was reconstructed. </p><p>  By about 1747, a wooden Epiphany church appeared on the square, and in 1774 a stone church appeared.  Later, Gostiny Dvor appears on the square (a new one is being built in the 20th century), the territory is laid out with paving stones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Area 1905" class="if uuid-2331351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331351.jpg"></div><p>  In the XIX century, this landmark of the city of Yekaterinburg (photo confirms) is replenished with the house of the Korobkov family, a little later - Savelyev and Shabalin.  At the end of the century, a male gymnasium, a bank building and the Tupikovs house were rebuilt.  In Soviet times, monuments inherent in time appeared on the square.  In the same period, a five-story building is being built. </p><p>  In our years, they are reconstructing the Korobkov‚Äôs house and paving stones, under which the graves of clergymen are found, the square is being cleaned.  Today, the square is the heart of the city, where life boils even at night.  And in the district, banks, restaurants, administrative buildings and shops are located in a tight ring. </p><h2>  Temple in honor of the ascension </h2><p>  It turns out great photos of the sights of Yekaterinburg after a trip to the Ascension Church.  After all, this is one of the oldest shrines of the city.  The church was founded and consecrated in 1770. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sobory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple in honor of the ascension" class="if uuid-2331300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331300.jpg"></div><p>  For about 18 years, the shrine was wooden, but the building quickly wore out, and a decision was made to build a stone monastery.  Later it was rebuilt several times.  In 1926, the church was closed and a school was placed in it.  In 1991, the temple was returned to the faithful.  The facility is located on Voznesenskaya Square, 1. </p><h2>  White Tower </h2><p>  There is a landmark in Yekaterinburg called the White Tower.  This is an ordinary water tower, built in the style of constructivism.  It was built in 1926 along with the <span>Ural Heavy Engineering Plant.</span>  The initial project involved the construction of a tower made of reinforced concrete, but there were no specialists of this profile in the city, and partly it was made of metal.  The first launch was in 1931, but everything went wrong - the tank broke, about 750 cubic meters of water spilled. </p><p>  Immediately a decision was made to remake the tank into a reinforced concrete structure, and it all worked.  A little later, the whole tower was painted with white lime, hence the popular name ‚ÄúWhite Tower‚Äù appeared.  By the way, there are similar structures not only in our country, but also beyond its borders.  For example, in China, a similar tower is installed near one of the dairy factories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.openarium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White Tower" class="if uuid-2331307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331307.jpg"></div><p>  Now N. Kuznetsov‚Äôs ecological path passes through this construction.  It is an interesting fact that at the time of the construction of the tower it was the largest object of this type in the whole world.  The name "White Tower" took over the annual architectural festival held in Yekaterinburg. </p><h2>  Sverdlovsk triangle </h2><p>  Of course, this place cannot be called a landmark of Yekaterinburg, but lovers of tickling their nerves, carried away by mysticism, come here.  On the way to the Novo-Sverdlovsk TPP, near Lake Shartash there is a triangle on the road where, according to eyewitnesses, incredible things happen.  Ghosts rush under the wheels of cars, and at night an incomprehensible glow and lights appear.  Some people claim that they found here the remains of certain creatures that are very reminiscent of ancient dinosaurs.  On the side of the road often find trees that are not felled by a lumberjack. It seems that they are bitten by the teeth of a huge animal.  After sunset, the locals try not to drive, much less to walk along this road.  The facility is located on the street Donbass, 1. </p><h2>  Novo-Tikhvin cloister </h2><p>  There is a photo with a description of the sights of Yekaterinburg - the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in any guide.  You cannot keep silent about this temple, because these are strict and perfect shapes, the highest spire of the dome.  On the approach to the church, it seems that he was in St. Petersburg, which is famous for such holy places. </p><p>  Novo-Tikhvin monastery appeared in 1838, the famous architect Mikhail Malakhov was engaged in design work.  The whole building is designed in the style of classicism.  Construction work lasted as long as 10 years.  According to Soviet tradition, in 1921 the monastery at the temple was closed, and in 1930 the church itself stopped working.  The building was used for administrative purposes, and the cemetery was completely destroyed and looted.  Only in 1991, the shrine was returned to believers.  And quite recently, the temple and the surrounding area were completely reconstructed and landscaped.  The facility is located at Green Grove Street 1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="perevalnext.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Devil's hillfort" class="if uuid-2331314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331314.jpg"></div><h2>  Park areas of the city </h2><p>  The city has a lot of parks, squares and recreation areas. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Arboretum </p></td><td><p>  At the intersection of March 8 and Kuibyshev streets </p></td><td><p>  Created in 1932, the total area is 7.5 hectares, with two ponds and a winter garden on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã300 square meters </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  TsPKiO named after V.V.

You can visit the skating rink in the Central Park of Culture and Arts, the skating rink at the Rainbow Park shopping center, at the Himmash, Turbinka, Yunost stadiums and others. </p><p>  If you want to go skiing, then several ski resorts are at the service of vacationers: </p><ul><li>  "Deciduous Mountain", the city of Berezovsky, 25 kilometers from the ECAD; </li><li>  "Mount Teplaya", Siberian tract, 57, the city of Pervouralsk, 50 kilometers from the city center; </li><li>  Uktus, Zimnaya street, 27; </li><li>  base "Nizhneisetskaya", Stakhanova street, 65. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ural-n.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Land art sculpture Monument to the keyboard" class="if uuid-2331318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2331318.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern Art </h2><p>  The capital of the Urals has many modern monuments that are worth seeing.
