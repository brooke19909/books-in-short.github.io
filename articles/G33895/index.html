    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting that many tourists prefer the hotel "Riviera" (Sochi) for their sea holidays.  Reviews about this institution contain such positive comments: </p><ul><li>  well-equipped access to the hotel; </li><li>  pleased that the hotel is located in close proximity to the sea; </li><li>  It is located near the city center, surrounded by cafes and restaurants; </li><li>  friendly and polite staff;  the rooms are very well cleaned; </li><li>  I am glad that the room has a refrigerator; </li><li>  next to the hotel is a large, beautiful park; </li><li>  exit from the rooms located on the ground floor leads directly to the street; </li><li>  maids do not clean rooms when it is convenient for them, but only when you leave the keys with the corresponding request at the reception; </li><li>  fairly budget prices for accommodation in rooms; </li><li>  from the windows of the rooms a beautiful view of the sea; </li><li>  Superior rooms have new plumbing. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the guests of the Riviera hotel highlight the following shortcomings in the work of this institution: </p><ul><li>  plumbing is leaking into the shower room, and due to poor ventilation, a very stale smell and mold; </li><li>  on the walls of some rooms hang carpets that not only spoil the appearance, but also smell disgusting; </li><li>  there is no makeup in the bathroom, and even paper is not put on the toilet; </li><li>  the hotel always has some kind of confusion with the reservation, and therefore you can’t be sure that you will check into the reserved room; </li><li>  the soundproofing in the rooms is simply terrible, and therefore not only noise from the restaurant, but also voices from neighboring rooms will interfere with your sleep; </li><li>  TV shows just disgusting: all channels hiss; </li><li>  despite the fact that free wireless internet is claimed, it almost never works; </li><li>  on the territory of the hotel for some reason it very poorly picks up the signal of a mobile phone; </li><li>  most outlets in the room do not work; </li><li>  the rooms have bare wires under voltage, and therefore it is quite dangerous to be here for children; </li><li>  a drain is clogged in the shower, and therefore, while you are swimming, a large puddle forms, which can flow into the room; </li><li>  in the rooms that are located on the ground floor, the windows do not open, and therefore it is very stuffy there; </li><li>  the towels provided by the guests are not only old but incredibly small; </li><li>  on the windows of some rooms - cracked glass, which is quite traumatic. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Fairly high cost of living are characterized by hotels near the <span>beach.</span>  <span>Riviera</span> (Sochi) is a kind of exception.  Prices by local standards are quite affordable, and the sea is visible from the windows of the rooms.  Nevertheless, for a reduced price you will have to pay in comfort.  The rooms are absolutely minimalistic in that there is a fairly small set of furniture and amenities.  But given that tours to Sochi are mainly bought by lovers of sea holidays, who spend little time in the rooms, then these conditions are quite suitable for an overnight stay. <br><br>  The main disadvantage of this institution can be considered that there is a club with a disco on its roof.  Here music plays loudly until the morning, and therefore guests here are simply impossible to fall asleep.  That is why it is not recommended to come here with young children.  But young people who like bright entertainment, but can not afford an expensive hotel, have a good time here.  It is also worth noting the advantageous location near the beach and a huge amusement park.  In the immediate vicinity there are a huge number of cafes, shops and other infrastructure entertainment facilities. </p>
