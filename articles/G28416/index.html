  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uesugi Kenshin - Etigo Dragon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Japan is an amazing country, and this could not but affect its historical figures.  A striking example of this is Uesugi Kenshin.  He, who became a hero and a <span>great commander,</span> amazes modern scientists not only with his talent as a strategist, but also with the fact that even after death he has the power to create intrigue.  It lies in the fact that it is not known for certain whether Uesugi Kenshin was a woman or still a man.  Be that as it may, his life left a tangible mark in Japanese history. </p><h2>  From the youngest son to the head of the clan </h2><p>  From a young age, Uesugi Kenshin was not considered as the leader of the clan, since the family of the famous warrior Nagao Tamekage had three more eldest sons who claimed this role.  Uesugi, and then he was still called Toratiya, was educated in the monastery.  At the age of 14, a sharp turn in fate awaited him - the death of his father and the appointment of an older brother as leader of the family, which did not suit the rest of the clan members, since this was preceded by the murder of all rival brothers.  Young Toratia, in order to avoid the fate of two older brothers, enlisted the support of a local feudal lord and waged a continuous struggle with a relative for several years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Uesugi Kenshin" class="if uuid-2605423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2605423.jpg"></div><p>  Ultimately, having defeated his brother's troops, the 17-year-old heir of the samurai led one of the most powerful clans in the province of Etigo.  This played a large role in the further subjugation of the entire province.  At this time, he began to bear the name of Kagator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How Kagetora became Kenshin </h2><p>  Soon after the clan in Etigo passed under the control of Nagao Kagetora, in 1551 Uesugi Norimasa, who was affected by the Hojo Udziyasu attack, asked for his defense.  Kagetora turned out to be so hospitable and generous master that Norimasa revealed a desire to adopt a young warrior, thus giving him the name of a kind - Uesugi.  Together with the name, the lands of Kanto passed under his rule. </p><p>  Eight years later, Uesugi Kagetora paid a visit to Kyoto to legalize his name.  The shogun Kyoto also gave him the opportunity to use a character from his name.  This great privilege was awarded only to outstanding personalities in Japan of those times.  Thus, the name of the hero again began to sound different: Uesugi Terutora. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uesugi Kenshin Samurai" class="if uuid-2610786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2610786.jpg"></div><p>  The final version of the name received after the commander turned into a monk.  From 1561 until his death, his name was Uesugi Kenshin. </p><h2>  Protecting the province from Takeda Shingen </h2><p>  The period of turmoil in Japan was characterized by constant attacks of one feudal lord on another.  The first adversary that Kagetor faced as governor of Etigo province was Takeda Shingen, who stopped his army on the border of the samurai estate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="lasamurai.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uesugi Kenshin's death" class="if uuid-2606339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2606339.jpg"></div><p>  Opponents turned out to be worthy of each other, since they had to measure their strength over the years 1553-1564 five times - no one wanted to concede.  But against the backdrop of hostility, these two experienced feelings of deep respect for each other.  Despite the fact that the Japanese commander was in a state of protracted war with his adversary, he more than once showed nobility towards him, for which he earned respect from other enemies, such as Samurai Khodze, who said that after his death he would entrust the care of his Uesugi‚Äôs family only. </p><h2>  What battles have the armor of Uesugi Kenshin seen </h2><p>  The samurai was not only a good governor and master of his lands - he was also an excellent strategist, which allowed him to significantly expand his possessions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uesugi Kenshin Monument" class="if uuid-2605420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2605420.jpg"></div><p>  In the period from 1560 to 1577, he waged bloody wars with the provinces of Etu and Noto.  Most of these territories were subdued by Uesugi Kenshin, difficulties arose only with the main castle of Noto province - Nanaodze.  In 1577, thanks to the cunning of the enemies, he lifted the siege of the castle and hastened to help in his native lands, and during this time the conquered territories returned to the control of the previous owners.  But their triumph was not long, since in the same year the siege of Nanaodze was renewed and the castle fell under the onslaught of Kenshin, thereby securing the power of the samurai on the lands of Noto. </p><h2>  The Death of the Dragon from Etigo </h2><p>  As a rule, great warriors spend even the last hour of their lives with weapons in their hands and on the battlefield.  But fate has prepared Uesugi Kenshin another scenario.  In 1577, the close samurai found the insensible body of their leader in an inappropriate place for such a moment - a restroom.  The initial version of Uesugi Kenshin's death was a bowel disease, but later, in order not to undermine the authority of the great military leader, another version appeared, according to which he fell victim to hired ninja killers. </p><h2>  The mystery of the personality of the samurai from Etigo </h2><p>  Uesugi Kenshin left not only material legacy (a talented military leader seized a lot of land), but also a big intrigue about his gender.  To this day there are discussions about who <span>this samurai was: a</span> man or a woman.  A point in this matter could be given by a study of Kenshin‚Äôs body and grave, but, unfortunately, the data on the burial place were lost or hidden by the clan‚Äôs representatives in order to avoid its disbandment. </p><p>  In favor of the fact that a woman won all the great battles, several facts speak at once: </p><ul><li>  Some images, including self-portraits, hint at the feminine nature of Uesugi. </li><li>  The commander avoided the marriage all his life and did not have children, although his relations with the fairer sex were warm and friendly, but not a single acquaintance ended in romance. </li><li>  Kenshin himself identified with Bisyamonten - the god of war and the keeper of the treasures of the world.  In the sanctuary of the beloved samurai castle, a statue was installed to this deity, which had obvious female signs, which gave rise to some speculation. </li><li>  Modern scientists suggest that the disease that knocked down the commander was associated with inflammation of the female genital organs.  This is also supported by historical records of the time, which indicate that each month Kenshin suffered from some kind of ailment, which passed after a couple of days. </li><li>  Samurai's literary preferences also raised doubts about his gender.  According to contemporaries, he could be found reading a novel about feelings and relationships. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="therovingroninreport.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wesugi kenshin was a woman2" class="if uuid-2606329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2606329.jpg"></div><p>  Now it‚Äôs not so important who Wesugi Kenshin was in the time of troubles, his instructive influence on descendants is much more important.  By his example, he showed that a warrior should possess not only courage and courage, but also nobility, human dignity. </p>
