The most famous physicists of the USSR</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Scientific research in the Soviet Union was carried out in droves.  Employees of countless research institutes and laboratories worked day and night for the benefit of ordinary people and the country as a whole.  The Academy of Sciences carefully monitored how technicians, humanities, mathematicians, chemists, physicians, biologists, geographers cut through the fog of obscurity. </p><p>  However, special attention was paid to physicists. </p><h2>  Physics Branches </h2><p>  The most important areas, which often had great privileges, were astronautics, aircraft construction, and the creation of computer technology. </p><h2>  Father of Soviet Physics </h2><p>  There have been many famous scientists in history.  The list titled ‚ÄúThe Most Famous Physicists of the USSR‚Äù is opened by the vice-president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, academician <span>Ioffe Abram</span> Fedorovich.  The scientist created the famous school, which at various times graduated from many talented graduates.  It is no accident that Abram Fedorovich is an eminent Soviet physicist, one of those who are called the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of this science. </p>

    <p>  The future scientist was born in 1880 in Romny, near Poltava, in the family of a merchant.  In his native village, he received secondary education, in 1902 he graduated from the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology, and another three years later - University in Munich.  The future "father of Soviet physics" defended the work of William Conrad Roentgen himself.  It is not surprising that at such a young age, Abram Fedorovich received the title of Doctor of Sciences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After graduation, he returned to Petersburg, where he began working at a local polytechnic.  Already in 1911, the scientist made the first important discovery - he determined the charge of an electron.  The career of a specialist quickly went up, and in 1913 Ioffe received the title of professor. </p><p>  The year 1918 is significant for history in that, thanks to the influence of this scientist, the Faculty of Physics and Mechanics was opened at the Institute for the Study of Radiology.  For this, Ioffe subsequently received the unofficial title "father of the Soviet and Russian atom." </p><p>  Since 1920, he is a member of the Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  For his long career, Ioffe was associated with the Committee of the Petrograd Industry, the Association of Physicists, the Agrophysical Institute, the House of Scientists in St. Petersburg, and the Semiconductor Laboratory. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, he headed the commission of military equipment and engineering. </p><p>  In 1942, the scientist lobbied for the opening of a laboratory in which nuclear reactions were investigated.  It was located in Kazan.  Its official name is Laboratory No. 2 of the USSR Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  Who is most often called the ‚Äúfather of Soviet physics‚Äù is Abram Fedorovich! </p><p>  The professor died on October 14, 1960 in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  In memory of the great scientist, busts, memorials were erected, memorial plaques were opened.  His name is given to a planet, street, square, school in his native Romny. </p><h2>  Crater on the moon - for merit </h2><p>  Who is called the ‚Äúfather of Soviet physics‚Äù is another prominent scientist - Leonid Isaakovich Mandelstam.  He was born on April 22, 1879 in Mogilev in an intelligent family of a doctor and pianist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  From childhood, young Leonid was attracted to science, loved to read.  He studied in Odessa and Strasbourg. </p><p>  Who is called the "father of Soviet physics"?  The man who made the maximum possible for this science. </p><p>  Leonid Isaakovich in 1925 began his scientific career at Moscow State University.  Thanks to the efforts of the scientist, the faculty of physics and mathematics resumed their activities at the university. </p><p>  The most famous work of Leonid Isaakovich was the study of light scattering.  For such an activity, the Indian scholar Chandrasekhara Raman received the Nobel Prize.  Although he repeatedly stated that it was the Soviet physicist who conducted this experiment almost a week earlier. </p><p>  There was no scientist in 1944 in Moscow. </p><p>  The memory of Leonid Isaakovich is immortalized in busts, memorials. </p><p>  In honor of the scientist named a crater on the far side of the moon. </p><h2>  Author of a textbook on which more than one generation has grown </h2><p>  Landsberg Grigory Samuilovich - the one who is called the "father of Soviet physics."  He was born in 1890 in Vologda. </p><p>  In 1908 he graduated from high school with a gold medal in Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  In 1913 he graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Department of Moscow University.  He began his career with teaching at this university. </p><p>  He also worked at the Omsk Agricultural, Moscow Physical-Technical and Technical Institutes. </p>

    <p>  In 1923 he received the title of professor. </p><p>  The main works are studies of optics and spectroscopy.  He discovered the method of spectral analysis in various metals and alloys, for which in 1941 he was awarded the State Prize. </p><p>  He is the founder of the Institute of Spectroscopy of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the school of atomic spectral analysis. </p><p>  Grigory Samuilovich was remembered by schoolchildren as the author of the Elementary Physics Textbook, which survived repeated reprints and was considered the best for many years. </p><p>  There was no scientist in Moscow in 1957. </p><h2>  1978 Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics </h2><p>  <span>Peter Leonidovich Kapitsa</span> was born on June 26, 1894 in the city of Kronstadt in the family of a military engineer and topographer.  After graduating from the Kronstad school, he entered the St. Petersburg Polytechnic at the Faculty of Electromechanics.  The first supervisor of the future scientist was Abram Fedorovich Ioffe. </p><p>  During the First World War, Kapitsa was a volunteer on the battlefield - he worked as a driver of a medical machine. </p><p>  After demobilization, he began work at the X-ray and Radiological Institute, where he published his first work as an employee. </p><p>  In 1921 he went to further training in the UK, in Cambridge, where <span>Ernest Rutherford</span> himself was its supervisor <span>.</span> </p><p>  The fame of the scientist was brought about by his studies of strong electromagnetic fields.  In 1922, Petr Leonidovich defended his doctoral dissertation.  In 1929, Kapitsa became a member of the Royal Society of London.  At the same time, he was elected in absentia to the USSR Academy of Sciences. </p><p>  In 1930, the personal laboratory of Peter Leonidovich was built. </p><p>  The scientist never forgot his homeland and often came to visit his mother and other relatives. </p>

    <p>  In 1934 there was an ordinary visit.  But Kapitsa was no longer released back to England, citing his help to foreign enemies. </p><p>  In the same year, a physicist was appointed director of the Institute of Physical Problems.  In 1935, he moved to Moscow and received a private car.  Almost immediately, construction began on a laboratory similar to the English one.  Project financing was almost unlimited.  But the scientist repeatedly noted that the conditions were much inferior to English. </p><p>  In the early 1940s, Kapitsa's main activity was aimed at obtaining liquid oxygen. </p><p>  In 1945, he took part in the creation of the Soviet atomic bomb. </p><p>  In 1955, he was in the development team of the first artificial satellite of our planet. </p><h2>  Bright work </h2><p>  For the work "Plasma and controlled thermonuclear reaction" in 1978, the academician received the Nobel Prize. </p><p>  Petr Leonidovich is a laureate of many awards and prizes.  His contribution to science is truly invaluable. </p><p>  The famous scientist did not become in 1984. </p>
