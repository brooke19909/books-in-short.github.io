It is no coincidence that solitary confinement is considered one of the worst <span>forms of punishment.</span>  We are attracted to others, but does interaction always work out well?  Of course, in each case there are features, but in general the success of our communication depends on whether adaptation to the norms of society, that is, the socialization of the individual, has occurred.  In this article you will read about the <span>factors of socialization of the</span> individual. </p><p>  In general, this process is considered from two sides.  A person is affected by his environment and significant people from this environment.  Such important ‚Äúdevelopment stimulants" are called "microfactors of personality socialization."  However, they look at the problem more widely, evaluating the influence of society as a whole on socialization.  These incentives are called "macro-factors of socialization of the individual."  Let us consider in more detail all the factors. </p><p>  Let's start with microfactors, they are especially relevant in early childhood. </p><p>  The first factor is socio-emotional development.  A small child goes through a stage at which he absolutely needs to solve communication problems.  This is as important for the baby as it is for the student to grow intellectually, solving mental problems.  The constituent part of ‚Äúsocio‚Äù in this term means that a child should receive basic communication skills with two or more children.  Moreover, the interaction of children is different from communication between a child and an adult.  In relation to equal children remain individualists, only adults can force them to look from the side at their own behavior.  Development at this stage ensures successful socialization in the future.  What does the baby need to be able to do?  Form a balance between independence and discipline.  And also he must learn to acquire the qualities of the environment around him.  This is mainly due to the tendency of the child to imitate the qualities of peers or adults that are interesting to him. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Authoritative adults can be family and parents (second factor).  Of course, families are different nowadays, new forms are emerging.  However, the importance of a small immediate society remains the same.  In each family, different roles, patterns of behavior and expectations regarding the baby are created.  Often different parents are surprised at each other's approach and requirements.  Ethnic factors also influence the pattern of expected behavior - in a Chinese family, the requirements will be completely different from those in, for example, the American one.  This factor is the most important, since it is in the family that values ‚Äã‚Äãare transmitted, and the interaction takes the longest time. </p><p>  When a child becomes a schoolboy, teachers begin to influence him.  But not all, but only loved ones.  Such a teacher becomes a model, and schoolchildren often even fall in love with teachers, so the latter must be very tactful in communication.  The third factor is teacher stimulation <span>of personality development.</span> </p><p>  At the stage of secondary and high school, maximum importance is gaining popularity among peers.  Therefore, many teenagers begin to learn worse - the ability to build relationships becomes subjectively more important than the knowledge given by the teacher.  That is, the fourth factor is the influence of peers.  Paradoxically, a teenager wants to belong to an authoritative group, this helps him to express his personality, because only the group has someone to demonstrate skills. </p><p>  However, let us consider macro-factors of <span>personality socialization.</span>  The theory of functionalism asserts that the main factor of socialization is society‚Äôs expectation of a person to fulfill a certain role, and the norms that a person learns and the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat he borrows allow him to fit harmoniously into society.  <span>The theory of conflict</span> considers all <span>social interactions of</span> individuals as a competitive struggle for an advantage.  And the main factor is the desire for personal excellence. </p><p>  One factor cannot be considered predominant, all of them make us people of society, therefore, in the process of raising a child and adolescent, it is necessary to know the "keys" to the successful adaptation of a small person in society to help him in this difficult task. </p>
