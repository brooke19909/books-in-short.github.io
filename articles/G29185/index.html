This is necessarily a beautiful sandy or sandy-pebble beach, which is pushed by the warm waves of the Mediterranean Sea.  A light breeze that brings life-giving coolness to the shining shore.

All this is found by tourists coming to Alara Park Residence Hotel. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel buildings are surrounded by emerald green palm trees.  Everything is drunk with the aroma of a pine forest and citrus trees.  Nothing violates the silence and does not interfere with the rest of the guests.  The nearest airport is about 100 km away.  Alanya is the beautiful heart of Antalya, a 20-minute drive away, and the Avsallar settlement is a half-hour leisurely walk.

The name of this beach, with a length of more than 7 km, is fully consistent with its name.  Finer sand is nowhere to be found.  The beach is just perfect for a family holiday, not only by the coastal territory, but also by a convenient entrance to the water.  The sea is so clear that every grain of sand is visible at the bottom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alara Park 5 Turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43719/1448081.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Breakfast is an introduction to a new day.  Do not be surprised if you are offered a large number of high-calorie dishes and do not give your beloved coffee.

Coffee in Turkey for breakfast is not accepted. </p><p>  You can, of course, go to the cafe in the morning and cheer up with the usual mug of drink with puff pastry with minced meat or with freshly baked buns stuffed with olives. </p><p>  For lunch, it is worth ordering soup.

And all the more it is pleasant to accept the offer of the owners of Alara Park 5 * (Turkey) and visit each restaurant for free once during a vacation, after tasting various dishes there. </p><p>  Small sweet tooth (and not only small ones) must visit a candy store.
