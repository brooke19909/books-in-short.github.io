Sights of France: medieval castles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ancient castles of the world seem to carry visitors several centuries ago.  One would like to imagine himself a beautiful marquise or a gallant viscount, or even a brave knight, ready to fight in the tournament for the look and smile of a lady of the heart ... The word "chateau" in French has many meanings.  This is a harsh feudal fortress somewhere on a cliff, and a nice estate surrounded by a garden and landlords' outskirts, and a grandiose palace with fountains, ponds and parks.  But because Caribus in the Pyrenees, Trianon in Versailles and Rambouillet near Paris - it's all a "chateau."  Each of these objects performed its functions, and now all of them are unique sights of France.  Many of them now have museums.  And some still serve for ceremonial receptions of the first persons of other states.  In this article we will talk about the interesting castle of Chenonceau (France).  It is one of the three in the Loire Valley that must be visited by tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Ancient castles in France - more than enough.  Each region has its own characteristics in the construction of defensive strongholds and magnificent palaces.  However, there are two provinces where the density of the "chateau" per square kilometer just rolls over.  This is Ile de France with Paris and its suburbs and the Loire Valley.  This last region is famous for fine wines and goat cheese.  But even more - with their locks.  That is why UNESCO has included the Loire Valley - from Sally to Chalon - on its World Heritage List.  Excursions in France cannot ignore this region.  Most of the chateau here dates back to the Renaissance.  This is an elegant mix of a country residence and an <span>impregnable fortress.</span>  The buildings are distinguished by splendor, beauty, but they are surrounded by a moat, and sometimes powerful walls.  Aristocrats and kings lived here, and therefore luxury (and well-grounded fears for their safety) is understandable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Historical monuments of France and the Loire Valley </h2><p>  In this country, there are about three hundred castles that deserve attention.  Even if some of them are ruins, their eventful history makes them very interesting.  The most recognizable is the Chateau Cheverny.  We have known him since childhood - after all, it was he who became for Disney a prototype of the cartoon dwelling of princesses.  In <span>the Loire Valley,</span> castles of Europe were erected in different periods.  So Brese, built in the eleventh century as a fortress, was alternately a citadel, a country residence, a palace and, finally, in the nineteenth century a hunting lodge.  A mandatory excursion program to the castles of the Loire includes a visit to Chambord.  It is believed that Leonardo da Vinci created his architectural plan: the Renaissance titan was then in the service of King Francis I and lived in neighboring Amboise.  But it is known for certain that the artist completed his famous "Mona Lisa" here. </p>

    <h2>  Exposition of the castle of Chenonceau </h2><p>  The chateau that interests us is famous for its collection of medieval tapestries, carpets and antique furniture.  Here lived the spouses and mothers of the monarchs of France, as well as their uncrowned favorites.  Therefore, Chenonceau is often called the "Castle of the Beautiful Ladies."  <span>Diana Poitiers,</span> Louise Dupin and Catherine de Medici wove their fates into the walls of these exquisite creations of architecture.  Many castles (including those located in the Loire Valley) have museums in France.  Do not forget that the famous Louvre was not built as an art gallery, but first as a feudal fortress.  To verify this, just go down to the basement of the museum.  The thickness of the walls of the medieval Louvre is impressive.  Then it was the residence of the king, abandoned for the brilliant Versailles.  Chenonceaux also houses a museum - not only tapestries, but also wax figures.  There is also a small art gallery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Chenonceau Castle and its neighbors </h2><p>  Chateau Chenonceau for over seven hundred years.  But, despite such a respectful age, it was never truly a defensive structure.  By the year 1243 they managed to forget about the wild Normans tormenting these lands at the turn of the millennium.  The villages that once hid on elevations began to crawl to the roads.  Therefore, Chenonceau, popularly called the "Ladies' Castle", occupies a convenient place directly on the Cher River, a tributary of the Loire.  If you are interested in the period of the early Middle Ages, then welcome to the neighboring ch√¢teau Lange - the oldest in these places.  Ancient castles of the world are not uncommon here.  This is Amboise, which is a typical example of Renaissance architecture, which, however, began to be built in the eleventh century.  No less ancient Chinon - one of the royal castles of the tenth century.  But a typical chateau in the Loire Valley is a brilliant "palazzo" in the style of the Italian Renaissance.  Those are Blois (Catherine de Medici died in this castle), Villandry, Chambord, Azele le Rideau. </p><h2>  The history of the feudal castle </h2><p>  The first mention of the fortress dates back to 1243.  Then the village of Chenonceau was owned by the de Marc family.  A small castle was built on the outskirts of the settlement.  According to the architectural canons of that time, it was surrounded by walls with loopholes and a moat where the Cher waters were directed.  The mill adjoined the chateau.  To get inside the castle, it was necessary to bypass the drawbridge.  During the Hundred Years War, the owner of the chateau, Jean de Marc, made an unacceptable oversight: he allowed the British to place a garrison.  For this front, <span>Charles VI</span> ordered the demolition of defensive fortifications and the destruction of the feudal tower.  Having fallen out of favor (and having experienced financial difficulties because of this), Rod Marc sold the castle of Chenonceau to Normandy Finance Quartermaster Thomas Boyer.  This man was a fan of the Renaissance.  And so he razed the ground that the French king had not had time to destroy, and launched a grandiose construction in 1512.  It was completed only in 1521.  Boyer did not have time to enjoy his residence in full: Thomas died in 1524, and his wife Catherine in 1526. </p>

    <h2>  Royal Castle History </h2><p>  Boye's son, Antoine, took over.  But King <span>Francis I,</span> on the pretext of punishing him for financial irregularities, annexed the chateau.  This expropriation occurred in 1533.  So the castle of Chenonceau became the royal country residence.  Francis I visited here for the sake of hunting.  But he also brought his associates to the chateau: wife Eleanor of Habsburg, son of Henry, daughter-in-law Catherine de Medici.  The favorites were also here - the Duchess of d'Etamps Anna de Pislau - the beloved of Francis, and Diana de Saint-Valle-de-Poitiers, the rivalry of his son Henry.  The chateau hosted literary evenings, balls and festivities. </p><h2>  Why is Chenonceau called "Ladies' Castle" </h2><p>  When Henry ascended the throne in 1547, Diana de Poitiers asked him for this nice place.  And the monarch, contrary to the law prohibiting the alienation of royal possessions, transferred the castle of Chenonceau to his favorite.  Diana began the reconstruction.  She ordered a park and a garden to be set up around the chateau, as well as a stone bridge over Cher.  After the death of Henry, the favorite was expelled by his legal wife, Catherine de Medici.  This active lady also did a lot for the castle: she set up a second garden and converted the estate, having written out from Italy the architect Primaticcio.  In 1580, a two-story building was erected directly on a stone bridge.  Catherine bequeathed the estate to her daughter-in-law Louise de Vaudemont.  But the new owner of the chateau was widowed a year later.  She dressed in mourning (he was white by the monarchs) and did not leave the castle until the end of her life.  Her bedroom and furniture have been preserved.  Residents of the village respectfully called her "White Lady." </p>

    <h2>  Further Chenonceau Metamorphoses </h2><p>  Castles of Europe were often transformed from defensive fortresses to palaces, then to prisons, then to estates and museums.  Chenonceau was waiting for the same fate.  The "White Lady" was handed over to the ch√¢teau by Francoise de Merker, wife of the Duke of Vendome.  Then the estate gradually began to decline.  One wing of the castle was given over to the Franciscan monastery (they built a new drawbridge).  In 1733, the land was bought by the banker Claude Dupin.  His wife converted Chenonceau into a salon, where she received prominent personalities of that era.  Thanks to her democratic views, the castle was not damaged during the Revolution of 1789.  The new mistress was Madame Peluse, who wanted to return Chenonceau to its original appearance.  In 1888, the castle was acquired by the Meunier family.  Her descendants are now the owners of Chenonceau. </p>

    <h2>  What to see in the castle </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, the chateau itself.  The original interior of the Five Queens room has been preserved there.  Each owner, following the couple Boye, contributed something of their own to the design of the castle.  You should visit the gardens of Diana and Catherine with flower beds and labyrinths, decorated with sculptures and fountains.  The front hall is located in the wing on the bridge.  And in the basements are huge kitchens with a set of dishes of those times.  Do not forget that the castle houses interesting museums in France: medieval tapestries, furniture, carpets and wax figures.  There is also a collection of paintings. </p>
