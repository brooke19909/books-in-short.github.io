Moreover, the competition in this area among organizations is simply huge.  And in order to attract customers, very often many simply deceive visitors.  What is Gazfond (NPF) actually?  Feedback on this organization from customers and employees is what helps to decide. </p><p>  Maybe you really should transfer your funded part of the pension here?  Or, on the contrary, never turn to the services of this company and find its better counterpart?  Immediately understand for yourself - there is no single exact opinion.  After all, how many people - so many reviews.  All conclusions will have to be done independently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gas fund npf reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287003.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What does he do? </h2><p>  True, in reality, this is not such a problem.  Having appreciated all the pros and cons of the company, everyone can make a conclusion for themselves.  Therefore, we begin with the activities of the organization.  Maybe she will scare you away already. </p><p>  Although it should not.  After all, reviews about the NPF "Gazfond" (Russia, St. Petersburg and other cities) are left as a place that offers the population to invest and keep their funded part of the pension.  Of course, with its advantages - it is possible to increase cash deposits.  And when the time comes, Gazfond will pay you the funds in your account as a pension.  Or rather, only its cumulative part.  There is nothing suspicious here.  It is a normal company that offers the services that the population needs.  This is not a Vedeno-Oyat monastery, not a fraudulent organization.  So, you can trust her.  So many customers believe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How is the employer? </h2><p>  What are the reviews received at NPF Gazfond?  Sometimes, according to the opinions of employees alone, it is possible to say with accuracy how reliable the company is.  With regard to the Gas Fund, the situation is very mixed. </p><p>  Why?  The thing is that most employees are neutral with respect to our organization today.  But at the same time, staff and applicants emphasize some of the shortcomings of the company.  Yes, she also has advantages, but to some they will seem not so significant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oyat Monastery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287005.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Among the advantages stand out stable earnings, as well as working conditions.  You will work in comfortable offices.  A more or less stable schedule also takes place.  And Gazfond is not a fraudulent company.  It really exists and offers real vacancies for employment.  But on this, perhaps, the pros end. </p><p>  Gazfond (NPF) does not earn the best reviews due to the fact that all employees are forced to transfer the funded part of the pension to this particular corporation.  And even there are threats of dismissal.  That is, the company acts by hook or by crook, honest methods of influence on employees and not very.  This is alarming - why should a bona fide, popular company generally force someone to make deposits?  Suspiciously, and nothing more! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Nevertheless, this is not a reason to refuse to "communicate" with this company.  NPF Gazfond earns a variety of customer reviews.  And you can‚Äôt say for sure whether to trust him or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf gas fund customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287006.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In any case, the so-called <span>rating of pension funds</span> plays a huge role <span>.</span>  It identifies all such organizations, taking into account the level of customer confidence, stability, as well as popularity among visitors.  And Gazfond is in the top five.  It follows that we are dealing with a truly stable corporation. </p><p>  By the way, her level of trust is the highest - A ++.  In any case, this is indicated by statistics.  Therefore, it should be assumed that the pension fund is trustworthy.  At least a minimum.  This is not some small desk that no one knows about, but a really large and well-known organization. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  Collects and increases pension fund OAO Gazfond.  Reviews about this organization are left by customers, as already mentioned, ambiguous.  Yes, according to statistics, the trust level of the population is high.  Moreover, the company is one of the five best NPFs in Russia.  But the important points do not end there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jsc npf gas fund pension savings reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287007.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What else should you pay attention to?  On what NPF "Gazfond" receives feedback on the profitability of the fund.  This is an important point.  It is not enough to maintain your retirement savings.  Funds also offer to increase them.  This means that profitability plays a huge role in the rating of a company. </p><p>  In this corporation, not too high figures are proposed.  The thing is that on average, the profitability of the Gas Fund reaches 4.17%.  Not very much, but it is more than many similar companies can offer.  Therefore, Gazfond (NPF) receives reviews as a fund that really helps, albeit slightly, to increase pension savings. </p><h2>  Surprises from the company </h2><p>  Separate attention requires membership in the company.  It causes the most confusion and indignation on the part of customers.  Why?  All because of what you can suddenly discover for yourself - your <span>funded part of your pension is</span> already in the Gazfond, although you haven‚Äôt applied there personally.  How is that? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf gas fund work reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287008.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Gazfond concludes deals with various employers, as a result of which all employees of the company become investors.  Their personal presence, as well as consent, are not needed.  Thus, unsuspecting citizens are storing the funded part of the pension in the Gazfond.  When checking this information pops up.  The fund itself allows you to refuse membership without problems, but your employer is unlikely to agree.  This is the picture that practice shows. </p><h2>  Personally </h2><p>  But if you yourself decided to become a contributor, you will not find any problems, negativity or negative aspects.  Moreover, NPF Gazfond receives positive customer reviews for its conditions, which it offers to all visitors. </p><p>  The contract is drawn up taking into account and indicating all the rules of the emerging relationship.  In addition, you are given the opportunity at any time by personal application to change the pension fund to some other.  It turns out that customers are not burdened with anything.  They can freely choose where to store their pension savings.  And this, of course, pleases.  Anyway, at the very beginning of membership. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF gas fund fund profitability reviews" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Harsh reality </h2><p>  Only in practice a different picture is obtained.  She pushes many away from the foundation.  What is the situation with Gazfond?  Not in the best way.  Indeed, despite the proposed conditions for cooperation, you do not get anything special.  Is that an extra headache.  This is exactly how some customers assure. </p><p>  Where does this statement come from?  All this is due to the fact that, in fact, Gazfond will not allow you to calmly change the storage fund for <span>pension contributions.</span>  To achieve your goal, you will have to write a statement for the transfer of funds several times.  It can be said that justice must be achieved ‚Äúwith a fight‚Äù. </p><p>  It also turns out that Gazfond often has problems with the payment of pension savings that are already on the account.  Sometimes citizens wait for their money for 2-3 months.  This is normal for a given non-state pension fund.  And not only for the Gas Fund, but also for other similar corporations.  Payment delays, although repulsive, are present everywhere in Russia. </p><h2>  Laurels of Glory </h2><p>  Only now "Gazfond" (NPF) reviews earn mostly positive.  Where do they come from if the company really doesn't have many advantages?  And the population is inclined to warn more about negative aspects than about positive ones. </p><p>  Everything is extremely simple - the praise to the pension fund has been bought.  People were paid positive feedback that could attract new customers.  This is a normal phenomenon that has long been used by all organizations - both scammers and bona fide firms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about npf gazfond russia st petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1287004.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Should you trust the Gas Fund?  This is up to you.  In any case, it is not worth trusting opinions indicating the ideal position of the fund in the services market.  Yes, this is a company that will not be closed, it is unlikely to go bankrupt.  Therefore, she deserves a minimum of trust. </p>
