    <p>  But the company did not get hung up on the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, albeit rather successful segment, having launched its new and rather interesting product - the Qumo Vega 8008W tablet, which managed to move many competitors, attracting users with its price and hardware, both hardware and software. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out whether the new gadget from Kumo is worth its money and whether it has other advantages besides price and filling.  For a more loyal evaluation of the product, the opinions of experts and the reviews of the owners of the gadget were taken into account. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  It is worth noting that Qumo Vega 8008W is packed in good conscience: high-quality cardboard mixed with plastic is neatly rolled up into a thin vacuum film, that is, the gadget can not be reached without violating the integrity of the package.  Therefore, there is at least some guarantee that the device went on sale directly from the assembly line, and not from any test groups.  After opening the box, you can see the following set: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The tablet. </li><li>  An adapter for charging the device through a USB connector, immediately implying the ability to connect to a computer. </li><li>  A relatively long cable with the same USB outputs. </li><li>  The manual is in Russian. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ol><p>  The package bundle is standard and quite acceptable for the <span>budget tablet</span> Qumo Vega 8008W.  Owner reviews note not too detailed instructions for the gadget, but if there are any gaps in the manual, then there is always an alternative in the person of Yandex or Google. </p><p>  Some, more expensive variations of the tablet may be equipped with a BT-keyboard for fixing the device.  In addition to the usual QWERTY-functionality, the panel can be transformed into a convenient platform for work like similar netbooks and ultrabooks. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the Qumo Vega 8008W is rather inconspicuous, but a couple of interesting points are still there.  It reveals some unique and elusive feature that other budget models lack.  There is no obvious imitation of venerable counterparts like Apple or Samsung, which most low-cost gadgets ‚Äúhurt‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  The Qumo Vega 8008W has everything in its place: good minimization of the space around the perimeter of the screen, competent edging of the controls, lack of stylistic excesses - all in moderation, so the design can be called neat and stylish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  The case looks solid and correctly assembled.  The slots are evenly spaced around the entire perimeter of the tablet, and no backlash is detected.  Pressing the buttons occurs without visible effort and with a good response.  The back cover of the Qumo Vega 8008W, under which the battery is located, is made of high-quality and sufficiently durable plastic. </p>

    <p>  Each socket that the gadget has is marked with its own designation, so it will not work to confuse the buttons and connectors.  The location of the rear camera is accented by a peculiar and eye-pleasing style.  The surface of the device has a matte finish, so fingerprints are quite difficult to leave, and the gadget is not so actively collecting dust and dirt. </p><p>  The back of the Qumo Vega 8008W 32Gb Win 8 tablet is marked with operating system version marks and the company logo, which are quite expected and look appropriate.  As for the type of battery, standard icons, copyright and rated voltage, then here they are clearly superfluous and completely unnecessary. </p><p>  Another interesting feature of the Qumo Vega 8008W 32Gb is its separate sockets for micro-USB and an adapter for charging, which gives additional control over the gadget: you can use external devices while connecting the tablet to the network.  About this feature users very warmly respond in their comments to the gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Qumo Vega 8008W 32Gb Win 8 tablet is equipped with a high-quality and well-proven IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels with a diagonal of 8 inches.  The saturation of pixels is not as large as we would like, but the eyes are not annoying - 189 ppi. </p>

    <p>  The screen clearly conveys tones and has rich colors, and viewing angles, thanks to a modern matrix, deserve all praise, so you can watch a video or photo with friends without any problems.  Illumination over the entire area passes uniformly without differences in the angles or the central part of the matrix, which also pleases. </p><h2>  Performance Qumo Vega 8008W 32Gb Win 8 </h2><p>  A review of similar gadgets showed that the full-fledged version of Windows 8 is a pretty serious test for a mobile device.  But, oddly enough, our respondent did an excellent job with the task, eating the operating system without even choking. </p>

    <p>  Intel‚Äôs well-proven <span>Atom Z3735F processor</span> and the video module represented by HD Graphics do not allow the device to stop, applications work quickly, clearly and confidently.  The only thing that gadget owners note in their reviews as a significant minus is the sleep mode.  After the tablet ‚Äúfalls asleep‚Äù for several minutes, if it is later ‚Äúwoken up‚Äù, it responds for too long, besides, there is a high probability that after the next exit from sleep the video card may not turn on or the battery charging sensor will stop working.  Therefore, you have to turn off the device completely and start it again.  We hope that the company will soon fix this issue with patches in the firmware. </p><p>  Another unpleasant moment is the processor loading at the time of idle time, that is, the battery is gradually discharged at a speed of 5% per hour of the total charge. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  Sound quality, both with speakers and in headphones, is up to par.  Even if you use the Qumo Vega 8008W 32Gb tablet with built-in speakers, then at maximum volume they do not wheeze, and the sound does not go into cacophony.  Other opportunities have more or less acceptable indicators. </p><ul><li>  movies are viewed in HD-resolution without jerking with good color saturation and excellent viewing angles; </li><li>  during games, FPS is kept within normal limits (30-50 fps), shader processing is at a high level, application saturation with objects is within 70%; </li><li>  work with documents and graphic applications does not cause any complaints. </li></ul><p>  It can also be noted that the BT device connected to the gadget works as intended, which is very pleasing.  Wireless communication has no noticeable delays even over long distances. </p><p>  Owners in their reviews note the presence of such a useful function as displaying an image on the screen of a large device using Wai-Fi protocols, which makes the tablet a good help in multimedia entertainment. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The rear and front cameras of the device have the same characteristics and practically do not differ from each other.  Both are equipped with a resolution of 2 megapixels, which, judging by the feedback from users, is clearly not enough for normal operation.  Nevertheless, talking on Skype and making avatars for yourself can be done without problems, but for many more is not necessary. </p>

    <p>  If you actively use wireless protocols and load the processor with games and graphics tasks, then the battery will last about five hours.  It is also worth considering the feature of lithium-polymer batteries: the lower the ambient temperature, the higher the energy consumption.  Therefore, working in cold rooms for a long time will not work. </p><p>  In general, for a four-core processor of a comparatively powerful video card and a modern matrix, the gadget has a good battery life, unlike similar competitors. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  As a result, you can list the main advantages and disadvantages of the model, and each one for himself will decide whether to buy a gadget or better save it for a more expensive modification. </p><p>  Advantages: </p><ul><li>  the design has neat and stylish features, gives the impression of a solid and reliable gadget; </li><li>  the display has rich colors, good viewing angles and sensible backlight; </li><li>  the device produces high-quality sound even on standard speakers; </li><li>  easy and confident synergy with external BT devices and headsets (keyboard, player, mouse); </li><li>  output of any image to a third-party device using the ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù protocol; </li><li>  trouble-free operation of the Windows operating system on the current gadget configuration; </li><li>  separate connectors for charging and working with other devices. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  battery life could be longer: I want games and the Internet, and not ‚Äúreaders‚Äù and music; </li><li>  Dependence of the gadget's full-fledged work on the ambient temperature: cold - the battery is low, hot - the processor is warming. </li></ul><p>  In the aggregate of all its characteristics, the gadget is perfect for those people who are set to work, not games.  An excellent matrix will not allow you to get confused in small fonts, and communications will always show confident work.  Game lovers will love the processor capabilities and stable FPS at medium settings.  Well, for those who like to communicate only on social networks and use the tablet as a "reader" or "watchman", it is better to find a gadget easier, since you will not use it at full power anyway. </p><p>  The price of the device on popular Internet sites ranges around 10,000 rubles. </p>
