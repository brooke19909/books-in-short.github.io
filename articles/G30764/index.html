    <p>  There is a railway station in the city.  Passenger trains ‚ÄúKiev - Rakhiv‚Äù and ‚ÄúLvov - Rakhov‚Äù, as well as local trains (4 routes) daily run through Yaremcha.  You can get to the city in another way: first you need to get to Ivano-Frankivsk, and then take one bus that goes towards Vorokhta, Rakhov. </p><h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  The city was founded in 1787.  The development of Yaremchi as a resort begins at the end of the 19th century.  In the 1890s, several dozen expensive villas were built here, the owners of which were representatives of the Austrian elite.  At the same time, the first tourist club "Yaremchansky" appeared in the city, which was engaged in marking mountain trails, landscaping and popularizing the sights of Yaremche. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, about 1,500 people vacationed in this area annually.  In 1907, the first guide to Yaremche was published.  To attract tourists, concerts, festivals, lotteries and humorous evenings were regularly organized in the city.  In the interwar period, the first sanatoriums arose in Yaremche. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since the beginning of the 1950s, the city has been actively developing as a Soviet resort.  Thousands of tourists from different parts of the USSR annually came to Yaremcha to improve their health, get acquainted with the Hutsul culture and see with their own eyes the <span>Carpathian Mountains,</span> which are "self-sufficient and perfect" (as defined by the Ukrainian writer Taras Prokhasko). </p><h2>  Souvenir market in Yaremche </h2><p>  The largest souvenir market in the whole Carpathian Ukraine is located in Yaremche.  This is not just a bazaar, but also one of the main enterprises of the city‚Äôs economy. </p><p>  The market is located in the center of the resort.  Several hundred sellers offer tourists to buy souvenirs, products, as well as works of art made by local craftsmen.  Here you can buy beautiful wood products, pottery, landscape paintings, warm sheepskin blankets and much more.  The souvenir market in Yaremche is also a museum with thousands of different exhibits, where you can walk for hours. </p><h2>  Breakdown waterfall </h2><p>  Perhaps the city‚Äôs most popular attraction is the Breakdown waterfall.  This is a cascade type waterfall located on the Prut River, in the center of Yaremche.  Water falls from a 7-meter height with a huge noise. </p>

    <p>  The waterfall is very picturesque; gray Yamnensky sandstones come to the surface along the banks.  You can admire this natural monument from the 20-meter bridge, which was built directly above the cascades. </p><h2>  Masterpieces of wooden architecture </h2><p>  At least ten monuments of wooden (Hutsul) architecture have been preserved in Yaremche.  The most famous among them is the Hutsulshchyna Restaurant.  A chic wooden building was built in 1952 without a single nail. </p>

    <p>  In addition, six wooden churches dating from the 18th-19th centuries have been preserved in the city.  Among them is the oldest church of <span>John the Merciful</span> 1663.  It was built in Yamna (the historical district of Yaremche) in the best traditions of Hutsul architecture.  In the interiors of the old church there are many icons and embroideries.  Near the temple, it is also interesting to see the old cemetery with ancient tombstones. </p><p>  Thus, Yaremcha is not only an excellent mountain resort, but also a city with a rich history and numerous monuments of culture and architecture. </p>
