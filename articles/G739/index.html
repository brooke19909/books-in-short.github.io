Since the reign of the French monarchs, lilies have been recognized as true royal flowers.  So why not act like a king and give your beloved a beautiful lily from beads?  It is believed that one of the longest and most painstaking activities is beadwork.  Lilies are made so simple and fast that only a feeling of pleasure and admiration for this beautiful flower will remain from the work done. </p><p>  At the very beginning of the work, it is necessary to determine the color of the lily from beads.  The classic version is a virgin white flower, but if you wish, you can originalize and weave no less beautiful tiger lily or some other. </p><p>  So, the place necessary for work is freed up, and all the necessary materials are prepared.  Namely, beads of green, yellow, brown and golden-orange color, several large beautiful golden beads for decoration of stamens, thin wire for twigs and thicker for a stalk, <span>floral ribbon</span> or green (brown) mouline thread, scissors, brushes and acrylic varnish . </p><p>  How to make a lily from beads?  Everything is very simple.  The main work is to create flower petals, stamens and small green leaves.  Petals for lilies from beads are made in the following way.  A wire of thirty centimeters is taken, on the edge of which fifteen beads are put on.  This will be the middle of the petal.  Now work continues with the long part of the wire.  Twenty beads are strung on it, and in order for the lily to become a tiger, brown beads randomly interspersed in them.  Both ends of the wire - long and short - are secured by twisting, and work is carried out to the next end of the base.  The next two rows are made of twenty-six beads in each, and then comes the last, edging row.  It is made only from golden-orange beads.  Here it is necessary to string thirty-one beads.  You can stop at this, and if you wish, continuing to work and increasing the number of rows, make an even larger flower.  At the end, both wires are threaded through the beads and well fixed.  The petal is ready.  For one flower it is necessary to weave six such petals. </p><p>  The next work is the manufacture of stamens for lilies from beads.  A piece of wire 16-18 centimeters is folded in half.  A large golden bead is put on it, and then twenty-three small beads.  The ends of the wire are fixed.  The stamen is ready.  Only five stamens are needed. </p><p>  Just like the petals for the flower, the leaves are executed.  Only here it is necessary to slightly reduce their size, which means to string a smaller amount of beads.  For the middle of the petal, you can take 15-16 beads and in the next rows increase their number by two.  Such petals also need no more than six. </p><p>  It remains to collect the flower.  Stamens are fastened in three and two, petals are attached to them in turn.  The finished flower is attached with a thin wire to the stem (thick wire).  Green leaves are attached to it.  All parts of the wire are wrapped with floss or floral ribbon.  You can leave the work in this form, but for a brilliant result, it is worth covering all its wrapped parts with acrylic varnish. </p><p>  The work is fully completed and now the question of how to make a lily from beads will be answered quickly and easily!  <span>The natural beauty of</span> this wonderful flower with a royal past will delight the eye throughout the year.  Lily - a flower of French kings, elegant and delicate, looks great both in a bouquet of several lilies and in splendid isolation. </p>
