  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY corrugated paper crafts: photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Corrugated paper comes in several forms.  This is a thick packaging, dense of various colors for crafts, and thin and soft paper, from which flowers and volumetric applique are made.  In the article, we will present for your consideration several examples of making crafts from corrugated paper with photographs and a detailed description of work on the product. </p><h2>  Work Explanation </h2><p>  When bonding applique or craft parts for such a dense material, you need thick PVA glue.  You will also need to use sharp scissors, and for the manufacture of paintings - a quality cutter.  Some crafts can be done by younger students, and some paintings from corrugated paper can only be done by people who have artistic skills and a certain taste. </p><p>  For crafts in the form of flowers, you may need additional elements.  For example, in a sewing accessories store, pick up a core for a flower; for a stalk, you need to prepare a strong wire.  In principle, do-it-yourself crafts from corrugated paper are easy, the main thing is to understand the stages of work and follow the instructions given in the article. </p><h2>  Beads for mom </h2><p>  Such a piece of corrugated paper can be offered as a gift to mom or grandmother for the holiday on March 8.  This work is mastered even by children of the senior group of kindergarten.  Beads can be made different, so the craft will look even more original.  For work, you need several sheets of corrugated paper in different colors.  It is advisable to choose a beautiful color scheme so that the shades are compatible.  Also, to put on the beads you need a kapron thread of the same color as one of the beads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To make cylindrical elements, paper is cut into even stripes of different widths.  Narrow and sharp triangles are needed for spiral beads.  A sample of cut paper for such items is in the photo below.  They can also be cut of different widths, then the spirals are long and more rounded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beads for mom on march 8" class="if uuid-2293871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293871.jpg"></div><p>  It is desirable to place them in a symmetrical order.  They start with the central large part, then make the same two beads and place them to the left and to the right of the center.  Glue the edges of the paper with thick PVA glue.  You can use superglue or transparent glue "Crystal". </p><p>  When rolling paper into rolls, they use a thin rod, for example, a wooden skewer or a knitting needle.  After fixing the edges of the bead is removed from the rod and a nylon thread is threaded into this hole.  For convenience, it can be inserted into a thick needle.  The free edges of the thread are knotted.  Everything, you can give a piece of corrugated paper to mom. </p><h2>  Toy "Bunny" </h2><p>  Such a large toy requires a lot of material.  The main color is blue, and for the nose one strip of pink will be enough.  Toy eyes can be purchased at the sewing accessories store.  For bonding such a quantity of corrugated paper it is better to use superglue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="toy bunny" class="if uuid-2293801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293801.jpg"></div><p>  As a wide base for wrapping, you can use a cardboard roll of toilet paper.  Having wrapped several layers around the cylinder, the edge is also firmly glued.  Then the paper is gently pulled from the cardboard core and flattened with a palm and folded as desired.  It turns out thin ears and paws. </p><p>  When all the details are fastened together, decorating the crafts from corrugated paper with your own hands begins, the photo shows what else needs to be done.  First, the nose is twisted and glued, then the eyes are attached.  Pressing a finger in the middle of the lower legs can make them curved up and more voluminous. </p><h2>  Tank for boy </h2><p>  Earlier in the article, a method was described for twisting paper around a core.  The following corrugated paper craft (step-by-step description below) uses the same principle.  First pick up strips of three colors: black, yellow and beige.  You can, of course, dream up and make another option, or the usual green.  The wheels have different sizes, reduced to the edges of the tank‚Äôs caterpillar.  It is better to make them in pairs, immediately for one and the second track, so that the size is the same and the product does not skew to the side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper tank" class="if uuid-2293868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293868.jpg"></div><p>  Connect the wheels together using a long track.  For strength, you can walk around them with a strip twice.  The edge is glued to the last turn, as in the rest of the details.  In order for the two caterpillars and the tank tower to have a base, you need to make a large cylinder and insert it into the center of the toy.  Large wheels and the upper superstructure of the tank are glued to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The upper cylinder of the tower is equipped with a gun before final gluing.  Make it from a wide sheet, twisting it in the length of corrugated strips.  The edge is fixed along the entire length.  If you press on the wheels and the tower with your finger from the inside, then they will have a bulge. </p><p>  To play with such a tank you need to be careful, because this is a piece of corrugated paper.  The photo shows that the details do not move, and the children will definitely want a mobile toy, not a static one.  Such a tank can be the subject of decor in a children's room or a craft for an exhibition at the school on February 23. </p><h2>  Crafts for girls </h2><p>  To make such a doll, you need to collect that body, that head from two parts of a conical shape.  The inner pink element may be cylindrical.  An already twisted purple cone is glued on top of it. </p><p>  The head is done in a slightly different way.  First, a black hairstyle is twisted, then the central part is pushed up with a finger, giving the head a roundness.  White paper sticks on top of black and curls with the layers shifting down.  Long curls are thin strips of paper curled up in pencil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="doll for girls" class="if uuid-2293876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293876.jpg"></div><p>  The lanterns of the dress fold out of thin strips and also slightly bend outward so that the volume can be seen.  Hands, eyes, mouth and heart are made as a normal application. </p><h2>  Quilling narcissus </h2><p>  Do it yourself with a step-by-step instruction on this corrugated paper craft.  In order for the flower pot to be durable, a disposable cup filled with sand is inserted in the middle.  Paste it with brown stripes and decorate with red. </p><p>  The middle of the flower is curled immediately from two colored stripes piled together.  Petals of a daffodil are made as follows.  First, a strip is wound on a thick rod, an edge is glued to the last turn.  Then it is removed from the rod and pressed with two fingers on one side, creating a sharp corner of the petal.  The rounded part of the petals are attached to the middle of the flower.  In order for the daffodil to stand in the pot, you need to pick up a green plastic thin wand.  It can be pasted over with paper.  At the base of the wand are attached thin leaves characteristic of the daffodil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Narcissus in a flower pot" class="if uuid-2293931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293931.jpg"></div><p>  Such a piece of corrugated paper - flowers - can be made as a gift on March 8 or on the birthday of mom or grandmother. </p><h2>  rose flower </h2><p>  For such a delicate flower as a rose, the thinnest corrugated paper is used.  The step-by-step diagram in the photo shows how to cut the petals, twist them around the stem (sticks).  You can use a wooden one, as in the photo, or you can pick up a thin green cocktail straw. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoinstructions.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose out of paper" class="if uuid-2293860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293860.jpg"></div><p>  After making the flower, the edges of the petals twist outward with their hands.  A rose is obtained, like a real one, from far away people are unlikely to guess that the flower is made of paper. </p><h2>  Poppy </h2><p>  Such a magnificent and large poppy is made from the same shape of the petals.  It resembles a triangle in which all corners are rounded.  The petals are fastened in the center.  The edges remain free.  Pieces of black threads are glued in the middle, on top of which a black half-bead is placed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="red poppy out of paper" class="if uuid-2293885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293885.jpg"></div><p>  Sharp green sepals are attached at the bottom of the flower.  If the poppy should have a stem, then it can be fixed on the back of the flower on a ball of crumpled paper.  To do this, the core is wrapped in several layers and then the cylinder is pasted over from above.  The volume of the sepals will turn out, as in a real flower. </p><h2>  Tulips </h2><p>  Such a delicate bouquet is made of strips of corrugated paper folded in half by twisting.  Balls of crumpled paper are inserted in the middle for volume. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquet of spring tulips" class="if uuid-2293878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293878.jpg"></div><p>  A wand is simply inserted from below and wrapped in green paper.  Flowers can be combined in a bouquet and tied with packaging film. </p><h2>  Corrugated paper pattern </h2><p>  To create real masterpieces you need to be able to draw.  First, a picture is drawn on the wrapping paper.  Then, with a sharp cutter, a thin layer of paper is very carefully cut, revealing the corrugated sheet.  You need to work with light movements, otherwise you can damage the layer you need for the image. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twistedsifter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper picture" class="if uuid-2293924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293924.jpg"></div><p>  The created panel can be closed under glass and hung in a frame on the wall. </p><p>  As you can see, many wonderful crafts can be made from corrugated paper.  Try it, you will succeed! </p>
