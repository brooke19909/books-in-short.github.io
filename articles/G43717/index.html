Despite the magnificent municipal beach, which is distinguished by cleanliness, guests note the absence of their own beach.  The disadvantages include the distance from the airport, which makes it difficult to travel to the hotel.  Many guests complain that although the Internet is in public places, it is expensive enough for an economical hotel.  In addition, there are guests who complain of poor soundproofing in the rooms.  But lovers of a great economical vacation, such little things can not overshadow the vacation.  There are so many positive emotions that, against the general background, such trifles are simply invisible to many. </p><p>  According to most vacationers in Marina 3 *, reviews and photos of the hotel can not fully convey all the sensations received during the holidays.  In order to feel its whole atmosphere and appreciate the surrounding beauty, you need to stay at this hotel at least once. </p>
