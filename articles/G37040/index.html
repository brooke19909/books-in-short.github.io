    <p>  Most often, the hotel booked a double apartment.  Some of these rooms offer a view of the park, others with sea views.  Tourists recommend choosing the first option, as the side of the sea coast is very noisy.  In the evening there are discos and animation programs. </p><p>  The rooms themselves are spacious and bright.  In addition to the huge euro bed, there is also an extra bed in the form of a folding sofa.  The room also has a spacious wardrobe, mirror, air conditioning, TV.  Internet can be used at an additional cost, but the signal is weak.  Among the shortcomings, hotel guests note some inaccuracies in the operation of the bathroom and sewage system. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel guests recommend taking all-inclusive meals.  An early breakfast is served at the café from 6am.  You can also have breakfast in the main restaurant, but from 7.30 to 10.00.  The guests of the complex dine near the beach bar in the open air from 12.00 to 15.00.  There is a lot of food, and all of it is varied and tasty.  The assortment always has ripe fruits.  For sweets - ice cream and delicious desserts.  Each guest will find something edible for himself and certainly will not remain hungry.  All drinks, except alcoholic drinks, are in the public domain.  Alcohol is served at the bar.  In addition to the main meals, there are snacks in the form of pancakes and sandwiches. </p><p>  For dinner, tables are served in the main restaurant.  On the first visit, the restaurant administrator assigns a table to each room.  You can have dinner from 18.30 to 19.45 or from 20.15 to 21.30.  The food is lighter and less varied than at lunch, but the quality of the dishes is on top. </p><h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The hotel staff is friendly and quick to respond to any requests from customers, trying to please.  It seems that they went through a courtesy school.  Hotel guests are treated with awe and are even interested in health and mood.  All misunderstandings are resolved very quickly.  The staff does not speak Russian well, but is fluent in English. </p><p>  The quality of service at the ClubHotel Riu Bellevue Park (Tunisia) is constantly monitored.  During dinner, each visitor should fill out a questionnaire in which he indicates whether everything suits him and what he lacks. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily; tips on the quality of cleaning are not affected.  Maids begin to work only in the absence of guests. </p><p>  Hotel guides describe excursion routes in detail, without imposing anything.  Issue cards with marked local attractions. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The beach area is strewn with sunbeds, there are always free places.  Annoying merchants often go along the beach, offering various goods.  But beach workers, caring for a comfortable stay for hotel guests, simply annoying sellers are simply kicked out. </p><p>  The sea is not very clean.  The water is cloudy and smells bad due to algae and small debris.  But after cleaning the beach, swimming in the sea is a pleasure.  Sometimes you can meet jellyfish.  They can even sting.  But the hotel staff will quickly provide first aid.  The beach belongs to the hotel.  All accessories are free. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2>

Particularly fastidious can go to the nearest night clubs, of which there are a huge number in Sousse.  The public of the hotel consists mainly of family people and senior citizens, so young people here can be bored. </p><p>  Holidays in Tunisia are often accompanied by shopping.  Prices in local shops and markets are especially pleasing to European tourists. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are several shopping centers with fairly high prices.  A little further is a four-story complex with good goods and prices.  In Tunisia, it is customary to bargain, but only in markets or in private shops.  On certain days, a man arrives at the hotel from whom you can cheaply buy souvenirs and other trifles. </p><p>  Money can be changed at the reception.  The course is even better than in exchangers. </p><p>  At the hotel you can use the services of a photographer and get an excellent photo session.
