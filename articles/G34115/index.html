  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to develop analytical thinking in future psychologists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mastering the analytical type of thinking is required for people of many specialties whose activities are associated with the need to process large volumes of diverse information based on logic.  In psychological work with various categories of people, a specialist must be able not only to analyze the data obtained, but also to model schemes for possible solutions to problems, to predict the development of the situation in the near or distant future. </p><p>  The development of analytical thinking through various forms of learning </p><p>  An analysis of the structuring of <span>curricula</span> for training psychoanalysts in America led to the conclusion that students' analytical thinking can also develop through a gradual transition from general to private knowledge, and, conversely, from private to general.  Both of these structures allow teachers to achieve results when a student becomes a competent specialist, able to think logically, make informed decisions, and also teach his client the basics of introspection.  Experienced educators leading practices among the population give lectures in the form of discussions, discussions of theories and cases from clinical practice.  Young teachers conduct seminars on the articles of <span>famous psychologists.</span>  The analytical thinking of teachers also continues to evolve and improve when the ideas of the classics are rethought by them with an emphasis on practical use. </p><p>  Studying a variety of theoretical concepts, the student should have an idea about them, and also take part in discussing the possibilities of their use in the practice of future work.  Participation in educational training allows future psychologists to form a willingness to solve difficult and complex problem situations.  When teaching students of psychological specialties, analytical thinking is a basic construct for the formation of their <span>professional competence.</span>  The student makes an analysis of typical situations that may occur in his practice.  It also highlights unique situations, the solution of which will require an extraordinary type of thinking, finding a new way to exit them. </p><p>  The analytical thinking of a psychologist goes beyond the introverted way of studying information.  For a future psychologist, it is very important to develop communication skills in oneself, master the technique of conducting a conversation, and create a confidential atmosphere in the process of working with a client. </p><p>  The development of analytical thinking during educational practice </p><p>  The first experience of psychological work is carried out under the supervision of a leader in the framework of the practice.  The teacher, observing the work of several students, unites them into a supervisory group, in which he himself is the leader.  Alternately, trainees present for discussion their situation, which caused difficulty in their work.  The situation may be presented by a consultant who believes that several students have difficulties in the same field of practical research.  Analytical thinking is the thinking of an outside observer who not only <span>ascertains the facts,</span> but also seeks to penetrate deeper into the problem and understand its motives.  Future psychologists take an observing position, analyze the volume of material that is relevant in a given situation, express their opinion based on previously studied theories and author's concepts.  The teacher directs and controls the students' thinking. </p><p>  Even after graduation, young professionals are encouraged to participate in closed or open supervisor groups.  This not only develops their analytical thinking, but also helps to avoid mistakes in work. </p>
