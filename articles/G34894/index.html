Today, few people can be surprised by the radio signal sensors with which electronics provide information transfer - such devices are present in acoustic equipment, in multimedia complexes and mobile gadgets.  Along with this, new technologies are being introduced in the headphone segment.  This addition expands the possibilities of connecting audio accessories and increases the convenience of their operation.  It remains only to choose the best <span>wireless headphones that</span> will not disappoint during use and will fully fulfill their tasks. </p><h2>  Wireless Headphone Features </h2>

    <p>  The main feature that determined the advantages of such models is the ability to broadcast a music signal from a source wirelessly.  This is realized through analog or digital signals, as well as using the Bluetooth module.  The use of a particular method of transmitting data at a distance determines the range and quality of coverage of the headphone signal.  The most common models are on radio sensors, since this is the most affordable and easy to technically implement way to provide wireless communications.  According to experts, the <span>best wireless headphones</span> still work on the Bluetooth module.  Actually, the presence of such a device is beneficial not only in terms of signal quality and stability, but also because of its prevalence in equipment that can be considered as a source.  That is, the model with Bluetooth allows you to consider a wider range of musical equipment for the connection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which headphones are better - wired or wireless? </h2>

    <p>  High technology does not always have indisputable advantages over traditional solutions.  This also applies to headphones.  The advantages of devices that can interact with other components of the multimedia complex at a distance are obvious.  This is very convenient in terms of ergonomics, however, in other operational parameters, the situation is not so clear.  Therefore, many music lovers have the following question: are wired or wireless headphones better in terms of sound quality?  Despite the technological effectiveness of devices with radio modules and Bluetooth sensors, they lose to their predecessors in signal processing.  And this is not to mention the possible interference distorting the sound.  In addition, the advantage in the form of convenience is not so obvious.  Getting rid of wires does not exclude another problem - power issues of the device.  Batteries and accumulators are a prerequisite for completing wireless models. </p><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2>

In particular, this applies to the aforementioned supply elements.  To ensure maximum performance in <span>standalone mode,</span> it is recommended to purchase headphones that run on batteries in AA and AAA formats.  In this configuration, you can count on 10-12 hours of continuous listening.  The weight of the device also matters.  When determining which <span>wireless headphones for a TV are</span> better, it is advisable to focus on models weighing no more than 350 g. Such a listening mode assumes that a person is only briefly distracted by other matters and, for example, will go to another room.  But for hours of listening it is more advisable to purchase headphones weighing no more than 250 g, otherwise the head will be very tired.  In addition, do not forget about the primary characteristics of music playback.  Among them are the frequency range, impedance, power and other indicators that wire models have at their disposal. </p><h2>  Which brands to target? </h2>

    <p>  Almost all major manufacturers of audio equipment that have headphones in their product lines also produce wireless models.  Despite the relative novelty, this segment is quite densely filled.  Brands such as Sennheiser, Philips, Sony, Plantronics, AKG and others are considered leaders in the same direction.  It is important to note that each manufacturer pays attention to specific characteristics.  For example, Philips has formed a whole line of headphones based on the DECT technology platform.  The development allowed to ensure high quality signal transmission, but the cost of such products is higher than in similar devices with the same Bluetooth module.  We can say that from the point of view of stability and reliability of communication, the best wireless headphones belong to Philips.  However, in terms of sound reproduction quality, Sennheiser and Plantronics still hold leading positions. </p><h2>  The best option for the TV </h2><p>  The interaction of headphones with a TV involves the expansion of interactive tools.  In this case, you should consider the support for Smart TV technology, which is supplied with modern home cinema systems.  As a rule, such equipment provides for the presence of Bluetooth.  Much less common are models that support radio modules or infrared channels.  As for the sound reproduction quality, this indicator is not so significant.  The fact is that the best wireless headphones for a TV are primarily focused on interactivity and functionality.  A good option for basic needs may be the Philips SHC5100.  This is an inexpensive solution that allows you to connect to most TVs of the latest generations. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose a model for the phone? </h2><p>  Using the phone involves being outdoors, so ergonomic features come to the fore.  It is desirable that the model has comfortable ear cushions, good noise reduction and lightweight.  Also, models on a radio signal are almost completely eliminated, since Bluetooth technology is the most popular in the segment of mobile devices.  The Philips SHB7150FB meets all of the criteria described.  These are the best <span>wireless headphones for the phone</span> and because of the high-quality sound provided by the 40 mm emitters.  The thoughtful design of the headphones also facilitates physical manipulation, and the soundproofing of the ear pads does not allow street noise. </p><h2>  Which headphones are better for a computer? </h2>

    <p>  The choice of a model for a computer is greatly simplified by the fact that the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù in such a technique necessarily implies the possibility of communication via Bluetooth and radio modules.  But that is not all.  Since only in rare cases, using a computer in this format involves removing it over long distances, you can not think about signal coverage.  The minimum value of 10 m is quite enough to configure the connection within a regular apartment.  It remains only to focus on sound quality.  Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã160 meets these requirements. These are good wireless headphones for your computer, which confidently reproduce both music and acoustic effects in games.  True, the cost of this proposal exceeds analogues from other manufacturers.  The increase in price tag is explained not only by sound quality, but also by stylish design, as well as durability. </p><h2>  Universal option </h2><p>  Multifunctionality rarely benefits electronics, although the cost of expanding the optional ‚Äústuffing‚Äù goes up considerably.  Of course, it is best to purchase a model with the appropriate characteristics for each purpose, but there are devices that can satisfy all needs at once.  From the point of view of universality of application, a modification of Plantronics BackBeat Sense can be a worthy option.  These are the best wireless headphones in terms of ergonomic advantages and in terms of performance.  The model is able to simultaneously communicate with two devices, work offline for up to 18 hours, and also act as a full-fledged headset for receiving calls. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  With all the advantages of wireless technology, many users are still confused by their imperfection in terms of the ability to process audio signals.  Indeed, it is not for nothing that experts recommend using wired devices to fully unleash the potential of high-quality Hi-End class stereo systems.  Hybrid models allow combining the advantages of both concepts.  That is, the best wireless headphones also provide the ability to connect via cable if necessary.  As a result, if you need to move away from the sound source at a five-meter distance, the user will use the radio channel, and in other cases, to get the maximum pleasure from music, connect the device through a wire. </p><p>  By the way, as wireless technologies improve, it is possible that the need for hybrid models will disappear in the near future.  Improving the quality of the transmitted signal, coupled with the simplification of synchronization tools, is already giving decent results, and most likely, this process will finally transfer music lovers to wireless systems. </p>
