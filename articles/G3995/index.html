    <p>  Located on the shore of a beautiful lake, the resort occupies more than 40 hectares, on which buildings, cottages, a bath complex and even a mini-zoo with stables are comfortably placed.  According to legend, if you walk between the two halves of the lake that the path shares, and make a wish, then it will certainly come true. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the resort ‚ÄúYakhonti‚Äù is not only that it is included in the category of boarding houses near Moscow (‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù), but also that there is such a huge selection of entertainment that every client will surely find something to do. </p><p>  It offers guests: </p><ul><li>  meals 3 times a day on the basis of the "buffet"; </li><li>  children's entertainment room; </li><li>  various animation programs for children and adults; </li><li>  bath complex with a wide selection of services; </li><li>  pools with slides for children and adults; </li><li>  open sports grounds for volleyball and badminton; </li><li>  visit to the mini zoo; </li><li>  fishing; </li><li>  arbors with barbecue. </li></ul><p>  In addition to these free services, the resort offers a wide range of entertainment at a very reasonable price: </p><ul><li>  cosmetic procedures in the SPA-salon; </li><li>  fitness and exercise equipment; </li><li>  horse rides; </li><li>  night club and numerous bars; </li><li>  boat trips or rooks in the summer; </li><li>  ice skating in winter; </li><li>  conference rooms of various categories and occupancy; </li><li>  bowling and more. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, up to 1234 people can relax in the resort, who are waiting for cozy rooms in the building or comfortable cottages.

Such pensions in the Moscow Region on New Year's Day are overloaded with guests, so rooms must be booked in advance. </p><h2>  Pensions of the category "standard" </h2><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the capital there are enough beautiful places that are worthy of making you want to return again and again.  But when the boarding houses of the Moscow Region (with a buffet, inexpensively) also offer quality rest there, this is a great reason to come more often. </p><p>  The Bear Lakes Club is located only 40 km from Moscow, but it seems that it is a Russian hinterland, such silence and pristine nature.  3 lakes formed in the Ice Age, surrounded by forest, and comfortable rooms and cottages make this club very popular among those who want to have a good and budget rest. </p>
