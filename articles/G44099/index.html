The abbreviation LG stands for Lucky GoldStar ("happy gold star").  At one time, the combined brand appeared through the merger of two companies of the same name.  For their creators, this solution really became a gold star, which brought considerable profit.  Today, more than 90 thousand employees of the company work around the world, ensuring its prosperity. </p><h2>  Brand history </h2><p>  The date of foundation of <span>LG Electronics</span> Corporation is considered to be the year of foundation of the first of the two companies included in the conglomerate - Lucky.  This is the year 1947.  The second brand appeared 11 years later.  Initially, the company's products were far from what we see in the markets now.  Only in the early 60s of the twentieth century, GoldStar released a novelty of the time - a radio.  Much later, the joint manufacturer LG appeared.  The brand‚Äôs home country is South Korea.  It was there that a significant part of the equipment was produced and continues to be produced. </p>

    <h2>  LG in Russia </h2><p>  The company began exporting equipment not only to the domestic, but also to the world market in the early 60s of the last century.  True, then it was known as GoldStar, and not the manufacturer LG.  The country at that time did not release its equipment abroad, and it was this organization that became the first widely known South Korean brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LG manufacturer country" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1925486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, in Russia (at that time the USSR), few knew about its existence.  The company gained wide fame only in the early 90s of the twentieth century, when goods from China and Korea poured into the domestic market.  A little later, already in 2006, a large factory was opened in Russia for the production of washing machines, refrigerators, computer monitors and televisions. </p><p>  In models released by the enterprise, only the assembly place changes, the essence of technology remains unchanged.  LG is a manufacturer whose product country does not really matter.  Similar plants are located in China, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and, of course, in the homeland of the famous brand - in South Korea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="company LG country manufacturer" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1925481.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Production Features </h2><p>  The factories use the conveyor assembly principle.  Each worker stands in his place and performs only 1 - 2 operations.  It takes only a few minutes to assemble one monitor or TV.  Each worker has his own set of parts that he uses.  Some of them are made in Russia.  If we are talking about monitors and televisions, these are simple components, cases, simple microcircuits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LG which country is the manufacturer" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1925484.jpg" width="600"></div>  As for refrigerators and washing machines, up to 60% of parts in them can be of domestic production, even if the documents indicate that the manufacturer is LG.  The country of assembly does not supply only cooling systems and compressors - these are imported parts.

This is done in order to reduce the cost of the final cost of production.  If you bring every light bulb from Korea, then the final price of the goods will be an order of magnitude higher than domestic counterparts.  This will make the equipment uncompetitive in the market, and it is far from the fact that its quality will be better. </p><h2>  Quality control in factories </h2><p>  High quality is distinguished by all LG appliances.  Which manufacturing country does not matter, the quality control procedure for all plants is the same.  Each TV and monitor after assembly is connected and checked for compliance with standards.  3 percent of the produced models are randomly checked.  They are left to work for a day at a high ambient temperature, periodically provoking voltage surges.  If a marriage is found in at least one copy, the entire batch will be discontinued and sent for re-examination.  This also applies to other types of equipment.  Products released from the factory are equally safe for both humans and the environment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LG TV country manufacturer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1925482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Washing machines </h2><p>  As mentioned above, since 2006, LG washing machines have been produced in Russia.  "Country of origin - South Korea" - this inscription can be found only on single copies, as a rule, on new products that have not yet been launched into mass production and are experimental. </p><p>  Distinctive features of the models released under this brand are innovation, reliability, simplicity and comfort.  There are several features inherent in LG washing machines: </p><ol><li>  Using a direct drive motor.  The drum is attached directly to the engine (without using a belt), which significantly reduces noise and vibration, increasing the reliability of the connection. </li><li>  A large number of programs and features.  Even on basic models, you can adjust the temperature, spin speed, select the optimal program for the desired type of fabric. </li><li>  The lineup is constantly updated.  For example, a new product recently appeared on store stands - a washing machine with two drums.  Some models use TrueSteam - steam processing technology.  It allows you to remove odors and small impurities from delicate linen. </li></ol><h2>  Refrigerators </h2><p>  Poland, China and Russia - this is where LG refrigerators are manufactured.  The country of origin depends on the models themselves.  In Russia, they produce economy-class budget models that are affordable for the average consumer, in Poland - more sophisticated multi-chamber premium class refrigerators.  Two-door models, the so-called Side by Side, are produced in China.  Unlike teletechnics, some of the components are produced at the assembly site: the bottom, back wall and doors of the units are pressed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerators LG country manufacturer" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1925490.jpg" width="328"></div>

    <p>  Among the distinguishing features of refrigerators manufactured by LG, you can specify a linear inverter compressor, which reduces power consumption and reduces the noise level inherent in models with No Frost.  You can also mention Multi Air Flow technology - multi-threaded distribution of cold air throughout the volume of the refrigerator. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is another option that is found in the latest models of this company.  When you connect the application, the owner of the smartphone will receive alerts about the open door, temperature changes inside the cameras.  He will be able to remotely turn on the fast freezing and tempering mode, as well as conduct unit diagnostics. </p><h2>  TV sets </h2><p>  A significant part of the equipment manufactured by LG is TVs.  The company's management invests heavily in the development of innovations.  One of the latest innovations, the prototypes of which appeared in 2015, is a TV with a <span>flexible screen</span> that can be rolled up into a tube.  Such exclusive models are developed first in a research center, and only then, with economic feasibility, they are launched into mass production. </p><p>  More often, buyers are interested in where the in-line production of LG TVs is located.  The country producing the mass market models is Russia.  At one of the four workshops of the plant in the suburbs, most of the televisions are assembled on a conveyor.  As mentioned earlier, the main part of components (in addition to secondary nodes) comes from abroad. </p><h2>  Phones </h2><p>  Phones are a relatively new area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLG.  Only in 1996, the LG Mobile Communications division was opened, which is engaged in the development and production of modern models.  Just a couple of years later, LG-branded phones conquered first Russian and then European markets.  And already in 2005 the company was one of the five world suppliers of mobile devices.  Nowadays, the range is not limited to phones, smartphones and tablets replenish the piggy bank. </p><p>  Where do they collect all the mobile equipment, including LG phones?  The country of manufacture of mobile devices is China.  There are also collecting tablets, radio and players. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the production of smartphones is not the main one for LG, it is trying to keep up with world leaders and is constantly pushing new products to the world market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LG phone country manufacturer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1926003.jpg" width="364"></div>  Today, the main direction of development is devices based on Android and Windows Phone 7 of the Optimus series.  LG has released the world's first dual-core smartphone and phone for working with 3D content.  In modern models, all the latest developments in the field of displays are constantly being implemented - LG Black P970 was once called the device with the brightest screen.

    <h2>  Company development prospects </h2><p>  Perhaps in Russia and Europe you will not find a single person who is not familiar with LG.  The manufacturing country of the brand was originally South Korea, today the corporation's factories are located around the world.  Judging by the quarterly reports, the company‚Äôs revenues are only increasing, there is an increase in production capacity.  Only the direction of premium smartphones sags.  We are not talking about opening new plants, however, existing enterprises are fully loaded with work. </p>
