    <p>  This is one of the rare places on Earth where the gaze opens to the unexplored edge of wildlife and unique natural resources, located just a few steps from the busy Chuysky tract.  Here, tourists discover a huge number of rare species of flora and fauna, the most interesting traces of ancient civilization in the form of ancient steles, barrows, <span>petroglyphs</span> and other monuments of history and archeology, harmoniously woven into the natural landscape.  The panorama of the largest <span>lake of the region</span> is also very impressive <span>.</span>  <span>Lake</span> Teletskoye, spread out among the high mountains and surrounded on all sides by taiga, is traditionally called the symbol of Altai.  It is part of the Altai State Reserve and UNESCO is included in the List of World Heritage Sites.  By the way, in terms of the volume of unusually clean fresh water, the lake ranks second after Baikal.  Often, Teletskoye is called a small Baikal by its developmental features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Variety of routes </h2>

    <h2>  Cape Kirsay </h2><p>  It is especially worth highlighting the rest in the south of Lake Teletskoye.  This is one of the peculiar places in Altai, giving a feeling of unprecedented spaciousness.  The waters of the main northern part of the lake are separated from the spills of the Chulyshman river by the sandy spit of Cape Kirsai.  The influx of warm waters of Chulyshman gives the south coast a special advantage - in summer, the water temperature sometimes warms up to 20 degrees (for comparison, it does not exceed 10 degrees on the north coast).  This place on the lake is considered the warmest.  Its southern part is rarely icebound even in winter. </p><h2>  Extreme diving </h2><p>  Diving is much more familiar with diving into the abyss of the kingdom of Neptune somewhere in the hot tropical countries.  However, this interesting form of recreation is very common on high mountain lakes.  Here it allows you to feel a completely different atmosphere and plunge into the abode of a mysterious darkness, creating a sense of mysticism and mystery.  Diving tourism attracts many, but even professionals consider Teletskoye a special lake, claiming that it is not open to everyone.  Diving here is more complicated and dangerous, which is associated with the temperature of the water in the alpine lake, and features of the relief.  Therefore, such trips are best organized through diving centers, for example, in Barnaul or Novosibirsk. </p>

    <p>  In Altai, the most popular object for this extreme type of recreation and spearfishing is precisely the southern shore of Lake Teletskoye.  Ice diving is also highly regarded by professionals.  Diving under the winter ice chains allows you to feel the contrast of the enchanting extravaganza of light and transparent ice with ink darkness, as if squeezed into a ring of impregnable cliffs and mysterious caves. </p><h2>  Bright moments </h2><p>  An unforgettable impression leaves rest on the lake.  Teletskoy in itself and adventure educational tours in its vicinity will be a real discovery in the world of natural wonders and archaeological puzzles.  A rich program of outdoor activities leaves incredible emotions, allows you to alternate a relaxing holiday on the lake with climbing mountains, with camping trips to waterfalls of extraordinary beauty, with rafting on mountain rivers. </p><p>  You can explore Altai endlessly, leaving, almost everyone understands that he would like to return here again and again.  And the memories of a vacation on the lakes of the region forever remain in memory as a bright moment. </p>
