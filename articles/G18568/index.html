  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the difference between a smartphone and a communicator?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When choosing a mobile phone for yourself with a modern variety of varieties and models, you need to decide which set of tasks it will solve for you in the first place.  This question is very important, because at the moment these devices differ from each other very much.  Of course, the issue of price comes to the fore.  It‚Äôs a shame to pay for a lot of bells and whistles in the device that you do not plan to use. </p><p>  There are three categories of communication devices: mobile phones, smartphones and communicators.  At the moment, this classification is very conditional, and it is given solely in order to understand what it is about.  Next, we will talk about how the <span>smartphone differs from the communicator.</span>  If we talk about a simple mobile phone, then there is no need to talk much in detail, since everyone tentatively understands what its main characteristics are.  It is designed to conduct a normal conversation, as well as transmitting and receiving text messages and small pictures.  Many models can be equipped with a camera.  The user does not have the ability to change or supplement the set of functions built-in by the manufacturer. </p><p>  And now we are interested in the question: what is the difference between a smartphone and a communicator?  Let's get it right.  A smartphone can essentially be perceived as a mobile phone equipped with a built-in personal computer (PDA).  Its name can be understood as ‚Äúsmart phone‚Äù when it comes to literal translation.  Smartphones based on operating systems are being created.  The most common are Linux, Windows Mobile, and Symbian.  They allow you to install various applications on smartphones.  However, such operating systems have certain processor power requirements.  Such devices are distinguished by a powerful processor and a significant amount of RAM, which has a direct impact on the functioning. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>What is the difference between a smartphone and a communicator?</strong> </p><p>  It may be difficult for an average user to distinguish a smartphone from a traditional mobile phone.  And if we talk about the difference between a communicator and a smartphone, then new difficulties appear, since these devices are very similar.  Let's see what the problem is.  This is due to the fact that the smartphone is a mobile phone that simply grew to a handheld computer, while the communicator, on the contrary, is a PDA in which the telephone module appeared.  It turned out that between them most often there is no difference.  If you are interested in knowing how the communicator differs from a smartphone, then we can say that they can be distinguished in appearance.  Usually they inherit the features of the devices from which they originated. </p><p>  The communicator is essentially a handheld computer.  Usually he has a large touch screen, there is a full QWERTY-keyboard.  Very convenient is the <span>touch screen</span> for games, reading books, watching movies, as well as for using e-mail and documents.  This information is not enough to understand how a smartphone differs from a communicator. </p><p>  It is important to note that when choosing a communicator, you can pay attention to the keyboard.  Most often, manufacturers, trying to place a full keyboard on the device, resort to various tricks, trying to make it small and compact or hiding it under the main panel.  In such communicators, to access the keyboard, you must slide or open the top panel.  Stand alone models equipped with a virtual keyboard.  To work with it, you can use a stylus or fingers. </p><p>  Of course, this is not all that makes a smartphone different from a communicator.  You should have enough of this information solely in order to have a common understanding on this issue.  It is important to understand that at the moment there is no hard line between these devices, therefore, they can be distinguished only by the name indicated on the package. </p>
