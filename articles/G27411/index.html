    <h2>  Bodrum Holiday Resort SPA: reviews, negative comments </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no ideal hotels (even five-star ones).  Reviews indicate the following disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  the main restaurant serves the same dishes for lunch and dinner; </li><li>  wireless internet does not work in rooms; </li><li>  on walking paths in the garden you can find huge cockroaches; </li><li>  the territory is uneven, contains many ups and downs, which is inconvenient for people with disabilities, the elderly, and also vacationing with children; </li><li>  diluted alcohol; </li><li>  lack of a beach as such (it consists of several wooden pontoons on which there are sun loungers and from which they enter the sea); </li><li>  use of the safe is paid; </li><li>  The rooms do not have slippers. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Bodrum Holiday Resort SPA 5 * is a luxurious resort that will delight with its size, architecture and landscape design.  A good location allows you to enjoy not only the surf, but also the mesmerizing mountain scenery and fresh coniferous air.  The hotel staff is extremely attentive to guests, and therefore any of your request will be fulfilled in a matter of minutes.  Of the shortcomings, perhaps, one can distinguish insufficiently varied nutrition, as well as too terrain. </p><p>  This hotel can be considered universal.  If you like outdoor activities and noisy entertainment, then prefer rooms near the pool and beach, where you can listen to music and take part in the animation program.  Fans of a relaxing holiday are advised to stay in a cottage complex, where, thanks to a separate location, no noise can be heard. </p>
