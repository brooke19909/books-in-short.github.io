Inexpensive entry-level models hardly get the whole option, which was considered advanced only a couple of years ago.  But, of course, there is no need to talk about the full compliance of the representatives of the two segments.  Those who want to get the optimal ratio of functionality and ergonomics should pay attention to the Garrett ACE 150 model. The metal detector in this version works in several modes, allowing the operator to easily control the device through the touch panel.  But this is not all the advantages that this model has. </p>

    <h2>  General Detector Information </h2><p>  The device represents a line of budget microprocessor detectors designed to search for metal objects.  It is important to note a special place in the assortment of the manufacturer, which this metal detector occupies.  Garrett ACE 150, 250 and 350 are detectors that form a single series of models for the initial segment.  The version under the index 150 received the most modest power potential, but in terms of ergonomics this is the most successful version of ACE.  This is confirmed, first of all, by an optimized configuration of settings with a minimum number of buttons.  Of course, the simplification of the control system is due to the lack of complex options in the metal detector, but professional filling is not provided for the target audience of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another feature of the device is its partial Russification.  Since 2013, the Garrett ACE 150 RUS metal detector appeared on the domestic market, the display of which received designations in Russian.  At the same time, updating the device interface did not affect its technical stuffing and operational capabilities. </p><h2>  Construction device </h2>

    <p>  Like most low-cost metal detectors, the device is equipped with a minimum set of elements to cope with basic operations.  The unit consists of two rods, a control unit, fixing hardware with seals and a coil, which should be considered separately.  The manufacturer used a 6.5x9 ‚ÄùPROformance mechanism.  This coil acts as the main, although the design provides for the inclusion of additional elements.  How appropriate is such an update is a moot point.  On the one hand, the standard Garrett ACE 150 metal detector coil is a typical mono-device that provides, at best, average values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the depth of inspection.  On the other hand, switching to reinforced coils does not always give the expected effect.  The use of a more powerful Double-D type sensor nominally expands the capabilities of the detector, but in practice there is a risk of encountering a mismatch in the component signals, which will lead to unnecessary interference. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  The model refers to devices that do not shine with ultra-high technical and operational indicators, but confidently and efficiently perform their main tasks.  The combination of a well-thought-out structural basis and modern electronic filling made it possible to form a balanced base on the basis of which the Garrett ACE 150 metal detector was developed. The characteristics of the device are presented below: </p><ul><li>  Type of metal detector - soil. </li><li>  Search Depth - 100 cm. </li><li>  The frequency of the detector is 7.2 kHz. </li><li>  Operating time without recharging - 40 hours. </li><li>  Batteries - AA batteries (4 pcs.). </li><li>  Dimensions - 55x28x14 cm. </li><li>  Weight - 1.2 kg. </li></ul><p>  The device lacks a lot of modern options, including the Bluetooth module and the ability to verify.  But, on the other hand, the creators have provided many useful additions precisely in the control and management systems of the device.  In particular, on the graphic scale 5 segments are displayed which transmit indications about metal and tasks of operation.  Here, the user can receive information about the sensor sensitivity settings and the depth of the object.  It is important to note that the sensitivity regulation in the model is performed almost like on professional detectors.  Therefore, it is likely that the device at maximum settings will fix any metal part.  In the search for treasure in the open, this option is very effective, but in domestic applications it is still desirable to use the minimum sensitivity indicators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Technological features </h2>

    <p>  If in terms of communication support the device can be called deprived, then the direct search function in the ground is implemented at the highest level in terms of technological support.  Of course, when compared with competitors in the segment.  So, the main feature of the device is the Target ID system, which, by the way, is used in professional models.  This technology has significantly expanded the range of functions for the user of the Garrett ACE 150. The metal detector makes it possible to carry out a differentiated analysis of objects.  In the process, the operator deals with two scales, one of which is designed to display information about all detected metals, and the second captures specific types of material. </p><h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  Despite the external complexity of the control unit, using it is quite simple.  Using the Power button, the device is turned on and off.  With the same button while holding it for a long time, the user can return the settings to the original factory settings.  To adjust the sensitivity, the Sensitivity button is designed, which works with four modes, the status of which is displayed.  Direct search modes are configured with the Mode key, which is also located on the Garrett ACE 150 control panel. The metal detector allows you to work with a targeted search for jewelry, coins, as well as use the general survey program for the presence of metals in the soil. </p>

    <h2>  Assembly instruction </h2><p>  First of all, it is necessary to provide the lower rod with sealing washers.  Next, the grooves on the same rod and the metal detector coil are adjusted, after which these components are connected.  The final fixation of the parts is carried out by fixing the nuts, but they should not be tightened strongly.  Then it is necessary to connect the prepared structure to the upper bar, which includes the control unit.  This is done with the help of clamps, which also allow you to adjust the length that the Garrett ACE 150 metal detector will have already assembled. The instruction recommends that special attention be paid to the instrument cable.  Its excess can be wrapped around the rod, which will preserve its integrity during operation.  The connector on the cable coming from the coil is connected to the control panel and is additionally attached with a special ring.  Immediately before work, it is necessary to open the cover of the unit and insert a free niche of the battery. </p><h2>  Service instruction </h2><p>  The manufacturer notes that even with regular use of the detector in the field, its resource lasts for many years.  But, you can always extend the working period, if you follow the rules of service.  In particular, it is recommended that you clean the control unit and coil after each search session.  All work items must be kept clean.  The instructions also note that the model is waterproof.  This is only partially true, since the main unit does not have a tight seal - accordingly, in this part of the Garrett ACE 150, the metal detector must be protected from moisture. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  The owners of the device note many of its advantages, which are due, inter alia, to belonging to the initial segment.  In particular, users point to the merits of a simplified management system.  The lack of a modern sophisticated option, especially for beginner treasure hunters, is a big plus.  Moreover, some users are even ready to abandon the display, noting that its function is superfluous.  But the main part of the positive feedback is addressed to the direct working qualities that distinguish the Garrett ACE 150 metal detector. Reviews, for example, indicate that the device accurately determines the location of target objects and correctly distinguishes metal. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The negative operating experience of this model is mainly associated with attempts to solve complex problems.  So, if you need to use increased sensitivity, there is a risk of stumbling on utilities.  At great depths, the device is not so accurate in determining the characteristics of the material, so the risk of error increases.  Experienced treasure hunters also note the lack of the option that the Garrett ACE 150 metal detector is equipped with. The reviews on the operation of the control unit are mostly devoid of criticism, however, in some search works there is a lack of advanced settings for metal analysis.  But, again, such complaints depend on the level of training of the owners themselves and the goals that they set for the equipment. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  Alternative options from the budget segment are much cheaper than this model.  For example, for 5-6 thousand rubles.  it is quite possible to find a good version of the detector with basic functionality.  But, the Garrett ACE 150 metal detector, whose price is 8-10 thousand, wins precisely due to the high-quality construction.  Along with the elemental base, effective performance of search tasks is also noted.  Therefore, an overpayment of several thousand rubles for a good-quality device in most cases justifies itself. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The model is primarily good because it is an affordable tool for a wide range of not only professionals, but also amateurs.  And the matter is not only that the detector belongs to the initial level.  The device is attractive precisely for its working properties, backed up by a simple control system.  It is also worth noting that the Garrett ACE 150 is a metal detector, the reviews of the owners of which emphasize the advantages in the form of opportunities for improving it.  This is not often found in devices from the budget segment, but in this case, the user can expand the operational parameters of the detector.  True, it is not worthwhile to independently carry out modernization.  Updating due to an expensive sensor, for example, is better to entrust to specialists who will raise the capabilities of the metal detector to a new level without unnecessary risks. </p>
