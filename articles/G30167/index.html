    <h2>  Island Description </h2><p>  Crete is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the largest - in island Greece.  Its area is more than 8000 square meters.  km, the length of the coast is about 1000 km.  Its geographical location is unique - the area where 3 parts of the world meet: Africa, Europe and Asia.  Its shores are washed by three <span>seas: Libyan,</span> Cretan and Ionian.  The capital of Crete is the ancient city of Heraklion.  Here are the main international airport on the island.  Another is located in the city of Chania.  In the beach season, regular and charter flights to both of these air harbors are made from major Russian cities.  Crete today is considered one of the most developed tourist centers not only in Greece, but throughout Europe.  And this is facilitated by both geographical and climatic features, as well as the presence of valuable historical and natural attractions, of which the ruins of Knossos Palace, the medieval Fortezza castle built by the Venetians, the Samaria Gorge, the famous cave of the Supreme God Zeus, etc. are the most popular. the islands are Agilos Nikolos, Malia, Hersonissos, Panorama, Chania, Agia Pelagia, which houses the Blue Bay Resort Spa 4 *, and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue bay resort spa 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/472289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Aghia Pelagia Village </h2><p>  This small, cozy tourist village is located on the northern coast of Crete, 20 kilometers from Heraklion.  The sea in these parts forms a wonderful bay with clear water, and this is the biggest advantage of the resort.  Compared to other areas of the island, the infrastructure is not very developed here, but for a quiet family holiday it is an ideal place.  Despite ancient history, this area began to develop as a tourist center only in the mid-60s of the 20th century, and soon a beautiful resort was formed on the site of a fishing village.  The low buildings of numerous hotels built in the traditional Greek style are arranged in the form of an amphitheater.  And below the turquoise bay flaunts with white and golden beaches, which are the paths from the hotels.  One of the best hotels forming this peculiar cascade of beige buildings is the Blue Bay Resort Spa. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  There are many different shops, restaurants, cafes, rental points, etc. But there are practically noisy entertainment centers, night clubs and discos.  Therefore, if you can not imagine a vacation without an incendiary party, you better go to a more suitable place.  But the Blue Bay Resort Spa and other hotels in this village are designed for a more quiet and measured relaxation.  True, people with disabilities will also be uncomfortable here, because winding steep paths lead to the sea from hotels.  However, representatives of this category of citizens can relax in the equally pleasant pool water, while admiring the beautiful sea views.  But for museum lovers here is a real paradise.  Guests <span>of the Blue Bay</span> Resort Spa 4 * <span>hotel</span> can visit the museum of the famous Spanish Renaissance painter, a native of Crete El Greco, as well as the Iraklinsky Historical and Archaeological Museum and the Cretan National Historical Museum.  Well, fans of myths and legends can immediately go to the ruins of the famous Knossos palace and see firsthand what remains of the mysterious <span>labyrinth of the Minotaur.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the Blue Bay Resort Spa Hotel? </h2><p>  By its type, ‚ÄúBlue Bay Resort and SPA‚Äù is a hotel complex.  It is located 150-200 meters from the Malevizi beach (Agia Pelagia).  Tourists who have bought tours to the Blue Bay Resort 4, which includes a shuttle service, will be met at <span>Heraklion Airport</span> and delivered to their destination in a comfortable minibus.  Well, to meet those who travel without a travel agency, regular buses leave from Heraklion Airport to Agia Pelagia every 2 hours (ticket price is 2.3 euros).  By the way, opposite the hotel entrance there is a bus stop, which is an absolute advantage.  After all, new arrivals do not have to drag their luggage uphill to the hotel building. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Hotel Blue Bay Resort and Spa 4 * was founded in the mid-nineties of the last century.  It consists of one two-story main building and three Annex complexes with mythical names: ‚ÄúAthena‚Äù, ‚ÄúArtemis‚Äù, ‚ÄúIcarus‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaedalus‚Äù.  Two of them (Athena and Artemis) have separate pools and playgrounds.  All rooms with sea view.  From the moment of opening, repair work is regularly carried out here.  In 2012, the central building was completely renovated, and rooms located in four other buildings are undergoing cosmetic repairs before each new season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reef oasis blue bay resort" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/472288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of the ‚ÄúBlue Bay‚Äù is the presence of a SPA center in the complex.  It is because of this that he is not confused with the hotels of the same name in different parts of the world.  However, there is also the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort on the coast of Egypt, which also has a spa.  However, it is in a higher class and is one of the most fashionable hotel complexes in Sharm el-Sheikh.  We‚Äôll talk about the Reef Oasis Blue Bay Resort 5 * some other time, and now let's return to the description of the Blue Bay Resort in Crete, which also deserves all praise.  The SPA center of the Cretan hotel is perfectly equipped with the latest technology and provides everyone with the highest level of service.  In the center there is a Turkish bath (hammam), a sauna familiar to Europeans, a spa tub with a jacuzzi, a massage room and a full range of spa treatments (peels, body wraps, masks, etc.). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue bay resort spa" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/472290.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food here is as upscale as anything else at the Blue Bay Resort Spa.  Crete, being a Greek resort, is famous for its amazing national cuisine with special notes.  The island cuisine is dominated by seafood, fresh vegetables, as well as fruits and legumes.  The hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  Vacationers eat three meals a day at the hotel‚Äôs main restaurant, where a buffet is served.  In addition, there is a √† la carte restaurant (paid) with sea views, bars "Dionysus", "Breeze", "Athena". </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Since the Menonaftis beach closest to the Blue Bay Resort is 200 meters away, you either need to go down to it on a steep but asphalt path or on a bus (free of charge) that leaves there at certain hours.  On the beach, sunbeds, umbrellas, towels and all water activities are paid.  The entrance to the sea, like on many <span>beaches of Crete, is</span> rocky, so you need special rubber shoes. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Many tourists buying tours to the Blue Bay Resort immediately agree on excursions.  However, if trips to the sights are not included in the price of your trip, it does not matter, or maybe even a big plus, since you yourself can organize them, and no worse than the operators.  To do this, you need to rent a car (for 30 euros per day), buy a map of attractions and embark on a free "swimming" in historical and mythical places.  However, Crete is famous not only for ancient architectural and other monuments.  Tourists are greatly impressed by the beauty of the world around them.  You can go to unique natural sights, to caves and lakes, to mountains and picturesque cliffs, visit secluded beaches hidden from a human eye and enjoy plenty of unity with nature.  If you do not have a driver‚Äôs license, then you can sign up for an excursion at some travel agency, where you can always find a Russian-speaking guide.  And believe me, an excursion program organized in this way will cost much less. </p>
