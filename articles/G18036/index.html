Holidays in the mountains of Italy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tourists regard Italy as a country of excursion and educational relaxation.  The eternal city of Rome, no less ancient Florence, Verona, Naples, enchanting Venice, the mysterious island of Sardinia, luxurious Milan ... From trips to these places, tourists bring a huge baggage of knowledge and impressions.  Italy is also famous for its sea resorts.  Also popular is the summer holiday on the lakes of the north of the country - Garda, Lago Maggiore, Como.  But no less than the cities and beaches of tourists attract the mountains of Italy.  What are their names?  Even a student knows that the Italian “boot” is called the Apennine Peninsula because of the mountain system of the same name.  Along its northern border are the majestic Alps.  The snow-covered four-thousandth peaks look in images from space, like a furry edge of the Apennine boot.  But this list is not limited.  What mountains are in Italy, what are they called and what are characterized by - read in this article. </p>

    <h2>  Alps </h2><p>  This is a huge mountain system, which stretches across the territory of not only Italy, but also Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France.  It is in the Alps that the highest point in Europe is located - Mont Blanc.  Here we need to make a reservation: this leadership takes place if we consider the Caucasus Range as part of Asia.  The height of the White Mountain (as the name Mont Blanc is translated) is 4808 meters, while Elbrus rises 5642 m above sea level. The Alps are considered a mountain system.  It consists of many ridges.  What are the alpine mountains of Italy called?  The list is quite extensive.  We can say that the alpine part of the country is divided into Western, Southern and Eastern.  The boundaries between them are rather arbitrary.  In order we will consider all the Alps, Apennines, mountains and volcanoes of Sicily.  Let's start from the highest point in Italy, and along with the whole of Western Europe - Mont Blanc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Western Alps </h2><p>  The conditional border in the east of this mountainous region runs along the line of the connection of lakes Como and Bodensky.  The Western Alps are heterogeneous.  They, in turn, are made up of smaller parts.  Mountains of Italy, such as the Maritime and Ligurian Alps, <span>border France</span> .  If we follow the map further to the northeast, we will see that the mountains in this part are getting higher.  These are the Cotsky, Provencal, Dauphine, Bernese, Graysky, Penninsky, Glarn and Lepontian Alps.  These mountains are characterized by steep slopes and deep gorges.  It is here that the ski resorts that take tourists all year round are located.  Indeed, in the Western Alps there are massive glaciers.  In this part there are also independent mountain ranges - Pelva and Vercor.  The highest peaks are in the Pennine Alps.  These are four thousandths such as Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa and Cervinha.  The last peak has another name - Matterhorn. </p><h2>  Central Alps </h2><p>  This part of the mountain system extends along the northern border of Italy, which is adjacent to eastern Switzerland and the Austrian province of Tyrol.  She is also very tall.  But the peaks here reach only 3899 meters above sea level (Ortles).  What are the mountains of Italy called in this area?  Allocate the Lombard Alps, and in them - the Bergamsky.  Here the highest point is Mount Coca (3052 m).  The border between Italy and Austria runs along an array called the Ötztal Alps.  The highest point of this ridge - the Wildspitze mountain - reaches 3,768 meters in height.  In the east, the Ötztal Alps pass into the Stubai.  In this massif, the highest point is the Zuckerhutl peak (3507 m).  Glaciation also occurs in the Central Alps (in the Ortles, Adamello and Bernina massifs).  These ranges are characterized by a wide strip of foothills.  They are occupied by alpine meadows.  Where the slopes divide the spur valleys, there are beautiful <span>mountain lakes.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Eastern Alps </h2><p>  This is a small area.  And not the highest in the Alps.  But this is no less picturesque.  The Eastern Alps are divided into Julian and Dolomites.  The first mountain system is partially located in Italy (Friuli-Venezia Giulia region), as well as in Slovenian Krajina.  The name of these Alps comes from Julius Caesar, who passed here with the army and founded the <span>province of the Roman Empire</span> with the capital Cividale.  The highest point of this massif (and at the same time Slovenia, and the whole of the former Yugoslavia) is Mount Triglav.  Its height is 2864 meters above sea level.  But do not underestimate the Julian Alps.  This is a paradise for cavers.  Here is one of the deepest caves in the world - Cheki-2.  She goes underground for one and a half kilometers.  And in the cave Vrtoglavice is the deepest continuous natural well (six hundred meters).  In this part of the Alps are the mountains of Italy, which should be specifically mentioned. </p>

    <h2>  Monte Pallidi </h2><p>  This system of ridges was called so until the French geologist Deodat de Dolomieu arrived there in the eighteenth century.  He investigated the mineral, from which these Monte Pallidi, Pale Mountains, were composed mainly.  The breed has an interesting property to reflect the sun's rays.  The mineral was named after the French geologist Dolomite.  Perhaps these are the <span>most beautiful mountains of</span> Italy.  Photos of dolomites illuminated by the setting sun and shimmering in different colors, from red to cream, are the visiting card of this massif.  Monte Pallidi stretched one hundred and fifty kilometers.  They have eighteen peaks, the height of which exceeds the mark of three thousand meters (Mount Marmolada).  It should be said about the unusual origin of the <span>Dolomites.</span>  These are coral reefs that ascended as a result of volcanic activity.  In Monte Pallidi, which in 2009 were fully included in the list of the natural heritage of mankind, there are many reserves.  Dolomiti Bellunesi is the most famous of them. </p>

    <h2>  Apennines </h2><p>  The question of where in Italy there are mountains is idle.  They are everywhere, with the exception of the wide Po Valley and the lowlands near Venice.  Along the entire Italian “boot”, the Apennines stretched for a thousand and a half kilometers, giving the name to the entire peninsula.  They are inferior in height to the Alps.  The highest point of the Apennines - the peak of the Corno Grande - does not reach even three thousand meters above sea level.  However, these are the youngest mountains on our planet.  A very extensive system, of course, is divided into arrays, chains and ridges.  The highest is considered the Gran Sasso.  The name of this mountain range is translated as "Big Stone".  It is in it that the peak of Korno (2914 meters) is located.  Since the Apennines are young mountains, volcanic activity has not died out in them.  Unfortunately, earthquakes are also frequent.  Famous volcanoes include Mount Vesuvius.  Its height is only 1277 meters, but eruptions are very powerful.  Amiata is another <span>highest mountain of the</span> Apennines with volcanic activity.  In the southeastern part of this system there are karst and lava plateaus of Le Murge and Monte Gargano.  The Apennines, merging in the north with the Ligurian Alps, in the south smoothly pass to the mountains of Sicily.  Mountains on the toe of the Italian “boot” reach a height of 1956 m. They are called the Calabrian Apennines. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What mountains are in Italy" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1238506.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Mountains of italian islands </h2><p>  Let us first consider Sicily - the “pebble” that kicks the “boot”.  The relief of this island is also very mountainous.  In a relatively small space, several arrays fit at once.  These are Peloritani, Nebrodi, Le Madonie and Ibleyskie mountains.  This whole system is related by origin to the Apennines.  Volcanic activity has also not died out here, which is manifested in the obstinate and unforeseen character of Etna.  The height of this mountain reaches 3340 meters above sea level.  Near Sicily are the islands of Vulcano and Stromboli.  Scientists associate their origin with the underground activity of the subsoil.  Sardinia in relief is not much different from Sicily.  Here are mountains of Italy such as Gennargentu.  This is a short chain.  The main peak - Mount La Marmora - reaches 1834 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Ski holidays in Italy </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the most popular are the alpine resorts, although they are not lacking in the Apennines.  Probably the reason is that in Lavigno, Cervinha you can ride all year round because of the glacier.  The Apennines attract not only skiers.  There are developed alternative types of outdoor activities: climbing, trekking, orienteering.  Alpine resorts in Italy are not much inferior to the world famous Swiss Courchevel.  And the prices are lower.  And no matter what mountains in Italy you choose for your winter holiday, first-class service awaits you everywhere.  It is interesting that, having risen on a lift to the top of the ski slopes in Cervinha, you can famously go ... to Switzerland.  Tourists enjoy popular resorts such as Bormio, Dolomites-Superski and Cortina d'Ampezzo.  In the long Apennine mountains there is an array of Abruzzo.  It is famous not only for ski resorts, but also for picturesque villages, which have clung like swallow nests over cliffs.  People come here to ride and visit national parks, because here preserved virgin nature with numerous lakes. </p><h2>  Holidays in the mountains of Italy on thermal waters </h2><p>  The youth of the Alpine and Apennine systems, not extinct volcanic activity contributed to the emergence of many hot keys.  In their place in the Middle Ages resorts appeared.  They are called "terme" (baths).  These are not saunas and not Russian steam rooms, although recently there are also plenty of such spa services.  The most famous thermal resorts in the Alps are Sirmione (on Lake Garda, in Lombardy), Abano Terme (in the province of Veneto), Erbusco and Merano (in South Tyrol).  In the Apennines mountain system, the most popular are <span>San Giuliano Terme, Terme de Medici,</span> Monsumman and Montecatini. </p>
