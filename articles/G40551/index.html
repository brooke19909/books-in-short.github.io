This is the Russian admiral, who once commanded the Baltic Fleet.  The glory was brought to him by the victory of the Second Archipelago expedition over the Turks in the <span>Athos battle,</span> as well as under the Dardanelles, at the head of which he was.  No less important in the biography of Senyavin is the fact that, being in the rank of flag captain, he supervised the first construction work on the construction of the fortified city, which a year later, from February 1783, became known as Sevastopol.

    <h2>  A family </h2><p>  Dmitry Nikolaevich Senyavin was born in the new style 6, and in the old one on August 17, 1763 in the village of Komlevo, which was located in the Borovsky district of the Kaluga region.  His family belonged to a noble family known in the country, the fate of whose representatives was inextricably linked with the Russian fleet from the very beginning of its foundation. </p><p>  The father of the future admiral, Nikolai Fedorovich, was a retired premier major.  For some time he served as adjutant general, serving under Alexei Naumovich Senyavin, who was his cousin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The noble family, to which the future admiral belonged, had its roots in the very revival of the Russian fleet.  So, the grandfather of the famous naval commander, Ivan Akimovich, served as the boatswain under Peter I. Under him, he also rose to the rank of rear admiral. </p><p>  His brother Naum Akimovich, who distinguished himself in 1719 in battles with the Swedes near the island of Ezel, was able to make an equally brilliant career.  Dmitry Nikolayevich‚Äôs father was the military governor of Kronstadt in the 1770s, rising to the rank of vice admiral.  When the boy was ten years old, the parent personally took him to the Naval Cadet Corps.  There he left his son. </p><h2>  Studying and starting a service </h2><p>  In the Naval Cadet Corps of the future Admiral D.N.  Senyavin was enrolled in 1773. In his studies, he showed great abilities, thanks to which he was one of the first to graduate from this institution.  Already at the age of 14, on the November days of 1777, the young man was promoted to midshipman.  In this rank, he swam for three years, having managed to participate in several campaigns. </p>

In these descriptions, that marine life that existed during the time of Ochakov and the conquest of the Crimean peninsula was betrayed.  The old man's memories wore a somewhat idealized form.  For example, he argued that in those years "everyone was blush and cheerful, and now you can see only dullness, bile and pallor around."

After he managed to pass the exam and became a warrant officer.  In this rank, he first went on his voyage to the city of Lisbon.  The purpose of the campaign was to support the armed neutrality of Empress Catherine II, which was associated with the war for independence, which was waged in the North American colonies. </p>

Already in 1782, the young midshipman was transferred to the Khotin corvette, located in the Azov fleet.  A year later, he received the rank of lieutenant.  During the construction of the new Russian naval base (Sevastopol), Senyavin, who was in the position of flag officer, was the closest assistant to Admiral Mackenzie.  It was then that he was noticed by the Governor General of New Russia, which was Prince Potemkin.  The future admiral dealt with construction issues until 1786. After he was transferred to a floating crew, he was appointed commander of a packet boat called Karabut, who maintained relations with the Russian ambassador in Turkey.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Rapid career growth </h2><p>  In 1787 - 1791, the future Admiral Senyavin was under the command of Ushakov.  In the same period, when Russia was at war with the Turks, he had to go through a harsh military school.  At the very beginning of hostilities, he was a flag captain, serving in the squadron of Voinovich.  Already on June 3, 1788, the Black Sea Fleet defeated Fr.  Fidonisi.  Ushakov, who led the Russian avant-garde, was especially distinguished in this battle. </p><p>  At a time when a sufficiently strong Turkish fleet was trying to help the besieged Russian Ochakov from the sea, Senyavin with five cruisers was sent to the shores of Anatolia.  The purpose of our sailors was to divert the attention of the Turks and disrupt their communication lines.  Historians report that already here Senyavin showed outstanding ability.  Carrying out his first independent actions, the <span>naval officer</span> managed to take several prizes and destroy a dozen Turkish ships. <br>  Senyavin took part in the battle of Kaliakria.  It was the last in the Russian-Turkish war of 1787 - 1791. </p><p>  Such successful actions contributed to the fact that Senyavin was assigned to command the ship "Leonty Martyr".  After he began to lead the ship "Vladimir".  Already in the 4th year of the war (in 1791) he was the commander of the Navarkhiya vessel, which was part of the Ushakov squadron. </p><h2>  The battles with the French </h2><p>  After the end of hostilities with the <span>Turkish fleet,</span> Senyavin continued to command the battleship entering the Ushakov squadron.  08/13/798 the Mediterranean Russian fleet left Sevastopol.  He went to Constantinople to connect with the ships of Turkey.  This squadron and made for the battle with the French. </p>

    <p>  The most protected of all the islands were Santa Mavra and Corfu.  Take the first of them and was received Senyavin, who, being <span>captain of the first rank,</span> commanded the ship "St.  Peter".  The frigate ‚ÄúNavarchy‚Äù helped him in this, as well as two ships of the Turks.  Senyavin coped with the task assigned to him successfully.  Santa Mavra Fortress fell on November 2.  In his report on the capture of the island, Ushakov gave a positive assessment of the actions taken by Senyavin. </p><p>  After the siege of Corfu, Russian sailors took other Ionian islands.  After that, they liberated Rome and the Kingdom of Naples from the French. </p><h2>  New appointments </h2><p>  Ushakov's squadron returned to Sevastopol in 1800. Senyavin, who distinguished himself in battle, was appointed to command the Kherson port.  In the same position since 1803, he began to serve in Sevastopol.  A year later, Senyavin was appointed naval commander and transferred to Revel.  Here he was until 1805. In the same year he was assigned to command the Russian squadron, which was sent to Sevastopol to carry out a new combat mission. </p><h2>  Senyavin's career at the beginning of the 19th century </h2><p>  After Russia in the late 18th century.  She was able to win a number of victories, under the leadership of her troops, the great commander Suvorov and the remarkable naval commander Ushakov, her influence on European affairs and international significance significantly increased. <br>  In the same period, a struggle was waged between England and France, who embarked on the capitalist path of development.  These countries fought for world domination.  At the same time, Napoleon's aggressive policy began to threaten Russia's interests.  This led to the aggravation of contradictions between the great states. </p><p>  Since 1804, Russia has taken a number of measures aimed at concentrating forces in the Mediterranean Sea.  She increased the number of warships and transferred from Sevastopol to about.  Corfu Infantry Division. </p><p>  In the spring of 1805, Russia and England entered into an agreement between themselves, which approved the joint actions of states directed against France.  Naples and Austria also entered into this union. </p><p>  In September 1805, a Russian squadron headed by D.N. was sent to the Archipelago from Krondstat.  Senyavin, who had previously been promoted to vice admiral.  The expedition arrived safely in Corfu.  Here Senyavin took command of the Russian land and naval forces in the Mediterranean.  The main task of the Vice Admiral concerned the protection of the Ionian Islands, which served as the base of the Russian fleet, as well as preventing the capture of Greece by Napoleon. </p>

He was occupied by Montenegro, as well as the region of Kattaro.  In order to win over the local <span>population, the inhabitants</span> of the regions occupied by Russian were exempted from all duties on his orders.  In addition, under the leadership of Senyavin, convoys of ships heading to Constantinople and Trieste were organized, which greatly intensified trade in these areas.

    <p>  In December 1806, Turkey, instigated by Napoleon, decided to declare war on Russia.  And already in early January of next year, a new squadron was sent to Corfu, commanded by Captain-Commander Ignatiev. </p><h2>  Trekking in the Aegean </h2><p>  Admiral Senyavin received an instruction from Russia, from which it followed that his task was to capture Constantinople, the blockade of Egypt, protect Corfu, as well as obstruct communication between France and Turkey.  If the admiral blindly followed all the instructions, then he would certainly have been defeated by spraying the forces at his disposal.  Senyavin made the right decision, leaving part of his army to defend Corfu, leaving the remaining troops in the Archipelago to solve the main problem.  In February 1807, his squadron set off for the waters of the Aegean Sea.  In order to ensure the surprise of the actions taken by him, Senyavin ordered to detain all merchant ships encountered on his way.  Thus, no one was able to warn the enemy about the approach of the Russian squadron. </p><h2>  The battle for the Dardanelles </h2><p>  The Russian government hoped that the British would go to the aid of Senyavin, having advanced the squadron of Admiral Dukworth to the Aegean Sea.  This, however, did not happen.  The British, who tried to prevent events, decided to capture Constantinople earlier than the Russians did.  In February 1807, a squadron of Misty Albion passed the Dardanelles and appeared near Constantinople.  The British began to negotiate with the Turks, during which the latter were able to significantly strengthen in the strait.  Dukworth left the coastal waters of Constantinople, suffering heavy losses during his retreat. </p>

His combat mission was very complicated.  Dukworth did not come to the aid of our squadron, having gone to Malta.

    <p>  After that, the Russian admiral gathered a military council, which decided not to do anything except the blockade of the Dardanelles.  To create a maneuverable base, Russian troops captured the Tenedos fortress, which was located on a nearby island.  After that, the blockade of the Dardanelles began.  It was the duty of two ships at the strait, not allowing merchant ships to enter the fortress.  All these actions caused hunger in Constantinople and the discontent of its inhabitants.  To lift the blockade, the Turks sent their fleet to the strait. </p><p>  The Dardanelles battle took place on May 10, 1807. Our squadron, taking advantage of the southwestern gusts of wind favorable to it, headed for rapprochement with the enemy.  The fleet of Turks did not want to accept the battle and went to the Dardanelles.  By eight o‚Äôclock in the evening, the Russian squadron caught up with the enemy, entering into battle with him.  Russian ships, the number of which was much smaller, perfectly maneuvered.  They did not adhere to a single system and used fire simultaneously from both sides.  In the dark of night, Turkish batteries fired shots not only at Russians.  Sometimes they fell into their ships.  The battle lasted until midnight.  As a result, 3 enemy ships, which could not move due to severe damage, stumbled into the shallows, and the rest managed to slip into the Dardanelles. </p><p>  At dawn on May 11, the Turks began towing their damaged ships.  The Senyavins were ordered to attack the enemy‚Äôs ships.  Only one of them managed to slip into the Dardanelles.  The other two were thrown ashore by the Turks.  This ended the battle of the Dardanelles, which disabled three Turkish warships.  Losses of the enemy in manpower at the same time reached 2000 people. <br>  The blockade of the Dardanelles led to the complete cessation of food supplies to Constantinople.  The discontent of the local population intensified, as a result of which there was a coup that overthrew Selim III, after which Sultan Mustafa IV received power. </p><p>  The defeat of the Turkish fleet was also inflicted in the Athos battle, which took place on June 19, 1807. Here Senyavin used the latest methods of warfare, using wake column attacks, attacking one enemy ship with two Russians, etc.  For the courage shown, the naval commander was awarded the honorary order of St. Alexander Nevsky. </p><h2>  Return to the Baltic </h2><p>  08/12/807, Turkey, struck at sea, was forced to sign a truce.  According to the Peace Treaty of Tilsit, Alexander I ceded Napoleon the Dalmatian and Ionian Islands.  In addition, Turkey got back its island of Theodos.  Upon learning of this, Dmitry Nikolaevich could not restrain his tears.  Such an agreement crossed out all the victories of the Russian fleet.  Soon his squadron returned to his homeland.  Senyavin sent to the Baltic. </p><p>  During the war with Napoleon, Senyavin commanded the Revel squadron, which patrolled off the English coast.  The naval commander considered this inaction.  He wrote a translation report, but he remained unanswered.  In 1813, Vice Admiral Senyavin resigned, having received only a half pension.  The family of Dmitry Nikolaevich suffered financial difficulties. </p><p>  But everything changed after the coming to power of Nicholas I. Senyavin returned to service.  The king appointed him a personal adjutant general, transferring after the commander of the Baltic Fleet.  Senyavin was promoted to admiral in 1826. And already the following year he received diamond signs for the <span>Order of Alexander Nevsky</span> .  This happened after the victory of the joint squadron of Russia, France and England over the Turkish-Egyptian ships in <span>the battle of Navarino.</span> </p><p>  In 1830, Dmitry Nikolaevich became seriously ill.  April 5, 1831, he died.  The funeral of the Russian admiral was very solemn.  The command of the honorary escort of the Life Guards of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, while giving the last honors to Senyavin, was carried out by Nicholas I. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Admirals of the Russian Empire are not forgotten by grateful descendants.  Lives in our hearts and the memory of Dmitry Nikolaevich Senyavin. </p><p>  So, the marine technical college is named after him.

    <p>  Depicted D.N.  Senyavin at the monument "1000th anniversary of Russia."  It is located in Novgorod, in the very center of its Kremlin.  This is a unique monument, which simply does not exist in the world.  It was not posed in honor of one event and is dedicated to more than one person.  He tells the descendants of the whole millennium and perpetuates the memory of the whole people.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating this monument belongs to Alexander II.  In total, the monument ‚Äú1000th Anniversary of Russia‚Äù depicts 109 figures of statesmen, heroes and military men, enlighteners and artists who were personally approved by the tsar. </p><p> Anyone who has ever seen this colossal mass of metal in the form of a silent bell at least once in his life will never be able to forget about it.  Just as the exploits of those Russian people who faithfully served for the good of their Fatherland are not forgotten. </p>
