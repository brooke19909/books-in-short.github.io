If previously only premium-class devices were equipped with them, now any, even budget, smartphone model has a <span>touch screen.</span>  However, a similar approach was seen at one time with support for such an audio format as MP3.  Why all this?

    <p>  The device works in second generation cellular networks.  The diagonal of the screen is three inches.  The device is equipped with one camera module, its resolution is 3.2 megapixels.  The amount of internal memory for storing user information is 50 megabytes.  There is the possibility of expansion through the use of external microSD drives up to 8 gigabytes.  A lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1000 milliampere-hours was used as a source of battery life.  The smartphone is presented in a classic form factor. </p><h2>  Device History </h2>

However, this is not entirely accurate.  The fact is that smartphones have their own operating systems with a wide range of distinctive functionalities.  But the model we are talking about today is nothing more than a phone with a touch screen.  At one time, LG released a device that literally undermined the inaccessibility of touch phones for a huge mass of buyers.  It was a model KR500.  Actually, for a South Korean company this has become a reference point.  The creation of the Samsung La Fleur GT-S5230 phone in 2011, a description of which the reader can meet in today's review, was a symmetrical response to the LG promotion of the device under the name KR500. </p><h2>  Exterior </h2>

    <p>  <span>Phone Samsung</span> La Fleur GT-S5230 can be called compact.  It is this opinion that arises when you first familiarize yourself with the model.  Most likely, this feeling is created due to the fact that the body is quite thin.  People who decided to try using the device for a long time were surprised at how light it is.  Most likely, many of them expected that the touch display will increase the size, but in reality everything turned out differently.  There is no need to talk about management: it is convenient to use the phone with one hand and two. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2>

    <p>  The manufacturing material for La Fleur Samsung GT-S5230 is mainly plastic.  It is not very high-quality, fingerprinting the back or front panel will not be difficult.  However, a fancy pattern is applied to the lid, and thanks to this, the prints are not striking.  But here's the problem: what to do with the front panel?  The pattern is not applied to it.  And we have no choice but to endure or simply not pay attention to this lack of attention.  Other few elements are made of metal.  This, in particular, the insert under the display, as well as the framing of the front panel. </p><h2>  Controls </h2>

They are intended, as you might have guessed, to receive or reset a voice call, go back, take a picture with the camera active, and also lock the screen.  Of course, it could not do without a paired key designed to adjust the volume or sound mode.  These controls are located under the screen of the device, as well as on its side faces.  The communication connector is located under the volume buttons. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The TFT matrix in the La Fleur Samsung GT-S5230 is made using resistive technology.  To be honest, this is a bit even an amazing fact, because manufacturers at that time tried to maximize the introduction of capacitive displays.  Even more interesting, in the nearest competitor to the model, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãalso resistive.  In general, this can not be explained logically, one can only guess why the Koreans decided to keep up with their competitors, and not step over them in this direction.  In any case, it should be noted that the resistive matrix has not only its drawbacks, but also advantages.  In our case, this is a response to touching with other objects, and not just with fingers.  Nevertheless, the stylus is not included in the package of delivery for such purposes. </p><h2>  Resolution and quality </h2>

    <p>  La Fleur Samsung GT-S5230 Display <span>Resolution</span> <strong> </strong>  is 240 by 400 pixels.  The picture is displayed as WQVGA.  For mid-range phones that are equipped with touchscreens, this resolution is becoming standard.  Color reproduction is at a level, the shades look quite natural.  Of course, the display is not the best of those that have competitors in the segment.  The brightness is sufficient when working indoors, but the screen will definitely fade when switching to bright sunlight. </p><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  The base for the phone was the platform, which is standard for many devices of the South Korean manufacturer.  There is a certain set of widgets that can be marked on the screen in standby mode.  Their set, by the way, is also standard for a Samsung device.  We are talking about widgets displaying time and date, links to the most commonly used functions.  The developers and services of the standard online did not pass by.  This is, first of all, news and weather.  Additionally, there are smaller versions of the player and notes. </p><h2>  Differences </h2><p>  What has changed compared to other versions?  Probably, the fact that the screen with widgets cannot be scrolled from bottom to top or vice versa.  Now it scrolls from left to right, and from right to left.  Is this solution practical?  It is quite possible, since now it is possible to create three sets of widgets at the discretion of the user, and at the same time they will not overlap each other, because the place and placement will be optimized with a maximum coefficient.  Literally one slide to the side is enough to move between widget pages.  Already here the first inclinations appeared, later implemented in the Android operating system.  These are three small squares that are located below.  They are needed so that the user can accurately determine which page he is currently on. </p><h2>  Responsiveness </h2><p>  Another argument that gives us reason to positively evaluate the work with widgets is the speed of their work and movement on the screens.  Processing does not last so long, everything in the framework of decency, lags or ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù during repeated tests was not noticed.  In similar devices, working with widgets takes a greater amount of time.  Here we can make one more conclusion: to a greater extent, working with these elements does not depend on how powerful the device‚Äôs filling is, but on which version of the firmware is installed in this device. </p><h2>  Typing </h2><p>  There is no physical keyboard unit in this unit.  And this means that you can only type text using the touch screen.  The user can select one of the input options.  The most popular and convenient is the layout, consisting of 12 positions.  By the way, it should be noted that the keys themselves are quite large.  You can get on them, even using one finger, what can you say about working with the stylus?  False clicks should not be. </p><p>  The phone is equipped with an accelerometer, it works when you turn the device.  The keyboard will be redrawn automatically.  However, the keys will become slightly smaller.  In order not to be mistaken when entering, you can follow the prompts that will notify the user about which character was entered. </p><h2>  Options Samsung La Fleur GT-S5230 </h2><p>  Instruction, phone, charger, battery and wired headphones - the package is almost minimal.  We won‚Äôt find anything else here. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  What do customers of this phone model say?  In their opinion, it leaves a rather pleasant impression.  The capabilities of the touch display for that time were completely implemented by the developers.  Due to the fact that they were able to improve the interface, add popular widgets, the device has become very popular. </p>
