Thanks to this, tourists of all kinds of incomes can be in this huge complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel Golden 5 Topaz located </h2><p>  Very close to the Egyptian resort city of Hurghada, on the very coast of the Red Sea, there are a large number of hotels that flock to tourists from all over the world.  Among them was built a modern hotel called Golden 5 Topaz Hotel 4 *.  It is located at a distance of about 17 km from the city center and its various shops, shops and cafes.  So, it will not be difficult for vacationers to get out of the hotel territory one day, take a taxi or public transport and visit Hurghada itself. </p><p>  The path to the hotel from the international airport will take literally 20 or 30 minutes, because you will need to drive only 10 km.

Next to it is also another hotel of this chain.  This is <span>Golden 5 Sapphire Suites Hotel</span> 4 *.

    <h2>  What food is available for vacationers? </h2><p>  Any potential vacationer will certainly have a question about food.  This problem is especially relevant when traveling to a distant country in which the food may not be the same as what we are used to at home.  However, tourists may not worry about this if they decide to go on vacation to Egypt.  Golden 5 Topaz, like almost most hotels of this country on the Red Sea, provides its guests with fresh and tasty products on an all-inclusive basis.  Thanks to this service, anyone will not only be full throughout the day, but will also be able to use any drinks, including alcoholic drinks, but only locally produced for free.  Of course, there is also imported alcohol in the hotel, but you will have to pay extra for it separately. </p><p>  For three main meals, tourists are invited to a restaurant called La Perla, which is the main one at this hotel.  It is designed for 320 people at the same time and offers a variety of dishes of international cuisine, so no one will definitely leave the hungry.  By the way, any of the hotel guests can also eat in the main restaurants of other hotels in the complex. </p><p>  On the territory of Golden 5 Topaz there are also two specialized restaurants - La Luna (Italian cuisine) and Mumbai (Indian cuisine).  There are five more similar establishments in the entire hotel complex.  Any guest has the opportunity to visit each of them for free once, but according to the preliminary reserve of the table.  But in <span>the a la carte restaurant</span> called Sea Food, which is located in the Golden 5 Emerald hotel, you will have to go only at your own expense and also by a prior appointment. </p>

    <p>  Guests can enjoy light snacks and a drink in the pool bar called La Brasseri.  He works from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In the lobby, the bar works much longer: from 10 am to 2 nights, but in the billiard room - only from 18:30 to 23:00.  But these two bars serve exceptionally varied drinks. </p><p>  However, this is by no means the entire list of bars that are available to guests of the Golden 5 Topaz Hotel (Hurghada).  The beach, owned by the hotel complex, has its own institution of a similar plan, in which you can taste delicious pizza or pasta, as well as a variety of drinks with or without alcohol.  There are also two bars near the water park and others, scattered throughout the complex.  They work from morning to sunset and daily offer light refreshments and drinks to vacationers. </p><h2>  What is a hotel beach? </h2><p>  You should talk about the beach at Golden 5 City separately.  This is a spacious sandy beach, the length of which is as much as one and a half kilometers.  It has everything for a comfortable stay by the water: umbrellas, sun loungers and towels are provided for free.  Right next to the sea you can play volleyball or squash, as well as spend time watching animation programs.  The sand on the beach is clean and soft, but still have to get special slippers.  After all, there are small coral reefs here, to admire which is one great pleasure for many vacationers. </p>

    <p>  Golden 5 Topaz is approximately 800 meters from the beach.  You can easily overcome this distance on foot, enjoying beautiful views of the rich territory of the complex, or use special free transport that runs quite often between the hotel and the beach. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the Golden 5 Topaz Hotel </h2><p>  On such a large territory it is very difficult to get bored, especially since there are plenty of various entertainments and activities for leisure.  The complex has its own water sports center, where for a fee you can go windsurfing, snorkelling or take an exciting boat trip on a yacht or other swimming facility.  It is possible to completely plunge into the underwater world, using the services of a diving center. </p><p>  For fans of entertainment on land, horseback riding, biking or typewriting are also offered for some money.  You can even rent a limo here.  A visit to the wellness center is also paid, but here you can get a quality full body massage, relax in the jacuzzi and go to the sauna or steam room. </p>

    <p>  Those who do not want to spend extra money also have something to please themselves.  First of all, it is necessary to watch the show ‚ÄúThe Singing Fountains‚Äù at least once during the whole rest, which starts daily at 21:00 and lasts half an hour.  And entertainment programs from a group of animators will not let any hotel guest get bored for a whole day. </p><p>  For lovers of outdoor activities there is the opportunity to play billiards, mini-golf, table and tennis.  Each room has 1 free hour of play per stay.  You can also visit the gym, where there is first-class equipment so that any tourist can stay in top shape.  And near one of the hotel's pools there are 5 water slides from which you can freely ride for both children and adults. </p><h2>  Be sure to go to the water park </h2><p>  Great entertainment for guests of all ages will be the Aqua Planet water park, which recently opened its doors to all vacationers in the Golden 5 City hotel complex. </p><p>  Its total area is just over 26 thousand square meters, and it can accommodate about 3000 visitors at a time.  Here everyone will find entertainment to their liking.  After all, the local slides of different heights and complexity are suitable for both extreme lovers and those who like to relax more peacefully.  And in the waters of a slowly flowing special river, you can slowly ride along the entire perimeter of the water park.  There is also a simple recreation area near the pool, restaurants and fast food bars, and, of course, a special town created especially for young guests of the complex. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to relax with children in the hotel? </h2><p>  Since now so many are sent to foreign countries with their kids, this question can not be left aside.  The Golden 5 Topaz Hotel has all the conditions for families with children of all ages to feel comfortable throughout their stay. </p><p>  One crib can be put in each room for free, the subsequent ones will be at an additional cost.  In the restaurants you will surely find highchairs, as well as a special menu and even a corner for children.  A variety of playgrounds, children's pools and slides will not leave indifferent any child who came here.  And so that the rest of a child aged 4 to 12 years was even more fun, you can bring him to a special kids club with animation.  For babies for a fee, you can always invite a nanny. </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists about the rest in the hotel </h2><p>  For those who are just planning to come to the Golden 5 Topaz for the first time, reviews about it will be very helpful.  Indeed, thanks to the impressions of others, you can add the most complete picture of the hotel. </p><p>  Most of our compatriots are satisfied with the choice of hotel.  Many liked the spacious and bright rooms, but often guests talk about the need for repairs and more frequent cleaning.  The highest praise from tourists goes to a well-groomed and beautiful area.  The food in the restaurants is very diverse, according to our compatriots, so anyone here will find dishes to their liking.  The guests praise the helpful staff of the hotel, but some of the animators are not very flattering, noting sometimes interesting events.  However, the lack of sun loungers both on the beach and near the pools during the period of the largest influx of guests most often causes the most concern. </p>
