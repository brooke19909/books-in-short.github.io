It has long entered our daily lives.  People coming from work or school, want to relax and watch a movie or listen to the news, and not look on the Internet for something interesting.  Of course, this is exactly what happens in cities, but in villages there may be a weak signal, which does not allow you to watch TV. </p><p>  In this case, it is necessary to solve the problem.  Usually they install a satellite dish, which allows you to qualitatively solve this.  Unfortunately, its cost and annual fee can be quite large for you.  What can be done in this case? </p><h2>  Antennas </h2><p>  Today you can find many different antennas that will get the desired result.  You can choose this device for any wallet.

    <p>  Each antenna can receive a signal and be used as a digital one.  It depends on the distance of the tower and obstacles to the signal.  If the house is located close to the relay tower, then you can receive a signal even with an ordinary bare television cable. </p><p>  Of course, if the area is located far enough from the tower, then you need to look for alternative options.  What to choose an antenna for giving with an amplifier?  Let's deal with this issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of antennas </h2><p>  Choosing a suitable antenna, you will see that there are a fairly large number of them.  They differ in type and method of installation and gain.  All of them are installed in different conditions.  To determine which antenna is needed, it is worth deciding on the type of location and signal amplification. </p><h2>  Indoor antenna for summer house with amplifier </h2><p>  The antennas that are installed indoors are quite compact and can be installed on a flat surface.  This species, therefore, differs from its outdoor alternative.  Unfortunately, indoor antennas need to be installed only in the city, next to it, or in the case when the cottage is located close to the tower.  In other cases, you will not be able to improve signal reception.  It should also be remembered that in one room the signal can be quite strong, and when transferred it is lost.  This happens due to walls or other obstacles. </p>

    <h2>  Digital antennas for outdoor use </h2><p>  Outdoor antennas are different from indoor ones.  They are installed in houses that are far beyond the city, where conventional antennas are not able to catch the signal.  This look will improve the quality of reception.  Of course, these antennas are often used, and therefore they have many types.  They are divided according to the type of amplification and the method of installation.  Which gain antenna to choose for a summer residence? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most common antennas are passive.  They do not have additional modules that enable additional amplification.  Of course, they can catch and slightly enhance the quality of reception, but usually this is not enough if the cottage is far from the relay tower.  Even such a simple look has some positive aspects.  <span>The passive antenna</span> does not introduce noise into the signal, which ensures high-quality reproduction, of course, if there is enough power. </p><p>  The second type is active antennas.  In size, they are similar to the previous view, but have additional microcircuits to amplify the signal.  They can be contained both in the antenna itself and separately from it in the form of an additional module.  Of course, it needs power, it is installed from a conventional outlet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="television antennas with an amplifier for giving" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1844877.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <p>  The last type is directional antennas, which are similar to active in their design.  The main differences are that directional antennas are larger in size and have some additional modules.  Thus, in this form, a long core is installed, and elements providing amplification are connected to it.  Directional antennas are perfect for remote areas, they qualitatively catch and amplify the signal.  You can also pick up an amplifier for the TV antenna in the country to improve the signal. </p><p>  Unfortunately, even when choosing a powerful antenna, you can get a distorted signal.  Before buying, you need to determine the distance from the tower to the antenna and choose the most suitable option. </p><h2>  Gain </h2><p>  What to choose an antenna with an amplifier for giving?  Before this, it is necessary to understand the technical characteristics of the device.  <span>For a television outdoor antenna</span> with an amplifier for giving, this is the gain, which is measured in dB.  This indicator will show us how well you can receive a signal for a specific area.  Of course, the larger this indicator, the better the reception quality and, accordingly, the higher the price.  It is recommended to choose an antenna with a suitable coefficient. </p>

    <h2>  Choosing a cable to connect </h2><p>  After choosing a suitable outdoor antenna with an amplifier for gardening, you can proceed to installation and configuration. </p><p>  In order not to disturb the whole picture, you need to purchase a good cable, as it also complements the quality of signal transmission.  Even if you purchased an expensive receiver and antenna, a poor-quality cable can break everything.  Of course, it will correspond to a high price.  You should also take into account the thickness of the central core, which should be quite thick, and the outer braid.  Before connecting, it is worth checking the wave impedance, which should be about 75 ohms. </p>

    <h2>  Rating of the best models </h2><p>  What to choose an antenna with an amplifier for giving?  It is quite difficult to advise something, since each person will have different conditions for receiving a signal.  Different terrain and distance from the repeater tower determines the appropriate antenna.  The rating of the best models will help you choose the right option. </p><ol><li>  Firm "Delta".  The antennas of this company are considered very high quality, and they occupy first places in many tops, our rating was no exception.  This happened thanks to a wide range.  It includes various narrowly directed antennas capable of receiving decimeter and meter waves, as well as broadband devices.  Almost all models can use a digital signal.  To connect, you must install the wire in the connector in which there is an F-connector.  Antennas of the Delta company receive a signal with high quality and are quite easy to install. </li><li>  In second place are the Locus antennas.  This company develops passive and active models.  They develop fairly high-quality models that are inexpensive.  Antennas can usually be connected to 3 TVs.  To install a model from Locus, special skills are not required, everything is elementary here. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor television antennas with an amplifier for gardening" class="if" height="196" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43007/1844880.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The third place is Harpoon.  It is a good manufacturer that supplies quality antennas of any kind.  Mostly Harpoon products have average prices.  The manufacturer claims that all models can receive a rather bad signal.  Studies and user comments show that antennas do a good job. </li><li>  Next comes GoldMaster.  The antennas of this company are the last in the ranking of the most popular models.  They are very high quality receive the signal.  When watching TV, there are no problems with playback, that is, there are no various interference and brakes.  Also, the weather does not affect the quality of reception.  The best part is that with good quality, this antenna can be taken at an affordable price. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="outdoor antenna with amplifier to the country" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/1844941.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  There is still an option to make an antenna for television yourself.  So you can make the right option for your area.  Of course, for this you need to work hard, as the task is quite difficult.  On the Internet there are many recommendations and videos on which you can make a suitable TV antenna for giving with an amplifier. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If your coaxial cable, which is connected to the antenna and the TV, has broken or pets have bitten it, do not immediately run for a new one.  You can connect whole sections.  To do this, it is necessary to clean the ends and solder the necessary contacts. </p><p>  In order to receive a signal qualitatively, it is necessary to pay attention to various factors.  Due to the installation height, high-voltage lines that are close to the house, the type of terrain of your area and the material used to make the roof, you can improve or degrade the signal.  This should be used during installation, so as not to waste your time. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Television antennas with an amplifier for gardening must be selected based on their area.  You can not choose a universal option, you must evaluate all the characteristics yourself in order to get a high-quality signal.  There are several types of antennas that may suit you.  After determining the desired type, you can proceed to the selection of the appropriate model. </p>
