The most attractive metropolis for tourists has a business card by which everyone recognizes it. </p><p>  The tallest building of the city has become the main symbol of the "capital of the world", testifying to the unbending American spirit. </p><h2>  The construction of the first skyscrapers </h2><p>  1889 marked the first construction of a skyscraper in New York.  For forty years, record high buildings appeared in the city, but on May 1, 1931 the grand opening of Empire State Buildings took place, which became a real phenomenon in the architectural world.  A unique building, which had no equal, opened its doors for all visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the empire state building" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1286563.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For many years, not a single building in the world could beat the achievement of American builders. </p><h2>  The legend that gave the city and skyscraper its name </h2><p>  An interesting story is known, according to which the English navigator <span>Henry Hudson,</span> during his journey, sailed along the river, which later received his name.  He marveled at the revealed beauty and grandeur of the area and exclaimed in admiration: ‚ÄúThis is the new empire!‚Äù  - which in translation means "This is a new empire." </p><p>  Later, New York State was called "imperial", and the constructed skyscraper bears the name Empire State Buildings, which is closely connected with the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction History </h2><p>  The first skyscraper in the world, with 102 <span>floors</span> 443 meters high, was erected in just one year.  It was originally planned to make it a place for mooring airships, but later this beautiful idea was abandoned due to strong air currents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="empire state building translation" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1286561.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  The history of the skyscraper is closely linked to the economic recovery of the 20s of the last century, which gave rise to a real boom in construction.  The sharp increase in the price of land has led to the construction of multi-storey buildings built at a high technological level. </p><h2>  Observation Decks </h2><p>  On the 86th and last, 102nd floors, there are observation platforms, and to get to them, tourists stand for several hours.  The ticket price for their visit starts at twenty dollars. </p><p>  In difficult economic times, suicides came here, and sad statistics tell of 40 deaths. </p><p>  At the very top there is a spire visible at the entrance to New York, on which special television and radio equipment is installed, and about seven million residents of the metropolis receive a signal from it. </p><h2>  Advanced lighting system </h2><p>  The legendary Empire State Building (New York) is incredibly beautiful after dark.  Illuminated by an entire system of 400 fixtures, it captivates with a magnificent view.  By the way, the colors are known in advance, most often they are confined to any cultural events and city holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="empire state building new york" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1286562.jpg" width="499"></div>

But after the introduction of a new system of dynamic lighting, which reproduces over sixteen million colors, even pastel, a variety of "live" effects will surprise the most demanding travelers.  The skyscraper sparkling with bright lights will present a catchy spectacle, so no tourist goes past the main attractions of the metropolis. </p><h2>  Where is Empire State Buildings located? </h2><p>  New York's business card is located at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan (Midtown Manhattan). </p><p>  Nearest underground station to the high-rise: 34th Street - Herald Square. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  On the eve of the Great Depression, the Empire State Building skyscraper appeared (the translation of the name sounds like ‚ÄúEmpire State Building‚Äù), which stood empty for a long time.  Due to the global economic crisis, the offices were empty, and for twenty years the building was not profitable, which greatly pleased the competitors of the skyscraper. </li><li>  Over the course of a year and forty-five days, it was built by about three and a half thousand immigrants from Europe, who were considered real lucky, because during the economic crisis it was simply impossible to find a job.  Apart were the Indians who did not know the fear of heights and worked without insurance. </li><li>  The tallest building in the city weighs 365 thousand tons, and the steel frame, widely used at that time, supports walls consisting of ten million bricks. </li><li>  Equipped with 73 high-speed elevators, Empire State Buildings is similar in design to a wedding cake.  The upper floors are significantly ‚Äúcompressed‚Äù in size and have a much smaller area than the lower.  To get on them, you need to overcome the stairs, consisting of 1860 steps.  And it is not surprising that since 1978, sports have been running indoors to the 86th floor, and the record for the fastest overcoming an impressive distance has not been broken since 2003. </li><li>  Due to the huge size and the large number of people working in offices, the country's postal office assigned a separate index to the skyscraper. </li></ul>
