    <h2>  What tourists do not like at the Rus mini-hotel </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the <span>mini-hotel "Rus" (Adler)</span> received negative <span>reviews</span> from vacationers on some points. </p><ul><li>  Irons and ironing boards are located only on the floor. </li><li>  The rooms do not have electric kettles.  But if you ask, a kettle can bring. </li><li>  There are also no hairdryers in the rooms.  Although a hairdryer can also be requested at the reception.  Attendants are always trying to help. </li><li>  There are practically no budgetary entertainments on the embankment; everything is designed mainly for wealthy tourists. </li><li>  There are complaints about the lack of ballot boxes in the hotel.  If you wanted to have a bite to eat in your room, then you have to run the trash to the trash in the street.  The room, of course, has a convenient bucket with a pedal, but it is undesirable to throw away food packaging there in order to avoid unpleasant odors. </li></ul><h2>  Some features of a hotel stay </h2><p>  I would like to note a number of features for those who chose the <span>Rus mini-hotel</span> for their holidays <span>.</span>  <span>Adler</span> is a very attractive place for tourists, but they should know all the nuances about the proposed property. </p><ul><li>  Breakfast is included in the room rate only in summer. </li><li>  The on-site swimming pool can only be used from the beginning of summer until the end of September. </li><li>  Unlike the rooms of the ‚ÄúStandard +‚Äù category, where there is an armchair-bed as an extra bed, in the ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù rooms an extra bed is a folding bed, which not everyone will like. </li><li>  Pets are not allowed. </li><li>  Payment for accommodation in this object is made only in cash. </li></ul><p>  Mini-Hotel Rus is a private property.  It is located in a picturesque place, far from the bustle of the city, on the state farm "Russia" of the Adler district of Sochi.  So if you will recommend it to your friends for a vacation, do not forget to recall the specifying data: <span>the Rus Hotel, the Rossiya State Farm, Adler.</span> </p>
