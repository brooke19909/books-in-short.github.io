Documents for departure are drawn up before noon (12.00).  Of course, the staff goes to meet the vacationers, because it is not always convenient to wait for a settlement if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning.

The tourist reception service for various issues works around the clock.

The balcony offers a wonderful view of the garden or the sea (it is advisable to occupy rooms on the 5th floor, because in front of the Kaya Maris 4 there is also a hotel that hides the view).

    <p>  On the floor there is tile or <span>carpet,</span> split-air cooling system is functioning.  There is a TV, Russian channels work.  There is a shower room, a hairdryer, and it is better to bring bath accessories with you.  Towels and bed linen are changed several times a week, room cleaning - daily.  For an additional fee, you can order a safe in your room, telephone and ask to fill a minibar.  The hotel has 1 room, specially equipped for the disabled.  The cost of living starts at 1900 rubles per night. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  On the territory of Kaya Maris Hotel 4 there are 2 swimming pools: for adults (open in the warmer months), with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 210 m <sup>2</sup> and a depth of 1.6 m, and a children's pool, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã9 m <sup>2</sup> , a depth of half a meter.

    <p>  I would also like to say that the hotel is located on the second line.  To reach the beach, you must cross the promenade.  This is one of the moments that causes discontent among vacationers in Kaya Maris 4 (Marmaris).  Reviews in general are not bad, since there is a clean city beach nearby, but you need to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas.  In truth, there is a small sandy area that belongs to the hotel, but it is not equipped and there is only free space until 10.00.  The beach has a huge selection of services and entertainment for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Sport </h2><p>  A gym and a fitness center are constantly working.  But to be honest, not many tourists visit them.  Do not forget that vacationers come here for new experiences, and you can go to the "simulator" at home.  Another thing is the services that provide on the beach, namely, the activities of numerous water sports.  Be sure to bring a camera with you if you go to Kaya Maris 4 - photo <strong> </strong>  will succeed <strong> </strong>  extraordinary. <strong> </strong></p><p>  Judge for yourself: a scuba diving school is open for vacationers, you can go boating and canoeing, water skiing.  Organized surfing, parasailing and bananasailing.  You can order rafting (rafting on mountain rivers), but here you really need to rely on your strength.  On the one hand, an extraordinary adventure for only $ 50.  The price includes travel, meals, equipment, instruction and several descents of 15 minutes for 1.5 hours.  If you doubt your abilities, it‚Äôs better not to ‚Äúscam‚Äù: groups are formed from those who paid for the tour, you won‚Äôt be able to refuse at the last moment.  At the end of a series of descents, they will certainly offer to purchase a disc recording your adventures. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  You will be guaranteed a great experience if you stay at Kaya Maris Hotel 4. The reviews are mostly positive.  But the most interesting thing is that you can book excursions not only with tour operators, but also with local agencies in Marmaris.  It is much more profitable and completely safe.  In addition, employees of local agencies often reward their customers by issuing free invitations to evening walks by sea.  True, for this you need to order several excursions. </p><p>  So, about $ 100 is a trip to Ephesus-Pamukkale, designed for 2 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaya maris hotel 4" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/526477.jpg" width="432"></div>  Check out early at 6.30 (by the way, you can take breakfast with you in the restaurant and eat on the way).  Be sure to take bottled water: a tour of the ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus</span> lasts more than 2 hours.  Then they drive to the monastery of the Virgin Mary, and then to the hotel, where you can have dinner and spend the night.  On the second day they drive to Pamukkale.  Immediately go to the Cleopatra's pool, walk along the travertines.  If you plan everything carefully, you can manage to visit the Hierapolis Amphitheater and take a couple of shots.

    <p>  If you plan to relax for a long time, book a trip to Dalyan.  The road is a little tiring, but for $ 30 you get a lot of pleasant experiences.  In terms of inspection, the radon pool, acquaintance with a huge turtle and Lycian tombs.  The area is well known for its rare blue crabs.  On the way back, you will have the opportunity to try their meat for $ 9.  Do not deny yourself the pleasure, be sure to order this dish. </p><p>  An excursion to the Aegean islands will cost $ 20. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaya maris hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21922/526480.jpg" width="506"></div>  Tourists are taken by boat to the sea, to the islands.  They are allowed to swim and dive, feed, serve water, beer and wine.  You can visit Cappadocia, where there are many cave monasteries, visit the ancient ruins of Mira and the ancient city of Knidos.  Some directions can be mastered independently if you rent a car at the hotel.

    <h2>  Where to buy gifts and souvenirs? </h2><p>  Sweets can be purchased at nearby stores.  If you ask, then sellers may allow you to try the product and pack it when you buy.  Souvenirs are best purchased in supermarkets, as well as in small shops and shops. </p><p>  By the way, during excursions, especially in Ephesus-Pamukkale, they constantly offer to visit some factories where they produce sweets and souvenirs.  As a rule, the prices here are overpriced, and the quality does not differ at all from what they sell at retail in the city.  Pay attention to small shopping facilities: here, as a rule, adequate prices for souvenirs, magnets and other trifles. </p><h2>  Hotel Pros </h2><p>  In conclusion, I want to summarize and highlight the features of the hotel Kaya Maris 4. Reviews <strong> </strong>  tourists will help to do this most accurately. </p><ul><li>  Excellent cuisine and a wide range of dishes. </li><li>  Polite, helpful and helpful staff. </li><li>  The rooms are comfortable, regular cleaning. </li><li>  Vacationers are mainly foreigners aged 45-55 years.  Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage should be decided by the tourists themselves, but the hotel is more suitable for a relaxing family vacation. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><ul><li>  Small rooms. </li><li>  Unsatisfactory work of plumbing: either the taps are leaking or the toilet. </li><li>  There are few animation programs in the hotel itself. </li><li>  There is no private beach. </li><li>  The staff does not speak Russian. </li></ul><p>  Despite all the pros and cons, most tourists are inclined to believe that the hotel fully justifies its 4 stars.  There are those who do not agree, but there are much fewer of them. </p>
