    <p>  Now you can admire the very modest cave houses, where whole families huddled in unsanitary conditions that are not very comfortable.  The ancient streets of Matera often become decorations for biblical-themed films.  In tuff, underground churches with wall paintings that have not lost their brightness are also cut down.  A walk through the city inhabited from the Neolithic era, nicknamed the "second Bethlehem", is an exciting journey into past centuries. </p><h2>  Unforgettable holidays in Liguria </h2><p>  Tourists who are interested in the most beautiful places on the <span>coast of Italy are</span> sure to visit Liguria - a small region of the country, whose beautiful beaches will not leave anyone indifferent.  The unique geographical location, mild climate and warm sea made it the most popular corner among foreign guests. </p><p>  Romantic San Remo, famous for its wonderful architecture, the ancient city of Alassio, which has turned into a famous resort, combining modernity and medieval monuments of Rapallo, perched on the cliff of Vernazza, attract millions of guests all year round.  However, many tourists unanimously call the fabulously beautiful Portofino a true paradise, whose population in the high season increases several times. </p><h2>  Portofino - Dolce Vita style city </h2><p>  The miniature city, awarded special prizes for clean beaches and clear sea water, was founded by the Roman emperor.  The former fishing village quickly turned into a prestigious resort, considered the most beautiful holiday destination in Italy.  Hollywood stars and famous musicians buy real estate, the value of which is growing every year, and it is not for nothing that local residents joke that one window in the city costs a million euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful cities and the best places in Italy" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1820847.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The respectable Portofino with picturesque landscapes and an aristocratic atmosphere is ideal for tourists who dream of a relaxing vacation on the beach and at the same time longing to immerse themselves in a rich social life.  A quiet city, where there is harmony between man and the environment, is so perfect that it seems unrealistic.  Leaving a vivid impression and devoid of noisy nightclubs, it was created for a relaxing holiday.  Any construction is prohibited here, and therefore Portofino looks the same as in the 19th century. </p><h2>  Praiano - the most beautiful place in Italy on the sea </h2><p>  The little-known pearl of the <span>Amalfi coast,</span> located on a steep cliff facing the sea, seems to be divorced from civilization.  In Praiano, founded in ancient times, a serene and measured life reigns, which will appeal to tourists tired of the noise of megacities.  In a small town where about two thousand people live, vacationers come, dreaming of loneliness and unity with mother nature.  The hallmark of the miniature resort are cute houses carved in stone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy's most beautiful places list" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1820846.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This is a rather "wild" place, due to the mountains and two undeveloped beaches.  The sensation of swimming, according to guests, is simply crazy: from the sea, gigantic rocks look awesome.  Here they enjoy the fresh air, in which the scents of pine are floating, and the unusual silence, the calming sound of the sea and stunning panoramas. </p><h2>  A country that opens in a new way </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the <span>most beautiful cities</span> and the best places in Italy cannot be described in the article and not seen in one trip to the country of olive oil and delicious sparkling wine.  The real experience of meeting her exceeds all expectations.  Here, every guest who has traveled to a real fairy tale will find something that will leave a bright mark on his soul. </p><p>  You can come here countless times, constantly discovering something new.  A time-lost country, which is called the cradle of world civilization, takes millions of tourists in their arms, hurrying after new experiences and dreaming to see its most beautiful corners. </p>
