    <h2>  Thai holiday </h2><p>  What is Thailand in November?  We know this country as a place of eternal summer, where exotic nature is intertwined with ancient traditions.  Here the traveler expects a hospitable meeting, highly developed infrastructure, affordable prices and first-class service.  And also the lack of a <span>language barrier,</span> since almost every dog ‚Äã‚Äãbarks in Russian in this part of Asia.  But the last <span>fall month</span> may be at the mercy of the wet season.  And no!  Thailand opens a high season in November, so you can forget about precipitation. </p><p>  This month you can choose different resorts for relaxation.  For example, the noisy and always festive Pattaya, the exotic islands of Samet and <span>Koh Chang</span> , Krabi, unique in its beauty, Pi Pi.  The <span>beaches of Phuket</span> and Samui beckon with their splendor, modern Bangkok is promisingly inviting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in november weather" class="if" height="150" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/952903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two words about the weather </h2><p>  So, you can safely choose to vacation Thailand in November.  The weather here is perfect: the air warms up to + 30-35 degrees, water, like fresh milk - +25.  Dry and comfortable, but not very hot.  Experienced travelers are advised at this time to go to the islands of the Adaman Sea and the <span>Gulf of Thailand.</span>  In these parts the weather is the most favorable, and the heat is easily tolerated.  It should be prepared for the fact that the number of tourists increases significantly during this period, and prices begin to skyrocket. </p><h2>  Travel cost </h2><p>  How much does a trip to Thailand in November cost?  Prices are quite high.  The lion's share of the expenses will be on air travel.  A tour for two lasting ten days will cost about 1400-1500 dollars or more if you choose a five-star hotel.  This amount includes tickets for the iron bird, transfer to the hotel, breakfast and medical insurance.  Separately, you need to pay for a visa at the airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Thailand in November" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/952895.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition to this amount, it is worth having some more with you for lunch and dinner, entertainment, excursions and shopping.  Prices in the country are very low, although they rise slightly in the midst of the holiday season and vary depending on the city.  Phuket is considered the most expensive place in Thailand, Pattaya is the most affordable.  Want to save money but visit Thailand in November?  Book tours in advance or catch last minute packages. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel business </h2><p>  <span>Holidays in Thailand</span> in November will succeed.  However, for this it is necessary to determine not only the resort, but also the hotel.  Institutions are distinguished by the harmonious beauty of interiors and exteriors.  Many tourists choose bungalow houses - they have the lowest price, but are very exotic.  In any hotel, regardless of the number of stars, the staff is very helpful.  Almost every institution is located near the beach area or has a private access to the sea.  In addition to bungalows, tourists can stay in rooms of different levels of comfort or in the private sector. </p><p>  If you plan to spend your holidays in Thailand in November, then you should decide on a place of residence in advance.  You should not hope that the hotel will be found after arrival: in the middle of autumn there are a lot of tourists here, so if there are any rooms available, they will cost a lot.  It is also very difficult to catch a burning ticket - they simply are not! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in november tours" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/952889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Capital bangkok </h2><p>  When going to Thailand in November, do not miss the opportunity to get acquainted with Bangkok.  The Thai capital city is very colorful, as it is interwoven with modern and historical sights against the backdrop of bewitching nature.  The route must include inspection of the Royal Palace and the adjacent Temple of the Emerald Buddha, as well as the Temple of Wat Po.  A little distance, tourists will find the original temple on the water - Wat Arum and the Temple of the Morning Dawn.  It is hard to miss the Golden Buddha Temple, the Marble Temple. </p><p>  Climb the highest skyscraper in the country of Bayok Sky with an observation deck from where a fantastic panorama of the city opens.  And take a walk through the colorful old quarters, where it seems that time has frozen.  Worthy of attention of every traveler is the Oceanarium, Lumpini Park, Safari World and the Dusit Zoo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in november prices" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/952878.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to entertain yourself? </h2><p>  And what kind of entertainment program did Thailand prepare in November?  The weather is conducive to sightseeing, underwater walks, fishing, water fun, a sea cruise.  You should definitely go to a session (or better not one) of Thai massage.  An interesting trip will be to a crocodile or snake farm, to the butterfly garden in Phuket.  Important Buddhist temples with gigantic statues of deities are located at Wat Chalong, Wat Sriesunhorn, Wat Phra Nang Sang, on Buddha Hill in Pattaya.  It will be interesting for both children and adults to visit the Pattaya Aquarium, "Elephant Village". </p><p>  Well, of course, it is worth doing shopping, however, before that you need to familiarize yourself with the list of items prohibited for export.  Buying here is profitable: </p><ul><li>  Jewelry; </li><li>  clothes and shoes: </li><li>  Electronics </li><li>  latex products; </li><li>  cosmetics; </li><li>  leather accessories (bags, wallets, belts); </li><li>  silk. </li></ul>

Dishes are a separate story.  Here you can eat plenty of sushi and rice in various ways for a penny.  Experienced tourists are advised to try the shrimp soup Tom Yan Khun, steamed fish.  Be prepared that the gastronomic delights will be very spicy and spicy.  Do not buy food on the street - there is a risk of poisoning with a poor-quality product.  Although after visiting the restaurant you can also get an upset stomach.

    <h2>  What do people say? </h2><p>  Are you ready to go to Thailand?  Vacation packages in November should be booked in advance, so as not to stay home later.  But what kind of reviews do tourists leave who have managed to visit this fabulous country?  Most travelers remain satisfied, since Thailand is a diverse country where you can relax on the beach, actively explore nature and local attractions.  An economical option is Pattaya, where nightlife is raging.  However, it is not suitable for pampered people: here it is always crowded and not quite clean.  A completely different picture in Phuket - an expensive resort where newlyweds, older people and families with children like to relax.  It is quiet and comfortable, nature is beautiful, as on the day of the creation of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand in november" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/952886.jpg" width="600"></div>
