    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Since Grenada is located in the <span>Caribbean Sea,</span> where the climate is quite favorable, the weather on the whole island is hot and humid for a whole year.  The average annual air temperature is at least 26 degrees. </p><h2>  Grenada: curious facts </h2><p>  We invite you to get acquainted with some information about this amazing country: </p><ul><li>  Interestingly, where the state of Grenada is located, it is forbidden to build houses above palm trees.  For this reason, you will not find tall buildings here. </li><li>  The country is washed by the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. </li><li>  The flag of this state shows nutmeg, as Grenada is rightfully considered one of the largest exporters of spices. </li><li>  There is an underwater sculpture park. </li><li>  The number of tourists coming here on vacation significantly exceeds the level of the local population. </li><li>  The official language in this country is English.  This is due to the fact that for a long time Grenada was part of the UK. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the island of granada" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1869413.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Each country has its own unique monuments of architecture and art, which are worthy of close study by tourists.  We invite you to get acquainted with the most interesting places in Grenada.  So, let's begin: </p><ul><li>  Where Grenada is located, one of the main attractions is the Seven Sisters waterfall.  It is located in the center of the island, so getting to it is quite easy.  During the journey, you will enjoy the beauty of the rainforest, and then you can plunge into the refreshing water of the waterfall. </li><li>  Do you like diving or just tired of swimming in not very clear water?  Then you definitely need to visit Jenny Island, where you can study the underwater world and its inhabitants. </li><li>  St. George is the capital of Grenada.  The city was built in the 17th century on the slope of an extinct volcano.  It burned about a dozen times.  But this fact makes the <span>capital of the island</span> even more interesting and attractive for tourists. </li><li>  National Museum.  If you want to not only know where Grenada is located, but also to study its history, then you should definitely visit this place.  A huge number of rare and unique exhibits are stored here. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state of granada where is" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1869408.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  If you ever get to where Grenada is located, be sure to visit the underwater sculpture park.  Here at a depth of three meters there are a large number of images of various people. </li></ul><p>  There are other attractions in the country that you can meet on your own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Travel Tips: </h2><ol><li>  Now that you know where Grenada is located, be sure to take all the necessary vaccinations before leaving for this country.  There is a high chance of contracting malaria, so be careful. </li><li>  Since solar activity is very high here, it is best to take sunscreens with you. </li><li>  The crime rate in this country, although not high, will not be out of place if you scan all the important documents before the trip.  It is best to have them in two forms: printed and electronic media (tablet, laptop, etc.). </li><li>  Also, no matter how sad it may sound, beware of people who volunteer to help.  They may turn out to be real scammers themselves.  There are cases when a person offered to convey things, and then demanded a very high fee for his work. </li><li>  Few people know, but collecting corals from the bottom, and even more so trying to take them out of the country, is prohibited.  Therefore, do not make such mistakes. </li><li>  If you do not have as much time to study the country as you would like, then initially make a list of the places that you want to visit.  In this case, you will have time to see much more. </li><li>  If you really want to relax, and not solve business issues, then leave your phone at home, and tell your relatives in advance. </li><li>  You can fearlessly swim in the sea near the beach, because because of coral reefs sea predators cannot get here.  But to swim far, we do not advise you, since this is already unsafe.  There can be strong undercurrents and marine predators. </li><li>  And the last tip for travelers.  Do not forget that you are in another country.  If you want to be treated well, you don‚Äôt need to behave arrogantly and rudely, remember that you are guests here.  The locals are quite friendly people, but very respecting their traditions and customs. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is granada located in which country" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1869410.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Souvenirs and souvenirs </h2><p>  Tourists and travelers are always trying to bring something from the countries they visited.  What souvenirs and gifts can you buy in Grenada for your friends and relatives?  Choose: </p><ul><li>  fragrant spices; </li><li>  practical fabrics; </li><li>  ceramic dishes; </li><li>  shell products, for example, beads, photo frames, ashtrays, flower pots and much more; </li><li>  souvenirs with the image of a Grenada dove (T-shirts, T-shirts, shawls, etc.); </li><li>  wooden utensils and more. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Granada in the Caribbean" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1869409.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to say once again that this holiday destination is becoming more and more popular with tourists every year.  Grenada attracts not only with magnificent beaches, warm sea, forests and waterfalls, but also with national parks, monuments, as well as other attractions.  We wish you a pleasant stay in this wonderful country and hope you enjoy it there. </p>
