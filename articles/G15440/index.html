  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Korablev Denis - the hero of the stories of Dragoon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Korablev Denis is the protagonist of the cycle of children's stories of the famous Soviet writer V. Dragunsky.  This character is one of the most popular in the literature, as evidenced by the fact that he became the protagonist of several adaptations dedicated to these stories.  These are "Fun Stories" (1962), and "Deniskins Stories" (1970), and short films shot on separate stories from the book of the same name in 1973, and "Secret to the World" (1976), and "Amazing Adventures" Denis Korableva "(1979).  It is known that the prototype was the son of the author, for whom he wrote his works. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The events of the bulk of the stories take place in Moscow in the late 1950s - early 1960s.  Korablev Denis in most works is a boy of preschool age.  He lives with his parents, next to the circus, as mentioned in one of the works of this cycle.  Subsequently, he had a younger sister.  The narration is conducted on behalf of the protagonist, which is the charm of these works.  The writer showed the world around him through the eyes of a child, many of whose judgments are striking in their truthfulness, prudence and directness. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ships denis" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1304944.jpg" width="580"></div></h2><p>  In addition, the images of his parents play a large role in the stories, and his closest friend and comrade Mishka also plays a significant role.  Secondary, episodic heroes periodically appear on the pages of stories, the presence of which, nevertheless, plays a big semantic load (for example, a school singing teacher). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Content </h2><p>  In all the stories, Korablev Denis tells of his adventures, funny stories and just episodes of his life.  They are interesting in that everyone is very different from each other, and each event, as it were, opens the main character from a new perspective.  Some of the works are funny, others, on the contrary, are very sad.  Thus, the author shows the complex inner world of a child who is very keenly and vividly experiencing everything that happens around him.  The writer skillfully wrote the most significant events of his era in the story: for example, in the story ‚ÄúAmazing Day‚Äù Titov‚Äôs flight into space is mentioned. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Denis ships" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1304941.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><h2>  Episodes </h2><p>  Korablev Denis periodically finds himself in various funny situations, which is described with childish simplicity and naivety, which makes the story even more interesting.  For example, in the story Exactly 25 Kilos, he drinks too much syrup to win an annual subscription to the magazine, and in another story he plans to spend his whole life under the bed.  A lot of funny incidents happen to his parents, friends.  For example, quite a lot of funny episodes are connected with his dad, who once accidentally drank an explosive mixture from various drinks prepared by a boy.  In another story, the hero tells how his parent unsuccessfully tried to cook chicken for lunch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Denis ships movie" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1304934.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The character </h2><p>  Denis Korablev is especially attractive in that he is an extremely sensitive boy with a romantic attitude.  In one of the stories, he tells about what he likes and what he loves the most, and from this long list we learn that this child has a lively mind, prudence and passionate imagination.  He loves music and singing, which is rather funny played out in several stories.  The boy likes the animal kingdom, which we can judge from the story ‚ÄúWhite Amadins‚Äù, he is attached to all living things: in one of his works he exchanged an expensive toy for an ordinary luminous bug only so that this insect would not become fun in the hands of his friend.  So, Denis Korablev, films about which were one of the most popular in our country, became the favorite of many readers. </p>

    <p>  A lot of funny stories are devoted to the description of acquaintances, friends and neighbors of the protagonist.  For example, he tells of a neighbor's girl Alenka and his yard friend Kostya, with whom he often spent time.  In Dragunsky‚Äôs cycle there is also one of the most touching and sad stories ‚ÄúThe Girl on the Ball‚Äù, in which the boy had to endure the pain of parting.  Particularly memorable is a work dedicated to the pope‚Äôs story about his military childhood, which made such a strong impression on the child that he stopped acting up.  Dragoonsky makes references to other works of world literature: for example, one of his stories is called ‚ÄúThe Old Sailor‚Äù, named after one of the characters of D. London. </p>
