    <h2>  Products Offered </h2><p>  The organization “Profi Credit" offers loans to its customers.  This product in the company is represented by two types: </p><ol><li>  "PROFI Comfort".  This type of loan offers customers cash in the amount of 10 thousand to 50 or 80 thousand rubles.  The term can be set from 3 to 12 months.  The interest rate is determined individually and ranges from 0.45% per day. </li><li>  "PROFI Together."  This type of loan is suitable for people who want to borrow a large sum of money for a long term.  Judging by the reviews, “Profi Credit” provides customers from 20 thousand to 100 or 200 thousand rubles.  The valid term is from 18 to 36 months, and the interest rate is from 0.12% per day. </li></ol><h2>  Example loan in “Profi Credit” </h2><p>  To understand the conditions for lending money, consider an example of a loan.  A person wants to use the PROFI Comfort product.  Previously, he had never taken loans from the company, which means that the maximum allowable amount for him is 50 thousand rubles.  Let's say that a person wants to get a loan - 15 thousand rubles for 6 months.  The total amount of payments on the loan will amount to 32 thousand 964 rubles.  The monthly payment will be equal to 5 thousand 494 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For regular customers, the interest rate is lower.  If they need to take the same amount for a similar period, the total amount of payments will be 28 thousand 764 rubles.  The monthly payment will be equal to 4 thousand 794 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  The microfinance company “Profi Credit” seeks to help the citizens of our country in need of money.  At the same time, she cares about the effectiveness of her activities and does not provide loans to obscure individuals.  It makes certain demands on borrowers.  Firstly, the age of clients can be at least 26 and not more than 64 years. </p><p>  Secondly, the borrower must live in the city in which there is an office of a microfinance company, as indicated in the reviews of “Pro Credit” (in Nizhny Novgorod, for example).  This condition is necessary because the client, when approving the application, is scheduled to meet with the organization manager to sign the documents. </p><p>  Thirdly, the company only cooperates with solvent borrowers.  People applying to Profi Credit should have at least 12 months of work experience, and at least 3 months at their current place of work.  In some cases, you have to confirm your solvency.  When applying for loans in the amount of more than 75 thousand rubles, clients provide a statement of income in the form of 2-personal income tax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Stages of a loan </h2><p>  According to reviews, in “Profi Credit” the loan processing procedure consists of several stages: </p><ol><li>  Filling in the form with the name and surname, date of birth, phone number, place of residence and registration. </li><li>  After sending the questionnaire to the borrower, the consultant of the company calls back.  He clarifies the necessary information by asking questions. </li><li>  After approval of the application, a meeting is scheduled with the consultant.  It will need to sign all the necessary documents, get acquainted with the schedule for making payments.  After paperwork, funds are transferred to a personal bank account. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Loan return to Profi Credit </h2><p>  A loan taken from a microfinance organization is repaid monthly in accordance with the payment schedule.  There are two ways to pay back.  The first method is the use of payment terminals "Eleksnet".  No commission is charged.  The only thing to consider is that the deposited money is credited to the company's account within 1 day.  To avoid any delays, it is recommended to send the payment in advance. </p><p>  The second way to repay the loan is to send a bank transfer.  You can do this at any branch of the bank or through the online bank.  Transfer fee is charged.  Its size is determined by the conditions of a particular bank.  It is also worth considering that the period for receipt of money can be several days. </p><p>  If at the time of payment a difficult financial situation arose and there were no funds available, then there is one way out.  Customers who apply for a loan with a service package can use a special option that freezes a payment.  Thanks to her, users get the opportunity to pay the loan later.  Penalties are not charged during this period.  If the loan was issued without a package of services, then it can be connected at any convenient time for an additional fee. </p>

    <h2>  Positive customer reviews </h2><p>  A lot of people leave positive reviews about the company “Profi Credit”.  Clients like the benefits that a microfinance organization has: </p><ul><li>  loan processing with a minimum of documents and formalities; </li><li>  operational consideration of the application - the period from the moment of sending personal information to the moment of receipt of money does not exceed 24 hours; </li><li>  low interest rates; </li><li>  convenient payment terms - 1 time per month; </li><li>  selection of the most convenient loan terms regarding the amount and term; </li><li>  the possibility of early repayment of the loan. </li></ul><p>  Many customers thank the company employees.  According to them, consultants of a microfinance organization are always ready to explain incomprehensible points, help to select loan conditions, if you need, for example, to take some amount for a long period and with a small payment.  Customers also thank the company for their trust.  Many of them were denied loans to banks, and Profi Credit approved the loan. </p>

    <h2>  Negative customer reviews about "Pro Credit" </h2><p>  Profi Credit, like any other microfinance organization, has negative reviews.  Often, debtors leave them.  They complain about constant calls, about the company's demands to repay the debt.  However, it is worth noting that in such actions there is nothing supernatural.  A microfinance organization simply wants to return the money that belongs to it.  The borrowers are to blame for the occurrence of such situations, because it was they who did not comply with the signed agreement. </p><p>  In comments of a negative nature, customers complain about large overpayments.  This is true, but this information is not hidden from people.  Initially, customers know what they are doing.  They are given the opportunity to use the online calculator on the official website of the company, calculate with it the monthly payment, the total amount to be returned.  Information about the amounts is also indicated in the contract, which at the meeting with the consultant is signed by each user of loans. </p>

    <h2>  Profi Credit: employee reviews about the company </h2><p>  The microfinance organization Profi Credit is contacted not only for obtaining loans, but also for employment.  Employees who have worked here for several months or years, respond positively about their place of work and invite new people to the team, attracting the benefits that the company has.  Here is a list of them: </p><ul><li>  registration according to the Labor code of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  bonus payment; </li><li>  high profit payment. </li></ul><p>  Mentioned the possibility of professional growth in reviews of "Pro Credit".  Employees in St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia talk about this.  For example, one of them in his review boasted of achievements.  He said that at the beginning of his career he was a regular consultant at Profi Credit.  Active work in a microfinance company and self-development allowed him to rise up the career ladder - to become a territorial manager in the organization’s team. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that the microfinance company Profi Credit in a difficult financial moment can indeed become a lifesaver.  And in order to avoid any disputes and conflicts, you just need to follow the rules of the signed agreement, use the loan freeze service in the absence of money to make a monthly payment.  If from the very beginning there are doubts that it will be possible to repay the loan, then you should not contact the company.  In case of delays, the amount may increase several times. </p>
