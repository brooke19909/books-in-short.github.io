    <h2>  The roots of pacifism </h2><p>  <span>Without a small digression into history, it will be impossible to explain the meaning of the expression ‚Äúera of pacifism‚Äù.</span>  <span>If earlier the phenomenon we were considering made itself felt in small outbursts, then in the 20th century it was possible to observe how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeaceful existence captured whole states.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Pacifism as an ideology has lived for a long time and takes its roots in the religion of different nations.</span>  <span>Even in antiquity, philosophers voiced the ideas of humanity, peace and good.</span>  <span>Julius Caesar penetrates them, erecting a temple in honor of the cult of mercy.</span>  <span>In Christianity, this idea also took a leading position.</span> </p><p>  <span>However, this phenomenon was alien to the barbarian peoples who inhabited Europe and used to live in war.</span>  <span>They regarded the world as a short respite in order to gain strength and to be able to continue to fight further for domination, resources and influence.</span>  <span>With the spread of Christianity, the picture has changed little, only now the war was perceived as sacred, as a way to restore justice and peace.</span> </p><p>  <span>This was probably guided by Germany as the main instigator of the First World War of 1914, calling it defensive.</span>  <span>Although this issue is very controversial, it would be unfair to refer only to the Germans.</span>  <span>Each of the participating countries pursued its own interests, be it France or Russia.</span> </p><h2>  Postwar world order </h2><p>  <span>The era of pacifism of the 20th century was a natural consequence of established interstate relations after the tragic war of 1914-1918, which entailed great losses.</span>  <span>On the one hand, social upheavals, weakened financial systems, and ruined state economies required appropriate conditions for stabilization.</span>  <span>On the other hand, the balance of power and interests of the great powers changed, and the constantly emerging contradictions between them required a settlement.</span>  <span>All this led to the question of creating a new system of relations that could prevent a war or at least reduce risks.</span>  <span>And the main role in this process was assigned to the Big Three - France, Great Britain and the USA.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The result of two international conferences of 1919-1922 was the Versailles-Washington system, which provided for the equality of all its participants.</span>  <span>Of course, in reality this was not so.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Formula Herrio </h2><p>  <span>France, changing its position from offensive to defensive, chose a new direction in interstate relations - open diplomacy.</span>  <span>She came up with a number of projects for ensuring international security, the developers of which were two prominent French politicians - E. Heriot and A. Briand.</span> </p><p>  <span>Herrio's formula was expressed in three terms: arbitration, security, and disarmament.</span>  <span>It implied the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrenouncing hostilities as a way to resolve interstate problems.</span> </p><p>  <span>League members enthusiastically accepted the proposal - the Geneva Protocol of 1924 was signed.</span>  <span>But he could not enter into force because of the contradictions of the leading powers, which "stumbled" on the definitions of "offensive" and "defensive" war.</span> </p><p>  <span>The term ‚Äúera of pacifism‚Äù coined by historians for this period, as you understand, is very conditional.</span>  <span>Along with loud slogans about peace, serious passions boiled over the division of territories and influence.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Briand Pact - Kellogg </h2><p>  <span>Wanting to restore US participation in solving European problems, French Foreign Minister A. Brian calls on the American people.</span>  <span>He suggests signing a Franco-American treaty banning war as an instrument of foreign policy.</span>  <span>His idea was approved.</span>  <span>F. Kellogg, Secretary of State of the United States, in response calls for a multilateral treaty by connecting European governments.</span>  <span>Germany was the first to respond, fully supporting the project.</span>  <span>The United Kingdom makes a number of comments, as a result of which the document has been finalized and clarified.</span> </p><p>  <span>On August 27, 1928, as a result of lengthy diplomatic negotiations, the Pact for the renunciation of war between 15 states was signed.</span>  <span>Its universality was that not only recognized, but also dependent, and semi-colonial countries could join it.</span>  <span>The figure of 63 countries at the end of the same year explains this well.</span> </p><h2>  What were the foundations of the era of pacifism </h2><p>  <span>The expression of the ideas of pacifism in the 20 years acquired a bright color.</span>  <span>The depletion of resources and fatigue from the war contributed to the growth of anti-war sentiment, which political leaders could not ignore.</span>  <span>Some countries were weakened and fragmented to go to conflicts, others strengthened their positions.</span>  <span>At this stage, nobody needed a war.</span>  <span>All this contributed to relative stabilization in Europe, later called the era of pacifism.</span> </p><p>  <span>The established world order, despite the positive aspects, had significant gaps.</span>  <span>Too many states have been put in a humiliating position before the leading powers.</span>  <span>The issues of territorial borders and nationalism could not be resolved due to many contradictions and conflicts.</span> </p><p>  <span>Thus, the era of pacifism did not last as long as its supporters wanted.</span>  <span>The collapse of the New York Financial Exchange in 1929 marked the beginning of a global economic crisis, political confrontation, increasing global tension and the threat of a new war.</span> </p>
