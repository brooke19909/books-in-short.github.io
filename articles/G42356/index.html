This option comes from the English word.  In addition, there are definitions: circular, clamp, loop.  All these names mean the same model, although the appearance of the product can vary greatly.  From thick threads make dense warm winter scarves.  Fine yarn with the use of openwork elements gives a beautiful decoration that will fit even a dress. </p><h2>  What and how are snood worn </h2><p>  This scarf is not considered a purely feminine element of the wardrobe.  Men prefer to use a collar when dressing for hunting or for riding a motorcycle.  This model protects from the cold not only the neck, but also the head, ears and upper back, in addition, it does not tighten the throat and prevents dust from entering the face. </p><p>  Worn as a headgear, the scarf tube visually lengthens the face.  It is worn on the neck both in one turn, and making a loop (depending on the model of the snud).  Many extravagant personalities prefer to wear two different snoods at the same time, combining different bright color shades.  This allows you to emphasize the individuality of the style and creates additional comfort. </p>

    <h2>  Preparation of materials </h2><p>  In order to make such a nice thing for a woman‚Äôs wardrobe, you will need a hook and threads of any color you like.  Choose the thickness based on the appearance of the model you liked.  It is better to take wool or the option that includes mohair, angora, lurex.  Now they are selling interesting decorative ribbon types of yarn.  To determine the quantity, be sure to make some measurements and calculations. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  In order to get a thing that fits perfectly on you, it is important not only to know how to crochet a scarf pipe, but also to determine the exact size.  It is necessary to measure the distance from the crown to the chin.  It corresponds to half the perimeter of the pipe.  If it turned out 22 cm, then the loops are gaining 44 cm. You will have to tie the sample in the same way of knitting as the original.  Only after steaming can you find out the true width.  A sample of approximately 10 x 10 cm will be sufficient as a sample. </p><p>  Initially, it is difficult to determine the density of the fabric, which will be obtained from a specific yarn, since all types of threads are different.  The nature of the knitting for each craftswoman is also her own.  After final processing, measure the sample.  Having made the proportion, you will find out how many loops you need to dial for your size. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  When reading the text, the calculations seem complicated.  But when you do them yourself once, then it will be easy.  If, for example, in a sample of 25 loops it turns out 10 cm, then 40 cm will require 100 loops. </p><h2>  Crochet scarf with description </h2><p>  If you already have some experience, you can not use ready-made step-by-step instructions.  Knowing the principle of manufacturing the product, some independently come up with a variety of options, changing, for example, color combinations or decorative elements. </p><p>  To get the scarf pipe shown in the photo, the crochet scheme should be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Gather the desired number of loops corresponding to the perimeter of the circumference of the snout. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scarf pipe crochet pattern" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601812.jpg" width="333"></div></li><li>  Connect the resulting chain into a ring. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet scarf pipe" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601818.jpg" width="331"></div></li><li>  Then you start making the pattern itself.  It can be performed both with double crochet and without crochet.  So, knit any version of the column. </li><li>  You need to perform several air loops.  The width of the resulting hole depends on their number.  The more you tie them, the longer the mesh will be. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pipe scarf with description" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601820.jpg" width="330"></div></li><li>  Perform the second column through the appropriate number of loops in the chain. </li><li>  Actions are repeated.  When choosing the width of the cell, calculate in advance how many loops you need to dial in the chain.  The value should be a multiple of the number of air loops forming the length of the hole. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pipe scarf for beginners" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601824.jpg" width="335"></div></li><li>  When the first row is ready, go to the second. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a pipe scarf" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601829.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  The subsequent ones are carried out according to the same scheme until the desired height of the snail is obtained.  Fasten the thread, cut it.  So the scarf pipe is crocheted.  For beginner needlewomen, such a product will be a good debut. </p><h2>  Tight knitting </h2><p>  The first option, shown above, is a light decoration.  Now let's look at an example in which a warm scarf tube is made.  <span>The crochet pattern is as</span> follows: </p><ol><li>  Take a tool the size of 7 mm, the yarn you like. </li><li>  Perform a test sample and the necessary calculations to determine the desired number of loops. </li><li>  Gather a chain of the corresponding number of air loops.  Lock them in a ring. </li><li>  The pattern will be as follows: 4 lifting VPs, insert the hook into the second loop and make 3 more VPs, grab the thread and pass through the two loops located on the hook, knit 1 VP.  The whole series is done in a similar way. </li><li>  Go to the next one and do this to the end. </li></ol><h2>  Openwork scarf pipe </h2><p>  Crocheted such a model is suitable even for a dress.  If you find it difficult to make it in a circle, you can knit a pattern in the form of a rectangle, and then gently connect the ends into a ring.  You can use any ornaments, but in this case you will have to constantly count the loops and work according to the scheme. </p>

    <p>  For beginners, this is not always easy.  There is a very simple and quick option for manufacturing the product.  Before joining the ring, it will look like the photo shows.  The image shows that knitting does not occur with ordinary threads, but with a "semi-finished product". </p><p>  Such a scarf pipe will look very original.  Crocheting it from ribbon yarn is very easy.  It is a wide strip assembled in a skein, along the edges of which a thread with loops is passed.  It is with their help that the tapes are connected to the product.  They are plain, colorful, openwork, with decor and even in the form of lace.  Such yarn makes magnificent ruffles and just very airy unusual things. </p><p>  The main thing is to work with her very simply.  So, so that you get a scarf pipe (hook), the manufacturing scheme will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Cut several strips of yarn with a size equal to the perimeter of the snout ring. </li><li>  Connect them together along the long side with ordinary threads, for example, columns with two crochets. </li><li>  Sew or hook the fabric along the short side.  All is ready.  Fast and easy. </li></ol><h2>  Snood from parts or with decor </h2><p>  If you want to make something original and simple, from separate elements connected into a single whole, you will get a magnificent scarf-pipe (crochet).  The scheme of work will be as follows: </p><ol><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pipe scarf for beginners" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/601739.jpg" width="550"></div>  Take a multi-colored yarn, from each shade you perform, for example, a square with single crochet columns. </li><li>  Make the right amount of elements.  You calculate their length, width and number based on the <span>size of the chest,</span> taking into account the multiplicity. </li><li>  Connect the individual parts first in vertical rows with alternating colors, for example, in a checkerboard pattern. </li><li>  Sew the resulting strip into a pipe.  At the junction, so that it does not greatly attract attention, you can make a bright strip of another pattern or shade. </li><li>  If desired, tie the upper and lower edges in a circle to give it a delicacy, using, for example, a simple system when you make several columns in one loop, then knit one in each previous row, and so on to the end.  The number of repetitions is easy to calculate by the number of buttonhole edges of your scarf. </li></ol><h2>  Children's snood </h2>
