But this is a very beautiful island, which is regularly visited by tourists.  He was lost among other Dutch islands, but managed to maintain his pristine enchanting appearance.  In the article we will discuss not only where Aruba is located, but also talk about its history, sights and modern condition. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The island is located off the coast of Venezuela, in the southern <span>Caribbean.</span>  Now that we know where Aruba is, let's talk about its history.  The earliest inhabitants of the island are Arawak Indians.  They were engaged in hunting, gathering and fishing.  It is known that they were able to produce clay pots and simple stone tools.  Cave paintings were discovered in the caves, which most likely were of a ritual character. </p><p>  In 1513, the Spaniards, who felt like the discoverers and owners of the island, sent the entire population to work in copper mines.  The Indians without exception there were dying from hard work and disease, and soon all died.  New immigrants arrived from the island.  The Spaniards used the remaining Indians as servants.  In 1799, the island was occupied by the British. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is aruba" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1997678.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  It is known that the inhabitants of the island were mostly Catholics.  In 1824, after a series of unsuccessful attempts to the island, gold was discovered and its mining began, which ceased with the outbreak of the First World War.  Also, phosphates and aloe were later found on the island.  The phosphate mining company quickly closed as all resources were exhausted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for modern times, Aruba is one of those rare countries that has refused full independence, proposed in 1996.  The island is partially controlled by the Netherlands. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  Currently, the population of Aruba is largely dependent on tourists.  However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping such a business here came only during the crisis in 1985.  The reason for the crisis was the closure of the refinery.  Experts noted that in that unpleasant year, 2,000 tourists visited the country, and by 1996 their number had increased to 7,000. To date, the statistics are such that the population of Aruba receives about 1.5 million tourists every year.  More than half come from the United States.  The construction of tourism infrastructure has not yet been completed, and it is not even at its peak, because the number of people wishing to visit the island is small, but gradually growing. </p><p>  Separately, note the international airport of Aruba.  Queen Beatrix.  The airport is located in Orenestad.  Flights depart not only from here to the USA, but also to a number of countries of the Caribbean and South America, and even to some countries of Europe. </p><p>  In addition to attractions and culture, tourists can relax on the island.  Here you can go diving, windsurfing or book an underwater excursion on a coral reef.  The last event is worth visiting at any cost, because when will it still be possible to admire the amazing and fantastic creations of the Caribbean? </p>

    <p>  There are three beaches that are considered the most beautiful, comfortable and prestigious - these are Arashi, Hadikurari and Druif.  The last beach is the cleanest area on the island.  Tourists especially enjoy relaxing on Baby Beach.  In total, the country has about 40 beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A feature of the island is where Aruba is located.  Only here tourists can see how chic pink flamingos pass by them, and not even one, because here it is a common thing.  The peculiarity is that in the most unbearable heat the sand never burns its feet. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  The cuisine of this island is a mixture of a wide variety of culinary trends.  There were almost no real Indian dishes, since the indigenous people ate foods that were inedible for a modern tourist.  It was caused by the poor resources of the island. </p><p>  At present, Aruba culinary specialists pamper tourists with all possible seafood.  Only here you can taste delicious lobsters, lobsters and deep-sea fish.  It produces its own beer "Balashi", as well as a huge variety of imported alcohol. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Where Aruba is located, we already know, but what can be seen there?  To begin with, we‚Äôll say that it‚Äôs not worth going to the island just to swim in the clear water.  There are other, almost deserted islands, on which peace and quiet.  Aruba is a small bright country, which has something to surprise a fastidious tourist.  Conventionally, the <span>sights of the island will be</span> divided into cultural and natural. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The last species, first of all, should be attributed to Arikok National Park, because it is there that the highest point of the island - Yamanota.  There you can explore the caves and rocks, which separate the natural pool from the sea.  The symbol of Aruba is Oyberg mound, which is a must visit.  Previously, tourists were very fond of visiting the natural bridge, under which blue water flowed.  Unfortunately, in 2005 the bridge collapsed. </p><p>  Now let's talk about cultural attractions.  It is worth visiting the oldest house on the island, which is located in Savannet.  Immediately from there you can get poisoned at Coral Reef Beach.  Locals will definitely recommend visiting the town of Noorde, which is most famous for its unique historical churches.  The two most impressive of them are the church of <span>St. Anne</span> and Alto Vista.  Within the city are two beaches.  Fans of the original can be advised to visit the California lighthouse, which is located in the northwestern part of Noord. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, you cannot imagine yourself as a city without a certain history.  For Noord, this story is the Battle of Ekuri, who was exalted to a national hero.  He fought with the German invaders and was shot near the Hague.  The hero has a chic monument.  The funeral of Ekuri Boy took place in 1947 with all possible military honors, and in 1987 he was posthumously awarded a medal. </p><h2>  Literature </h2><p>  Aruba Island is a place where new talents grow.  As for literature, poetry and books for children are most common here.  Novels, poetry and plays were printed for a long time by the house of Charuba, and then you could find really masterpieces.  To date, finding something worthwhile is much more difficult, few good works are published.  To be heard, authors must publish books at their own expense, but only wealthy Aruba citizens can do it.  In view of this situation, there were even attempts to restore activity and bring Charuba Publishing House back to life, but they ended in failure. </p>

    <h2>  Sport </h2><p>  Sports on the island are quite developed.  For example, from 1952 to 1984, athletes participated in the Summer Olympic Games.  Then they performed in a team of the Netherlands Antilles.  After 1988, the athletes were already a separate independent delegation.  However, unfortunately, while the island can not boast of a single medal. </p><p>  Also since 1988, the Aruba Football Union has been a member of FIFA. </p><h2>  Artists </h2><p>  Note that the works of artists have become an example and source of inspiration for many creators, whose names are now world famous.  As for the fine arts on the island, the <span>portrait style is the</span> least popular here <span>.</span>  Currently, more and more artists in sculpture and three-dimensional graphics.  Where did the inhabitants of the island come from, you ask?  The fact is that after 1988, at the peak of economic growth, the situation began to improve.  In the country (Aruba belongs to Holland), the first worthy graphic studios appeared.  There are a lot of professional artists here and they work as designers.  This is very profitable, because rich tourists often order the services of commercial designers.  Among the most high-profile names we mention Elvis Lopez, Stan Kuyperi, Vanessa Paulina, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Performers </h2><p>  Let's not forget about the performing arts.  By the way, rest on Aruba differs from that which tourists most often imagine on the islands.  Here you do not have to go to the beach or sit in the hotel room.  It is enough to go outside, and many different entertainments will overwhelm you.  This is not about cheap local clubs, but really interesting leisure. </p><p>  There are several theater troupes on the island who regularly perform.  The oldest and most popular of them is the Mascaruba troupe.  In Oranjestad (Aruba) there is the famous Cas di Cultura theater, which all tourists seek to visit.  Art projects in the country are actively developing thanks to the Arte pro Arte Foundation, which sponsors various cultural events.  For example, the dance fund organizes international festivals and opens workshops.  Young people who are invited to dance and ballet schools from an early age are actively attracted.  Twice a year, for many years in a row, Aruba hosts an international theater and dance festival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aruba Airport" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1997673.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aruba reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about this country are only positive.  Tourists are attracted by the opportunity to relax physically, spiritually and morally.  As mentioned above, the peculiarity of this island is that here the sea is not the main thing.  You can conquer the water, visit museums, theaters, festivals, play sports and try the chic local cuisine.  European tourists who are not used to sunbathing on the beach all day long are attracted by such opportunities.  Come and see for yourself that this is a magical island! </p>
