    <h2>  White celebration </h2><p>  Shot from different angles, it resembles an impregnable fortress, if the camera is looking from below, then the head of a cobra blowing its hood when viewed from above at the central ledge.  There are a lot of natural caves and faults, canopies and grottoes.  And all this is painted <span>white,</span> blinding eyes in the sun.  The white rock rises above the valley of the Biyuk-Karasu river (someone calls it Black Water, someone calls it Big Karasevka) by 100 meters, and above sea level - by 325. Of course, most of the names around are connected with the white color of the mountain - nearby there is a village of the same name, the area is called Belogorsky, and the mountain itself is a symbol of the district center. </p><h2>  Ancient temple </h2>

The white rock on its western side has aeolian grottoes (indentations blown out by the winds) and two caves - the upper and the lower.  The first one is in the center of the western wall.  Bob is interesting, such is its name, with its cave signs belonging to the Sarmatians.  It is possible that once there was their sanctuary, which was also probably called so: White Rock.  How to get to this place?  After walking a few meters from the bus stop of the same name, you need to turn onto the first wide street of the village of the same name, which will lead to the ford across the river, but there is a bridge over Karasevka nearby.  It is recommended to backpackers in the spring at the ford to stock up with drinking water.  Along the entire western wall there is a trail in the middle and the lower cave Bob.  Very beautiful views open near her, especially at sunset.  Birds nest on a steep rock.

She became famous after archaeologists found here the skeleton of a woman with a child.  The age of the well-preserved remains of a Neanderthal mother is 150,000 years.  Signs of the stay of the Sarmatians are also present.  The cave-grotto is overgrown with legends, the most eerie of which tells that a huge serpent lived here, and his course was dug up to Theodosius herself. </p><h2>  Ancient civilizations on our earth </h2>

Kolosov‚Äôs book ‚ÄúWhite Rock‚Äù, from which it becomes known that bones of a mammoth and cave bear, onager and giant deer were found at the tracks from the fires in these sites , wild horse and saiga.  In the rock on the White Rock, even the tooth of a giant shark was found.  In a word, this is a unique place, and the plans to create a park here are justified on its territory, which could accommodate not only modern infrastructure for recreation and tourism, but also exhibits that reflect the history of the rock and everything connected with it.  For example, statues of heroes of the famous films made here, and, of course, Neanderthals around the campfire eating a mammoth.

Here is another legend that tells that in front of the captive of the Turks Bogdan Khmelnitsky threw down his companions in chains.  But there are also reliable facts indicating the historical significance of this place.  They are connected with the name of the genius A.V. Suvorov.  There is a 700-year-old Suvorov oak.  It will become the pearl of the park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã70 hectares, which is planned to be created in memory of the legendary commander.  The name of the future park is Suvorovsky.  The troops under his leadership were stationed here in 1777.  And in 1783, Prince G.A. Potemkin-Tauride took the oath of allegiance to Russia from the defeated Crimean Beys brought here.  Beautiful place! </p><h2>  The location of the natural miracle </h2>

It is also famous for its amazing views, opening from its top in different directions.  They are unique both in the early morning and at sunset.  In the spring, the Red Beam, located in the north, justifying its name, is completely covered with blooming tulips.

From Simferopol to the aforementioned district center, buses run every one to two hours.  From Belogorsk (the so-called regional center) to the village of Belaya Skala (a stop is also called) - 10 minutes drive.  The interval of movement of buses and minibuses is 40 minutes.  Then it‚Äôs quite simple - the White Rock itself serves as a guideline.  You can start taking photos right here, then the views open one better than the other.  Trails are trodden, there are signs.  Tourists climb the mountain on a sloping slope, which makes the passage itself not without pleasantness. </p><h2>  White cliffs </h2>

Abkhazia can be proud not only of such attractions as New Athos Falls and the cave of the same name, but also this stretch of coast, which in photographs taken under certain lighting colors the Black Sea in white.  This is a <span>wild beach,</span> located near the village of Tsandripsh, located at the mouth of the Khashups river, 17 kilometers from Gagra, and 5 - from the border with Russia.

Since 1981 it has been recognized as a natural monument of national importance.  There are very few vacationers, people come here mainly to look at this natural monument.  It is located 300 meters from the boarding house "Sunny".  Around there is really a lot of sun, like on the entire coast, but here it is still reflected by white cliffs.  Abkhazia, given this unique natural gift, in order to attract tourists used the brand in the name of the hotel built right there.

    <h2>  Building Boom </h2><p>  Recently, tourism has started to develop intensively in Abkhazia again.  Old resorts are popular, and there is an active construction of new buildings that take into account the modern requirements of vacationers.  Mini-hotels are actively being built, which include the White Rocks.  She has, frankly, different reviews.  Outwardly cozy, two-story, located on a slope 50 meters from the sea, it has rooms for every taste, you can arrange accommodation without meals.  There is detailed information about it widely available, and negative reviews can be found there not only about the condition of the rooms, but also about the services provided, which inflicts a certain damage on the image of White Rocks. </p><h2>  Difficulties of becoming </h2>

And at the same time, this is not a wild place - there are many cafes, restaurants, markets around.  That is, the infrastructure is well developed.  It remains to be assumed that, given the remoteness from the tourism centers on the Black Sea coast, the hotel staff did not quite learn the principles of decent service.  But this is fixable, because they cannot understand in the village that tourism is the main source of budget revenues of the country, and that it is impossible to compete with the resorts of the Red and Mediterranean Seas that are popular with Russian tourists, being rude to customers.

    <h2>  Much more advantages </h2><p>  It should be noted the advantages of the hotel, which, of course, are.  For example, next to it there is a healing spring with water saturated with hydrogen sulfide.  We can not ignore the mild climate, which allows you to relax here in the winter.  Two hotel buildings were commissioned after 2012 - the buildings are completely new.  The abundance of fruits and vegetables of affordable cost has always made Abkhazia especially attractive.  A cozy hotel on the seashore can serve as a resting place between excursions around the country, which nature has so generously endowed with attractions. </p><h2>  Availability of necessary infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has an outdoor pool and a sauna with a font.  The institution provides two meals a day - breakfast and lunch.  According to the rest of people here, the food is very tasty.  Right on the territory of the small hotel there is a cafe and a dining room with 24 seats; there are a lot of other various food points within walking distance from the White Rocks Inn (Abkhazia).  There are also positive reviews.  It has a well-equipped beauty parlor, parking, and rooms have a TV and refrigerator, toilet and shower, hairdryer, air conditioning and Wi-Fi.  Other household appliances can be rented from the administrator.  A general <span>discount system is</span> provided for children <span>.</span>  The approach to the beach is equipped through a tunnel over which a railway track is laid.  You can get here by taxi or public transport from Adler to the Cossack Market, go through the border post, and then overcome 5 km to the hotel by any means of transport.  You can get there by train.  You can learn more about any option on the hotel‚Äôs website. </p>
