Smartphones differ from ordinary phones in the number of functions, screen size, and battery life.  If you need a phone only for calls, then the numerous functions of your smartphone may not be useful to you. <br><br>  The choice of smartphones on the market is more than large, this can be seen on the site <noindex>  <span>mmicenter.ru</span> </noindex>  .  You can get confused in numerous products.  Sales consultants can advise you on which phone to choose, but you should not completely rely on their advice, because they have a certain sales plan, which is mandatory to follow.  Therefore, they can advise a phone that doesn‚Äôt suit you.  It‚Äôs better to make a choice yourself. <br><br>  Several criteria should be highlighted, following which you can make a choice. <br><br>  1) Price. <br><br>  2) Phone brand <br><br>  3) Operating system <br><br>  4) Screen size.  Screen specifications. <br><br>  5) CPU <br><br>  Let's start with the operating system, because before you choose a phone at a cost and to the manufacturer, you need to know the technical criteria of smartphones. <br>  Operating system (OS).  The smartphone is reminiscent of the functions of a computer.  A smartphone is running an operating system, with which the phone executes commands.  There are many operating systems, but 3 operating systems are popular on the market, the so-called ‚Äú3 whales‚Äù in the OS market: iOS, Android, Windows Phone. <br><br>  iOS is an operating system that is installed only on Apple ‚ÄìiPhone smartphones.  This is a very convenient operating system with good design and graphics, which will help you enjoy using this smartphone.  Applications for this platform are very convenient.  As a rule, clients of social networks, necessary programs, interesting games first appear under this OS.  But it is worthwhile to warn those people who do not disdain "pirated" products.  You will have to pay for all applications, music, films, buying all this in a special virtual store iTunes Store.  Free download from the Internet and upload to this smartphone will not work. <br><br>  Android - is the most popular OS.  This operating system is installed in most smartphones that are present on the market.  The main advantage of this OS is openness, loyalty to developers.  New applications for this OS also appear pretty quickly.  This OS is slightly inferior in design to iOS.  Since Android is installed on a large number of smartphones, therefore, the price range is quite high, and you can choose the one that suits you best. <br><br>  Windows Phone (WP) is an operating system manufactured by Microsoft.  This is the third most common OS.  Applications for this system appear later.  This system is characterized by a bright design.  In convenience, this system exhausts both iOS and Android. <br><br>  Screen size.  The cost of the smartphone, the operating time, and the convenience of using it will depend on the screen size. <br><br>  Do not chase large screens.  Using phones with large screens is completely inconvenient.  Before buying, it is better to hold the device in your hand for several minutes, so that the smartphone is ‚Äúon hand‚Äù, scroll through the menu, applications.  If you feel discomfort when using, it is better not to take such a phone. <br><br>  Before buying, pay attention to the pixel density in the phone.  In the store, when you still choose a smartphone, open on it a video from YouTube or one that is in the phone‚Äôs memory. <br><br>  Processor. Do not fall for a large number of "cores" in the processor.  This is not a decisive factor.  The speed of the smartphone depends more on the quality of the OS. <br><br>  So, let's get down to price and brand. <br><br>  The cost of smartphones can be divided into several categories. <br><br>  1) Inexpensive (from 3500 to 7500 r).  In this price category, you can choose a good smartphone with Android or Windows Phone, with an average processor and a camera from 3 to 8 megapixels.  Phone brands: Samsung, Philips, LG, Nokia, Fly, Alcatel. <br><br>  2) Medium (from 7500 to 15000 r).  Smartphones in this price category are suitable for advanced users.  OS: Android, WP, iOS.  The processor in these smartphones is more powerful, the image is clearer.  The camera is from 8 to 13 megapixels.  Phone brands: Samsung, Philips, LG, Nokia, Fly, Alcatel, Lenovo, HTC, Apple. <br><br>  3) Expensive (from 18000 to 35000r).  It‚Äôs not a pity to spend this money on a smartphone for those who love the quality, design, style of the phone.  In these smartphones, the body is made of high-quality and durable materials, the processor is much more powerful, a clear screen, a camera from 8 to 13 megapixels.  Built-in memory up to 64 GB. Phone brands: Apple, Samsung, HTC, Nokia, LG. </p></div></article>
