    <h2>  Making a Seat Outboard Chair </h2><p>  The macrame seat is much more economical, you will need the following parts of the cord: </p><ul><li>  8 pieces of 6 m; </li><li>  4 to 5; </li><li>  4 to 4.5; </li><li>  2 to 4. </li></ul><p>  Now you need to place the workpiece on the hoop.  8 threads are fastened in pairs in the center at a distance of 6 cm from each other.  All others are fixed with the same distance on the sides. </p><p>  To fix the cable, it is necessary to make a knot on each thread.  We knit with the location of the knot at a distance of 6 cm, periodically we make a stretch. </p><p>  In order for the cocoon chair to be with a fringe, it is necessary to lengthen each thread by a meter and do not cut the end. </p><h2>  How to make a frame and backrest </h2><p>  To make a cocoon hanging chair with your own hands, you need to take care of a solid frame.  Wooden rods should be wrapped with a cord and inserted into the back, they should be fixed before knitting the back. </p><p>  The hoops on the opposite side must be secured with a cord.  The frame fits in the same way as the seat - a network of nodes. </p><p>  The next step is the location of the slings on the seat and the suspension of the chair. </p>
