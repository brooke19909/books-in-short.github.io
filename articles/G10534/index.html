  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Video surveillance is a guarantee of security. Where to order?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Most large stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouses, private houses are equipped with this type of protection against theft of property, money or goods, such as video surveillance.  This is one of the best methods of controlling the safety of people, actions of store employees, for example, or elementary control of the loss of goods.  There are many opinions, both positive and negative, regarding the implementation of this method of preventing theft in life.  Video surveillance is a very expensive pleasure, but it is better to acquire quality than low cost with further unpleasant consequences. </p><p><br>  You need to order a video surveillance installation from professionals <noindex>  <span>http://www.ergozoom.ru/</span> </noindex>  who can advise you on the installation of the necessary equipment, give advice on choosing the power of cameras and image quality. <br>  For shops and supermarkets, you need to install cameras with high definition, since the security of the store applies not only to goods and cash desks, but also to visitors.  This can be explained as follows: hypermarkets, supermarkets are places of large crowds of people, and for fraudsters and thieves this can be a good opportunity to profit.  There is a wallet, there are the contents of the pockets, and then the person at the checkout cannot pay and will claim that the wallet was with him before he went to the store.  And the reputation of this store will fall. <br>  On the site of video surveillance and security systems, you can choose ready-made sets of equipment for the target object.  For office, warehouse, store (regular or round-the-clock), cafe, restaurant, etc. </p><p><br>  Installing video cameras often helps in revealing thefts held in public places, and you can also observe statistics of thefts and robberies.  But there are times when the camcorder does not give a one hundred percent guarantee of security.  In such cases, the security system at the facility should be triggered.  If there is one. <br>  As a rule, video surveillance helps prevent theft by amateurs, not by professionals.  Most often these are people for whom petty theft is something like a hobby: adolescents or children who do not have enough money for chips or chocolate, mothers with strollers, young people who are thirsty for thrills, and many others whose motives are easy to understand. </p><p><br>  Video cameras are not a 100% guarantee, so prices in stores already have a mark-up, given future losses. <br>  The greater the clarity of the camera, the easier it will be to catch the criminal, the easier it is to identify the thief, so if you take cameras for their real use, then it is best to use quality, otherwise you can simply put camera models and entrust visitors only with security. </p></div></article>
