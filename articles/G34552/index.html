  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific knowledge and its features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From the very moment of his birth, a man seeks to know the world.  He does this in a variety of ways.  One of the surest ways to make what is happening in the world understandable and open is scientific knowledge.  Let's talk about how it differs, for example, from unscientific knowledge. </p><p>  The very first feature that scientific knowledge possesses is its objectivity.  A person who is committed to scientific views understands that everything in the world is developing whether we like it or not.  Private opinions and authorities cannot do anything about it.  And this is wonderful, because it is impossible to imagine a different situation.  The world would simply end up in chaos and could hardly exist. </p><p>  Another difference of scientific knowledge is the orientation of its results into the future.  Scientific discoveries do not always produce momentary results.  Many of them are doubted and persecuted by individuals who do not want to recognize the objectivity of phenomena.  A tremendous amount of time passes while a true scientific discovery is recognized as having taken place.  There is no need to go far for examples.  It is enough to recall the fate of the discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo Galilei regarding the bodies of the solar galaxy. </p><p>  Scientific and unscientific knowledge has always been in conflict, and this has determined yet another <span>feature of scientific knowledge.</span>  It necessarily goes through such stages as observation, classification, description, experiment and explanation of the studied natural phenomena.  Other types of these stages are not inherent at all or they are present in them separately. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientific knowledge and <span>scientific knowledge</span> have two levels: <span>empirical and theoretical.</span>  <span>Empirical</span> scientific knowledge is the study of facts and laws established by generalizing and systematizing the results that are obtained through observation and experimentation.  Empirically, for example, Charles's law on the dependence of the gas pressure and its temperature, the Gay-Lussac law on the dependence of the gas volume and its temperature, and Ohm's law on the dependence of the current strength on its voltage and resistance are revealed. </p><p>  And theoretical scientific knowledge more abstractly considers natural phenomena, because it deals with objects that are impossible to observe and study under ordinary conditions.  In this way were discovered: the law of universal gravitation, the transformation of one <span>type of energy</span> into another and its conservation.  This is how electronic and <span>genetic engineering</span> develops <span>.</span>  This <span>type of knowledge is</span> based on the construction in close connection with each other of principles, concepts, theoretical schemes and logical consequences arising from the initial statements. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge and scientific knowledge are obtained through observation and experimentation.  An experiment differs from observation in that the scientist has the opportunity to isolate the subject under study from external influences, surrounding him with special, artificially created conditions.  An experiment can exist in a mental form.  This happens when it is impossible to study the object due to the high cost and complexity of the required equipment.  Here, scientific modeling is used, the creative imagination of a scientist who puts forward hypotheses is used. </p><p>  Scientific and unscientific knowledge always walks alongside.  And although they are most often in a confrontation, it must be said that the first is impossible without the second.  It is impossible to imagine modern science without an inquiring folk mind that invented myths, studied phenomena in the course of life practice, and left our generation a priceless treasury of folk wisdom, which contains common sense that helps us to be guided in life.  A large role in the knowledge of the world is given to objects of art.  How diverse life is, so diverse are the <span>ways of knowing</span> its laws. </p>
