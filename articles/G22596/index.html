To answer this question, you need to carefully understand the topic.  Although the service is provided without any additional instructions, it has a number of interesting features that must be considered.  First, we consider the meaning of the existence of such a function, and then move on to the instructions for its activation. </p><h2>  Why is this service needed? </h2><p>  “Promised payment” in “Tele2” - an opportunity to replenish a mobile account for up to 7 days.  A subscriber can get a kind of loan from a company, which he can use to pay for communication services.  You cannot transfer this money to another user and pay for purchases via the Internet.  And if you plan to change the tariff, send a paid SMS or call abroad, then the service may provide such an opportunity.  It remains only to figure out how to take the "Promised Payment" on "Tele2". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topnomer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Promised Payment service allows you to temporarily top up your mobile phone account" class="if uuid-3132069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132069.jpg"></div><h2>  How to use this service? </h2><p>  Now you should delve into the procedure for receiving money from the operator.  The instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Activate your mobile phone. </li><li>  Dial the command * 122 #, click on the call. </li><li>  You will receive a message about the availability of payment and the maximum amount. </li><li>  If the operator is ready to provide the service, then dial * 122 * 1 #, press the call button. </li><li>  To take a different amount, it is enough to indicate the corresponding figure in the window that appears. </li><li>  Wait until the account is replenished and you can use the funds received.  Please note that a commission of 10% will be deducted from the amount provided. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is how the Promised Payment availability message looks like" class="if uuid-3132089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132089.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure is quite simple and takes only a few minutes.  But a situation may arise that the payment is available, but you can’t get it.  This may be due to various reasons.  To understand the situation, just call the support of the mobile operator at 611. You will receive advice and recommendations to solve the problem.  And then we will talk about the basic conditions for receiving the “Promised Payment” of “Tele2” to the number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mandatory requirements for the provision of services </h2><p>  To fully enjoy such a convenient offer from a mobile operator, you need to consider a number of nuances.  They are the basis for the provision of the promised payment to the subscriber and are as follows: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to use the services of Tele2 for more than 60 days. </li><li>  A tariff with a prepayment system is active on the room (here it means that you first deposit money and only then use the connection).  If social and preferential services are provided, then the promised payment will not be available. </li><li>  Debt does not exceed 30 rubles (conditions may vary depending on the region). </li><li>  There is no active mobile loan on the room. </li><li>  Over the past month, you spent more than 50 rubles on communication services (be sure to check with the operator, for some regions the conditions may be different). </li><li>  The more finance you spend, the higher the amount of the “Promised Payment”. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="tele2wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="There are a number of conditions for a Promised Payment." class="if uuid-3132091" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132091.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, the nuances of providing this service abound.  Be sure to comply with all conditions so as not to encounter unpleasant situations. </p><h2>  Features for individual regions </h2><p>  Now you know how to take the “Promised payment” on “Tele2”.  But do not rush, as the conditions of the mobile operator are distributed separately for each region of the Russian Federation.  Mainly distinctive nuances relate to the following areas: </p><ol><li>  The amount of the payment may vary from 150 to 700 rubles. </li><li>  Different terms of service. </li><li>  The minimum debt threshold is from 5 to 100 rubles. </li><li>  Additional nuances (specified directly from the mobile operator at 611). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.protarif.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Each region has its own special conditions." class="if uuid-3132095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19296/3132095.jpg"></div><p>  Before you take the "Promised payment" on "Tele2", be sure to read all the conditions and requirements.  You can do this on the official website of the mobile operator or by calling in support of subscribers.  And remember that the features of the service are tied to the region where you purchased the SIM card.  They will not change if you change your place of residence or go to another subject of the Russian Federation for a long period. </p>
