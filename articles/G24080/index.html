  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application builder for Android: review of the best applications, features, operating instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A little earlier, the creation of sites involved only professional programmers and layout designers.  Later, with the advent of special shells - CMS ‚Äì content management systems, any novice in this business could cope with this task.  The latter does not need to learn programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand understand the layout.  It‚Äôs enough to pick up a template and fill it with content. </p><p>  A similar situation occurs with the Android platform.  A few years ago, creating a normally functioning software for mobile devices was only possible for a specialist knowledgeable in programming languages.  Today, application designers for Android have taken on this role. </p><p>  They greatly facilitate the entire layout process and do not require any specific knowledge from the user.  It is enough that this, as they say, was in the subject, and had a minimal theoretical base in this area.  Well, knowledge of the English language here will obviously not be superfluous, because a good half of the software does not have Russian-language localization. </p><p>  There are a lot of similar designers for creating applications on Android on the Web.  And if advanced users are still somehow guided in all this diversity, then beginners simply shrug their hands and do not know which software to pay attention to. </p><p>  We will try to understand this issue and designate the best application designers for Android, which are distinguished by their quality component, work efficiency and accessibility for ordinary users.  All the platforms described below can be found on the official resources of the developers, so there should be no problems with testing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth deciding on the critical nuances that need to be taken into account before choosing the application builder for Android.  A good half of such software offers the creation of two types of software - HTML5 and native. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.codementor.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="constructor for creating applications on android" class="if uuid-2872063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872063.jpg"></div><p>  In the first case, we have an adapted application for a specific version of the website.  That is, the output is additional software attached to the main site.  Such application designers for Android are the least popular, but are still in demand among layout designers and programmers.  A striking example here is the YouTube service with a host of related software ‚Äútied‚Äù to it. </p><h2>  Native constructors </h2><p>  Native or otherwise independent of the site designers are much more popular.  For such applications, you do not need a browser or any control web resources.  Native software has a clear advantage over the rest.  One of these is the sending of push messages, which users rarely deactivate. </p><p>  As a fly in the ointment here is the value of the product.  If the HTML5 application builder for Android and iOS will cost an average of 1,000 rubles (monthly maintenance), then you will have to pay at least two thousand or three for the native ordinary version.  Developers stipulate such costs by registering the product in Google Play and the App Store. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The best designers </h2><p>  Next, we consider specific representatives of this segment.  It‚Äôs worth to clarify right away that the designers of Android applications on a PC, that is, local ones, are extremely rare.  They work mainly in their environment - Android.  But almost all programmers and typesetters use platform emulators: NOX, BlueStacks, Andy, etc. They feel great in the Windows environment.  The same rule is true for iOS. </p><h2>  Goodbarber </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular designers from French developers.  The product is primarily striking with an abundance of beautiful and vibrant patterns.  The platform easily synergizes with both the Android operating system and iOS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodbarber.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application builder for android and ios" class="if uuid-2872069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872069.jpg"></div><p>  The designer offers a lot of useful and relevant functionality now: integration with social services, chats, iBeacon beacons and geozoning.  Using this platform, you can quickly create an application from scratch.  Just select the template you like and start filling it. </p><p>  The output is products that are very difficult to distinguish from similar applications made by professionals.  It is also worth noting that for working with databases, the GoodBarber Android application builder is ideal, so here you can create complex and multi-level software.  The platform is flexible, understandable, convenient and has great features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="techglimpse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="android application builder" class="if uuid-2872061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872061.jpg"></div><p>  As for the entry threshold, a beginner in this matter will quite cope with the designer.  Detailed instructions are in the reference section, where step by step all the stages of creating applications are explained, from the choice of a template to the final layout.  The only thing worth mentioning is that, alas, there is no Russian-language localization, and the developer offers only English, French and German interface languages. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the product is about 2,000 rubles / month. </p><h2>  Shoutem </h2><p>  The platform has been successfully operating since 2011 and during this time it was, as they say, polished to the brilliance by the developers.  The product offers a wide and quite powerful functionality.  One of these and the most popular is the geolocalized catalog of places.  This allows you to use the designer as an advertising software for restaurants, museums, entertainment centers and other points associated with the map. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shoutem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android application builder on pc" class="if uuid-2872062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872062.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the platform received sensible integration tools with third-party monetization applications.  Advertising is fully supported, and not easy in the format of pop-ups, but with a competent synergy in the interface. </p><h2>  Product Features </h2><p>  In the library of templates you can spend more than one hour looking for the right option, but you will surely find it, because the developer offers a lot of solutions for every taste and color.  The entry threshold for the platform is low and those who have at least once encountered such products will quickly master the software.  If you encounter any difficulties, then the platform help system is at your service.  There, the layout of applications is described in stages: the search for a suitable template taking into account the direction, the choice of monetization method, geolocation tools, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new.shoutem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android application constructor for working with a database" class="if uuid-2872066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872066.jpg"></div><p>  Of the minuses, we can note the lack of Russian-language localization, but the problem is solved by installing third-party add-ons.  The latter have a minimal effect on usability, but you will have an application designer for Android in Russian, especially if you have very tight English. </p><p>  The approximate cost of the platform is about 1,500 rubles / month. </p><h2>  Swiftic </h2><p>  Another powerful application builder for Android, launched in 2010 by Israeli developers.  The platform offers users a chic set of features for almost any project.  Many advanced users call this constructor the best of its kind. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.affiliatebay.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application platform" class="if uuid-2872068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872068.jpg"></div><p>  The local library pleases with the widest choice of building blocks: a lot of templates, the integration of organizers, calendars, directories, loyalty cards, e-commerce and much more.  Developers position their product as an ideal tool for typesetting applications in the field of restaurant services, music groups, cinemas and other entertainment. </p><h2>  Platform Features </h2><p>  The service allows you to publish ready-made applications right away in Google Play, and with the so-called guarantee of success.  That is, if you do not achieve any significant results in your activities, then the developers will provide free six months of using the platform.  And for beginners in this matter - this is a serious argument in favor of this product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apptooltester.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="application creation" class="if uuid-2872064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2872064.jpg"></div><p>  As for the entry threshold, it is minimal here.  In addition, the designer is literally teeming with all kinds of hints and instructions.  There is also a competent master assistant who will tell you what in general terms and guide you through all the hot spots of the platform: getting started, choosing a template, designing columns, titles, as well as a selection of optimal tools for monetization and geo targeting. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Russian-language localization, as in previous cases, is not provided, but the problem is solved with the help of third-party crackers. </p><p>  Estimated cost of software - about 3,500 rubles / month. </p>
