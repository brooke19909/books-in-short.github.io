Sometimes it seems that he didn‚Äôt leave the country anywhere ‚Äî the neighbors were Russian, the staff was Russian-speaking, he turned on the TV ‚Äî and there was both RTR and NTV. </p><p>  The hotel "Giftun Azur" is a completely different matter.  Hurghada - the resort where it is located, is famous for its wonderful beaches, the Red Sea and a lot of entertainment for every taste.  The hotel complements all these advantages with ideal conditions for tourist life and a pleasant atmosphere, which is constantly present here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  <span>Hotel Giftun Azur Resort</span> 4 * is located on the outskirts of the Egyptian resort of Hurghada, from the airport.  It is only 3 km away, so the transfers provided by travel agencies ‚Äúfly‚Äù here in 7-10 minutes.  But the noise and any other inconvenience associated with the proximity of the airport is not felt.  The center of Hurghada from the hotel is slightly less than 8 km or 3-4 minutes by shuttle bus.  The road is nearby, a stop is almost opposite the hotel.  On the same road there are many different shops with clothes, souvenirs, accessories, beach goods, cosmetics, as well as bars, taverns, there is a youth club where discos are held every day. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Giftun Azur (Hurghada) has a very beautiful territory that does not allow to forget that this is Africa.  Around a lot of palm trees.  Even the playground has found a place between these exotics.  But not only variegated palms here are pleasing to the eye.  The territory is literally buried in blooming bougainvilleas, bright vibrant cascades decorating all the bungalows.  Every corner of the territory is ideally swept, no mote anywhere.  Tourists are impressed by the large pool with an island in the center, where you can conveniently sit for relaxation.  The tennis courts, sports fields, an amphitheater, shops, parking, several bars decorated in an exotic design give an exclusive look to the hotel.  The whole territory is functional enough to ensure a good rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
