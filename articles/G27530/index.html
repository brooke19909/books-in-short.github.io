Making small crafts calms, relieves stress and develops fine motor skills, which has a good effect on brain activity.  You can find wire craft ideas below. </p><h2>  Flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dongnuosc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire flowers" class="if uuid-2436224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436224.jpg"></div><p>  The ideal material for creativity is chenille wire.  This soft and plastic tourniquet is well suited to bring childhood fantasies to life.  Even a small child can work with such wire.  He can play with her, and then make something.  For example, a flower.  Crafts made of wire are distinguished by their decorative appearance and good preservation.  How to make a bright plant?  Take the yellow wire and twist it with a spiral.  Now create waves from the pink soft material.  Each petal needs to be fixed, interlacing with the extreme ring of the yellow spiral.  Finish the product by attaching a green leg.  You can also create a soft sheet.  Looks beautiful bouquet made in this technique.  It can be presented on a birthday to mom or grandmother. </p><h2>  Carrot </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dongnuosc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire carrot" class="if uuid-2436225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436225.jpg"></div><p>  In a similar technique, you can produce fruits and vegetables in order to explain to a child how they look with a good example.  Let's make a carrot <span>out of fluffy wire.</span>  <span>The craft</span> completely repeats the shape of the vegetable, although it exaggerates a bit.  To create a carrot, you will need an orange and green wire, as well as some kind of cylinder with a diameter of 2 cm. Wind the orange wire with a spiral, and then remove it from the base.  Then make the top of the carrot a little wider than its nose.  We leave this blank and proceed to the production of grass.  We make three semicircles of green wire and wind them at the base.  We attach such a twig to the wide side of the carrot.  The product is ready.  In this way, you can make an apple, for this purpose you will need to use a semicircular shape, make fruit from two halves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Christmas tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vamosadecorar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire tree" class="if uuid-2436229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436229.jpg"></div><p>  Such a <span>piece</span> of <span>chenille wire</span> can decorate not only the nursery, but also the living room.  The Christmas tree looks stylish and decorative.  How to make such a product?  To create a Christmas tree, you need two types of wire.  We take a standard copper wire and make a frame.  It will consist of a base circle and six segments that will form a cone.  Solder the base or wrap the parts together with a less thick wire.  The frame is ready, now you can proceed to its decor.  Take fluffy wire and make curls out of it.  You need to make blanks of different sizes.  Now attach the parts to the metal frame made earlier.  You can use either green wire or any other color wire for decoration.  Take, for example, white or dairy.  Then your product will look very stylish.  Additionally, you can decorate the tree with beads, beads or metal fittings. </p><h2>  Hare </h2><div class="photo" data-original="astucerie.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire bunny" class="if uuid-2436234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436234.jpg"></div><p>  Cute wire crafts can be a toy for your child.  For example, you can make an animal figurine that will cheer you up and be able to captivate your child for more than one evening.  You can make such animals together with the child.  The step-by-step process of creating a hare you can see above.  It looks as follows.  Take the cylinder and wind a soft wire of bright color on it.  Remove the spiral and give it volume by slightly fluffing up the workpiece.  Insert a piece of wire between the turns at the back of the product.  Fold the ends of the wire to the center.  It will be the feet of a hare.  Now insert another piece of wire between the turns, but this time in the front of the product.  By analogy with paws, bend your ears.  It remains to make the hare's face.  You can cut out eyes from colored paper or fabric, or you can buy blanks in the store.  As a nose, you can use any large bead. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pendant </h2><div class="photo" data-original="artefaccio.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire pendant" class="if uuid-2436235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436235.jpg"></div><p>  Crafts made of wire can look not only like toys, but also as accessories.  For example, you can make yourself a fashionable pendant for a dress.  To do this, take the copper wire and flatten it.  For this purpose, you can use a hammer or use nippers.  Before you begin, you need to draw a sketch of the decoration.  The easiest way is to create a stylish accessory made of wire wrapped in a spiral.  Twist one half of the metal piece to one side and the other to the opposite.  To make the jewelry look more interesting, you need to twist one part more than the other.  Now connect the workpieces.  They should be connected in the following order: the lower and upper parts should be mirrored vertically, and the side ones - horizontally.  Fasten the workpieces together should be a thin wire. </p><h2>  Flat figures </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat figures" class="if uuid-2436242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436242.jpg"></div><p>  It is most convenient to make small crafts from wire using molds.  To do this, take a wooden base and attach twigs to it.  Depending on the sketch, you can vary the size of the future product and the sharpness of the corners.  If you want to make a sharp detail in the animal, drive in the carnations in the right place, and if you need to make a smooth turn, it is advisable to use a small part of the branch.  But how to connect the finished product?  It is not necessary to fasten it on the form, otherwise you will not be able to remove it.  Connect the parts of the figure by twisting one end of the wire with another.  Be sure to think in advance where the twisted part will be located.  It is advisable to do it on the back of the animal, since a noticeable thickening will be located in this place.  You can decorate the figurine with various details that will need to be made of thinner wire.  For example, it can be a bow in a cat's neck or a bone in a dog. </p><h2>  Paper clips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire clips" class="if uuid-2436250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436250.jpg"></div><p>  Children at school constantly lose bookmarks.  Such colored pieces of paper are inexpensive, but few people want to go to the store every three days (to purchase a new pack).  Make your child bookmarks, paper clips with their own hands from the wire.  Such figures can serve as toys, as well as a stylish and useful thing at the same time.  It is possible to make in such a technique not only animals, but also things around us.  For example, an envelope, a guitar, a flower.  How to make a bookmark?  You need to arm yourself with pliers and roll up the shape.  To make this process easier, and you did not have to fantasize at the time of creation, you should draw a sketch in advance.  One end of the wire should always be twisted into a spiral.  This item will cling to the paper, transforming the wire figure into a paper clip. </p><h2>  Tree </h2><div class="photo" data-original="naukalib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wire tree" class="if uuid-2436319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2436319.jpg"></div><p>  What DIY crafts can I make?  From this material you can make pendants and earrings.  One of the options for such a product is presented above.  It will be very <span>easy to make</span> such a pendant or earrings <span>.</span>  <span>Crafts from beads</span> and wire are made in the sequence described below.  First, a circular base form is formed.  Now you need to take a thin wire and make the roots.  Attach a piece of wire to the ring, make several revolutions, and attach another cut in the neighborhood in a similar way.  At the end of this stage, 25 segments should be fastened on the circle.  Let's start creating the roots.  Of every three adjacent wires, braids must be braided about 1 cm long.  Now we twist all the wires into a bundle.  This will be the trunk.  And 3-6 wires are gradually discarded.  These branches need to be twisted into bundles.  We hang beads, beads or pebbles on the ends of the branches.  Nodules attach the wire to the base ring. </p>
