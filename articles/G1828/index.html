For example, unlimited internet.  And MTS is no exception.  Such a useful service as ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù, unfortunately, is far from satisfying everyone.  And if you connect it easily, then abandoning it is problematic.  So how to disable ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù on ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù if there is no need to use the option? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable minibit on mts" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/449060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  First of all, you need to know that this service was previously included in the package immediately.  There was no need to connect it yourself.  What is the meaning of the service?  For example, you have a need to use the Internet from your phone, but your tariff plan is not too economical in this regard.  The MiniBit service allows you to use the World Wide Web at a reduced price.  In this case, payment will be charged only for the day on which you used the Internet.  That is, you do not write off the monthly fee for the service on a daily basis.  Only for the day of use.  But, unfortunately, it does not do without minuses.  For example, many complain that payment is made too often, although they do not use the service, or the connection speed is too slow.  How to disable ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù on ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù if this option is no longer necessary?  It depends on the region of residence in the first place.  In some areas, the service is still available for connection and use.  But there are also regions where the option works only for those subscribers who have connected it up to a certain number.  And, of course, it will no longer be possible to connect it after disconnecting.  Think about whether this option really bothers you like that?  After all, it is possible that the preferential Internet is useful to you at some critical moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable minibit on mts Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13885/449061.jpg" width="600"></div>

If the confirmation does not arrive within 24 hours, contact the Internet assistant on the official website of MTS in the Samara and Region region.

    <h2>  Saratov </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù option is available both for connecting and for disconnecting in the Saratov region.  And if the activation of the service does not raise big questions, then refusing it can make you sweat.  Firstly, disconnect notifications do not always arrive on time.  If you send an SMS to number 111 with the text ‚Äú6200‚Äù, the service will be turned off, but not immediately.  This may take some time.  Secondly, before you turn off ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù on ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù (Saratov and the region), you need to call the operator and consult.  You will need to indicate the subscriber number and name of the owner of the SIM card, after which the service will be disabled for you.  This option gives a 100% guarantee that the option will be turned off immediately. </p><h2>  Stavropol region </h2><p>  In the Stavropol Territory, the MiniBit service is no <span>longer available</span> for connection.  But if you became its owner until July 15, 2013, then the terms of service for you remain the same, according to the contract.  How to disable ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù on ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù?  The Stavropol Territory (including all the settlements of this region), like any Russian region, can voluntarily refuse the imposed service.  To do this, send an SMS with the number "6200".  This is a service disconnect code.  The operator number is 111. After some time, a notification should come that the option has been successfully disabled.  If this does not happen, you can contact the consultant for help in the MTS mobile phone salon. </p><h2>  Why is the service out of date </h2><p>  Despite all the advantages, the option has a significant minus, which made it so unclaimed that most of the Russian regions have already abandoned it.  Which one?  Little traffic.  In total, the daily rate, which is given by the option, is 10 MB.  This, of course, is enough to view mail, for example, or download one or two songs, but not enough for normal use of the Internet.  It is precisely because of this that more and more users are wondering how to disable MiniBit on MTS.  Many then simply switch to more profitable package plans.  For example, SuperBit.  There are more convenient options for using the World Wide Web. </p><h2>  What subscribers should remember </h2><p>  If you have an old tariff plan and service was included in it, then the company is not entitled to change the terms of use without notifying you as its subscriber.  You will receive an SMS notification.  If you do not use the Internet on your phone at all, then even the activated service will not bring you a loss.  There is simply nothing for the company to charge you for a <span>subscription fee,</span> which means that your finances are safe.  If you are still interested in how to disable ‚ÄúMiniBit‚Äù on ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù, then contact the operator in your area.  A qualified employee of a cellular company will not only tell you about which options you have connected and what their cost is, but will also offer more interesting options.  The MiniBit option is ideal for those who do not often use the Internet on their phones, but simply check from time to time, for example, mail or browse one or two pages on the network.  Other active users of the World Wide Web should look for more profitable services that will allow you to use the Internet as much as you want.  For this you need to know how to disable all other options. </p>
