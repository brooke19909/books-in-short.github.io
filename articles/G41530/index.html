It is clear that each of these stages has its own characteristics and subtleties, which in many respects deform the general laws of formation.  However, there is the possibility of some classification of the state of legal consciousness, both of society as a whole and of its individual representatives. </p>

    <p>  The system of <span>social values</span> in the USSR </p><p>  As if each of us did not belong to the <span>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,</span> but this is our story, which allows us to more fully understand and evaluate processes in various areas of life of both the state and citizens.  Modern Russian sociology of law is no exception.  It is worth recalling that the principle of the <span>dictatorship of the proletariat</span> was the main socio-political principle, at least declared <span>.</span>  This fact largely determined the understanding of law by a citizen and, accordingly, regulated the issues of social policy of the state itself.  Thus, the sociology of law in the USSR was focused on the exclusion, if possible, of all social risks. </p>

    <p>  New Russian Federation </p><p>  The fundamental changes that sociology has undergone in modern Russia have their roots in the relatively distant 80s of the last century.  It was at this moment that the fundamental aspect <span>of the</span> state‚Äôs <span>social policy was</span> not on the collective, as the unit of reference, but on the individual, which largely changed not only the legal system in the country, but also the legal awareness of people.  Even more actively, all these processes were visible in the 90s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Of great importance in the legal consciousness of citizens during this period were the problems of the state, both in the economy and in the field of political structure.  The system of priorities collapsed, creating a rather serious vacuum, which to some extent contributed to a distortion of the understanding of legal norms by the population.  Not the least role in this process was played by the fact that <span>social institutions</span> practically did not fulfill their functions, and there was no time left for such a concept as the sociology of law, nor, as they say, forces.  We can say the bottom of this fall was 1994, when, in the end, the state was adopted in the field of social policy.  In this case, special attention was paid directly to the fundamental aspects of the life of social groups, such as social partnership, the formation of the labor market (including in the projection of unemployment), and the stabilization of living standards.  It is worth noting that the last priority considered by modern Russian sociology of law has replaced the distribution system of the so-called public consumption funds. </p>

    <p>  Modern realities - new challenges </p><p>  It is clear that time does not stand in one place.  As a result, the sociology of law should move forward in its development.  Moreover, the current conditions for the development of society form new tasks and functions of the state in social policy.  First of all, we are talking about strengthening the so-called targeted support for all poor and low-income citizens.  Secondly, the serious problem that sociology in one degree or another must solve in modern Russia is, without a doubt, internally displaced persons and other groups of migrants.  Naturally, their adaptation to society and sufficient social support are necessary. </p>
