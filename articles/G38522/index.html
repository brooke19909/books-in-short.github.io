  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to dig a well in the country with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Clean and fresh water in the country is a must.  And in order not to need it, you need to dig a well.  The easiest way is to entrust this work to specialists, and yet you can also build a well in the country with your own hands.  This is in addition and the money will save that would have to pay for the work.  All your expenses will come down to the fact that you have to buy special concrete rings and hire a car to transport them to the cottage.  What the diameter of the rings will be depends on two reasons: how big you want to have a well, and how deep the aquifer will lie.  In the latter case, the greater the depth, the wider the well should be.  Please note that one ring should go slightly on the cone, and a shoe with metal rings should be installed on it. </p><p>  Before you begin to build a well in the country with your own hands, take a look at the wells of your neighbors.  Take an interest in their depth, amount of water, etc.  Determining the best location for the location of the well yourself is difficult.  You will certainly get to the aquifer, but only at what depth will this happen, only specialists can determine.  When choosing a place for a well, make sure that it is as far away as possible from those places that can pollute water (for example, a toilet, a drain from roofs).  Well, of course, you should not build a well very far from home, a distance of 5-6 meters is the maximum. </p><p>  So, you have decided on the place, bought the rings, now you can begin to build a well in the country with your own hands.  We put the first conical ring on the ground and dig all the earth inside it.  The ring will gradually fall down.  After it drops below ground level, put on it a second ring.  We connect both rings with steel strips, which we bolt through the holes in the rings.  Then we continue to choose the ground in the rings.  And so on until all the rings are in the ground.  You will need so many rings so that you can get to the aquifer, and this already depends on the characteristics of a particular site.  Having reached the aquifer, the bottom must be covered with layers of gravel (three will be enough).  The thickness of each layer should be about 10 cm. In this case, with each layer, gravel should be larger. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That's all, the <span>well at the cottage with his own hands is</span> almost ready.  It remains only to build a house over the well and be sure to make doors so that any debris does not pollute the water. </p><p>  Do you want to make your country life even easier?  A water supply station for a summer residence is exactly what you need.  If you decide to install it, then you can forget about what it means to get water from a well by immersing and raising a bucket.  The station will do all this work.  It will help pump out as much water as you need from the well.  You can not only water the garden, but also conduct water directly into the house, which is very good. </p><p>  Well, now you will definitely not have problems in the country with water.  You can safely plant a garden, flowers, garden.  By the way, about the garden.  On it you will have to grow a wide variety of vegetables, including tomatoes, peppers.  And in order to collect a good harvest, you will have to build <span>greenhouses for the garden</span> with your own hands.  Making them is very simple, and all you need is special plastic tubes for the greenhouse, fasteners for the film and, of course, the film itself.  Standard tubes have a length of 3 meters, and their number, as well as the amount of film, depends on how big the greenhouse you are going to build.  Now the main thing: we bend the tubes and insert them into the ground.  We cover them with film, fasten with clips, and pull the extreme arches tightly using a rope tied to pegs driven into the ground.  The free ends of the film are covered with sand.  That's all, now you can start planting vegetables.  With a well and a hotbed, your life in the country will become much easier. <strong></strong></p>
