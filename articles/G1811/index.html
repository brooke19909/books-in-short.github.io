  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a payment request?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern conditions, a significant part of all payments is made in non-cash form, and cash turnover is gradually reduced, including under the influence of the state.  In order to avoid problems with cashless <span>cash flow,</span> you need to know how to fill out a payment order <strong> </strong>  or other types of settlement documents. </p><p>  Various settlement documents are drawn up primarily on paper, but the use of electronic systems with electronic digital signatures is gaining momentum. </p><p>  The most common form of settlement documents is a payment order, which is a requirement for the servicing bank to transfer a certain amount of money from the payer's account to the payee. </p><p>  <span>A payment order may,</span> by agreement of the parties, be urgent or premature.  An urgent payment order is used in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  payment after shipment of the product, that is, through direct acceptance; </li><li>  <span>advance payment,</span> that is, payment before work, delivery of goods; </li><li>  partial payments in case of major transactions. </li></ul><p>  In addition, a payment order can be paid in full or in part if there is no necessary money in the account.  This is noted on the payment document. </p><p>  In turn, the payment request is, as it were, a mirror image of the order.  This is the requirement of the supplier directed to the buyer regarding payment for goods and services.  The payer must bring an acceptance of payment to the bank within three days.  Having determined the possibility of making payment on the received payment request, the payer submits this document to the bank for transferring the accepted amount to the seller’s account.  Thus, the payment request is drawn up, unlike the order, by the recipient of the funds, and not the payer, and represents the payer's request to the bank to make payment according to the settlement and <span>shipping documents of the</span> delivered products. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Settlements by payment claims have the following specifics: as already noted, the recipient must respond to the request no later than three banking days by accepting it or refusing it.  The refusal must be justified.  A payment request is drawn up on form blank number 0401061. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that all banking documents are prepared in triplicate, certified by the signature of authorized persons and the seal of the organization. </p><p>  All banking documents, regardless of their type, must have the required details - such as the name of the document, amount, date, number, as well as data of the recipient and payer of funds and the banks serving them.  The type of payment and the priority are also indicated. </p><p>  To pay taxes and contributions to the <span>state budget</span> , the KBK, OKATO, the period for which the payment is made and its type must also be indicated. </p><p>  In addition to these settlement documents, checks, letters of credit, and collection are also used in practice. </p><p>  Despite the fact that a payment order and a payment request are among the simplest and least costly forms of payment, these <span>payment methods</span> have their advantages. </p><p>  For a letter of credit - this is the assurance that all documents for the goods will be duly executed and transmitted within the prescribed time.  Collection also guarantees minimal risks associated with the supplier's failure to fulfill contractual obligations.  In any case, if the supplier does not fulfill the obligations properly, the money will not be transferred to him.  This option is extremely beneficial when working with new partners, as it minimizes risks. </p><p>  Cons for all of the same type: the relative high cost and significant labor costs for accounting for these calculations. </p>
