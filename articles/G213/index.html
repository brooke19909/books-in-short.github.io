In this article you will find interesting notes about possible and impossible sketches for creating unforgettable decoration elements.  You will learn about the nuances of a given hobby (or profession) when such compositions are intended for someone else. </p><h2>  Nature itself in the interior </h2><p>  Today, many people prefer environmentally friendly, natural things: food, clothes, furniture, decoration elements.  So, in the interior they try to use compositions from fresh flowers.  And indeed, this is the most natural material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="renatures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition in a basket" class="if uuid-2576999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2576999.jpg"></div><p>  Starting with bouquets of wildflowers, ending with huge (engineering skills will help) floral walls.  Of course, the life span of such decorations in your apartment will last only a few days, depending on the conditions of care.  But, having removed one bouquet, you can successfully choose the next one. </p><p>  When making a sketch yourself, one of the most important issues is the correct combination of aromas. </p><h2>  To whom duration is preferable </h2><p>  When you get tired of changing compositions from fresh flowers, an alternative appears - artificial plants.  This option is great for those who: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Doesn‚Äôt like to devote much time to cleaning and caring for bouquets, </li><li>  doesn't like the smell of flowers </li><li>  prefers long-term home decoration. </li></ul><p>  You can also say that such compositions are for lazy hosts.  Not in a bad sense of the word, rather, for those who already have enough worries in household or work matters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="davidpaluchdmlf.canalblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition with bottles" class="if uuid-2577003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577003.jpg"></div><p>  Another advantage of this choice is the ability to combine odor-incompatible flowers. </p><p>  And you can also find non-existent species or unnatural color flowers.  Which will also be the indisputable advantage of compositions of artificial flowers. </p><p>  As you can see, there are advantages and disadvantages everywhere.  The choice is yours. </p><h2>  DIY flower arrangements </h2><p>  And now you have reached the most limitless and unimaginable flight of your imagination: how and from which to compose a composition at home. </p><p>  Fully decorated bouquets consist of the flowers themselves, decorations and coasters.  Today you can use everything that is at hand or in a nearby store.  Therefore, it is better to disassemble each of the constituent elements separately. </p><p>  Firstly, flowers and other plants.  They can be live, dried or artificial from any materials.  Usually you are used to seeing textile options.  But today's range of materials allows you to go much further.  So, you can use stucco flowers (polymer clay, plastic), textile ribbons, beads, paper (for origami, corrugated or any other), wooden blanks.  In general, any material available to you can be used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="animal of flowers" class="if uuid-2577011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577011.jpg"></div><p>  Secondly, decorative ornaments.  Now plush toys on bouquets, sweets attached to flowers are in fashion.  You can also use any beads, rhinestones, ribbons.  Decoration from artificial butterflies or dragonflies will not go unnoticed.  The most important thing is to maintain harmony and compatibility. </p><p>  Thirdly, a stand for your future composition.  A classic option would be a flower basket.  If you are a fan of originality and unsurpassed, then read below about the non-standard approach to choosing a stand. </p><h2>  The original basis of the composition </h2><p>  You are all used to seeing flowers in vases or baskets.  But when composing flower compositions, it is worth moving away from the patterns and becoming the original florist.  What prevents you from putting the finished bouquet in the shoe?  Already there is a note of personality, and your creation will not be forgotten.  For such ideas, you can use any containers and things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers in an envelope" class="if uuid-2577006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577006.jpg"></div><p>  For example, take any unnecessary kitchen utensils, decorate properly (to harmonize with the bouquet and interior) and use as the basis for the flowers. </p><p>  Another option would be to use unnecessary umbrellas.  Quite an extraordinary approach, but it looks impressive (and once again you do not have to throw garbage out).  The biggest difficulty is placing and securing the bouquet.  In the case of artificial or dried flowers, it will be easier: it is enough to securely fasten.  If you decide to use live plants, then you will have to pore first of all on fixing the tank with water.  Alternatively, use a package with a special gel for flowers. </p><p>  If it is not possible to buy a suitable container for a bouquet, you can take an ordinary glass jar (a bottle or even a beaker) and decorate it with available materials: wrap with twine, decorate with stained glass paints, and entwine with wire.  The main thing is to blend harmoniously with the bouquet. </p><p>  In general, any item where you can place or attach a bouquet can serve as an excellent basis for a composition of flowers: shoes, clothing items, chests, kitchen items, various containers of any materials (non-toxic), garden tools (watering cans), car parts, cases from televisions or other equipment, children's toys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="robomargo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition in the chest" class="if uuid-2577008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577008.jpg"></div><p>  Turn on the imagination, begin the general cleaning of the house and find a suitable frame. </p><h2>  Surprise everyone around you. </h2><p>  Not only the basis of the bouquet can be original and impressive.  With a proper approach to business, you are able to create a masterpiece from the flowers themselves.  It is enough to come up with an original form: make a smile, assemble in the form of a turtle or a hedgehog, a car, a steam locomotive or any other other composition with your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower turtle" class="if uuid-2577012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577012.jpg"></div><p>  From flowers and additional decorative elements (optionally add credibility) you can make a unique ‚Äúlively‚Äù and deliciously smelling object.  Your ingenuity and resourcefulness will help here. </p><h2>  Real country house in miniature </h2><p>  Many say that visualization helps in the realization of their desires.  So why not do this while constantly admiring the country house of your dreams?  Yes, <span>decorated with flowers?</span>  Such a composition becomes not only an element of decor, not only an original bouquet, but also an object for visualization.  How many useful and necessary things are combined in one. </p><p>  If you decide to make a similar site in miniature, then first you need to decide on some details: </p><ul><li>  what the house will be made of (glue yourself from cardboard or choose a fish lock in the pet store); </li><li>  what flowers will be used (artificial, dried or living); </li><li>  in the case of living plants, consider a humidification system. <div class="photo" data-original="www.tapinto.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house of flowers" class="if uuid-2577014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577014.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Collect all the elements of the future design, combine them into one and enjoy the hacienda of your dreams. </p><p>  A little tip: as a grass for the site, it is convenient to use real forest moss.  Care for it is minimal, but it looks very natural in such sketches. </p><h2>  Ikebans always stay in fashion? </h2><p>  Do not forget about this kind of intermediate option between natural and artificial flowers.  Compositions from dried plants have been around for a long time.  On the one hand, there are a number of positive aspects: minimal care, a long-lasting decoration for the interior (with proper care they can stand for years), absolutely natural natural material.  On the other hand, the disadvantages of such compositions are obvious: extremely fragile bouquets, the natural color is not so saturated, they collect dust well, their aroma is already missing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="davidpaluchdmlf.canalblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition of roses" class="if uuid-2577001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2577001.jpg"></div><p>  After weighing the pros and cons, you decide for yourself whether it is worth choosing such jewelry for making bouquets. </p><h2>  Make sense in your work </h2><p>  It's one thing when you make a composition of flowers for yourself, for personal enjoyment.  Then only your own tastes and wishes are taken into account.  And it‚Äôs a completely different thing when you perform such sketches for others.  For example, as a gift or for sale.  In such cases, it is necessary to take into account some subtleties and nuances when choosing suitable colors. </p><p>  Firstly, over many centuries, certain associations have developed with each of the colors that define this or that emotion.  So, the white color, a symbol of purity and innocence, bears the best wishes.  Red is associated with love, passion, strong emotions.  Pale pink is tenderness, and dark pink is gratitude.  Blue or blue flowers mean longing and loyalty.  Purple symbolize humility.  Violet is a sign of friendship.  Yellow is interpreted in two ways: betrayal, betrayal and separation, or joy, wealth and prosperity.  Orange flowers in a bouquet mean pride, coquetry. </p><p>  Secondly, the nationality of the recipient of your flower arrangement plays an important role.  Of the colors of all possible colors, it is worth highlighting a few, which in some countries will be considered inappropriate as a gift.  For example, for a resident of Latin America, a bouquet of red flowers can only be sent expressing sympathy or grief.  In this country, red is associated with death, blood.  At the same time, in Western European culture such a present means strong feelings, love.  When the countries of the New World see white flowers as a symbol of happiness, then in India it is the color of mourning.  Therefore, one must be extremely attentive to the cultures of other countries.  If you make the wrong choice, you may be misunderstood or even offended. </p><p>  Thirdly, take into account the color symbolism of various cultures and peoples.  Each of them can find its own meaning for a particular flower.  For example, a rose is a symbol of love and beauty, carnation is platonic love, and a cornflower is elegance.  Daffodils are associated with selfishness, calla lilies - with unsurpassed beauty, orchids - with sensuality.  Peonies stand for wealth, and ivy stands for fidelity, gerbera carries a secret, and azalea stands for devotion.  Lotus is a symbol of longevity and a happy life. </p><p>  All of the above nuances should be combined under one name - florist etiquette, or flower etiquette.  It allows you to correctly compose compositions of flowers for the interior, taking into account the characteristics of nations and the symbolism of flowers.  If you decide to engage in the compilation of bouquets yourself, then knowing such etiquette is the key to your continued success in a new kind of creativity. </p>
