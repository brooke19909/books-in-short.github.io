Exactly what style, color and other nuances are chosen independently.  The ability to sew is especially helpful when there is a little girl at home - a princess, for whom every mother wants to create the most beautiful and comfortable outfit.  Or sew a sundress for a girl, the very one who lives inside each mother.  After all, she also wants to be beautiful. </p><p>  To sew a sundress with your own hands means to acquire a universal summer thing, suitable for both an adult woman and a little girl.  In order to make the simplest option, you will need: </p><ul><li>  Lightweight, preferably natural fabric that conducts air well.  In this outfit, the body will be pleasant and fresh, which is very important in the summer heat.  In addition, all natural tissues are hypoallergenic, which is also very important. </li><li>  Fantasy, where without it, will help create an original outfit. </li><li>  Knowledge about building a pattern of a bodice, a skirt and other small nuances, such as darts. </li><li>  Threads, needles and other necessary accessories and materials. </li></ul><p>  If everything is clear with the first and last points, you just need to get it out and put it in front of you, then what about those in the middle? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Women's sundress" class="if uuid-2451693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2451693.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  In order to sew a sundress with your own hands, measurements and knowledge are simply vital.  The measurements are taken as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Chest circumference.  Only half of this value is used in the pattern. </li><li>  Waist circumference.  It is measured exactly where the waist will be in the product.  It can be overestimated, normal or underestimated. </li><li>  Skirt length. </li><li>  Hips, if it‚Äôs an idea about a sundress that has a silhouette similar to a sheath dress. </li></ul><p>  For those who are going to provide themselves or a child with things made with their own hands, it is best to make a base pattern.  It is made up by all the standards of the body and looks like a full-fledged pattern-base case. </p><h2>  Skirt </h2><p>  To sew a sarafan for a girl, or rather to cut a skirt for him, is the simplest thing that can be at all stages of work.  Of course, if the product does not have any complex parts that require the attention of a highly qualified specialist.  Skirts come in: </p><ul><li>  Sun skirt.  Very common and one of the simplest options.  Before directly cutting from the material, it is recommended to create a full-fledged drawing on paper in a 1: 1 scale. </li><li>  Wedge skirt.  Dimensions in the drawings are completely dependent on the planned number of wedges. </li><li>  One-piece two-seam. </li></ul><p>  Depending on the imagination, you can decorate the hem of the sundress in different ways, using embroidery, drapery and other decorations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prettyprudent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple sundress for the summer" class="if uuid-2451697" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2451697.jpg"></div><h2>  Folds and draperies </h2><p>  Such a part of the decor as folds is quite common.  With their help, you can create romantic and light outfits.  Ways to create draperies and creases vary in technique.  Not the simplest, but quite common among them technique of bow folds.  What is she like?  It is characterized by the onset folding of folds, which creates a rather large additional volume.  Sewing a sundress for a girl with such a design is not difficult and not as expensive as it seems at first glance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unusual sundress for a girl" class="if uuid-2451695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2451695.jpg"></div><h2>  Crease calculation </h2><p>  For a standard skirt with two side seams, you will need no more, no less than 3 hips, if the hem of a sundress for a girl starts under the breast, then you will need to calculate the amount of fabric, starting from this particular value.  Since the bow folds are large, it is advisable to use them on models with a skirt from the waist. </p><p>  The calculation of folds begins with their number.  It depends on it the volume and size.  In addition, it is necessary to consider allowances for seams, they are not included in the calculation length.  For convenience, it is recommended to draw an even horizontal line at a distance of about 1 cm from the top edge.  This allowance will be needed to connect the upper and lower parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itsalwaysautumn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The simplest dress for the girl" class="if uuid-2451686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/2451686.jpg"></div><p>  Folds are postponed starting from the right edge of the indentation to the seam, while you need to lay them only until the middle, and then repeat the whole procedure starting from the left edge.  So the product will look neater, and the folds will be more symmetrical.  The same thing must be repeated with the second part of the skirt. </p><p>  Sewing a simple dress is not tricky, it is much more interesting to try something new that will make a thing unique and memorable.  By changing small details, you can achieve different visual effects from the product.  For example, folds, flounces and ruffles - are full, but at the same time give the image of femininity.  A straight cut makes it stricter, but often emphasizes all the charms of a female and girlish figure in a much more favorable light than some tight-fitting models. </p><p>  When choosing, and even more so when sewing things, it is necessary to pay attention to both the general appearance of the product and the small details that can ruin everything or, conversely, make the look perfect.  A needle, thread, fabric and fantasy sometimes work wonders with appearance. </p>
