This island has its own culture, customs, which it would be better to know about in advance.  You should also clearly understand what currency in Cyprus, so that you can make purchases with minimal losses.  It should be noted right away that the island is divided into 2 parts - Greek (southern) and Turkish (northern).  And although tourists can move from one to another quite freely, life in one and the other is quite different. </p>

    <h2>  What money is better to take with you </h2><p>  Since 2008, the euro has been officially introduced in Cyprus as the main currency.  Therefore, going on a trip to this country, it is enough to have them with you in sufficient quantities.  As in any other civilized state, here in shops, restaurants and other places of mass visits plastic cards are accepted for payment.  They, in turn, can be opened in any currency, if it differs from the euro, then conversion will simply happen. </p><p>  Neither Russian rubles, nor <span>Ukrainian hryvnias,</span> nor other money of the countries of the former USSR here are accepted even at special points and banks, so there is no point in taking them with you.  American dollars and <span>British pounds</span> in the store and on the market are also unlikely to be taken for payment, but they will certainly be exchanged at banks, so if you have this money with you, the tourist will certainly not be lost.  In the north of the island, you can pay with Turkish lira. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What currency was in Cyprus before </h2><p>  Before joining the European Union, there were bills and coins.  <span>The currency of Cyprus</span> was a pound of 100 cents.  At the same time, many shops (especially in the northern part of the island) willingly accepted Turkish liras and euros.  Therefore, to the question: "What currency to pay in Cyprus?"  there was no single correct answer.  The one that was available. </p><h2>  Modern monetary policy of the island </h2><p>  Unfortunately, many tourists do not know exactly what currency is in Cyprus, and they think that pounds here are still the main <span>bargaining chip,</span> and therefore try to acquire them in advance in the required amount.  In fact, the population, of course, had both banknotes and coins, but now they can be used only as a souvenir.  In the territory occupied by the Turks (the northern part of the island), the lira is still in circulation.  Therefore, having it available, you can have dinner without any problems, pay for the purchase of souvenirs or products.  True, tourists usually visit the Greek part.  So the correct answer to the question: “What is the currency in Cyprus?”  - all the same, the euro.  Banknotes here are the same as in other states of the Commonwealth.  Exchange operations are best done at banks, rather than at hotels or other points.  Otherwise, you can significantly lose course. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  In addition to the usual tourist routes with sightseeing and relaxing on the beach, there are other, equally exciting entertainment.  One of them is shopping.  Before embarking on it, it is necessary to decide what is best to carry from this country, and what currency is in Cyprus.  2013, like the preceding years, was sunny and fruitful here.  Therefore, it is worth trying the local wine (especially sweet), which is famous for the island.  As souvenirs, laces, silver, gold and ceramics are often brought from here.  And Russian tourists even manage to arrange shopping tours with the aim of acquiring fur products.  Going on such a trip, you need to understand what currency in Cyprus (as mentioned earlier, this is the euro) and take with you a sufficient amount. </p><p>  Many people prefer to buy jewelry and fur coats here because of the sophistication of products, unique design and consistent quality. </p>
