For example, when making an appointment with a specialist online.  Not everyone knows where to see this kind of information.  And therefore, in the process of implementing the task, sometimes problems arise.  Fortunately, not everything is as scary as it seems.  Next, we will study the procedure for obtaining a policy, its purpose and types.  After that, you can search for the series and number of the relevant documentation. </p>

    <p>  The package of documents for the implementation of the task is not so big.  Adults need to bring: </p><ul><li>  statement indicating the type of policy; </li><li>  passport; </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  Children under 14 years of age additionally require a birth certificate and a document with a residence permit.  In addition, all actions are carried out through legal representatives.  And filling out an application including. </p><p>  To apply for a policy, foreign citizens need the previously listed papers + copies, a passport / birth certificate and a migration card.  Nothing incomprehensible. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  To see the number of the medical insurance policy, you must first obtain this document.  We decided on a package of papers.  What's next? </p><p>  Now it is recommended to proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Choose an insurance company. </li><li>  Submit a request for a policy. </li><li>  Get a temporary health insurance document. </li><li>  Pick up the policy at the appointed time. </li></ol><p>  Typically, the papermaking time is only 1 month.  Until this time, the citizen is invited to use the temporary form of the document.  But, as practice shows, this is usually not necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Document types </h2><p>  Where is the medical policy number?  The answer directly depends on the type of paper being studied.  What forms of a document can be encountered in real life? </p><p>  The following scenarios are known today: </p><ul><li>  old-age medical insurance policy; </li><li>  temporary document; </li><li>  VHI policy; </li><li>  new sample of compulsory medical insurance; </li><li>  plastic card policy; </li><li>  UEC. </li></ul><p>  The number of the medical policy can be seen directly on this or that paper.  This is a normal occurrence.  But where exactly to look?  Below we consider all the possible layouts. </p><h2>  Universal cards </h2><p>  Until 2017, the so-called universal cards were introduced and operated in Russia.  This is plastic, which replaced a number of documents.  For example, a policy, SNILS and passport. </p>

    <p>  The number of the medical insurance policy was not available in this case.  There was only a card identifier.  It is located on the front of the universal card.  This is the only combination of numbers on the document.  Since 2017, the mandatory UEC was canceled. </p><h2>  Voluntary insurance </h2><p>  How to find out the number of a voluntary insurance medical policy?  You just need to look at the document in the established form. </p><p>  Typically, the studied paper looks like a regular certificate, printed on a sheet of A4 form.  On the front of it there is a row of numbers.  This is the number.  A series is also available here.  First it is written (2 digits), then - the number.  There is nothing supernatural in this.  The studied components are located, as a rule, in the upper right corner of the sheet. </p><h2>  Old policy </h2><p>  The medical policy number can also be found on the old sample document.  There are several forms. </p><p>  The first old policy is a small booklet with one spread.  In a similar paper, all data is located inside.  The search for a series and a medical policy number does not cause any problems. </p><p>  And there is an old-style policy in 2012.  This is a leaf of blue color.  It is placed in a special envelope.  Has no turns.  All information is written on the front of the document. </p><p>  The policy number in this case is at the bottom of the paper.  This is a combination of 16 components, where the series consists of 6 digits, and the remaining 10 are the number.  What else can be found in practice? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="series and number of medical policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2211714.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Paper document </h2><p>  For example, there is a regular policy of compulsory medical insurance.  This paper looks the same as the 2012 sample.  The difference is only in the location of the data on the form of the established form. </p><p>  The policy number under such circumstances is written on the top of the paper.  It is usually signed as a "personal number."  Or this combination is not marked at all. </p><p>  It still consists of 16 digits.  If necessary, the series are the first 6 components of the combination.  But it is generally accepted that new policies have only a number.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><h2>  Temporary form </h2><p>  As we already said, citizens sometimes have to use temporary policies.  This form of paper also has a number.  And a series.  The main thing is to know where to look at the relevant data. </p><p>  The number row is located in the upper right corner of the policy page.  The document itself is a small sheet on which information about the insured person is written. </p><p>  On a temporary policy you can find a series of 9 digits.  The first 3 are a series, the remaining are a number.  Now it‚Äôs clear where to look for the requested information.  From now on, everyone will be able to make an appointment with the doctor via the Internet using the temporary form of the paper being studied. </p><h2>  A plastic card </h2><p>  The last sample of the policy is a completely new look.  The latest help forms look like plastic cards.  They are somewhat reminiscent of bank plastic. </p><p>  The number of the medical policy in this case is also not so difficult to find out.  But with the series problems are not excluded.  Especially if you do not take into account some information. </p><p>  The fact is that the number of the medical insurance policy is written on the front of the document, at the very bottom.  This is the only combination on plastic.  As in past situations, it consists of 16 components.  Accordingly, the first 6 digits can be considered a series. </p>
