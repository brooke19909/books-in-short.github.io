    <h2>  More Attractions </h2><p>  Excursions to Vyborg leave an amazing experience.  At the junction of the 15th and 16th centuries a fortress was built here.  Subsequently, it was called the Horn.  The impressive architectural ensembles of past centuries have survived to this day.  Now you can see the towers of the Town Hall and the Round, as well as a bastion called Panzerkaks.  Guides talk about the history of their creation, the circumstances that caused the construction of a building.  When Empress Anna Ioannovna ruled here, the Annens fortifications were erected. </p><p>  Thanks to them, Vyborg became an even safer place.  A self-guided tour here is a way to slowly walk through the historical center and admire the skilful architectural ensembles built over many centuries.  Some of them belong to the Swedish era (up to the 18th century).  These include the following houses: located on a rock belonging to the merchant Vekrut, episcopal, the church of St. Hyacinth and others. </p>

    <h2>  City development </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century  this defense point passed into the possession of the Russian Empire.  It was at this moment that the authorities began the construction of several cathedrals, a gostiny dvor, a town hall and other important sights, which tourists today enjoy, taking tours of Vyborg on their own or as part of a group led by a guide. </p><p>  In 1893, the New Cathedral was erected, which is of central importance in the religious life of the city.  It belongs to the neo-Gothic style.  This is a rather large and beautiful building.  During the Finnish period, many wonderful architectural ensembles were also created here.  One of them is the library built in 1935, named after Alvar Aalto.  People from all over the world are striving to personally experience this masterpiece of architecture. </p><h2>  Monrepos Park </h2><p>  Quite saturated, full of interesting information and vivid images are tours of Vyborg.  A sightseeing walk, as a rule, is not complete without a visit to the famous Monrepos Park, created at the junction of the 18th and 19th centuries.  Its area is 170 hectares.  Translated from French, the name means "my rest."  The owners of the estate really liked to spend their free time here.  Coming here is equally good at any time of the year.  There is a manor built of wood.  Guides often focus the attention of city guests on the Library wing, executed in the style of classicism. </p><p>  The procession along the paths of this place, which is a work of landscape gardening art, gives incomparable pleasure.  In the period from 1788 to 1943, the owners of the estate were Barons Nikolai.  Excursions to Vyborg in most cases include a walk in these places, because here you can see such interesting sights as Ludwigstein - an island that plays the role of a necropolis. </p>
