And a miracle happened on the shore of Lake Kleban.  This was the beginning of the birth of the Kazan Khanate. </p><h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  This is just one of many beautiful legends that surround the foundation of Kazan.  There are versions about the skull of a pious Muslim, from whom a miraculous spring beats, and about the terrible fire-breathing dragon, which has always been depicted on the coat of arms for many centuries, and many other interesting stories. </p><p>  Unfortunately, no one can name the exact year of foundation of Kazan.  The first mention of it in the Russian annals dates from 1376 and 1391, and in eastern sources - the 15th century.  Geographer Rachkov suggested that Kazan was founded after the death of Batu in 1255. </p><p>  But official is considered a completely different time when the foundation of Kazan took place.  The date of 1005 is based on the results of archaeological excavations in the Kazan Kremlin. </p><p>  For a long time, erected as a border fortress of the Volga Bulgaria, Kazan was part of the Golden Horde.  This was a period of its economic growth.  Due to the geographical location and the development of many types of crafts, trade and economic ties were established with Turkey, Crimea, Moscow, etc. </p><h2>  New era </h2><p>  Then there was a period of rather difficult relations with Moscow.  And despite the fact that diplomatic relations were maintained between the cities, war could not be avoided. </p>

    <p>  In 1552, the troops of Ivan the Terrible took Kazan.  Numerous human losses in the August battle, and then the siege that lasted more than a month, left Kazan no chance.  It was the hardest year in the history of the city.  The foundations of Kazan, its lifestyle were completely revised, and after the fall of the city in October 1552, a new era of development of the city as part of the Russian state began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The local population was outside the city, and the place of their settlement began to be called the Old Tatar settlement.  Kazan itself was actively begun to be settled by immigrants from Russian cities.  In 1556, by order of Ivan the Terrible, the construction of the Kazan Kremlin began.  The city was built up and developed economically.  Many craft settlements appeared, bridges were built, the first manufactories were created. </p><p>  During the reign of Peter the Great, Kazan received the status of the capital of the Kazan province.  And the opening of the permanent theater and <span>Kazan University</span> (1791 and 1804) secured the city the title of cultural and scientific center. </p><p>  But there were tragic events in Kazan.  The fire during the Pugachev uprising and subsequent fires in 1815 and 1842 thrice burned the city almost to the ground. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Today, Kazan is deservedly considered the <span>third capital of Russia.</span>  This unique multinational city combines a variety of cultures and religions. </p><p>  Despite such a long year of foundation, Kazan failed to preserve truly historical monuments. </p>
