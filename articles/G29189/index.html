The city center is only 1 km away, so the entire infrastructure of this large tourist center is within walking distance of the hotel.  The distance to the nearest resorts to Balchik is relatively small: to Golden Sands - 20 km, to Albena - 9 km, to Varna - 36 km.  The nearest airport is in the vicinity of Varna, 46 km from the hotel complex under consideration.  Thus, after arriving at the air harbor, your journey to Naslad will take less than an hour.  On the way, you can admire the natural beauties of this region of Bulgaria.  Since the vast majority of tourists go to the Black Sea coast mainly for beach holidays, the issue of remoteness of the coastline plays a big role in choosing a hotel.  As for the hotel complex under consideration, it does not have its own beach.  The nearest beach is municipal and is 600 meters away.  At the same time, the road to the sea runs through the picturesque Botanical Garden.

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  In the hotel complex under consideration, the rules clearly establish the time of check-in and check-out of guests.  So, the resettlement of arriving tourists is carried out after two in the afternoon.  However, this rule cannot be called too strict.  The hotel administration is always trying to make the rest of its guests as convenient as possible from the first minutes after their arrival at "Naslad".  If you arrived at the hotel earlier than 14:00, then the staff will do everything possible to check you in the room of the selected category as early as possible.  However, this is not always possible at the peak of the holiday season, when the hotel is 100% full.  In this case, you can leave things in the luggage room and go for lunch, to the pool or for a walk.  As for the day of departure from Naslada 3 * (Bulgaria), it is necessary to vacate the occupied room before noon.  At the same time, you should pay at the reception during your stay (if you have not fully paid for the tour to your tour operator).  Please note that the hotel only accepts cash payments.  If you plan to pay with a plastic card, then you should first ask the hotel administration if this is possible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation for guests with children </h2>
