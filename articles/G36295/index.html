Of course, this does not negate the basic tools of marketing and branding, but a little-known brand can win in an empty niche.  The main thing is to correctly determine consumer requests.  That is exactly what the Indian brand Mikromax did in 2008.  Reviews about the brand‚Äôs products, of course, are very diverse and not always favorable to the creators, but the low price covers most of the shortcomings. </p><h2>  General information about the Micromax models </h2>

    <p>  The company is committed to offering the latest and most attractive mobile market technologies that can only be introduced into the budget segment.  It is the focus on low-cost smartphones, which are distinguished by functionality, that allowed the brand in just a few years to become one of the leaders in the class of entry-level models.  What is a Mikromax mobile phone today?  Reviews emphasize fairly tolerant quality when compared with most Chinese low-cost devices. </p><p>  Along with this, the latest lines already hint at good performance and the makings of high-grade mid-range smartphones.  For example, a 1.4 GHz processor and a 13-megapixel camera appeared in the latest Canvas series.  Until recently, it was impossible to imagine such abilities in the filling of the budget model.  Today, the Mikromax phone is endowed with such potential, reviews of which emphasize the build quality.  It must be said that reliability and ergonomics have always prevented representatives of lower-level phones from becoming market leaders.  The Indian brand is no exception, but so far it has managed to strike a balance between price and overall quality.  And now it‚Äôs worth to take a closer look at the most significant brand models. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  X1800 Reviews </h2>

    <p>  We can say that this is the youngest model in the company's lineup.  The cost of the device is only 800 rubles.  To a certain extent, this is a unique offer on the domestic market, since options with such a price tag and two SIM cards are extremely rare.  Moreover, users note the functionality that this Mikromax device has.  Reviews, in particular, praise the good work of the MP3 player, note the very fact of having a camera, a slot with a memory card and Bluetooth.  It‚Äôs hardly worth talking about the shortcomings of a phone with such a price tag and filling, but the owners still note a small screen resolution and a modest battery of 750 mAh.  One way or another, models with such data are almost impossible to find not only in the lines of Philips and Nokia manufacturers, but also Fly. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model S302 </h2>

If we talk about the advantages of the device, users highlight the thoughtful design and ergonomics of the case, a processor of rather high power and versatility, which this Micromax phone provides during operation.  Reviews also emphasize the presence of two cameras and the same number of SIM cards.  However, the quality of the pictures is at the level of smartphones that were popular about 5 years ago.  Again, for the level of a simple budget employee, 2 megapixels is not bad, but the consumer is actively raising the bar of requests, and very soon even 5-megapixel modules will be considered obsolete. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model Bolt D320 </h2>

    <p>  This smartphone is available on the market for 4000 rubles.  Its owner gets at the disposal of Android 4.4, the ability to use two SIM cards, a good 3.2 megapixel camera, as well as communication support in the form of Wi-Fi, GPS, 3G and Bluetooth.  The owners, for their part, note the good build, the ability of the phone to catch signals in any conditions, and the nice design, which is also rare for low-end models.  At the same time, there are many disadvantages that are found in this model.  So, ‚ÄúMikromax‚Äù is a smartphone, reviews of which are often criticized by an insensitive touch screen, strong heating in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera‚Äôs location, weak battery and image quality.  Actually, this is a traditional set of claims to budget models, but in this smartphone many of the shortcomings are compensated by the wide communication capabilities and stable signal reception. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model A093 </h2>

    <p>  This model is also represented by a dual-SIM version with 4 GB of memory, Android KitKat OS, a quad-core processor and a 5 megapixel camera.  First of all, owners praise the truly powerful speakers that provide detailed and clear sound.  Today, devices specialized in musical functions are rare.  But the Micromax A093 is one of those, reviews of which emphasize the effect of the front stereo speakers amplifier.  In addition to this, an elegant design is noted, formed by a fringing with different shades, including silver and gold.  Users also praise the responsiveness of the interface - the menu works clearly and quickly, and if necessary, you can connect and voice search.  Thanks to the processor on 4 cores, you can confidently run applications with games without delays or delays.  If we talk about the features compared to other budget devices, the A093 stands out with a bright screen with a good matrix, mechanical glass, resistant to mechanical stress and a wide range of equipment, which includes headphones. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model A69 </h2><p>  This is one of the most successful models in the line of the Indian company.  Firstly, it is inexpensive - an average of 2800-3000 rubles.  Secondly, its wide functionality is provided with a productive filling in the form of a combination of Android 4.2 OS and a dual-core processor.  Many owners note the speed and responsiveness of the Micromax A69.  Reviews on the organization of the menu should be highlighted separately.  Ergonomics in this part used to be typical for Nokia models, but the Indian brand also decided to focus on convenience when working with functions. </p><p>  But the rest of the characteristics are more likely to cause positive emotions among users.  Cons can be attributed only to a battery with a small capacity.  However, only those who actively use the Mikromax A69 phone will feel this defect.  Reviews regarding the screen are also not without criticism, but for a smartphone in this segment it provides acceptable image quality. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on the model A79 </h2><p>  The device can be considered as a representative of the average level in the brand line.  The model is equipped with a standard set of functions and capabilities, including support for two SIM cards, Bluetooth, 3G, etc. Among the advantages, users highlight the presence of a radio, the quick operation of menus and applications, as well as the ergonomic advantages of the case.  The rest is a typical "Mikromax", reviews of which do not note any special flaws, making a discount on the cost of 2500 rubles.  It is clear that, by acquiring such a phone, one should prepare for the weak operation of the battery and the low quality of the camera‚Äôs pictures.  If we compare the model with competitors, then these flaws will fade in most cases against the background of more significant disadvantages of third-party analogues. </p><h2>  Reviews about the model E313 </h2><p>  This representative of the Canvas Xpress 2 series can be considered as the flagship model of the Indian brand.  The device is available for a small amount of 9000 rubles.  It would seem that for a budget phone this is a lot, but the characteristics of the device suggest otherwise.  It is enough to note the 5-inch diagonal of the touch screen, high-quality IPS matrix, <span>Gorilla Glass</span> protective coating and the main camera of 13 megapixels, not to mention the second 2-megapixel Mikromax module.  Owner reviews praise almost every characteristic of the model - both in terms of display and in terms of camera operation with the processor, the opinions are positive.  As for the disadvantages of the E313, they relate to minor operational issues.  For example, the low capacity of the battery is again noted, although in this case it is obvious that the requirements of the device have increased significantly.  There are also claims to a small amount of memory - 8 GB for a smartphone with such capabilities is still not enough. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The company confidently maintains its position in the class of budget smartphones, simultaneously participating in neighboring segments.  In particular, the 13-megapixel Mikromax is a smartphone, reviews of which not only praise its low price and functionality, but also compare it with representatives of higher categories.  This means that products are developing at an active pace.  Moreover, progress is observed in all parameters - this applies not only to performance, camera and display, but also to the appearance with ergonomics.  The stylistic qualities, ease of use are improved, and with it the reliability of the devices is increased. </p>
