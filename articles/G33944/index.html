Who doesn‚Äôt want to get good money without much risk?  However, the right to such an order is granted only to bidders or auctions, participation in which involves the contribution of 0.5-5% of the maximum initial cost of the lot, while it is mandatory in cash, in accordance with applicable law. </p><p>  Naturally, it is practically impossible to provide small and medium-sized companies with the possibility of withdrawing a significant amount from the turnover for a period of up to 3 months: this brought huge losses to the business.  That is why banks and credit organizations have developed a special product - <noindex>  <span>tender loan to secure the application</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  <strong>What problems can this form of loan solve?</strong> </p><ol><li>  Money does not go out of circulation; the company operates as usual. </li><li>  If there is a need to participate in several tenders at once, lending will help to provide security in each case. </li><li>  To obtain a tender loan, a surety or collateral is not needed.  The package of documents is small, enough financial statements for the period indicated in the financial organization, property documents, a completed questionnaire and tender data.  This helps speed up the design process. </li><li>  Even if for some reason you have to delay the funds for a week or two, you can agree on a small (albeit paid) deferment. </li></ol><p>  <strong>Difficulties in using a tender loan</strong> </p><p>  But can this form of lending be considered an unambiguous solution to problems?  Do not forget that it takes from 1 to 3 weeks to get a loan.  During this time, you can skip the start of the competition. </p><p>  Another significant aspect that needs to be addressed is the interest rates for this type of loan.  The average official rate in Russia is 20%.  In fact, you will find out the rate only when announcing the required amount of credit funds and the exact period for which you need them.  In other words, get ready for more significant interest that you have to pay. </p><p>  If for some reason the competition is delayed for several days, you will have to pay additional interest, usually serious.  At a minimum, this issue should be stipulated in the contract immediately upon execution of the document in order to know exactly what you are doing in a non-standard situation. </p><p>  Participation in competitions helps to achieve a certain status, creates advertising for the company, enriches the customer base and brings good income.  However, it is worth carefully weighing your actions in each case, taking into account all the circumstances.  Receiving a tender loan to secure the application, the client receives a number of obligations that must be met accurately and on time. </p></div></article>
