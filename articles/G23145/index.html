Vacationers can visit the Internet cafe, cinema, karaoke, take part in entertainment programs.  Animators offer guests to play darts, futsal, billiards, volleyball, table tennis, archery, visit the tennis court, gym. </p><p>  For children there is a pool and a playground. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Limassol is the most fun and popular resort in Cyprus.  It is good because it is located approximately in the middle between all the most interesting places on the island.  Therefore, those who love to travel will appreciate the convenience of the location of the city.  And the name Limassol itself is translated as ‚ÄúMiddle City‚Äù. </p><p>  Spa life here does not freeze even in winter.  Night clubs, cafes and restaurants are open all year round, inviting tourists to taste the beautiful Cypriot wine.  However, you should not think that Limassol is a place of youth parties, couples with children have a great rest here.  Absolutely all categories of tourists find <span>interesting activities</span> for themselves <span>.</span>  For young vacationers there are three water parks, a <span>zoo, an amusement park.</span>  Respectable vacationers do not part with their laptops, even on beaches and in bars.  In addition, I would like to note that Limassol is the most Russian resort in all of Cyprus. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Limassol does not have its own airport.  The two closest are in Larnaca and Paphos (both at approximately seventy kilometers).  To get to the hotel, you can use a taxi, bus.  Public transport takes no more than 45 minutes.  In addition, minibuses run between cities.  It is quite convenient to get to Limassol by water.  For example, ferries from cities such as Beirut, Ashdod, Haifa, Crete, Beirut, Rhodes go here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="atlantica gardens 3 cyprus limassol reviews" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1553437.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For those who plan to travel to the cities of the island, the most convenient means of transport are buses that regularly fly.  You can also move around the city by taxi and public transport. </p><p>  Around Limassol there are many beautiful wild beaches, but they do not go to transport at all.  Therefore, your car here will be very helpful.  The cost of renting a car is very affordable, so even people who prefer an economical vacation can afford it.  To take a car in Cyprus, it is enough to have a driver‚Äôs license and driving experience (age - more than 21 years). </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Limassol are incredibly good.  They have gentle descents to the sea and well-developed infrastructure.  Most of the coast is sandy, but there are also sand and pebble areas.  However, sand in this area is far from ordinary.  It has a volcanic origin, and therefore contains flint, which has a beneficial effect on metabolic processes in the skin.  The central beach of Ladies Mile is considered one of the best.  It is equipped with everything you need for a good holiday.  But the coastline here is quite narrow.  On the beaches of Limassol, tourists are offered all kinds of sea sports and entertainment.  The resort is incredibly popular, and therefore always crowded with vacationers. </p><h2>  Atlantica Gardens 3 * (Cyprus, Limassol): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I definitely want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who recently rested in it.  Hotel Atlantic (Cyprus) has an excellent location, across the road from the sea.  The complex has beautiful rooms.  Almost all of them have been recently renovated, but even those that have not yet had time to update have a beautiful view.  It should be noted that all apartments are very spacious and have extensive furnished terraces or balconies overlooking the sea coast.  The rooms have excellent quality furniture, all plumbing serviceable.  The beds are very comfortable with lovely comfortable mattresses.  The apartments have kitchenettes with all necessary equipment.  Therefore, those who wish can cook for themselves or their children.  There are practically no dishes in the room, if you need it, then it can be ordered at the reception.  There are no problems in this matter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel atlantica gardens 3 cyprus limassol" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1553439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is very important that the apartments are very quiet, absolutely no audible sounds from neighboring rooms.  At night, you can sleep with open balcony doors in the fresh air, no street noises.  This is apparently due to the fact that all entertainment events are held in the neighboring Oasis hotel, which is convenient.  Going to him is not at all difficult, but the hotel always has peace and nothing interferes with the guests' relaxation.  As for cleaning, not all tourists are satisfied, apparently, it all depends on the maids.  Overall the rooms are clean and tidy.  Towels are changed regularly.  The linen is not old, in excellent condition. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food is the main issue that interests tourists going on vacation, which is a natural moment, since everyone wants to have a good time, and not waste time preparing food.  In the hotel "Atlantic" (Miramare, Limassol) it is possible to take half board or All Inclusive.  Experienced tourists advise "all inclusive", because then vacationers have a number of advantages. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel is ordinary (continental).  In the morning, omelets, eggs, coffee, tea, yogurts, salads, slices and much more are served.  And for children different varieties of cereal, oatmeal with milk, sausages, crepes and fruits are offered.  On the children's table often appears french fries, nuggets, fish fingers, which is not very clear.  In our understanding, such food is extremely harmful for babies.  In general, meals take place on the territory of the neighboring Oasis Hotel.  Vacationers remain incredibly quite in quantity and quality of food, as well as its variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cyprus limassol hotel atlantica gardens apts 3" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1553442.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For lunch and dinner, fish, pork, beef, baked ham, lots of greens, salads, snacks, vegetables and cheeses (even Dor Blue) are served daily.  On the tables there are certainly seasonal incredibly tasty fruits: oranges, bananas, dates, raisins, grapefruits, melons, watermelons, prunes.  There is always a lot of food, and therefore no queues arise.  Pancakes are prepared in the evenings, and you can choose from a wide variety of toppings: honey, all desserts and ice cream are incredibly tasty. </p><p>  Juices can be taken in vending machines, there are no freshly squeezed fresh juices.  All drinks from the restaurant can be taken away.  For this, there are even special plastic cups with lids.  I would like to pay special attention to the service in the restaurant.  Each time visitors are seated by an administrator who is looking for a table for you.  It is very convenient, there is no need to wander around the hall in search of free space.  For dinner, it is supposed to come in the appropriate form, and not in shorts and slippers.  For those who use All Inclusive, the waiter serves a bottle of wine on the table, after which you can choose your own food for dinner.  The atmosphere of betting is very pleasant and solemn.  In addition, during the day in the bars all drinks on the all-inclusive system are completely free, you have the right to take champagne and fine Cypriot wines. </p><p>  All guest reviews regarding food are only positive, which speaks for itself. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  If you plan to visit Cyprus-Limassol, Atlantica Gardens Apts 3 * hotel can be a great place to relax.  The complex can be attributed to budget hotels with excellent food and excellent service.  According to tourists, the hotel deserves attention.  It is very comfortable to relax here.  An important factor is the fact that guests with All Inclusive can attend all the events and facilities of the neighboring Oasis complex.  Rest here turns into a real holiday full of entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="limassol atlantic garden" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1553444.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beaches of Limassol resort deserve special attention.  "Atlantic Garden" is located on the coast itself, to get to the beach (municipal), you only need to cross the road.  Vacationers choose the most different sections of the coast for recreation, everyone looks after the most convenient and beautiful bays.  In general, the entire coast is the same and belongs to the local municipality.  Almost all beaches are equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas (renting a kit costs 1 EUR), however, you can always stay for free on your own towels. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Atlantic Garden is an excellent hotel for all categories of vacationers. It will be incredibly comfortable for couples with kids, senior citizens and youth.  The budget complex with excellent food and good rooms fully complies with the ratio of "price-quality". <strong> </strong></p>
