    <p>  The freshness of the sea and the beauty of the mountains attract thousands of tourists of all ages to the fabulous city of Obzor.  Bulgaria generously bestows hospitality and goodwill on every vacationer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The ancient town of Obzor has existed for more than three thousand years.  Initially, it was settled by the Thracians.  During the reign of the wise Greeks, he received the name Navlochos, and was subsequently renamed the city of the Sun - Heliopolis.  When the Romans came to Obzor, the construction of the temple of Jupiter begins.  From this moment the city bears the name Theopolis - the city of God.  And today, the townspeople, as well as visitors, can observe the remains of this magnificent structure. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, the Bulgarian military fortress Koziak was built in the city.  After the utter destruction by the Ottoman forces, the village of Gezeken appeared on its territory.  And only in 1935 the city received its current name Obzor.  Bulgaria from that moment opened up new prospects for its development. </p><h2>  Climatic and weather conditions </h2>
