  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zhukovsky city: attractions, entertainment, excursions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For aviation enthusiasts, there is a unique city in the suburbs of Moscow called Zhukovsky (25 kilometers to the capital).  It is in this city that the ISS air show is held every odd year.  On the show you can see firsthand the legendary domestic aircraft: ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù and ‚ÄúVityaz‚Äù, others. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Back in 1933, the construction of the Aerohydrodynamic Institute began in the city.  At the end of the work, the institute expanded rapidly, specialists came here, for whom they began to build housing.  Thus, by 1940, the village of Stakhanovo appeared.  But a few years later the village turned into a small city, and it was renamed Zhukovsky in honor of the Soviet founder of aerodynamics - N. Zhukovsky. The monument to the scientist was unveiled in 1969 and is located on Mayakovsky Street, 26. </p><p>  Today the city is a real scientific center of aviation in Russia. </p><h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  The ecological situation in the city is quite prosperous, there are beautiful forests in the district.  The settlement itself is also green.  The biggest negative in the environmental situation is the proximity to the Zhukovsky airport Ramenskoye itself. </p><p>  The total population is 108 thousand people.  A significant part of the population is engaged in aircraft construction and in local research institutes.  There are many higher and professional educational institutions, naturally associated with aviation. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  Zhukovsky is a green city where you can easily breathe and really want to do science.  In the center of the village there is a recreation park, beyond which is located the Tsagovsky Forest - a green zone with deciduous and coniferous trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not far from Zhukovsky is <span>Kratovskoe Lake</span> and the Moscow River.  In the city itself there are several resorts. </p><p>  The city has a Vorontsov park, in which the remains of a magnificent manor of the same name have been preserved.  And in the neighboring village of Bykovo, the old Vladimir Church is preserved, which is famous for its Gothic style, which is not characteristic of Russian architecture. </p><p>  The city has a standard set for entertainment - clubs, cinemas, bowling and others.  And if you have time, you can go to the performance of the Strela Theater (3 Kirova Street).  The repertoire includes performances for both children and adults.  And the theater itself is housed in an old mansion, where Tchaikovsky himself and von Mecca (philanthropist) visited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.transparentworld.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsagovsky forest" class="if uuid-2569640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569640.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine an aviation city without a thematic exposition, and first of all, it is the Zhukovsky <span>Museum of Aviation</span> and Sky Conquest.  The collection of exhibits and facts began in 1969, but for visitors the doors opened only after 10 years.  Here you can find out how the national aviation industry and the city itself have been developing since the 17th century.  The most valuable photographs and documents are presented in the form of an interactive show. </p><p>  The second hall is no less interesting, there are collected copies of uniforms for pilots.  You can also learn Morse code and find out how the parachute works.  In the third hall, interchangeable expositions are presented.  The museum is located on 41 Chkalova Street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the street Zhukovsky, 1 is another museum - TsAGI.  It has been working since 1964, and the most interesting thing in it is a large collection of aircraft models of different periods.  Here you can see the current model of some installations, for example, the T-101 wind tunnel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeout.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhukovsky Museum of Aviation and Sky Conquest" class="if uuid-2569643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569643.jpg"></div><h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  At the corner of Mendeleev and Gagarin streets, the MiG-21 stela was installed.  This is a famous aircraft fighter.  During its design and construction, it was in Zhukovsky that its tests were carried out. </p><p>  The city has an interesting tradition among students.  At the end of the session, a rotating propeller is installed on the aircraft in honor of such a significant date for students.  The propeller has been on the stele for several days.  Also, anyone has the opportunity to get on a plane, climb inside and inspect the structure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stele &quot;MiG-21&quot;" class="if uuid-2569649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569649.jpg"></div><h2>  Toy railway </h2><p>  In the suburbs of Zhukovsky there is an interesting place - the Small Moscow Railway.  The line consists of only two stations: "Youth", "Children's", but on demand there are two more.  Interestingly, the road itself runs along the border between the village of Krotovo and the city. </p><p>  On the basis of the railway there is a training club for students from 11 to 17 years old.  People from 25 schools of the capital come here to study.  Students of the University of Railways (Moscow) also practice here. </p><p>  Schedule of the children's railway: from 10:00 in the morning, from Thursday to Sunday, from late May to August (last Sunday). </p><p>  An interesting fact: in 1938, shots from the film "Girl with Character" were shot on the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zhukovsky.life" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toy railway" class="if uuid-2569653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569653.jpg"></div><h2>  Airfield Ramenskoye </h2><p>  This is another attraction of Zhukovsky.  This is a universal airfield capable of accepting almost all types of aircraft.  7 Russian airlines are based here. </p><p>  On the basis of the airfield, tests of newly constructed aircraft are being conducted.  Ramenskoye also accepts international cargo. </p><p>  During the Second World War, there was a base of bombers and assault vehicles.  And during the construction of the Buran spacecraft, parts of the space shuttle to Baikonur were sent from here. </p><p>  Today at <span>the Ramenskoye airfield</span> , an air show is held.  Once every two years, spectators come to the city to see how new flying aircraft models demonstrate their skills and show their skills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.infox.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airfield Ramenskoye" class="if uuid-2569655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569655.jpg"></div><h2>  Holy places </h2><p>  There is an interesting attraction in Zhukovsky - the Church of the Transfiguration.  This is a new building, erected in 2003.  It is designed for 1 thousand parishioners. </p><p>  The church is a six-pillar structure with five domes.  The main shrine of the temple is an icon depicting local new martyrs.  The church is located on the street Gagarina, 77a. </p><p>  Judges of church architecture should go to Udelnaya stanitsa (Internatsionalnaya street, 12) to look at the wooden church of the Trinity Life-Giving.  The temple was built in 1897, but the most important thing is the wooden church, and they built it in just 4 months. </p><p>  In shape, the church was erected in the shape of a cross, has beautiful domes and gilded crosses.  Another feature of the church is its iconostasis made in the best Byzantine traditions and made of oak.  On the walls of the temple there are beautiful icons painted on a gold background.  And the most unique is the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, painted on stone. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.59749119999999" data-lng="38.11325620000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/6/7/4767.png"></div><h2>  Manor in Bykovo </h2><p>  Another attraction of Zhukovsky, because of which they come here.  The estate was erected back in the 17th century, and the initiator of the construction was the favorite of Catherine the Second - Izmailov, whom the queen granted Bykovo for participating in the plot.  Later, the estate became the property of the Vorontsov-Dashkov family, and the most recent owners were Ilyins. </p><p>  This is a two-story building with exterior decoration with light stone.  There are also several ponds and a bell tower, which was built in the XIX century.  Previously, the Hermitage was located on the estate, but today it is completely lost.  The park itself is represented by many winding paths and secluded places to relax. </p><p>  Here, in the village of Bykovo, you can look into the church of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God.  Built it in the XVIII century.  This is a prime example of a pseudo-Gothic style.  Under Soviet rule, the church was completely looted and closed; even church books were burned.  Then a sewing factory and warehouses were placed in the temple.  Only in the 80s of the last century the temple returned to believers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God" class="if uuid-2569658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2569658.jpg"></div><p>  The city of Zhukovsky is a beautiful and neat city where you can come along with an excursion or on your own, take a walk in the parks and see the sights, learn a lot of interesting things about aviation. </p>
