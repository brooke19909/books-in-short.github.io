It is also called the Third Civilization.  Its beginning is considered to be 1045 BC, the sunset falls on 249 BC  This is an important era that has played a significant role in history.  The founder of the dynasty was Wen-wang. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.followcn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zhou dynasty culture" class="if uuid-2869072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2869072.jpg"></div><h2>  Prerequisites for the formation of Zhou civilization </h2><p>  Tribes of Zhou in the XII century BC  lived in Southeast and East Asia in the Yellow River basin.  They were engaged in cattle breeding and agriculture.  According to the history of China, the ruling Shang dynasty, as a result of the weakening, was defeated by the Zhou tribes that occupied its territory, on which an early feudal state was formed. </p><p>  The founder of the Zhou Dynasty in China is considered to be Wen-wang, who reformed the system of tribal relations, creating a powerful principality on the border of the Shan State.  This was facilitated by the transformation of a large part of the Zhou tribes from nomadic herders into sedentary farmers, which lasted for several previous generations.  They received high yields using irrigation irrigation systems. </p><h2>  State formation </h2><p>  The successor of his father‚Äôs work and the first king of Zhou is Wu-wan, who is building a state in the likeness of Shansky.  He moved the capital to the city of Hao, located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Xi'an.  In the territories conquered from the Shang dynasty, the new rulers built a social structure, which historians call Chou feudalism.  The gradual conquest of territories and an increase in population led to a complication of the social and administrative structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhou Dynasty and its contribution to Chinese culture" class="if uuid-2857739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857739.jpg"></div><h2>  Zhou Dynasty Periods in Ancient China </h2><p>  Depending on the military and political influence, the Zhou era is divided into two periods, which are commonly called: </p><p>  1. <em>Western Zhou.</em>  It is from this period that the formation of a new powerful state begins.  Takes the period from 1045 to 770 BC  This is the heyday of the era, the time of ownership of the territories in the basin of the middle Huanghe by the Zhou Dynasty.  Briefly, it can be described as the formation and rise of a powerful state.  At the end of its capital moved to Loy (modern Luoyang). </p><p>  2. <em>Eastern Zhou.</em>  The late period from 770 to 256 BC  The time of the gradual decrease in the hegemony of Zhou and the collapse of a single state into separate kingdoms.  It is customary to divide it into subperiods: </p><ul><li>  <em>Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn).</em>  This period, as legend has it, was edited by Confucius himself.  It lasted in the years 770-480 BC.  e.  It can be characterized as follows.  The territory of China was divided into many small kingdoms, which inhabited both the Zhou peoples and other peoples.  All of them were ruled by the rulers of the Zhou Dynasty.  Gradually, the real power of the Zhou house became nominal. </li><li>  <em>Zhangguo (Fighting kingdoms).</em>  It lasted in 480-256 BC.  All kingdoms were as if in motion.  Territories were constantly changing, as there were internecine wars, which led to a weakening of the state and to the sad result of the collapse into small kingdoms. </li></ul><h2>  Zhou feudalism </h2><p>  The social system of the country of the Zhou dynasty had a number of distinctive features.  The king (van) appointed rulers to the conquered lands (destinies), who were called Zhuhou.  They were given the titles of hou and guna.  Often, such posts were held by representatives of the lower lines of the dynasty.  If the kingdoms recognized the hegemony of Zhou, then their rulers were recognized as specific with the obligatory conditions for paying tribute and participating in hostilities on the side of the dynasty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rulers constantly fought with each other, seized the lands of neighbors.  The rule in many provinces was also established by the likes of Zhouski.  This led to the failure of the fact that many of them proclaimed themselves bathtubs, which led to the undermining of stability in the state.  After a certain time, the central government was no longer considered. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.china-deko-arts.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zhou dynasty in ancient china" class="if uuid-2857724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857724.jpg"></div><h2>  Western Zhou </h2><p>  Public education was motley in ethnicity, diverse and imperfect.  When the territories were seized as a result of military operations, they were given over to the Zhuo feudal lords or retained the local rulers who recognized their rule.  Observers from Zhou Wang were left for surveillance.  Strong control over the provinces remained until 772 BC. </p><p>  At this time, an event occurred when the Zhou king Yu-wan drove out his wife.  Instead, a concubine was taken.  The father of the disgraced wife went to Yu-wan in a war, having previously entered into an alliance with nomadic tribes.  After his overthrow, the new king was declared the son of Queen Pin-wang, who was recognized by a number of county-level authoritative rulers.  The capital of the state was the city of Luoyang.  It is these events that Chinese historians associate with the beginning of the sunset of the Zhou Dynasty in ancient China. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.numisbids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zhou dynasty briefly" class="if uuid-2857730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857730.jpg"></div><h2>  Socio-political structure of the state </h2><p>  The great importance of the rule of the Zhou dynasty is noticeable in the process of the formation of the early feudal state.  Its signs can be observed already at the initial stages of its formation.  During the early dynasty, the hierarchical system of ranks was strictly observed.  The highest rank - "van" - could have only one person.  He was inherited by his eldest son.  The remaining children dropped to a lower rank and received hereditary possessions.  They also left their rank to the eldest son, the rest descended even lower.  Next in rank were the heads of large family clans.  Common people closed this system. </p><p>  Belonging to a particular rank determined a strictly regulated lifestyle.  This concerned the life, clothing, food, the shape and size of the house, its decoration, the ceremonial of relations between senior and junior ranks.  Even the number of trees on the graves was certain.  This was done in order to determine the place on the hierarchical ladder, which in the Zhou dynasty was determined solely by origin. </p><p>  Heirs of high ranks could become commoners.  Thus, the whole state was like one patriarchal community.  Crafts and trade were the lot of commoners.  Here wealth could not change the arrangement on the hierarchical ladder.  Even a very wealthy merchant was still a commoner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zhou dynasty" class="if uuid-2857742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857742.jpg"></div><h2>  East Zhou </h2><p>  This period lasted more than five hundred years, and its beginning is associated with the transfer of the capital.  A number of circumstances forced to do this, in particular, protection from the Zhong tribe living in the north and northwest of the Zhou state.  The state did not have the opportunity to confront it, which undermined its credibility. </p><p>  This negatively affected the influence of the Zhou Dynasty.  Gradually, independent provinces began to depart from it.  Soon, only the territory that was influenced by the Zhou domain was preserved.  He was left alone, which practically equated him to the specific principalities. </p><h2>  Spring and fall </h2><p>  This is a time span from 722 to 480 BC.  in the history of China, it was reflected in the collection of chronological commentaries "Zhouzhuan" and "Chunqiu."  Zhou's power was still strong enough.  15 vassal provinces recognized the dominant role of the Zhou Dynasty. </p><p>  At the same time, the kingdoms of Qi, Qin, Chu, Jin, Zheng were strong and independent.  They interfered in all the affairs of the royal court, dictated political conditions.  Most of their rulers received the rank of Van, which further strengthened their position.  It was at this time that significant changes occurred in the alignment of forces and changes in the spheres of influence, which ultimately led to the collapse of the once great state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icollector.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zhou dynasty in china" class="if uuid-2857714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857714.jpg"></div><h2>  Fighting Kingdoms (Zhangguo) </h2><p>  The duration of this period is from 480 to 221 BC.  According to the chronicles, it lasted another 34 years after the collapse of the Zhou Dynasty.  These were battles for dominant power.  The once powerful state was divided into three large kingdoms - Wei, Zhao and Han. </p><p>  The main opposition took place between 9 kingdoms, whose rulers received the title of van.  In short, the Zhou Dynasty no longer had influence.  As a result of the difficult and many years of war, the Ying Dynasty defeated and the Qin era began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="importance of the reign of the zhou dynasty" class="if uuid-2857719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/2857719.jpg"></div><h2>  Cultural heritage </h2><p>  Despite the constant military conflicts, the Zhou era has become a time of cultural and economic expansion.  Significant development was trade.  The constructed channels played a major role in this.  Trade and economic ties with other civilizations have had a certain impact on the development of the state.  It is impossible to overestimate the significance of the Zhou Dynasty and its contribution to the Chinese cultural and economic heritage. </p><p>  It was during this era that round money became widespread in China.  The first educational institution was established, which was called the Jixia Academy.  Items of decorative art, such as mirrors made of bronze and silver, various household items coated with varnish, crafts and jewelry made of jade, appeared precisely in this era. </p><p>  A special place in the culture of the Zhou Dynasty was occupied by the development of philosophy, which was represented by various movements.  This is called in history the "one hundred philosophical schools."  Its most famous representatives were Kung Fu Tzu, whom we know as Confucius.  He is the founder of the course of Confucianism.  The founder of another trend of Taoism is Lao Tzu.  The founder of Moism was Mo-Tzu. </p><p>  It should be noted that the culture of the Zhou era did not originate from scratch.  It arose from the Shan culture, which the wise rulers did not destroy, as is often the case in history, but took it as a basis.  The economic development and features of the Zhou social system have given impetus to the formation of many directions in the culture of the new state, which occupies a special place in the great heritage of China. </p>
