    <h2>  Deluxe and Bungalow </h2><p>  Mayor La Grotta Verde Grand Resort 4 * hotel (Corfu island) also has rooms of this category.  Deluxe rooms are more spacious - their area is 29 sq.m.  Inside is everything that is listed above.  But slippers and towels are also provided.  In addition, deluxes look much more luxurious than standard rooms.  This can be seen by looking at the above photo.  And many are actually willing to overpay for aesthetics. </p><p>  But it costs, in fact, not so expensive.  Overpayment, in comparison with the "standard", for two people will be 5-6 thousand rubles.  And for three - 10 tons. </p><p>  Now about the bungalow.  They are spacious here - 32 square meters.  m. Guests can choose what they want to sleep on - either on one "king" bed, or on two separate, single beds. </p><p>  The advantage of the bungalow is that its space is divided into a living room, a bedroom and a balcony with a bathtub.  Usually in such apartments two people live, but it is possible to accommodate two people.  They will have to sleep on a sofa bed.  As extra beds are not available here.  However, all the furniture is new and comfortable - many people sleep very well on sofas. </p><p>  Two people for 7 nights will need to pay about 80,000 rubles.  For three guests, the price will be 110,000 p.  And four will have to pay 140 thousand rubles.  However, the last option is the most profitable.  Since in this case it turns out only at 5000 rubles per person per day (this is a bit, it is worth remembering the all inclusive service). </p>

    <h2>  Suite </h2><p>  Naturally, a hotel of this level has rooms of the highest category.  The suites here are luxurious, modern, however, like all other apartments.  But noticeably more.  Their area is 43 square meters.  m. Inside there is a large bedroom with a huge 2 double bed.  There is a separate living room, a plumbing unit with a bath and a balcony with sea views.  The apartments are designed for two people.  Usually they are occupied by newlyweds or just couples in love.  However, it is possible to place the third guest on the sofa in the living room.  The highlight of this suite is a panoramic view of the sea. </p><p>  A week of living for two people will cost 110,000 rubles.  If you plan to call in three, you will have to pay 150,000 p. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  Now it is worth noting some nuances regarding the hotel.  It is intended for those people who want to spend a calm, quiet and peaceful holiday by the sea, enjoying high quality service and comfortable rooms.  The hotel is really quiet, even in high season.  Due to the fact that it is forbidden to stay with children.  Persons over 16 years old are allowed to register as a guest.  Therefore, mainly lonely travelers, couples in love and groups of friends come here. </p><p>  Check-in starts at three in the afternoon.  If you need to check in earlier due to an early flight, you should talk about it with the administration.  Better in advance, before departure.  When the hotel is not crowded and the apartments reserved by guests are free, they can be settled right away.  But at the height of the season this is unlikely to succeed.  Departure, by the way, is carried out before noon.  On the day guests leave, drinks and meals are not provided. </p><p>  By the way, since the reviews about Mayor La Grotta Verde Grand Resort are mostly good, many people, having read them, wish to go here.  The hotel is popular - by the beginning of the season there are practically no free dates and rooms.  Therefore, it is better to reserve the apartments in advance.  You may even be able to get a discount. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Each review of the Mayor La Grotta Verde Grand Resort contains a rather detailed description of the services provided by the hotel.  But it is much more interesting to find out what impression the complex really made on the guests. </p><p>  People assure: here it is definitely worth going to those who want to forget about everything and just enjoy the rest.  If guests arrive early and there are no free rooms, they will be able to leave things in the luggage room and start using the hotel services - breakfast, order drinks, go to the private beach. </p><p>  By the way, they recommend booking apartments in a building remote from the pool.  Since there‚Äôs a little noise around it.  Suggestions are best indicated when booking.  And one more thing: you must take one or two pairs of comfortable shoes with you.  The hotel is on a mountain, so you have to walk a lot.  And you have to go down to the sea.  True, the stairs, which is convenient.  By the way, if after a storm the seaweed washed ashore, you can go to Corfu and see the sights while the weather is getting better. </p><p>  It‚Äôs also convenient that there are vending machines for calling a free ‚Äútaxi‚Äù on the hotel‚Äôs territory - it takes guests to the reception or restaurant. </p><p>  The attitude towards the guests is also pleasing.  All polite, courteous.  And upon arrival, they can be pampered with a gift - for example, free massage vouchers in the SPA salon. </p><p>  All in all, this is a really good hotel.  Reviews confirm this.  If you want to make sure yourself, you should go here on vacation. </p>
