This question cannot be answered unequivocally.  Indeed, during the transitional periods, which include spring and autumn, the weather changes day by day, and therefore the climatic conditions in the first days of October are significantly different from those that come at the end of the month.  Yes, and the Apennine peninsula, which is occupied by Italy, stretches in the form of a boot far from north to south.  And if it can be said that it is hot in the whole territory of this South European country in summer, then in the middle of autumn everything is not so simple.  Well, let's look at what Italy will please a tourist in October.  Weather, <span>beach vacations</span> and reviews of tourists about it will tell us whether to go to this country in the fall and which route to choose for travel.  Note that they are sent to Italy not only for the sake of sea bathing and tanning.  Beach holidays in this country are rather an additional bonus to a rich excursion program.  A cognitive journey is good to do in cooler weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach holidays in Italy in October" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Beach holidays in Italy</span> in early October in the north of the country </h2><p>  While the breath of autumn is already felt in the countries of Western Europe north of the Alps, summer continues on the Apennine Peninsula.  But coolness comes to the northern regions of Italy.  On the great lakes - Garda, Lago Maggiore, Como - beach vacation is already unthinkable.  <span>Seas, Ligurian</span> and Adriatic, due to the large volume of water still store <span>summer heat.</span>  But the number of rainy days is increasing.  Also, storms are increasingly being felt.  In principle, in early October you can still catch the last tan in the elite resort of the Ligurian Riviera Portofino.  But hardened natures can only buy.  After all, the water temperature on the northern coast of Italy does not exceed a mark of plus twenty degrees.  Although the air warms up on clear days to + 25 <sup>¬∞</sup> C in the shade.  And the surroundings are quite summer: the trees are in green foliage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy october beach holidays reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463788.jpg" width="600"></div>

The "Eternal City" is good in that it can combine the viewing of historical and cultural attractions with a beach holiday.  Indeed, from Rome to the sea can be reached in half an hour by ordinary train at the price of a metro ticket!  Many tourists, judging by the reviews, do so.  But if in the summer they go to the <span>beaches of Rome</span> in the evening, cool off after staying in the red-hot stone bag of the city, then in the autumn it needs to be done in the afternoon, from about eleven in the morning until four.  And then you can go to the <span>museums of Rome.</span>  Even further south, in Naples, Bari, on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, the <span>weather in Italy</span> in October (at least in the first decade of the month) is not much different from August in the Krasnodar Territory.  You can swim and sunbathe here completely.  It is gratifying that the temperature of air and water in the sea is almost the same: twenty-six degrees off the coast of Sicily.  It‚Äôs very comfortable to swim and to walk on monuments of architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy in October weather beach vacation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463801.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Northern Italy in the second half of October </h2><p>  During this period, Florence, Milan, Verona, Bergamo and other cities in the region begin to live their own lives.  The tourist stream turns into a trickle.  It's time to make excursions and photograph the sights without a whole crowd of people getting into the frame.  But a beach holiday in Italy in October is already fully completed.  And even if you are a seasoned swimmer and the day is sunny, most of the coasts in Genoa and Rimini will be closed.  But you can look for non-equipped beaches, free in the summer, and in October - even more so.  An impoverished tourist stream gives the traveler traveling to Italy in mid-autumn another advantage.  After all, prices in this expensive country are falling, and the level of service remains at the same height.  So if Italy is the country of your dreams, then turning a fairy tale into a reality is best in October.  Tuscany, Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna - all these provinces become accessible, and traveling to them does not make a dent in the family budget.  Just take warm clothes with you.  After all, the temperature in the afternoon is about sixteen degrees.  And grab an umbrella: there is a high probability of rain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy tour october" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463824.jpg" width="600"></div>

Sun-scorched grass, cypress candles and azure of the sea inspire sunbathing.  Temperature indicators slightly decreased compared to the first half of October, but continue to remain high.  For those who do not like the heat, plus twenty-five degrees will seem quite comfortable.  Even the sea has not cooled.  Long swims are permissible, because the temperature of the water has dropped only to twenty-three degrees.  At the same time, clear, cloudless weather reigns in Sicily, Puglia, Sardinia.  And the southern sun at noon bakes just in the summer.  But there is no past heat.  And if a summer trip to Pompeii or to the sights of Syracuse was equated with a feat (after all, the temperature in the shade was over the top thirty), now such walks will only be pleasant. </p><h2>  The advantages of a vacation in Italy in October </h2><p>  To get from the dank autumn of the middle lane to even if not summer, but sunny and warm weather - is this not a fairy tale?  Changing a down jacket for a light jacket is not the only bonus when traveling to Italy in October.  Few budget tourists can afford to travel to Western Europe due to the high cost of tours.  But since beach vacations in Italy in October in most regions end, the prices for tickets are becoming more affordable.  You should not think that Florence and Verona in the fall do not remind Anapa in the "season".  No, museums, travel agencies and other tourist attractions continue to operate at full capacity.  And the cold sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe northern provinces of Italy can be contrasted with wonderful water parks.  Many of them have open areas where you can buy a beautiful tan under the rays of the gentle autumn sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach holidays in Italy in early October" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463828.jpg" width="488"></div>

    <h2>  Gastronomic tours </h2><p>  Do not forget about another tourist destination, which Italy beckons to travelers in October.  Beach holidays gourmet reviews are called side entertainment, which you can indulge in if you have free time and good weather.  But the main goal of those who appreciate the ‚Äútaste for life‚Äù is the local culinary holidays.  After all, October for Italy is sometimes a harvest.  And some towns celebrate this with great scope and with real Italian expression.  Tuscany hosts the White Truffle Festival.  Something similar to the "Beaujolais Nouveau" is celebrated in Merano.  They also walk in the vineyards of Marino.  In Perugia and Turin, the king of the festival is excellent Italian chocolate.  Montepescali hosts days of olive oil.  In Vallerano, chestnuts are solemnly starting to bake.  And in San Manato there is a duck paste festival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach holidays in Italy at the end of October" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other events </h2><p>  In mid-autumn, when there is no heat, and in some places a slight coolness reigns, you can realize your dream and travel around the cultural treasury of the world, which is Italy.  A tour (October for this is one of the best months) can cover the whole country or some separate region of it.  Especially popular are trips to Rome.  In October, the Eternal City hosts the Festival of Art and Sacred Music, which attracts celebrities from all over the world.  In the second month of autumn, International Museum Day is also celebrated.  It is very important to be on this date somewhere in Florence, Naples, Verona, Rome.  After all, then all museums hospitably open their doors for tourists and work on their professional holiday for free.  In general, the golden autumn allows tourists to plunge into the ancient and the beautiful: to devote all time to the contemplation of historical and cultural attractions. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  But suppose that you are not interested in the canals and bridges of Venice, the words Senoria Square or the Neptune Fountain do not say anything to you.  And you are also indifferent to gastronomic pleasures - after all, wine, olive oil and chocolate can be bought at the supermarket.  Let's say the only thing that interests you is a beach holiday in Italy.  Is it worth going there in October or not?  This question should be answered with a reservation.  Only to the islands and to the south of the Apennine Peninsula.  There, until the beginning of November, you can sunbathe and enjoy sea bathing.  But at the end of October, the weather can disappoint.  So that the drizzling rain and sea excitement do not spoil your vacation, it is better to choose more tropical countries for relaxation.  October pleases with summer heat in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, in the Canary Islands.  With a great delay, autumn comes in the south of Spain, in Morocco, Jordan, and Israel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Italy in October" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1463826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours to Italy in October </h2><p>  This month with its gentle warmth allows you to combine cognitive and beach holidays in Italy.  In October, tours cover the iconic cities of the country, giving the opportunity to realize a rich excursion program.  But they also provide an opportunity to live a couple of days by the sea, and in the southern part of Italy.  Tours to Sicily are the best choice for October.  On this southern island you can enjoy doing nothing on one of the impeccable beaches, wander around the remains of ancient cities and visit museums, climb Mount Etna, treat yourself to local cuisine rich in seafood, fruits and vegetables.  And, by the way, such tours do not require fabulous sums from you. </p>
