    <p>  Key concepts in the economic sphere: </p><ul><li>  Production. </li><li>  Exchange. </li><li>  Consumption. </li></ul><p>  Companies, factories, factories, mines, banks and so on participate in the production. </p><h2>  The interaction of the political and economic sphere </h2><p>  We give examples of the interaction of the spheres of society among themselves.  The State Duma of the Russian Federation passes laws that all citizens are required to comply with.  Some adopted laws and regulations may affect changes in sectors of the economy.  For example, licensing of certain types of activities leads to a rise in the cost of certain products due to the additional costs associated with the innovation. </p><p>  Concrete examples of the interaction of spheres of society can be illustrated in the light of recent events.  International economic sanctions have been introduced against the Russian Federation.  In response, the authorities of our country introduced counter-sanctions.  As a result, some European food products and medicines do not enter the Russian market.  This led to the following consequences: </p><ul><li>  Rise in price of products. </li><li>  The absence on the shelves of many products whose analogues are not manufactured in Russia. </li><li>  The development of certain sectors of the economy: livestock, horticulture, etc. </li></ul><p>  But it is a mistake to believe that only power affects business, sometimes it is the other way around.  The opposite examples of interaction between the spheres of society, when economists dictate terms to politicians, can be given in practice by lobbying for laws.  A recent example is the so-called Rotenberg law in Russia, according to which millionaires who fall under Western sanctions will be paid compensation from the state budget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Social sphere </h2><p>  The social sphere satisfies the needs of society in education, medicine, services, leisure and entertainment.  It includes everyday communication of citizens and large groups of people. </p><h2>  Political and social spheres </h2><p>  Politics can affect a country's social life.  The following examples of interaction between spheres of society can be given.  Local authorities forbade the opening of any entertainment venues: clubs, night bars and cafes in one of the criminal areas on the outskirts of the city.  As a result, the crime rate in it fell, but residents have to get longer to places of recreation and entertainment. </p><p>  The following example: during the crisis, the district municipality is experiencing <span>a budget deficit.</span>  In order to reduce costs, he decides to close one of the schools.  As a result, there is a reduction in teaching staff, children are transported to another locality every day, and money is saved on the maintenance of objects, since by law all the costs of their maintenance are borne by local authorities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="examples of interaction between spheres of society from history" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1476906.jpg" width="396"></div>

    <h2>  Social and economic spheres </h2><p>  The economic development of the country greatly affects social life.  Here are just a few examples of the interaction of spheres of society.  The financial crisis has reduced real incomes.  Citizens began to spend less on entertainment and leisure, limiting trips to paid parks, sports clubs, stadiums, cafes.  Loss of customers has led to the ruin of many companies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The interconnection also exists between the politics, economy and social development of the country.  We give examples of the interaction of the spheres of society among themselves.  Instability in the Middle East and the depreciation of the ruble by half, coupled with the active development of <span>domestic tourism,</span> led many to cancel their traditional trips to Egypt and Turkey and began to relax in Russia. </p><p>  This example can be disassembled into components: </p><ul><li>  Political - instability in the Middle East, government measures to increase domestic tourism. </li><li>  Economic - devaluation of the ruble has led to a significant increase in prices for trips to Turkey and Egypt while maintaining domestic prices. </li><li>  Social - tourism belongs to this area. </li></ul><h2>  Spiritual sphere </h2><p>  Many mistakenly assume that the spiritual realm belongs to religion.  This misconception comes from the course of history, where church reforms of certain periods are dealt with under relevant topics.  In fact, religion, although it belongs to the spiritual sphere, is not its only component. </p>

    <ul><li>  The science. </li><li>  Education. </li><li>  The culture. </li></ul><p>  As for education, the most attentive readers will ask a fair question about the fact that earlier we attributed it to the social field, when we analyzed examples of the interaction of social spheres with each other.  But education refers to the spiritual as a process, and not as the interaction of people.  For example, school attendance, communication with peers, teachers - all this relates to the social field.  The acquisition of knowledge, socialization (education), self-realization and self-improvement - this is the process of spiritual life, which is designed to satisfy the need for knowledge, improvement. </p><h2>  Spiritual and political spheres </h2><p>  Sometimes politics influences religion.  We give examples of the interaction of the spheres with each other.  Today Iran is a religious state: all domestic politics and laws are adopted exclusively in the interests of Shiite Muslims. </p><p>  We give a historical example of the interaction of the spheres of society.  After the October Revolution of 1917, many temples were blown up, and religion was recognized as ‚Äúopium for the people,‚Äù that is, a harmful drug that must be disposed of.  Many priests were killed, churches destroyed, in their place formed warehouses, shops, mills, etc. This also affected social life: there was a spiritual decline in the population, people stopped honoring traditions, did not register marriages in churches, as a result of which unions began to break up. .  In fact, this led to the destruction of the institution of family and marriage.  The witness of the wedding was not God, but a man, which, we agree, is a huge difference for a believer.  This continued until the Great Patriotic War, until Stalin officially restored the activities of the Russian Orthodox Church on legal grounds. </p><h2>  Spiritual and economic spheres </h2><p>  Economic development affects the spiritual life of the country.  What examples of interaction between the spheres of society among themselves prove this?  Psychologists note that during a period of economic crisis, a depressed state of the population is observed.  Many people lose their jobs, their savings, their companies go bankrupt - all this leads to psychological problems.  But in Russia the practice of private psychologists is not developed, as, for example, in the USA.  Therefore, there are religious sects that draw ‚Äúlost souls‚Äù into their networks, from which it is sometimes very difficult to break out. </p><p>  Another example is South Korea.  The lack of minerals and other resources has influenced the fact that this country has begun to develop science and tourism.  This yielded results - today this country is a leader in the field of electronics and is among the ten most developed countries in the world.  Here, politics, economics and social development immediately collided. </p><h2>  Spiritual and social spheres </h2><p>  The line between spiritual and social life is very thin, but we will try to clarify it through examples of interaction between the spheres of society.  Students attending school, entering institutions are all <span>relations between the</span> two spheres, as people communicate (social) and perform various ceremonies (spiritual). </p>

    <h2>  Examples of interaction of spheres of society from history </h2><p>  Let us recall a little history.  It also contains examples of the interaction of various spheres of society.  He will take the reforms of Stolypin at the beginning of the 20th century.  In Russia, the community was canceled, peasant banks were created, which issued loans by the settler, made preferential travel at the expense of the state, and created a small infrastructure in Siberia.  As a result, thousands of peasants from the low-land South and Volga region poured into the East, where the treasured hectares of free land were waiting for them.  All these measures allowed: </p><ul><li>  weaken peasant landlessness in the central provinces; </li><li>  to master the empty lands of Siberia; </li><li>  feed people bread and replenish the state budget with taxes in the future. </li></ul><p>  This serves as a vivid example of the interaction of politics, economy and social life of the country. </p><p>  Another situation is the dispossession of peasants, as a result of which many hardworking rational owners were left without means of subsistence, and their place was taken by parasites from comedians.  As a result, many died of starvation, and rural farming was destroyed.  This example shows the impact of rash political decisions on the economy and social life. </p><h2>  The interaction of social sectors: examples from the media </h2><p>  Channel One announced the decision by the Russian authorities to bomb terrorists of the <span>Islamic State</span> banned in Russia.  The Federal Channel also said that the authorities intend to resume negotiations on the Turkish gas pipeline to Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interaction of spheres of society media examples" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42015/1476903.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  All information is from a source that relates to <span>the media.</span>  It illustrates examples of the interaction of different spheres of society.  In the first case, political and social, as the decision of the leadership of our country will lead to consequences in the Middle East.  The history of the <span>Turkish stream</span> shows the relationship of politics and economy.  The agreement between the countries will develop the gas industry and replenish the budgets of both countries. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Examples of interaction between spheres of society prove that we live in a complex system.  A change in one subsystem necessarily affects others.  All spheres are interconnected, but none of the four is the main, dominant, on which all the others depend. </p><p>  The superstructure is law.  It is not included in any of the four, but does not stand out in the fifth.  Right is a holding tool over them. </p>
