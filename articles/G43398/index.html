Moreover, the water area is 39 thousand square kilometers.  The sea often warms up to +26 degrees.  And another unique feature - this is the most desalinated body of water, salinity is only 13%, but this is only in the southern part, in the rest of the water area it does not exceed 10%. </p><p>  But, most importantly, on the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov you can have a great rest, soak up the sun and swim.  One of the favorite places for residents of the Rostov region is Chumbur-Kosa.  As a rule, whole families come here for the weekend.  A couple of days is enough to restore strength before the new work week. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geomasters.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chumbur-spit, beach" class="if uuid-2354680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2354680.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The village is located in the <span>Taganrog Bay,</span> on the territory of the spit of the same name, which goes far into the sea.  The Chumbursky Spit begins from Margaritovo and ends with the cape of the same name in the sea. </p><p>  The beaches and the seabed on Chumbur-Kos are sandy.  Clean coast, and the depth increases gradually, so you can go here with children. </p><p>  A frequent guest here is the wind, mainly a sea breeze blowing from the sea.  Summer, the water temperature is always above +20 degrees.  In the coastal strip there are <span>recreation centers</span> and pensions.  The shore is always clean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.stihi.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coastline" class="if uuid-2354686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2354686.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The official history of the village of Chumbur-Kosa began only in the last century.  Then a fish factory was built here, although from time immemorial the inhabitants of this area were engaged in fishing.  The name "Chumbur" in Old Russian means "float". </p><p>  Today, the fish farm does not work, only dilapidated buildings and several longboats remain from the enterprise.  The village gained fame after the construction of a children's camp on its territory.  But the village did not become a real resort, due to the regular erosion of the coastline, so it was not possible to create a developed infrastructure here. </p><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  Children from the age of 7 to 15 years are admitted to the Chumbur-Kosa camp.  You can send your child on 18 or 21 days.  At the same time, the camp can take 250 children.  For them, accommodation is provided in one-story buildings, in rooms of 5-7 people, with amenities on the street.  Meals 6 times a day. </p><p>  The camp has its own beach, on the territory there are sports grounds, exercise machines and tennis tables.  As usual in all camps, leisure activities are organized for children.  These are circles, competitions, hiking trips and discos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can get to the camp not only by your own motor transport (45 kilometers from Azov), but also by regular bus that goes to Port Caton. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The left bank of the Chumbur-spit" class="if uuid-2354682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2354682.jpg"></div><h2>  Family holiday </h2><p>  On the territory of the village there are many guest houses, the Brigantine boarding house is working.  It is located 100 meters from the sea.  In the pension you can stay in 2-4 bed rooms, or in a cottage.  It offers guests - showers and toilets, a barbecue area, a kitchen and gazebos. </p><p>  In principle, there are no problems with the settlement in the village, the cost of living starts from 500 rubles per day. </p><p>  Reviews about Chumbur-Kos are mixed.  Indeed, relaxing on a spit for an amateur, there are quite deserted beaches.  On the left coast there is no beach at all, there is a fortification installed so that the shore is not eroded. </p><p>  On the spit, the wind always blows, but not everyone likes it.  Although even at temperatures above +30 degrees, the heat is not felt.  On the other hand, you can sometimes see kiters here, because the conditions for doing this sport on the braid are the most suitable. </p><p>  If you look at the photo of Chumbur-Kosa at the people who rested there, it is noticeable that the area is really deserted. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.9542892" data-lng="38.90260880000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/8/1808.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  From Rostov-on-Don to the spit 90 kilometers.  Naturally, it is best to drive your own car, especially since the road is paved.  It will take about 1.5 hours to travel, but you can admire the local beauties, fields with wheat and meadows where livestock grazes. </p><p>  You can get to Chumbur-Kosa by regular bus.  From Rostov-on-Don by bus to the village of Azov, where you need to transfer to another bus, next to Port Caton.  On average, the cost in one direction will be about 150-200 rubles per person. </p>
