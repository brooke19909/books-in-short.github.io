    <p>  This natural park is located on the outskirts of the city of Yekaterinburg.  Shartash Lake in shape resembles a huge bean, spread out in the middle of a huge foundation pit. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The lake, which appeared in prehistoric times, surrounded by high shores, has practically not changed in the entire history of its existence.  The flora and fauna of its shores, of course, have undergone some changes.  And giant ferns gave way to needles and flowers, and mobs and bears now inhabit the lizards' habitat.  The cultures of the tribes that settled on the banks in different eras also changed.  Archaeologists and historians do not exclude that somewhere in the vicinity of Shartash is the ancestral home of ancient civilization ... </p>

    <h2>  Geography and geology </h2><p>  Now, on the site of ancient sites, the handsome Ekaterinburg is spread out.  Lake Shartash in its bowels stores a huge amount of sapropel.  Until the last century, this pond was flowing and had a drain into the nearby <span>Iset River.</span>  This drain was located a little to the west of the village of Peski.  Nowadays, the water level in the lake is supported by fifty springs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the northern shore of the reservoir is the village of Shartash.  The first mention of it dates back to the XVII century.  Isoplit village is located in the east.  By the way, the eastern shore of Lake Shartash (Ekaterinburg) <strong> </strong>  open for swimming. </p>

    <p>  In the south direction is the village of Sands. </p><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  Hydronym "Shartash" of Turkic (Bashkir or <span>Tatar) origin.</span>  Many researchers suggest that it is based on the merger of two roots: "sary" (yellow, white, light) and "tash" (stone).  In this case, the toponym is associated with the shade of the rocks surrounding the lake.  The famous toponymist A.K. Matveev gives a different version.  In his opinion, the triplet ‚Äúball‚Äù can be associated with the Bashkir word ‚Äúswamp‚Äù.  Perhaps there are other versions of the origin of the toponym. </p><h2>  Younger brother </h2><p>  Not only this pond is famous for the nature reserve mentioned by us.  Another attraction that Yekaterinburg is famous for is Lake Shartash Maly.  Although it does not have such glory, it is no less amazing place.  Once both reservoirs were connected by a canal, but now it is swamped and overgrown. </p><p>  In shape, Small Shartash resembles grain and has a rather modest size.  Streams flowing from the lake, flowing into the Istok river (a tributary of Iset).  The western shore of the reservoir is bordered by granite outcrops, which are also called "tents." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The coast of this lake also stores traces of the habitat of ancient people.  According to historical sources, it was inhabited in the Stone and Iron Age. </p><h2>  Shartash Forest Park </h2><p>  The southern and southeastern shores of Lake Shartash are covered with mixed forest.  Traditionally wild and urban plant species grow in it.  The pearl of the forest park is the historical and geological monument "Stone Tents". </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the forest park there are several more interesting sights for tourists and researchers.  For example, an ancient altar, an archaeological site.  And in 2012, on the shore of Shartash, near the boat station, scientists from the Institute of History and Archeology discovered another object - traces of a Neolithic settlement. </p><p>  Yekaterinburg, Lake Shartash, a forest park and Stone Tents are of interest to sports lovers.  Tourists and athletes come here not only from all over the Russian Federation, but also from abroad.  Rock climbers are attracted by unique megaliths.  Forest trails are open for cyclists and scooters.  And the eastern shore of Lake Shartash (Ekaterinburg) is equipped with wonderful beaches.  In different years, depending on the conditions, other coasts are open for swimming.  In addition, there is a boat station on the lake. </p><h2>  Swimming in the lake </h2><p>  The place is considered very clean, in any case, most of the city residents are sure of this.  The reservoir that Yekaterinburg is so proud of - Lake Shartash - pleases the eye with a blue iridescent water.  But, apparently, the composition of water is to the liking not only of man.  Sanitary doctors regularly test, periodically identifying pathogens of dangerous diseases. </p>

    <p>  Most of the bottom surface is silty.  In some places, quite sharp protruding rocky fragments are located.  The average depth of the lake is only 3 meters, but in some places there are hollows up to 5.5 meters in depth. </p><p>  The eastern shore of Lake Shartash (Yekaterinburg) has a muddy bottom, and the water there is cleaner.  But even this zone sometimes comes under the scrutiny of sanitation.  During periods of infection, the beaches of the lake close. </p><h2>  Tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  All year round, guests are welcomed by the warm Lake Shartash (Yekaterinburg).  Rest on its shores can be both active and relaxing.  Those who are tired of the bustle of the city and just want peace, are waiting for hospitable camp sites.  On the shore of the lake are many small restaurants and cozy cafes. </p><p>  Local residents living in nearby villages rent out green tourism lovers.  Such a vacation may seem especially attractive to those who decide to go on a trip with their children. </p><p>  Tourists can easily find everything they need in stores located almost everywhere. </p><h2>  "Stone Tents" </h2>

    <p>  Lake Shartash (Yekaterinburg), the photo of which is similar to illustrations for old Russian fairy tales, is beautiful in its surroundings.  The unique "Stone Tents" is a great confirmation of this.  These are the remains of granite, located near the reservoir under consideration, almost in the city (Kirovsky district).  In the Middle Urals, this object is considered the most unusual, picturesque, monumental and accessible monument of natural beauty and ancient culture. </p><p>  According to the latest archaeological information, up to 10 sites and settlements of ancient people were located on the shartash.  The earliest known today date back to the III millennium BC.  e., and even to even earlier historical periods.  Researchers note that these settlements, apparently, had elements and signs of an ancient religious cult.  There is evidence and commodity production.  The surface of the "Stone Tents" contains traces of the fact that once there was a sacrificial place here, apparently referring to one of the ancient pagan cults. </p><p>  It must be not in vain that Lake Shartash, Yekaterinburg, the beach on its shore, green spaces around attract tourists here.  All these places almost from prehistoric times were chosen by man. </p>
