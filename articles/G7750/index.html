Description, characteristics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Europe, even at the household level, traditional incandescent lamps have not been found for a long time.  They are replaced by fluorescent or LED analogues, which are superior to obsolete light sources in many ways.  In Russia, the process of updating luminaires began only a few years ago, but you still can‚Äôt talk about the desire of users to abandon familiar devices.  In part, this attitude can be justified both by the high cost of more technologically advanced products, and by the spread of rumors about their health hazards.  But, as practice shows, in terms of the combination of operational qualities, modern lighting is the optimal solution.  It remains only to decide which lamp is better - LED or energy-saving?  Both options appeared on the market relatively recently, but to this day, most consumers do not have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe properties of this product. </p><h2>  LED Model Features </h2>

    <p>  One of the main characteristics of the lamp is power.  The brightness of the light beam directly depends on it, but also the <span>energy consumption.</span>  The features of LED devices include the reduction in the effect of power on energy consumption.  In such models, this indicator has a wider range, but in standard versions it is in the range from 4.5 to 15 watts.  The advantages that luminaires for LED bulbs possess include the ability to control the parameters of the light beam with the expectation of minimizing electricity consumption.  The brightness of light is measured in lumens and the ratio of this indicator with power in Led-models can be called one of the most profitable.  So, a 15 W bulb corresponds to a brightness of 136 Lm, and a 25 W model - 249 Lm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another significant characteristic is the <span>temperature of light,</span> measured in kelvins (K).  LED models are quite diverse in this parameter.  For example, there are 3300 K variants that provide the so-called warm light.  The standard is considered to be 4000 K. This is natural, or daylight - the best option if you want to provide lighting at home with natural properties for perception by the eye.  Less common is ‚Äúcold‚Äù light, which corresponds to an indicator of 5000 K. It is usually used in special cases, for example, in industries. </p><h2>  LED lamp reviews </h2><p>  LED lights are positioned as devices that provide high-quality and pleasant lighting with economical energy consumption.  And users confirm these qualities.  A variety of housing designs for such products is also noted, which allows any configuration of lighting systems to be implemented with minimal installation effort.  After the transition from traditional models to LED ceiling lights, many note a reduction in energy costs to 200-300 rubles.  per month. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth going to the negative reviews of users of such lamps.  Although emission from the spectra as a whole gives rise to favorable opinions, the supply of light loses even to incandescent lamps in terms of scattering parameters.  This is partly due to the desire of interior designers to use several point LEDs to cover the entire space.  Therefore, you should prepare in advance to ensure a narrow flow, which provide LED bulbs.  How to choose the appropriate option for the implementation of the optimal LED lighting system - this issue is largely determined by the needs of the user.  The best use of such models involves the organization of individual zones with backlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Best led bulbs </h2>

    <p>  Experts evaluate the quality of the lamps by comparing the data declared by the manufacturer with the indicators identified in practice.  As tests show, most of the lamps on the market simply do not meet the characteristics indicated on the package.  For example, if power is declared at 20-30 watts, then there is a risk of obtaining actual data at 15 and 25 watts, respectively.  Moreover, the more powerful the declared indicator, the higher the gap with actual data may be.  In this regard, the most reliable manufacturers should include Verbatim, Philips and Osram brands.  We can say that these are the best LED bulbs, as their users receive operational indicators that are closest to the characteristics indicated in the marking. </p><h2>  Characteristics of energy-saving lamps </h2><p>  Luminescent models provide lighting according to other operating principles.  They transfer the fourth part of energy in the form of heat, and the rest share is converted to light.  The power range of such devices varies from 7 to 250 watts.  However, you should not consider these values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the point of view of compliance with incandescent lamps.  The ratio of the power of energy-saving models to traditional sources is 1 to 5. Further, based on the characteristics of light output, we can come closer to answering the question of which lamp is better - LED or energy-saving.  As already noted, in Led-models the ratio of power to the characteristics of the light flux is optimal and suggests the possibility of regulation.  In turn, energy-saving lamps demonstrate a ratio of light output to power in the range of 10-15 lm / W.  This is a low indicator, therefore it is better to give preference to <span>LED lamps</span> in evaluating this criterion <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Energy Saving Model Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Such devices are popular mainly due to the economical use of electricity and the ability to provide light with large areas.  According to the manufacturers themselves, even entry-level products can serve at least 7 thousand hours, which also attracts a considerable part of buyers.  However, reviews of lamps of this type after prolonged use indicate the non-standard of their glow.  Energy-efficient models provide good diffusion and brightness, but this light can be tiring on the eyes.  In addition, the specific base of many causes problems in installation - in any case, after installation, the design looks rather messy.  But the main fear of users of such lamps relates to the content of mercury.  Because of this nuance, many even refuse luminescent products.  Otherwise, extreme care should be taken when handling gas-containing devices. </p><h2>  The best energy-saving lamps </h2>

    <p>  Earlier, <span>fluorescent lamps,</span> which are a type of energy-saving models <span>,</span> have already been mentioned.  Both varieties belong to gas-discharge light sources, but at the same time they differ in characteristics.  So, in the case of luminescent versions, a higher light output is noted, therefore it is advisable to use them for domestic needs.  Traditional energy-saving incandescent lamps are more often used in public places, institutions and in industries.  In both cases, to identify the best option should be guided by two characteristics - power and durability.  As a rule, such models do not imply high requirements for lighting.  To cover a medium-sized room, 15-20 watts will be enough.  The indicator of service life matters from the point of view of characteristics of a light stream.  The longer the working period, the lower the luminous flux. </p><h2>  Lamp comparison </h2>

    <p>  To begin with, it is worth noting the general advantages that these types of lamps have.  They are united by the economic benefit of use, durability (although Led models have a slight advantage) and providing sufficient lighting.  Now you can move on to the question of which lamp is better - LED or energy-saving?  The first option is advisable to use if you plan to design accent in the lighting system.  Such models are distinguished by aesthetic appearance and organically enter modern interiors.  Luminescent models are not the most attractive option aesthetically, but with proper installation they will also provide a decent result.  The advantages of LED lamps include their safety for health, while gas-discharge analogues are potentially dangerous due to the mercury content.  Thus, in terms of the totality of qualities, it makes sense to turn first to Led technology, although such products are more expensive. </p><h2>  Other lamp options </h2><p>  There is still a demand for both classic incandescent lamps and more modern halogen models.  These types of lamps lose out to LED and <span>energy-saving devices</span> in terms of economy and durability, but at the same time they have their own advantages.  For example, halogen versions have perhaps the best light transmission.  They are presented on the market in various modifications, which differ in design decisions, sizes and shapes. </p>

    <p>  Incandescent bulbs are also not a thing of the past.  To a large extent this is facilitated by their affordability.  The cost of one product is within 100 rubles, which is very attractive against the background of expensive LEDs.  In addition, thanks to incandescent lamps, you can get high-quality home lighting without eye strain.  The main thing is to purchase models from reputable manufacturers. </p><h2>  The nuances of optimal lamp choice </h2><p>  In order not to be disappointed in the choice, you should initially rely on specific requests.  In some cases, for example, the purchase of modern technology versions does not justify itself, so you should decide on the requirements in advance.  So, for long-term operation in a house or apartment, it is advisable to use LED bulbs.  How to choose a suitable option?  First, consider the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlighting, which will determine the appropriate power.  Secondly, you need to think about the location and installation diagram - this will help you choose the right size and shape of the lamp.  Energy-saving models are appropriate for use in large non-residential premises.  Attention when buying should also be given to size and power. </p><h2>  Lighting requirements </h2><p>  Comparing the varieties of lamps, do not ignore the characteristics of the lamp.  In many ways, this shell determines the quality of light and the appearance of the lighting.  Today, there are compact ceiling lights, and massive shades, and delicate sconces - this choice is determined by the individual needs of users.  However, different types of lamps differ in the shape of the cap, which may limit the choice of the lamp.  For use at home, socle-minions with markings E14 and E27 are intended.  By the way, the second digit indicates the diameter of the connector in millimeters.  GU socles are also in demand, which are designed exclusively for working with 12 V. lamps </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  One of the most reliable approaches to the choice of a device involves an assessment of its shortcomings.  This principle can also help in answering the question of which lamp is better - LED or energy-saving?  Among the main disadvantages of Led-models, it is worth highlighting the narrow focus of light, high cost and a specific glow that can irritate the eyes.  As for the shortcomings of energy-saving lamps, they are expressed in potential harm to health and, again, in considerable cost.  Thus, for residential premises, the LED lamp as a safe, beautiful and economical light source will definitely be the best choice.  The same advantages in the form of minimizing costs should be provided in a non-residential premises with the help of an energy-saving lamp.  The mercury content in this case will not be so dangerous. </p>
