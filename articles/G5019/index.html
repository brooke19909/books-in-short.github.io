    <p>  Sweatpants - indispensable clothing in gyms, at home, on a personal plot, on hikes.  Knowing how to sew them, you can learn to sew and pajama pants.  Since these trousers usually work, exercise or travel, they have a lot of work, and very often you need to buy new ones.  But you can rip the old ones - and there will be a ready-made pattern of sweatpants.  But to assemble them correctly will also require skill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Required measurements </h2><p>  Nevertheless, before cutting, you should measure the waist, hips, as well as the required leg length.  When calculating the amount of tissue, you need to take into account the volume of the hips: if they are less than a 100-centimeter mark, then the material is required along the length of the leg.  The length of the trousers is measured to the floor, and if there is an idea to stretch the elastic at the bottom, you need to add another 10 cm. </p><p>  If the fabric is very thin, then, for example, with a width of 110 cm, the width of the legs should coincide with the width of the material, and in length with the total length of the product, multiplied by two. </p><p>  The layout must be done, given the extensibility of the fabric.  If the material is of such quality that over time there is no threat of stretching it, you can tailor it as it will be convenient.  This primarily applies to synthetic fabrics. </p>

    <p>  But natural fabrics suggest a certain cut - along the warp, then the legs will be parallel to the edge of the fabric. </p><p>  Cut out with a small margin, the parts are folded together and fastened with pins. </p><p>  It is necessary to sweep the tucks that are along the waist and bottom.  Then the belt is attached and cuts on the sides are processed.  A cord is inserted at the waist and bottom of the trousers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Threaded Pants </h2><p>  If you need to make a pattern of pants with an elastic band, this process will not cause special difficulties, since the cut is simple enough and it does not take time to make calculations for additional details. </p><p>  First, you need data that you can obtain by measuring: </p><ul><li>  waist circumference </li><li>  girth of the hips, immediately half-girth should be recorded; </li><li>  distance from waist to hip; </li><li>  leg circumference to find out the width of the leg; </li><li>  the length of the trousers, you will need to know the distance from the waist to the foot. </li></ul><p>  Knowing all this data, you can make a pattern on graph paper. </p><p>  The first horizontal line laid is the waist.  A line drawn perpendicularly at the intersection is marked with the letter A, and point B is placed in parallel. The resulting segment AB is the length of the trousers. </p><p>  You should postpone the AB segment, which is equal to the semicircle of the thigh, taking into account an allowance of up to 8 cm, and draw a horizontally straight line through point B - this is the hip line.  Now the middle of the BV segment is marked, 4 cm is laid up from this point, and the point K is set. A horizontal line is drawn through it defining the knee. </p><p>  Now you should pay time to the waist.  From point A to the right, point G is marked, it is calculated by dividing the semicircle of the waist into 4 parts, the resulting total will be this distance.  Extra centimeters are added to the allowance. </p><p>  To the left of A, point T is at the same distance, an allowance is also needed. </p><p>  The line of the hips is done in this way.  From B to the right, point W is set, obtained by calculating the fourth part of the semicircle of the hips.  On the opposite side, at the same distance, point L is marked with an allowance of up to 11 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Bottom line.  From point A to the side, distances equal to half a measure of width are marked.  The side seam line is drawn smoothly, obtained by crossing the points A and T. Then it is necessary to connect it with the bottom point.  From point G, a perpendicular to the hip line is drawn, retreating to the right by 2.5 cm, it is necessary to bring to point S. It turns out a codice by connecting G and Sh. </p><p>  Rear end.  From A to the left, a distance equal to half the semicircle of the waist is laid.  This is point D. The allowance is up to 18 cm. </p><p>  The line of the hips.  The BM segment is delayed left and right; they are equal to half the semicircle.  The allowance will be 16 cm. From B to the bottom line, a side seam line will run. </p><h2>  Baby pants </h2><p>  Moms love to sew for their children, therefore, making children's pants for a pattern is not a problem for them.  The child grows quickly, so it is better to rip old trousers and make new ones out of them, given the larger size. </p><p>  The fabric will suit any.  If it‚Äôs summer time, then it‚Äôs better to take a light one. </p><p>  The material should be folded face up, then the pattern is pinned with pins.  We must not forget about allowances.  On the front half, you can make a shelf, after it is cut off, it needs to be turned over so that its wide part is located at the side. </p><p>  The cut out front part and the shelf are attached, on the front side the shelf should be bent, stitching with a simple seam.  Then the two halves are connected and attached. </p>

    <p>  For the belt there should be a strip of fabric equal in width to the trousers.  It is necessary to stitch a tight tape in the wrong part.  Now you need to insert an elastic band so that it does not squeeze the stomach, but it is not too loose. </p><p>  When making a pants pattern for a boy, you need to consider how many and what pockets will be.  It is better to make them with small bevels, and so that they do not come off, it would be nice to put rivets with the help of special devices.  To create pockets, rectangles of the same size are cut, tucked and sewn. </p><h2>  Merki </h2><p>  In order to sew trousers for a man, you need to know which style he prefers.  But no matter what style he loves, a pattern of men's pants is required in any case. </p><p>  To create a basic pattern, you will need to take measurements such as: </p><ul><li>  distance from the waistline to the seat plane; </li><li>  <span>waist</span> and hips; </li><li>  length on the inner surface; </li><li>  from waist to floor; </li><li>  width of trousers. </li></ul><p>  The entire construction of the pattern is based on the following algorithm.  A vertical line is drawn, on which point T. is marked. A horizontal line passes through it - the front waist line. </p>

A horizontal line is drawn through it, i.e., a step line. </p><p>  The bottom line is formed with the help of the point , from which the leg length along the inner seam is marked down, marked with the letter N. The obtained segment of the  is divided into two parts, and the point  is obtained 5 cm above the marked point, a horizontal line should be drawn through it, which will give a level the knee. </p><p>  From  upwards, the fourth part of the diameter of the hips is laid down and is marked by point B, drawing a horizontal line through it, you can get a line of hips. </p><h2>  <span>Pattern pants</span> according to the algorithm </h2><p>  The front of the trousers.  From point W, point W <sub>1 is</sub> postponed to <sub> </sub>  the lines <sub> </sub>  step, it is equal to the semi-volume divided by 4 with an allowance of up to 0.5 cm.
