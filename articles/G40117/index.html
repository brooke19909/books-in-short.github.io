Some people are attracted by mountains, some are sunny beaches.  Well, there are those who are not attracted by the lights of overseas embankments and tropical islands.  It so happens that amidst the gray everyday life, an adventurous thought flickers in my head: ‚ÄúBut should I give up on Peter from Moscow for the weekend?‚Äù  And such wonderful impulses must be realized. </p>

    <p>  How not to get lost among the huge number of offers of tour operators of all stripes?  What to go and how to get to the fabulous Northern capital?  <span>Where to stay in St. Petersburg</span> and where to go?  How many questions rummages in the head of the one who first decided to arrange a weekend tour in St. Petersburg from Moscow!  We will try to answer at least the most important of them. </p><h2>  Before the trip </h2><p>  Even if you are going on a weekend, try to do everything possible in advance so that you do not get any unpleasant surprises on the road.  Check the status of accounts on bank cards that you plan to take with you.  Recharge your mobile in a familiar place so that you don‚Äôt have to wander around a strange city in search of a terminal.  Check the documents - a photo that is not pasted in time will certainly become a problem and spoil the rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Weather monitoring will not be superfluous, because the St. Petersburg climate is very different from the Moscow one.  It might be worth taking an umbrella. </p>

    <p>  By the end of the 18th century, with the light hand of Empress Catherine II, the Admiralty appeared here, the Fontanka and Moika embankments settled down, the beautiful Nevsky Prospect, the Winter Palace appeared.  St. Isaac's Cathedral was built after victory in the war with Napoleon. </p><p>  The revolution of 1917 brought the city not only a new name - Leningrad, but also greatly influenced its development.  A whole cultural layer is associated with it.  What is the mention of Smolny alone.  Unfortunately, the First World War and subsequent tragic events provoked a significant decrease in the number of inhabitants.  Part died, someone emigrated. </p><p>  But Leningrad continued to live and develop.  Soon the first film studio Lenfilm was opened in the country.  Huge tests brought the Second World War.  The city survived the blockade. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the glory of the cultural capital for Peter finally entrenched.  The natives of here glorified Soviet art and science throughout the world.  After the collapse of the USSR, the city was returned the historical name - St. Petersburg.  In 2003, he magnificently celebrated the 300th anniversary.  And in the fall of 2012, a five millionth resident was born in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  What cultural layer attracts you?  What is causing more interest?

Then your excursion to St. Petersburg for the weekend from Moscow will bring maximum pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Professional approach </h2><p>  In Moscow there are a huge number of travel agencies ready to take all the trouble on organizing a trip for themselves.  If this method seems optimal for you, discuss with the operator all the details.  You will be offered several tours to choose from, they will talk about the cost of each of them and explain in detail what is included in it. </p><p>  As a rule, tours to St. Petersburg for the weekend from Moscow include 3 days and 2 nights.  During this time, the guide will tell your group in detail about the history of the city, will orient you by the cost of tickets for St. Petersburg events, and tell you how to spend your free time between excursions.  Agencies place Moscow tourists in St. Petersburg hotels, eliminating the need to take care of finding housing on their own.  Meals and transport are partially provided.  Pay attention to everything that the manager will tell you so that you will not be disappointed during the trip.  Part of the tour can take place not by transfer transport, but by public transport, and some routes involve long walks.  Be sure to specify what you have to get to Peter and back.  Not all excursions start in Moscow.  Many of them start at the Moscow station in the city on the Neva. </p>

    <p>  Among the huge variety of tours, everyone can find what suits their interests, tastes and financial possibilities as much as possible.  On average, a weekend trip to St. Petersburg from Moscow will cost 6-6.5 thousand per person, excluding travel expenses. </p><h2>  To Peter by train </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to St. Petersburg from the capital.  The train ride will take several hours.  Several flights depart daily in both directions.  And although transport runs relatively often, it makes sense to take care of tickets in advance.  By the way, Russian Railways provides the opportunity to purchase tickets over the Internet, which can save you from having to stand in line. </p><p>  Who has not heard of the legendary Red Arrow?  Traveling on this extraordinary train is an adventure in itself.  It runs between Moscow and St. Petersburg for over 80 years, but today its technical equipment is the most progressive.  The cars are equipped with double-glazed windows, the latest furniture, comfortable bathrooms.  In addition to the usual coupe, a place in which will cost about 2 800 rubles, in the "Red Arrow" there are wagons of increased comfort.  Get ready to fork out - a ticket to a suite costs a little over 5 thousand.  But a double VIP-room will cost you 7 thousand rubles, but at the disposal you will receive not only a wide and comfortable sofa, but also everything you need on the road: from a soft bathrobe to hygiene products.  The Red Arrow will take you to Peter in 8 hours. </p>

    <p>  There are other trains.  Most of them cost less and go faster.  You will pay less than 2 thousand rubles for a bed in the reserved seat.  The distance from St. Petersburg to Moscow is only 650 km. </p><h2>  Flight </h2><p>  It is believed that air travel is faster and safer than any ground transportation.  Remember that the sooner you buy a ticket, the lower its cost.  For comparison, a ticket for tomorrow's flight will cost an average of 3 thousand rubles.  And if you buy a ticket 2 months before departure, it will be half the price. </p>

    <p>  The board will take you to St. Petersburg from Moscow in just an hour and a half. </p><h2>  Bus tours </h2><p>  You can get to St. Petersburg from Moscow by bus for the weekend.  Perhaps this type of transport is the most budgetary.  You will spend an average of 10-12 hours on the road, and you will pay about a thousand rubles per ticket.  The pre-booking rule also works here. </p><h2>  Car ride </h2><p>  If you decide to go to St. Petersburg for the weekend from Moscow by car, you will surely get a lot of emotions from the road.  The journey is not easy - it lasts about 12 hours.  Well, if you have the opportunity to take turns at the driver's post, because for one person such a load is quite large.  Although there are many drivers who claim that this path turned out to be quite feasible.  Along the way, you will meet a lot of beautiful and unusual.  For example, a village with the capacious name Panic.  There are many versions of the origin of this name.  Are you approaching Valdai?  Know: halfway behind and the same number left. </p><p>  Very soon, a new M11 expressway will be commissioned. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  If you prefer to live in hotels, Peter will open their welcoming doors in front of you.  Pleasure will cost from 10,000 rubles and above.  VIP apartments in the center may cost more than similar ones in some European capital.  The cost of some of them reaches more than 30 thousand per day. </p><p>  Budget hotels are ready to accept you for only 2-5 thousand rubles.  Private realtors will quickly find an apartment for the same money. </p><p>  There is another option, especially popular among young people - a hostel.  A bed will cost 250 rubles.  Please note that most hostels only have shared, multi-bed rooms, where travelers of both sexes are adjacent. </p><p>  Distributed in St. Petersburg and the phenomenon of couchsurfing.  If you do not mind hosting St. Petersburg tourists and giving them a tour of Belokamennaya, you can count on reciprocal hospitality.  In this case, you do not have to pay at all for the night. </p><h2>  St. Petersburg must have </h2><p>  The Admiralty‚Äôs spire, bridges, <span>white nights, the</span> Hermitage - the list goes on and on.  But is it worth it?  Better make your own.  Perhaps for you it will include the office of your favorite radio station or cafe in which you shot the scene of the movie "Brother"? </p><h2>  Unusual Peter </h2><p>  Even those who are not coming to the Northern capital for the first time say that they discover this city again and again.  What is only one St. Petersburg slang with its "curbs" and "ceremonial".  Many of the local words may be unusual for a Muscovite‚Äôs ear. </p>
