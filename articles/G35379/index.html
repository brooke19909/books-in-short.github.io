    <h2>  Museum-Estate "Arkhangelsk" </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine the parks of Moscow suburbs without the Arkhangelskoye estate, located in the Krasnogorsk district, in the village of the same name.  Under the park, 62.76 hectares are occupied.  The estate itself is a particularly valuable object of cultural heritage.  The palace and park ensemble was created in the XVIII century and today is divided into 2 parts.  On a paid basis, you can get into the homestead and inspect the estate itself.  Apollonovna Grove and the Gonzaga Theater are located in the free park area.  Two parts of the park are separated by the Ilyinsky highway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Natashinsky park </h2><p>  In Lyubertsy, the Natashinsky park near Moscow is located.  In 2007, local residents had to conquer the territory, as they tried to build residential buildings here.  However, the park is the only one in the northern part of the city, so the activists managed to defend their point of view. </p><p>  This is a relatively new “green” corner, created in the middle of the XX century.  Although his story begins at the end of the XIX century, when the nobleman Skalsky dug ponds in this place in honor of the 18th anniversary of his daughter Natalia, in whose honor the park zone was named.  Natalya did not drown in any pond, this is all a made-up story.  Forest plantations of the park were badly damaged during the Second World War, but they were restored.  Now it is a pleasant place for walking. </p>

    <h2>  Park Hotels </h2><p>  But the region is famous not only for ordinary parks.  Recently appeared park hotels in the suburbs, where you can relax from the bustle of the city. </p><p>  For example, 75 km from MKAD in the Serpukhov district, there is a park hotel Vozdvizhenskoye.  This is a territory of 25 hectares in the historical site of a noble estate.  On the territory there is a temple of the Exaltation, which is currently being reconstructed.  The hotel has 2 hotel buildings with 235 rooms of various categories.  There is an indoor pool (25 meters) and a private beach with clean sand, Finnish and infrared saunas, a SPA center, and the opportunity to go fishing in any season.  There is also a sports hall, a football field, animation events are held for children on a regular basis.  On the territory there are cafes and restaurants, gazebos with barbecue.  In winter, snowmobiles, sledges, skis, skates and a tubing slide are available for holidaymakers. </p><p>  Naturally, this is not the only park hotel in the suburbs.  In a beautiful place in the north-east of the <span>Moscow region</span> is the park-hotel SOFRINO (45 ha).  Once in this place was the estate of the family of Prince Gagarin.  Near the hotel there is a church, and most of the territory is occupied by an old park and a cascade of ponds.  It offers vacationers a large number of rooms and plenty of entertainment.  Therefore, you can have a wonderful rest, and without leaving the region, both a budget traveler and a wealthier one. </p>
