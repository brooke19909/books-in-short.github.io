Where and how much credit history is stored</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not all borrowers have an equal chance of getting a loan.  Those who previously delayed may forever lose the ability to receive borrowed funds.  Bad credit history is the reason why banks do not want to give out loans.  She can be a big problem.  To avoid difficulties in filling out an application, you should know the options for clearing your credit history in Russia.  Read more about this in the article. </p><h2>  What is a credit rating? </h2><p>  Credit history plays an important role in assessing the solvency of the borrower.  It reflects the degree of his responsibility. </p><p>  Information on loans is presented in the form of a rating with points.  The higher the score, the greater the chance of loan approval. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the credit history kept" class="if uuid-3265369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265369.jpg"></div><p>  Rating is individual.  It is assigned to the client after registration: </p><ol><li>  Mortgages. </li><li>  Loan. </li><li>  Loan. </li><li>  Credit cards or installment cards. </li><li>  Cards with overdraft. </li></ol><h2>  What affects credit history? </h2><p>  Not all credit customers understand the principle of rating formation.  Some payers are sure that 1-2 delays per month will not prevent them from taking a mortgage or a loan in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.  But they are wrong. </p><p>  Banks and MFIs transfer data on all arrears to the BKI, including repayment with a lag of 1-2 days.  Such breaches of the contract will not cause a refusal to grant a loan, but will affect the borrower's rating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Early repayment also slightly affects the credit history.  Banks lose profits if customers close their loans ahead of schedule.  Therefore, registration of early repayment is undesirable for those who already have arrears. </p><p>  When making payments on schedule, the active use of a credit card or installment plan, the history of the borrower will be close to ideal.  You can learn it for free: once a year the client has the opportunity to make a request to the BKI without a commission.  Repeated request will cost at least 390 rubles. </p><p>  Knowing what rating, the payer can search for options on how to clear credit history in Russia.  If you wish, you can correct the rating within 1-3 months. </p><h2>  Why fix the story? </h2><p>  Malicious defaulters have a bad credit history.  For those who always regularly contribute on schedule - excellent.  There is a separate category of citizens who did not take loans and did not draw up credit cards.  Their "characteristic" is zero or absent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fyi.extension.wisc.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix credit history for free" class="if uuid-3265355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265355.jpg"></div><p>  All payers want to know where the credit history is stored.  Banks are not authorized to disclose data from where they get information about the solvency of customers. </p><p>  Information about all payments on a loan, mortgage or credit card is transmitted to BKI - credit bureaus.  Banks and MFIs collaborate with one or several organizations at the same time, transferring data and requesting information about payers.  The largest BCI are: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  "National Bureau of Credit Histories." </li><li>  Equifax </li><li>  Infocredit. </li><li>  "Joint Credit Bureau". </li><li>  "Russian standard". </li></ol><h2>  How much credit history is stored in the BCI? </h2><p>  Information has been stored here for 15 years.  After which the credit history is "reset".  The shelf life is too long and does not suit those who allow for delays.  Therefore, such clients are looking for options on how to clear their credit history in Russia in order to take loans again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jmbaccounting.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean credit history in bk" class="if uuid-3265384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265384.jpg"></div><p>  BKI cannot correct the "characteristic" at the request of the client: such a service does not exist.  Companies offering these options are scammers. </p><h2>  Rating Correction Methods </h2><p>  To again get the opportunity to issue loans, the borrower must sequentially perform several procedures: </p><ol><li>  To issue and repay 3-5 loans in the amount of up to 15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Get rid of existing debts and delinquencies. </li><li>  Actively use a credit card or installment card. </li><li>  Refuse early repayment. </li></ol><h2>  Correction of credit history by loans </h2><p>  Since the borrower rating is formed by observing the terms of the loan agreement, to correct the history, it is best to take a new loan and repay it on time.  This is the easiest option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adamlevin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to clear your credit history for free" class="if uuid-3265379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265379.jpg"></div><p>  Loans with bad credit history give out 8 out of 10 online sites without failure.  In some companies, for example, Zaimer, there is a special loan to correct the "characteristics". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Advantages of the option: </p><ul><li>  information on the repayment of the loan is instantly transferred to the BKI; </li><li>  the client himself chooses on what terms to apply for a loan (you can use a special loan to "treat" your credit history, but MFIs with a high percentage of approval will also give ordinary loans to people with arrears); </li><li>  it is allowed to apply for loans in 2-3 MFIs at the same time (relevant for those who want to upgrade the rating within a month). </li></ul><p>  Loans are limited by the terms of the lender and the financial capabilities of the client.  In order not to aggravate the situation, it is not recommended to conclude agreements with more than 3 companies at the same time.  A delay in one of the MFIs will lead to an even greater downgrade and a possible refusal to issue online loans in the future. </p><p>  How to clear credit history in BCI using loans: </p><ol><li>  Contact an MFI with a low failure rate.  This is a lender who provides loans to customers with arrears and without references. </li><li>  Get your first loan for the minimum amount.  To correct the credit history, it is recommended to take a loan of 1-3 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Repay the loan on time, avoiding early repayment. </li><li>  Take a new loan with an amount in excess of the first loan.  An increase in the initial loan amount will increase loyalty and will indicate the solvency of the client. </li><li>  Pay off the secondary loan without delay. </li><li>  Repeat steps 4 and 5. <div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix a credit history after delinquency" class="if uuid-3265374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265374.jpg"></div></li></ol><p>  For the rating to increase, at least 3 loans issued and repaid on time are required.  The interval between the conclusion of contracts should not exceed 1 month. </p><h2>  Overdue repayment </h2><p>  Existing delinquencies of up to 97% reduce the chances of obtaining a loan.  Therefore, the first thing to do is pay them off.  Loans with bad credit history are issued without refusal to those who have repaid debts.  If the client has an outstanding fine or penalty under the payment agreement, it is recommended to get rid of them first. </p><p>  Banks are demanding of customers: it is impossible to get a loan to the borrower with delays.  MFIs issue loans to correct the ‚Äúcharacteristics‚Äù provided that the client makes payments on time.  Repayment of delinquencies is one of the options to clear the credit history in Russia legally.  All applicable penalties are taken into account.  Credit cards, mortgages or overdrafts are also considered. </p><h2>  Credit Card Rating Improvement </h2><p>  An option suitable for payers with zero or very bad credit history is the active use of credit cards or installment cards.  It is very easy!  Using a card, a client can solve the problem of how to fix a credit history for free.  The rating will increase, as will the loyalty of borrowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecollegeinvestor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much credit history is stored in BCI" class="if uuid-3265371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265371.jpg"></div><p>  To assess the benefits of the option, you need to use a credit card or installment plan during the grace period.  By credit card, it is from 20 to 100 days, depending on the bank.  AlfaBank offers credit cards with a period of up to 100 days, at Tinkoff - up to 55 days without interest, at Sberbank - up to and including 50. </p><p>  Within the grace period, the client can pay by card without interest.  If the owner repays the entire amount of the debt during the grace period, he will not have to pay a commission to the bank.  At the same time, the borrower's rating will grow, since payments during the grace period on a credit card are included in the analysis of the credit history. </p><p>  An installment card is attractive in that you can buy any product from partners and not pay interest for up to 12 months.  Each store, cafe or outlet has its own installment terms. </p><h2>  Refusal to make payments ahead of schedule </h2><p>  When applying for long-term loans, the client receives a payment schedule.  The payment method, annuity or differentiated, does not matter.  Early repayment of the loan allows you to pay off the creditor as soon as possible, but it partially violates the loan agreement. </p><p>  When making payments ahead of schedule, the balance of the main debt, on which the bank accrues interest, decreases.  This affects the amount of overpayment - interest on use.  Banks and MFIs have a negative attitude towards early payments, therefore, the client rating when depositing funds ahead of schedule is slightly reduced. </p><p>  One way to fix your credit history after delinquency is to refuse to make early payments.  Especially taken into account are loans issued for 1 year or more and repaid within 1-3 months from the date of receipt.  The next time a bank or MFI may refuse to grant a loan, as the lender is not interested in issuing a loan without interest. </p><h2>  Can I fix the rating for free? </h2><p>  Customers who previously made loan arrears sometimes were not able to make a payment.  Lack of funds was often associated with job loss, lower salaries, serious illness, or life difficulties. </p><p>  Such payers can not always afford to spend money on paying a commission for correcting the "characteristics".  But for them there is an option to clear credit history for free. </p><p>  Some MFIs offer new clients an online loan for free.  The terms of the promotion include obtaining a loan of up to 10 thousand rubles for a period not exceeding 2 weeks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bad credit loans" class="if uuid-3265353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3265353.jpg"></div><p>  In case of repayment of the loan at 0% during the specified period, the MFI does not require payment from the client, and his credit history will be improved.  In addition, the payer will be able to get a second loan on special conditions - for regular customers. </p><p>  Not all MFIs have a free loan, in addition, the borrower can take advantage of the offer only 1 time.  In case of delay, its rating will be lowered, and a microloan will require a return of credit funds, taking into account fines and interest on the use of funds. </p>
