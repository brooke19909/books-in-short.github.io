However, when the home is so tight that it resembles a thermos, then there can be no talk of any comfort.  Indoors, quality air exchange is required.  Old air, which contains a lot of carbon dioxide, should go away, making room for a new, fresh one.  Due to the disturbed air exchange in the room it becomes stuffy, the kitchen child spreads throughout the house, instead of weathering, and the humidity in the bathroom can increase so much that it is comparable to a steam bath.  Misted windows are the first sign of a lack of proper ventilation.  It is imperative to fight this, because as a result of the constant exposure to dampness, not only furniture and the interior suffer, but also human health.  To avoid this, a thoughtful and carefully planned ventilation installation system is required. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  There are currently three different types of ventilation systems: natural, forced and mixed.  In the latter case, some elements work forcefully.  It is worth considering all these types in more detail, having understood not only their device, but also the installation features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Natural ventilation is characterized by the fact that its operation does not require electricity, that is, it is autonomous.  A system of blowing and <span>ventilation ducts is</span> arranged in the room <span>.</span>  The difference in temperature and pressure at the beginning and at the end of the system creates a natural movement <span>of air masses,</span> which some call a "draft".  The installation system of ventilation of this type involves the use in the design of calculations to determine the optimal points for the inflow and outflow of air. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Natural ventilation has certain advantages, among which stand out: </p><ul><li>  the creation of natural conditions that are considered most suitable for a comfortable stay of a person indoors; </li><li>  autonomy; </li><li>  low cost of arrangement and subsequent maintenance; </li><li>  lack of details on which fungi will develop and multiply; </li><li>  natural movement of air masses, completely dependent on weather conditions. </li></ul>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Such a system also has certain disadvantages, among which one can single out the dependence on the natural weather conditions.  For example, often strong winds cause reverse thrust, which removes debris from the ventilation duct.  The movement of air in hot weather actually stops, since the normal functioning of natural ventilation remains possible only if the outdoor temperature is lower than in the room.  However, it is the natural ventilation installation system that is most suitable for providing the most comfortable conditions for a person to stay.  So you can exclude the risk of allergies, colds and colds and instability of blood pressure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Application features </h2><p>  Natural ventilation is used in residential buildings, both old and modern.  All high-rise buildings are equipped with ventilation ducts, which usually pass in the middle of a riser or apartment.  Through a vertical ventilation duct, the exhaust air goes up, that is, to the roof.  However, in the Soviet buildings, air inlets were not provided.  In theory, fresh air had to enter the room by means of a ventilation window, which was necessarily present on each window, or through small cracks in the frames.  The movement of air through wooden windows has a lot of positive qualities.  Natural recovery allows air to heat up even in winter, passing through windows. </p>

    <h2>  Health Check </h2><p>  So, the installation and installation of ventilation systems are carried out after checking the operability of the existing system.  If you notice the first signs of the natural ventilation stopping in the room, then you need to check and accurately identify the place where the problem occurred.  It does not hurt to check its performance more often, for prevention.  To do this, take a piece of paper 25 x 3 cm, bring it to the exhaust outlet in the room with windows and doors closed.  If a piece of paper has deviated to the ventilation hole and even stuck to it, then everything is fine, that is, the air flow is due to the cracks under the doors and windows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Forced ventilation </h2><p>  Normal operation of natural ventilation is not possible if certain rules are not followed.  Air ducts and air inlets must be on the outer wall, and an <span>exhaust</span> duct must be placed on the opposite.  The ventilation installation system allows you to position the supply valves in several places: </p><ul><li>  under the windowsill; </li><li>  in the upper or lower <span>window frame</span> ; </li><li>  in the wall next to the window. </li></ul><p>  Many modern models of plastic windows are already equipped with supply valves in the lower or upper part.  Usually they are equipped with a shutter and a filter, so their operation can be controlled.  Installation of the supply ventilation system can also be done by placing holes in the wall.  However, if the region is characterized by the severity of the winter climate, then this will be a source of icy air, because of which there is condensation on the wall, and sometimes frost.  The best option is to place the supply valve under the windowsill in close proximity to the heating radiator.  Air entering the room will heat up quite quickly.  Installation of heating and ventilation systems in this case should be carried out at the construction stage, that is, before the start of finishing work indoors. </p>

    <h2>  Forced ventilation </h2><p>  A distinctive feature of this solution is the use of electricity, which drives the installed fans.  Installation of ventilation and air conditioning systems in this case has certain features.  Forced movement can be organized in various ways: </p><ul><li>  monoblock solution for one room; </li><li>  monoblock system for the whole cottage; </li><li>  combined options that consist of air ducts in all rooms, filters, recuperators, fans, noise absorbers and other elements. </li></ul><p>  Such solutions are completely independent of weather conditions, since the pressure difference is formed artificially by means of fans.  There is no reverse thrust.  Filters are used to clean the air from various harmful impurities, and it can also be heated depending on weather conditions.  Installation of ventilation and air conditioning systems in this case is a much more difficult task, since it is necessary to draw up a plan for the placement of all elements at the design stage of the structure. </p><h2>  Features of forced ventilation </h2><p>  The disadvantages of such a system are not only the high cost of development, creation, installation and subsequent operation, but also the fact that most of the elements of such a system serve as a breeding ground for bacteria.  It is impossible to clean them daily, and the air passes through them constantly, transferring all sorts of bacteria to the room.  <span>Installation of an exhaust ventilation system</span> in this case brings only negative moments for people in the form of allergies, asthma and frequent SARS. </p>

    <h2>  Scope of use of forced ventilation </h2><p>  However, in some situations it is impossible to do without using such a solution.  For example, in large rooms, characterized by a significant influx of people, where there is a need for a large influx of air.  Installation of an industrial ventilation system is required in industrial premises, classrooms, gyms, train stations and other places where there is a need to provide people with large masses of fresh air. </p><p>  The application of such solutions has become popular in large country houses.  For example, the installation of an industrial ventilation system, in particular, openings for the inflow or intake of air, can be done directly above the place where there is a massive concentration of people.  It can be a sofa in the living room, a smoking room or some other place.  It‚Äôs easier to use houses with natural ventilation, except for cases when the structure is too tight. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The ventilation installation system is a complex task that requires a whole range of activities.  The result is an effective solution that can work for many years.  The choice of a particular type of ventilation, that is, natural, forced or mixed, depends on many factors that must be taken into account by professionals in the development process.  The owners of the building can only express their preferences regarding the appearance of future structures, as well as how the installed system should work.  An important point is the design of the visible elements of ventilation and air conditioning, which should also be taken care of in order to create a complete harmonious interior. </p>
