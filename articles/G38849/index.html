Prior to that, the manufacturer of smartphones in the arsenal had phones with much simpler characteristics.  However, even at the time of their release they were quite advanced in comparison with what was present on the market. </p><p>  Today we‚Äôll talk about just one of the earliest touch phones released by Nokia.  It's about the <span>5230 Nokia.</span>  <span>The characteristics of the</span> device, as well as customer reviews about it, will be given below.  In the meantime, we give a general description of what this model of the legendary mobile Finnish company is. </p><h2>  general description </h2>

    <p>  Immediately after its release, the model was positioned as an innovative solution, but very soon it became a typical representative of the budget class of the company's products.  If you believe the data in the Internet media, the phone was released in 2009 at a price of 149 euros - for the simple version, and 225 euros - for the device with the additional Nokia Comes With Music service.  If we talk about official sales in our country, only the more expensive Nokia 5230 model could be found in stores.  The characteristic of the service shows that this is a musical addition that gave the user access to listening to their favorite music.  Again, at the time of the presentation of the device, its functions were quite new. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Since, as already noted above, the Nokia 5230 model (the characteristics confirm this) is a relatively budget option, it is not surprising that it was offered on the market in a plastic case.  However, as shown by customer recommendations, the material here is quite pleasant to the touch, which leaves a positive impression. </p><p>  The Nokia 5230 device, the characteristics of which we present at the moment, comes on the market in several variations.  They differ among themselves depending on which panel we are talking about.  The front of the phone is available on the market in black and white, while the back is decorated with black, red, pink, blue or light green cover - the choice of the buyer.  Such a variety definitely allows you to personalize your phone ‚Äúfor yourself‚Äù, which will clearly appeal to a young audience of users of the Nokia 5230 model. </p><p>  The characteristic of all mobile phones includes a description of the display of the smartphone in question.  Our article is not an exception in this regard, so we will also describe the sensor that Nokia used back in 2009 in the production of the 5230 series. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  So, it‚Äôs worth mentioning right away - the screen here, like on old keyboard smartphones, belongs to the TFT type.  Its resolution is only 360x640 pixels, which looks ridiculous compared to modern devices.  The sensor on this model is installed resistive, so there will be problems with simultaneously pressing several points on the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As the manufacturer‚Äôs specifications say about the Nokia 5230, the display sizes are not that big - the diagonal is only 3.2 inches.  Today, of course, there are not so many smartphones with such small displays, but in 2009, almost all popular games could be clearly seen on the screen of the 5230 model. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  Given the age of the device, the technical equipment here is also difficult to call advanced - there is a processor with a frequency of 434 MHz, which has a RAM of 128 megabytes.  Although this is not much, the phone was able to play the games of that time.  Developers, by the way, judging by the reviews, quite qualitatively optimized the Nokia 5230. </p><p>  The characteristics of the WiFi module are not mentioned, for this reason we conclude that such a function is not provided here.  But the device supports mobile Internet.  In addition, Nokia has a physical memory of 78 MB (with the possibility of increasing it due to a memory card). </p>

    <p>  It is also important to mention the camera on the phone that this review is dedicated to.  Of course, the resolution in it is not large enough to photograph the text (only 2 megapixels);  but already this was a good achievement at that time for the Nokia 5230. </p><p>  The characteristic of the camera is nothing compared to the accelerometer - an option that allows you to determine the position of the device in space.  It is very often used, as we know, in games and applications. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  By the way, regarding the software and OS for the model - of course, not modern Android or iOS is installed here.  The model is Symbian 9.4, which coped relatively well with the tasks set for Nokia 5230. The GPS feature shows that the device is capable of receiving a signal at 20 stations with the A-GPS option connected.  Thanks to such an OS, a large number of entertainment content was already available on the Internet at that time.  Thus, it is impossible to say that a device that does not work on Android or iOS is capable of anything. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding the recommendations, they, as always, can be divided into positive and negative, coming from customers with different requirements and the style of use of the device.  For example, there are those who claim that a mobile phone is cheap and convenient, simple and practical;  It has a powerful battery, a bright display and a sturdy case.  Some users call the model a cheap option for a simple but functional smartphone. </p><p>  The negative aspects include some ‚Äúdevelopment restrictions‚Äù associated with the lack of a module for Wi-Fi reception, an outdated operating system that new applications are not released for, and the lack of a flash under the camera.  Regarding 5230 Nokia, the customer testimonial indicates the presence of periodic device freezes during the execution of more complex tasks and the not-so-obedient sensor.  However, even with these problems you can come to terms, because the phone is really reliable in every sense of the word. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Of course, the Nokia 5230 model can not be compared with modern budget phones for the reason that it was released back in 2009.  However, even this does not stop finding reviews with admiration for this model, dated 2012, 2013 and 2014 - 5 years after the sale of the device.  This is obviously the best indicator of what the phone was. </p>
