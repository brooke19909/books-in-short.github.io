  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting facts about animals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thousands of species of animals live on our planet, each of which is unique and amazing.  They are an integral part of the Earth‚Äôs ecosystem.  To date, more than 100,000 species of mammals, birds, insects, fish, etc., have been studied, and a wide variety of interesting facts about animals have been collected.  However, much remains to be learned. </p><p>  There are such interesting facts about animals that many are not even aware of.  However, we must know more about our smaller brothers, because we have a common planet.  Some species are threatened with extinction, and humanity must find ways to preserve them. </p><p>  Below are some unusual <span>interesting facts about animals that</span> are hard to believe, but they are all nonetheless scientifically confirmed. </p><p>  So, let's begin. </p><p>  Despite its name, anteaters prefer to eat termites. </p><p>  Deer do not have a gall bladder. </p><p>  A female sea crocodile lays eggs at night.  At the same time, she enters a state similar to trance and does not pay attention to what is happening around. </p><p>  You will never find two tigers with the same stripes. </p><p>  <span>A starfish</span> can live forever until it becomes ill or an accident occurs with it. </p><p>  The highest of all mammals on Earth is a giraffe. </p><p>  <span>Elephant tusks are</span> made up of dentin, the same substance from which human teeth are formed. </p><p>  Dolphins sleep with one eye open. </p><p>  Ants have no lungs, and they never sleep. </p><p>  The language of the <span>blue whale is</span> so large that about 50 adult men can stand on it. </p><p>  The only animal in the world that can never jump is an elephant. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The heart of the shrimp is located in her head. </p><p>  The only fish that blinks with both eyes at the same time is a shark. </p><p>  The ostrich's eyes are larger than his brain. </p><p>  If a goldfish lives for a long time in dim lighting, it turns white. </p><p>  Shark and beam fish are the only species that never get cancer. </p><p>  Birds use gravity to swallow food.  Without gravity, they choke on eating. </p><p>  The bee has hairs in her eyes that help her collect pollen. </p><p>  Lions can mate more than 50 times a day. </p><p>  The only mammals that can fly are bats. </p><p>  Jaguar is not so brave - he is afraid of dogs. </p><p>  The goldfish has an excellent memory: it can be taught to remember the way out of the maze for up to one month, and also press the levers for food. </p><p>  A snail can slide on a sharp razor without harming itself due to the mucus it produces. </p><p>  The loudest sound among animals can reproduce a <span>blue whale</span> (188 decibels) - it can be recorded at a distance of up to 800 kilometers. </p><p>  Only a chameleon can see in two opposite directions at a time, because its eyes can move independently of each other. </p><p>  Some species of frogs can be frozen to a solid state, then thawed, and still continue to live. </p><p>  Snails can sleep for three years. </p><p>  Butterflies use their legs to discern odors. </p><p>  Not all <span>interesting animals of the</span> world are mentioned here.  A huge number of amazing facts about the animals surrounding us are known.  Some do not even suspect that the most striking is sometimes nearby.  Take at least our pets.  Some interesting facts about pets will be news to you. </p><p>  Dogs and cats, like humans, can be either left-handed or right-handed. </p><p>  Chow Chow is the only dog ‚Äã‚Äãthat does not have a pink color on its tongue. </p><p>  There are more than 32 muscles in the cat‚Äôs ear. </p><p>  The smartest dog in the world is a border collie. </p><p>  A cat's mustache helps her determine if there is enough space to go through. </p><p>  Cats can hear ultrasound. </p><p>  The world of fauna is very vast and diverse, some interesting facts about animals are so unusual that it is difficult for a person to believe in them.  Our duty is to help preserve all the diversity of the animal world.  After all, our planet will not be so beautiful without our smaller brothers! </p>
