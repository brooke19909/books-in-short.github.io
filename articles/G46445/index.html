    <h2>  The location of the hotel.  How to get to the Belarus Hotel </h2><p>  The prestigious resort of Krasnaya Polyana lies at an altitude of eight hundred meters above sea level between the Caucasian mountain ranges Achishchkho and Aibgi.  And just 75 kilometers down the road, the Black Sea splashes and the city of Sochi shines with lights.  Krasnaya Polyana (Hotel Belarus is located in the heart of the ski resort) has its own railway station.  It is called Estosadok.  From her to the hotel "Belarus" to go a maximum of ten minutes.  And the <span>Adler station</span> and <span>Sochi</span> international <span>airport</span> lie from Krasnaya Polyana at a distance of forty-five kilometers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the hotel is quite easy on the high-speed train "Swallow".

    <h2>  Spa Hotel Belarus (Krasnaya Polyana) </h2><p>  How to get to the resort, we have already told.  Now it's time to tell about the hotel itself.  It is relatively new and was built in 2006.  This hotel is one of the few in Krasnaya Polyana that welcomes tourists all year round.  Snow has not yet really descended from the Caucasian slopes, and already tourists come to Belarus to climb the peaks and enjoy the powerful waterfalls. </p><p>  And in summer, an outdoor pool with a sunbathing area is open for guests.  During the construction of the Belarus complex, the administration resorted to the services of an experienced landscape designer who built a miracle park in a relatively small area.  From early spring to late autumn, the garden delights guests with flowering.  The hotel consists of two multi-storey buildings with three and four stars, stylized as alpine chalets.  There are nine more detached cottages equipped with everything necessary for a good rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SPA hotel Belarus Krasnaya Polyana" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1214274.jpg" width="600"></div>
