It was opened back in 1969.  The palace belongs to a large sports complex. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Many people know that most of the major sports facilities in Moscow were built on the eve of the famous 1980 Olympics.  But here we are talking about an exception.  The Sports Palace AZLK Moskvich began to be erected long before this event - back in the 1960s.  It was intended for workers of a famous automobile factory. </p>
