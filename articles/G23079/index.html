Then you need to know what the weather awaits you.  Are you sure that in May everywhere is good?  This is partly true.  May is exactly the month when it is beautiful even in a gassed metropolis with a dull industrial landscape.  But in China, great importance is attached to the aesthetic environment, as well as healthy energy.  Therefore, in May there is doubly beautiful.  In this article, we will review the conditions for a vacation in China in the last month of spring.  There are two points to make here.  First: China is a very large country.  Its territory lies in different climatic regions.  And if somewhere the last breath of winter is still felt, real summer reigns in other regions.  The second caveat is that May belongs to the offseason.  So, the first and second half of the month differ from each other in temperature indicators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="To China in May" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is attractive about vacation in China at the end of spring </h2><p>  Statistics show that Russians have a thirst for travel, not only in the summer, but also in May.  This is facilitated by a series of days off in the first ten days of the month.  Those Russians who live in the European part of Russia flock mainly to the Krasnodar Territory.  And the Siberians choose China for a short vacation.  The weather in May in this country is ideal for traveling.  In almost the entire territory, except for the north and mountainous regions, comfortable temperature conditions are established.  Long daylight hours, not cold and not hot, lush flowering plants - all this makes the rest very comfortable.  You can make excursions without fear of dying from the heat or getting wet under a prolonged rainfall.  The Chinese, like the Russians, celebrate many holidays in May.  They are very exotic - with crackers, fireworks, colorful processions.  All of the above contributes to the fact that May <span>tours in China are</span> very popular.  If you have planned a vacation for this month, you should take care of buying airline tickets in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China holidays in may" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857505.jpg" width="600"></div>

Beijing and Harbin </h2><p>  As mentioned above, China is not only the most densely populated country in the world, but also the largest in Asia.  Therefore, it is not surprising that different regions present a striking contrast in climatic terms.  For example, in the north of the country, in areas bordering Russia, it is still cool.  In Udalyanchi, the average air temperature at the end of spring is + 18 degrees, and in Harbin - + 20 C. Therefore, going to China in May, you need to grab a jacket or a warm sweater.  But what will be superfluous in the northern regions is an umbrella.  In a month, only a couple of short rains can pass.  The risk of typhoons, dust storms and other troubles that can overshadow the vacation, the most minimal.  In the capital of the country the same clear weather reigns.  Only the air in Beijing warms up more.  In the afternoon, the temperature reaches + 26 degrees.  But the mornings and evenings are still fresh, so the lightweight jumper doesn't fit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China weather in May" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857359.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  May is the most favorable month for climbing Mount Everest.  Although the highest peak on the planet is in Nepal, many climbers arrive in China to begin their journey.  In May, Tibet warms day by day.  The mountain sun is very aggressive, so you should stock up on protective cream and take dark glasses.  But the temperature regime proves that winter has not yet left the highlands.  In Lhasa, the air warms up to + 14 in the afternoon, but when the sun sets, the real cold begins.  A completely different weather in Urumqi.  There, the average monthly temperature is 20 degrees.  Travelers traveling to Tibet must have warm winter clothes in their luggage.  But in the foothills real summer reigns.  May there is scarce rains.  The air warms up in Xi'an to 29 degrees, and in Luoyang - to thirty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China holidays in may" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857384.jpg" width="545"></div>

After all, this month, when everything blooms and smells, is ideal for a visit to nature reserves and national parks.  And there are a great many of them in the country.  Their concentration is especially high in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.  Low, but very picturesque mountain ranges, waterfalls, crystal clear lakes will not leave anyone indifferent.  The most popular, especially after the release of the movie "Avatar", is the Zhanjiajie National Nature Park.  It was his landscapes that became the set for the planet Pandora.  The rains in May in this region are also quite small.  The month will be favorable for those who go to look at the Great Wall of China.  The air at this time has not yet completely warmed up.  There is no haze and the horizon is visible for many kilometers. </p><h2>  Central China </h2><p>  Holidays in May in this region will be varied.  In this region, as well as in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the warming preceding summer sets in.  However, the climate in Central China is sharply continental.  The lower atmosphere under the influence of hot sunlight warms up to + 27 degrees.  People wear summer shorts and sundresses.  Everything changes with the sunset.  Dry air cools very quickly.  At midnight, the thermometer drops to + 13 degrees.  Therefore, if you are going to Chongqing, Wuhan or Nanjing, you need to pack the most diverse wardrobe in your suitcase - from summer tops and shorts to a warm jacket.  But sharply continental climate also reduces the chance of precipitation.  Shanghai, although it belongs to the central region of China, but still lies on the coast.  Therefore, it rains in this city.  True, they are short-lived.  The thermometer column here also does not make sharp jumps.  During the day in Shanghai + 23, and at night - + 15 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China Hainan in May" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857502.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  South China  Hainan in May </h2><p>  The territory of China is so huge that the extreme south of the country lies already in the tropical zone.  Most Russians know only one place for a beach holiday in China - Hainan Island.  It lies at the same latitude as Hawaii.  So, the holiday season there is already in full swing.  And if the sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãChina in other regions of the country has not warmed up in May (or rather, its temperature is +20 degrees), then water off Hainan‚Äôs coast is like fresh milk.  In shallow bays its temperature is + 26-28 degrees.  The beginning of May is the best time for divers.  And those who just want to sunbathe on a white sand and swim in the warm sea will be comfortable.  However, it should be remembered that May is the last month of the tourist season in Hainan.  Powerful tropical showers, lasting several days in a row, can come a week or two earlier.  The sea also becomes a storm during this period.  A gale of wind, dense clouds and high humidity can overshadow your vacation.  Therefore, you should not plan a trip to Hainan at the end of May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China Sea in May" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays and festivals </h2><p>  As in other countries, China celebrates Labor Day on a grand scale.  On May 1, all cities are full of red flags and banners.  Concerts and festivals are held everywhere.  May 4 is marked with equal enthusiasm for Chinese Youth Day.  People recall the events of 1919, when student rallies laid the foundation for modern democracy in the country.  On May 4, interesting performances, large-scale processions, theatrical street performances take place.  But these two events are not the final list of red dates that China marks.  Holidays in May followed in this country in a continuous series.  The Canton Southeast Asian Trade Forum is held in Guangzhou.  Especially large-scale is Mother's Day, which falls on the second Sunday of May.  Everyone who has a living parent should give them some gift.  And on the streets of the cities morning parties are arranged with refreshments.  In the fourth lunar month (this date ‚Äúfloats‚Äù in May) near Lhasa, an amazing mystery of Cham unfolds in the monastery of Tshurpu.  Those interested in Buddhist spirituality can enjoy the dance of Lam masks.  And if you are an avid athlete, you can take part in a marathon race along the Great Wall of China section.  This event takes place annually on the third Saturday of May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China may reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1857388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited China at the end of spring were satisfied with their vacation.  With the exception of the extreme south, where tropical showers are already highly likely, the weather in the country is warm and cloudless.  The last month of spring is favorable for those who cannot sit still.  The temperature is set ideal for excursions.  Do not be afraid to go to South China in <span>May.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> assure that the price of tours is already reduced, and the rainy season has not yet begun.  Therefore, in Sanya or another resort in Hainan, you can spend unforgettable two weeks in the first half of the month. </p>
