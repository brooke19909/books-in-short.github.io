His biography is full of secrets, and is not even thoroughly known to professional historians.  It is only clear that the basic facts of his life were fixed on paper by his own students, who were in different parts of the world.  The biography of Pythagoras is summarized by us in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pythagoras biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/321673.jpg" width="353"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of life </h2><p>  The biography of Pythagoras begins in 570 (an approximate date), in the city of Sidon (now Saida, Lebanon).  He was born into the family of a wealthy jeweler who was able to give the best education and knowledge to his son.  An interesting fact is the origin of the name of the future sage.  His father, Mnesarchus, named his son in honor of one of the priestesses of Apollo, Pythia.  He also named his wife, Pythasis, in honor of her.  And it all happened because it was this priestess who predicted to Mnesarchus that he would have a son who would surpass every other person both in beauty and in his mind. </p><h2>  First knowledge and teachers </h2><p>  The early years of the scientist, as the biography of Pythagoras narrates, took place within the walls of the best temples of Greece.  As a teenager, he tried to learn as much as possible by reading the works of other sages, as well as conversing with spiritual teachers.  Among them, it is worth highlighting the Herekis of Syros, the greatest ancient Greek cosmologist.  He helps the young Pythagoras to study mathematics, physics, astronomy.  Pythagoras also fell in fellowship with Hermodamantus, who taught him to love poetry and everything related to art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pythagoras biography" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/321675.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cognitive Travel </h2><p>  In subsequent years, the biography of Pythagoras consists of his life experience already on foreign lands.  First he goes to Egypt, where he plunges into the local mystery.  Later in this country, he opens his own school, where he could study mathematics and philosophy.  In the 20 years that he spent in Egypt, he gathered a lot of disciple supporters who called themselves Pythagoreans.  It is also worth noting that during this period he introduces such a concept as a philosopher, and calls himself this word.  The fact is that before all the great people called themselves sages, which meant "knows."  Pythagoras introduced the term "philosopher", which translated as "trying to find out." </p><p>  After his scientific discoveries that were made in Egypt, Pythagoras goes to Babylon, where he spends 12 years.  There he studies Oriental religions, their features, compares the development of science and art in the countries of Mesopotamia and Greece.  After that, he returns to the Eastern Mediterranean, only now - on the shores of Phenicia and Syria.  He spends quite a bit of time there, and after that he re-embarks on a journey, only already more distant.  Crossing the country of Achimenides and Media, the philosopher finds himself in Hindustan.  Gaining knowledge about a completely different religion and way of life, he further broadens his horizons, which gives him the opportunity to make new discoveries in science. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pythagoras biography briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/321674.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <h2>  Pythagoras biography: his last years </h2><p>  In 530 BC  Pythagoras is in Italy, where he opens a new school called the Pythagorean Union.  Only those who have enough knowledge behind them can study there.  In the lessons at this institution, Pythagoras tells his students about the secrets of astronomy, teaches mathematics, geometry, and harmony.  At the age of 60, he marries one of his students, and they have three children. </p><p>  Around 500 BC  in relation to the Pythagoreans, persecution begins.  As the story goes, they were connected with the fact that the philosopher himself chose not to take the son of one respected citizen among his students.  After numerous riots, he disappeared. </p>
