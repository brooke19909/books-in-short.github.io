With their help, the leaders of large companies and organizations increase the effectiveness of activities in a competitive environment, and creative groups stimulate extraordinary thought processes.  There are many ways and practical methods for implementing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa non-trivial approach to solving problems - from the classic brainstorming to the technique of six hats.  Recently, another method has become popular - synectics, the effectiveness of which has long been proven in practice.  A feature of this technique is the ability to use various techniques, the totality of which expands the boundaries of the search for original solutions. </p>

    <h2>  General Syntectic Information </h2><p>  The author of the method is William Gordon, who actively worked on improving the brainstorming technique in the early 1950s.  The result of the scientist‚Äôs work was the synectic approach to solving problems.  This word means "connection of different elements", which reflects the peculiarity of this method.  Although the method of synectics refers to methods of activating creative skills, it is used in various fields, including even industrial enterprises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first acquaintance with the technique may make a wrong opinion about it as an accessible technique.  In fact, it requires complex organization and serious preparation from the participants of the synectic group.  It should also be noted that synectics solves specific problems and does not involve the use of patterns in the development of different systems.  As already noted, this technique is based on the <span>brainstorming method.</span>  To be more precise, it presents its modified version, designed for professionals. </p>

    <h2>  The social significance of the method </h2><p>  Studies show that modern companies and organizations are governed by certain laws that determine their policies.  Often, strict adherence to a particular course does not allow the use and even consideration of ways to solve problems that could increase the effectiveness of activities, but contradict the charter.  Often, the adopted rules and regulations really reflect reality and work for the good.  But there are also reverse cases when corporate laws are represented by nothing more than a set of habits from the past.  In turn, innovative ideas are able to change the situation without destructive processes from the inside, the main thing is to use the method correctly.  Synectics, even at lower management levels, can achieve good results in the decision-making process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The essence of the method </h2><p>  In practice, this method is implemented on the basis of the principles of analogy.  That is, to solve the problem, experience is taken from another sphere in which a similar problem has already been resolved.  To illustrate this approach, we can give an example that was decided by the Gordon group.  The creator of the method was faced with the task of how to put the chips into the packaging with the greatest compactness so that they would not crumble at the same time.  The way out was found with the help of analogy, which demonstrated the essence of the method of synectics as a way of comparison.  The scientist's group used the principle of bagging leaves, which at the same time retained their structure because they were wet.  In the case of chips, special molding and flour wetting technology were used, which saved space in the package.  This is how the famous Pringle brand appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Creation of a synectic collective </h2><p>  The process of forming members of the group that will implement the method involves several stages.  At the first stage, testing of potential participants of the synectic event is carried out.  During the tests, general erudition, educational level, flexibility of thinking, experience in participating in various experiments are determined.  Tests for specialized knowledge, which determines the specific purpose of the methods of synectics in a certain area, may be required.  For example, in construction tasks, knowledge of architecture may be required, and in the food industry, chemistry.  Then the group members are trained.  It is worth noting that in the West this method is actively used in various directions, therefore, training centers on synectics are quite common.  The final stage is the introduction of a prepared group into a real environment for working on a task. </p>

    <h2>  Method implementation procedure </h2><p>  Like any other method of generating new ideas, synectics provides for several phases of work on a task.  To begin with, in order to maintain the abstractness of thinking, a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe problem is given without specifying the requirements for the result.  Then the problem is subdivided into several simplified parts, after which the group works on an independent search for possible problems and ways to solve them. </p><p>  It is important to note that in this phase, the participants are dealing with the problem in the form in which they understand it, that is, without clarification.  At the main stage, solving problems by the method of synectics involves considering analogies that are closest to the problem posed.  This phase completes the decision on the choice of analogy, and a comparison of the <span>solved problem</span> from another sphere and the problem is carried out.  It is worth emphasizing the important difference between this approach and the classical method of brainstorming.  In the case of synectics, criticism of the proposed idea by experts is also provided, as well as bringing the solution to practice. </p>

    <h2>  Synthesis Operating Mechanisms </h2><p>  Participants in synectic groups have to work with a wide range of tools, including operational mechanisms.  In particular, it can be a game with metaphors, in which, again, analogies are used that are similar to the problem posed.  Usually among the main goals of such work is the transformation of a friend into an unfamiliar.  In other words, the framework and barriers are being removed, which makes the method more efficient.  Synectics makes it possible to comprehend the problem in a new form and from an unusual point of view.  It is noteworthy that it is impossible to teach psychological tools.  Mechanisms such as playing with intuition suggest that each person can use them on a conscious level. </p>

    <h2>  Types of analogies in synectics </h2><p>  Analogies are a key mechanism that provides a synectic result.  There are several types of this tool, including direct, fantastic, personal and symbolic comparisons. </p><p>  Direct analogies suggest that a third-party object will be as similar as possible in certain properties to the subject of the task.  Personal analogies set the goal of a search based on one‚Äôs own impressions, emotions, memories, etc. The symbolic method of analogies is also popular.  In this case, synectics requires the participants to express the problem through the language of metaphors and symbols.  In the process of such searches, the object is transferred from the real world to a system of abstract concepts.  The method using fantastic analogies has similar features.  Participants endow objects with special properties and qualities, which also makes it possible to more effectively solve assigned tasks. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Synectics </h2><p>  The advantages of the method include its versatility, efficiency compared to alternative methods of development of abstract thinking, as well as the improvement of individual qualities, including intuition and imagination.  Also, synectics is one of the methods of activating thinking, which provides for critical assessments in the preparation of the result, which increases the quality of experts' work.  If we talk about the cons, the main one will be complexity.  Although the tools and mechanisms of the technique seem simple, organizing synectics on a professional level is a rather complex undertaking. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The basic principles of synectics involve the use of various means of developing imagination and thinking.  And the very nature of this technique does not exclude its improvement.  To date, there are several directions in which the method is developing.  Synthesis in the simplest models is available for implementation by one person who, through the same analogies, finds at least original and new <span>ways to solve problems.</span>  Another thing is that the effectiveness of this approach will be low.  The traditional approach to synectics nevertheless presupposes group work on a problem in which criticism of sentences is not excluded. </p>
