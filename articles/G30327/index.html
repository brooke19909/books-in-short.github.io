    <h2>  Why do you need a foreign ‚Äúpayment‚Äù? </h2><p>  If you are an entrepreneur, you have probably come across a situation where your partner from abroad (for example, from some country of the European Union) sends you a cash payment in an envelope, after having invested a personal check there.  You are truly lucky if you avoided the very notorious headache.  In practice, such transfers most often occur with a bunch of annoying interference.  Either the check disappears mysteriously somewhere without reaching its addressee, or the payment takes so long that you are ready to curse everything in the world.  What can we say about the high cost of bank transfers and the accompanying paperwork!  After all, the bank may, on completely legitimate grounds, ask you to provide a copy of the contract (otherwise it simply will not credit the money).  This will entail the need to do the same thing through intermediaries (and again, annoying expenses - commission, etc.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And plus to all this, the tax inspectorate will descend like snow on the head with endless "amenities" in the form of fines, questions or even worse.  Forget about all these ordeals - the Payoneer LLC payment service, reviews of which are presented in this article, is guaranteed to take care of all these issues. </p>

    <h2>  How to start working with the system? </h2><p>  Before you start registering with Payoneer, you need to briefly outline the main points regarding the sources of earnings that are most suitable for this payment system.  Payment on PayoneerMastercard (reviews of which are only positive) is carried out in two main areas of work: </p><p>  1. Remuneration of <span>freelancers (freelance</span> - remote work) by transferring funds to a Payoneer card. </p><p>  2. Payment to a Payoneer card, but already for participation in various investment hype projects. </p><h2>  Freelance </h2><p>  Today, no one doubts that the Internet is not only the main source of information in the world, but also an infinitely huge labor market.  More and more people who want to work and earn money find their vocation in freelance.  By the way, Russia, along with other countries of the Commonwealth, is among the top ten in terms of the number of people employed in freelance.  To make sure of this, you just need to go to any of the resources specializing in remote work from your home computer (Net-Translators, iStock, Freelance, Fiverr and many others). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will be pleasantly surprised to see how many of your fellow citizens have devoted themselves to this type of activity.  Freelance exchanges gathered a wide variety of categories of the population, because this type of earnings is available to absolutely everyone.  Here you will meet schoolchildren, retirees, and young mothers who, for obvious reasons, can work only without leaving home, and people who, because of their ill health, prefer to work in a home environment.  In addition, here everyone earns as he can. </p>

    <p>  Such resources are an invaluable opportunity for any person to prove themselves and express their skills and talents.  These are artists, and programmers, and designers, and translators, and IT-technology experts, and other representatives of a wide variety of professions.  But one thing unites them - the desire to prove themselves, to show their uniqueness and to prove that you can make money on it.  They have at their disposal a countless number of interesting projects and a whole army of employers.  Salaries are translated either in euros or in United States dollars.  And this is another argument confirming the benefits of remote work.  And that is why the services of OOO Payoneer are so relevant, reviews of which can be found more often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Investment </h2><p>  If it‚Äôs more convenient and convenient for you to make investments in Russian and foreign projects, as well as in their referral programs, then it‚Äôs quite troublesome to get the income from the investment on the cards of banks of the country of residence.  And above, a sufficient number of arguments were given (loss of a personal check, bank refusal to charge funds, tax audit, etc.), convincing that it is more convenient and convenient to just use a Payoneer card.  Feedback on this feature is extremely positive. </p>

    <p>  Everything is extremely simple.  You receive a Payoneer card, bind it to the created billing account and receive dividends acquired by overwork. </p><p>  Well, another nuance: if you interact with partners from the United States or the European Union, you can‚Äôt avoid contacts with billing systems (they are engaged in servicing payment systems (accepting payments, etc.). You need to register on the world famous PayPal platform. the largest debit payment system currently existing in the world, and perhaps one of the most reliable, Payoneer fully manages this electronic money. </p><p>  Billings are used mainly by foreign trading floors.  The most famous among them is 2Checkout, created by the USA. </p><h2>  What kind of payment service is this? </h2><p>  As already noted, Payoneer is a corporation from the United States, created in the mid-zero years.  The headquarters of the corporation is located in New York.  The service consists of the INC list and the list of corporations in the financial services market.  The payment system has a wide range of services, having everything from transferring to a Payoneer card.  The work, reviews of which are so positive, is fully operational. </p>

    <p>  Opening an account will be an action that will not cause any problems and difficulties.  Using this account, you can use your own funds, which will come to the Payoneer service.  User reviews also report that accounts in euros and dollars are opened according to a completely different principle and separately from the main one. </p><p>  As already noted, the corporation is located in the United States, so it can be judged that it meets international standards.  If in doubt, then look at the reviews of customers of this company - your doubts should disappear immediately, so you should not doubt the legality of this system.  At present, Payoneer representative offices work in different countries.  Russia is among them. </p><h2>  Bank card from the payment system and account features </h2><p>  The service offers a card from MasterCard.  This payment tool is recognized both in stores and at various sites.  You can withdraw earned money from ATM ATMs, which are definitely in any big city.  If you have a dollar card, and you want to exchange it for an instrument in euros, you have the right to receive a secondary one.  Funds received on the card become active up to 2 hours after the transfer.  It is about this, as a great advantage, that numerous Payoneer reviews report. </p>

    <p>  Upon completion of registration, you have full access to your account.  To get started, having a card is not a prerequisite, since the system has a built-in function to transfer money to any account. </p><h2>  Currency operations </h2><p>  After receiving the card, you get opportunities such as taking money at a terminal or bank, paying for services at Payoneer.  Reviews in 2016 often affect such a system option as the possibility of transactions in dollars and euros.  This service provides an opportunity to make transfers in different currencies.  If you make payments in dollars, you are inside the local American banking system.  If you use the euro, then you, accordingly, make transactions within the European system.  To gain access to this area, you must fill out a questionnaire and upload a document to confirm your identity.  In fact, there is no difficulty in this, which is also noted by reviews of OOO Payoneer. </p><h2>  Beneficial differences and potential of Payoneer </h2><p>  The service work is very well established.  All reviews indicate a comfortable and effective option for receiving payments in the case of work with American and European services and partners.  Moreover, for all payers this is a familiar format of bank payments.  The cost of Payoneer services for this year is only $ 29.95.  No prepayment is required, the money will be withdrawn from the card account as soon as they appear on it.  Another plus is the absence of commission penalties.  There is also a nice bonus of $ 25 from Payoneer (when crediting the first hundred dollars to the card), in which case you will spend only $ 5 for annual maintenance. </p><p>  All incoming finances to the Payoneer MasterCard (reviews on the convenience of which are listed above) immediately go to its account, they can be withdrawn at any ATM.  There are no any intermediate operations with crediting money to the balance with further transfer to the card. </p><h2>  Payoneer system: work, user reviews </h2><p>  The card of the payment system is equally used in online and offline payments.  It is accepted by such large trading resources as Aliexpress, ebay, Amazon, as well as payment systems such as Skrill and Paypal.  This card can be used without problems in all services and online stores.  You can withdraw money from any ATM where you accept MasterCard cards anywhere in the world. </p><p>  The debit card holder does not run the risk of getting into debt.  According to reviews, it is impossible to exceed the limit ‚Äî only that amount of money that is on the card account will be spent.  The mechanism for withdrawing funds to an account in a local bank is intelligibly and clearly thought out. </p>

    <p>  Owners of Payoneer accounts can transfer money for free and deposit to each other's account, within two hours they become available on the card. </p><p>  In case of loss of the card or its theft, the owner can quickly and without additional problems replace it.  The card will be delivered to him free of charge by DHL service anywhere in our planet in two to three days, with the transfer of all finances to a new account.  All these advantages also list the reviews written about Payoneer.  Russia began to use such services relatively recently, but Russian-speaking users immediately noticed their positive aspects. </p><h2>  Security guarantees </h2><p>  The use of advanced security technologies in the Payoneer system ensures compliance with strict requirements in the field of protecting confidential customer information.  Similarly, technologies are used to protect the authentication system and verify compliance. </p><p>  With the OOO Payoneer system, reviews of which are so highly rated, the user will not have problems with the tax service both at home and abroad.  This is because the money that is paid to you does not really get into the account in the country of residence, and it does not exist for the tax office.  However, this does not work in case of withdrawal of funds to the account of a local bank.  When registering with Payoneer, registration takes place in the United States, in the status of a non-resident, without any obligation to anyone to report and without providing personal data.  This allows the client to decide for himself what to do with the income statement. </p><p>  Payoneer, whose reviews formed such a positive review, has a Russian-speaking customer service that provides assistance to any contacting client around the clock, and if you call by phone, the operator will call you back absolutely free of charge. </p><h2>  Interaction with Paxum </h2><p>  Until the time when Payoneer became widely known in Russia, the Canadian Paxum system was widely distributed among users.  It has existed since 2010 and also has a very high reputation.  Despite the fact that this service has been successfully used for electronic payment transactions, it has also gained popularity in the sale of services for adults. </p><p>  Today you can often hear the question of what to choose - Payoneer or <span>Paxum?</span>  <span>User reviews</span> suggest that these services are identical and can be used with equal success.  Moreover, if you use both payment systems at the same time, you have the opportunity to transfer funds from one to another.  This has become available thanks to numerous e-currency exchange sites, including on RuNet. </p><h2>  Work in the system </h2><p>  Recently, you may come across ads that require remote workers to work with Payoneer.com.  Reviews also report that the company offers intermediary services in money transfers.  The essence of the proposal boils down to the fact that the system needs users from different countries, since with their help it is possible to facilitate the movement of funds in accounts.  For each completed transfer, a <span>commission is</span> guaranteed <span>.</span>  However, it is not known whether such remote work in Payoneer is real.  There are no reviews from employees about whether this promise is true.  Therefore, responding to such a vacancy, you act at your own peril and risk. </p><p>  The conclusions from the above can be drawn as follows: Payoneer is perfect as a payment system (including for issuing a debit card), but other aspects of this company‚Äôs activity are little known in Russia. </p>
