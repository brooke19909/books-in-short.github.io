  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting scientific facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most of us are far from science and have little sense in this, but will this prevent us from learning interesting scientific facts about the world that surrounds us?  A lot of interesting, funny and surprising is hiding from our eyes. </p><h2>  Proven Scientific Facts </h2><ul><li>  Human activity adversely affects the planet.  So, over the past two centuries, 2.1 trillion tons of <span>carbon dioxide</span> have been released into the atmosphere <span>,</span> and the acidity of the ocean has increased by almost a third. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scientific facts" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/749095.jpg" width="450"></div></li><li>  Dark eyes are a <span>dominant sign,</span> therefore there are much more dark-eyed people in the world.  In a pair where the parents have dark and light eyes, they are more likely to have children with dark ones. </li><li>  In addition, eye color may vary.  Sometimes in a child with bright eyes, with age, they become dark due to the accumulation of melanin.  In older people, by contrast, the eyes may turn pale. </li><li>  People may even have <span>red eyes,</span> but only albinos.  This is due to the absence of melanin in the iris. </li></ul><h2>  Miscellaneous Scientific Facts </h2><ul><li>  Satellites are located at a distance of 35 thousand km from the planet.  It is from this distance that cable television signals come. </li><li>  One twentieth of a second is enough for a person to identify an object. </li><li>  <span>Sperm odor</span> caused by spermine protein.  Its main function is to protect sperm. </li><li>  Interesting scientific facts apply to our daily lives.  In soda, which many love, there are artificial sweeteners that make you drink more and, accordingly, get fat. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scientific interesting facts" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/749094.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  Saccharin, an artificial sweetener, was invented by chance.  During tests to create a cure for an ulcer, the scientist decided to taste the mixture and it turned out to be sweet. </li><li>  Why are snowflakes falling slowly?  All lies in the fact that they are mostly composed of air, but only 5% of ice, which makes their flight graceful. </li><li>  Have you heard that the first <span>aircraft</span> was created by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century?  He was really a brilliant scientist and artist, but in this area he was far ahead of the ancient Greek philosopher Archit, who made a similar discovery in the 4th century BC.  e. </li></ul><h2>  Facts about people </h2><ul><li>  There is a certain <span>height above sea level</span> at which the pressure is so low that human blood can boil.  This point is called Armstrong's limit, and it is located at an altitude of 19,200 meters. </li><li>  By the structure and content of minerals, human bones are similar to some types of coral. </li><li>  A person can tolerate a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius.  This was proved by an experiment conducted in the USA in 1990. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="proven scientific facts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/749093.jpg" width="321"></div></li><li>  Russian researchers have determined that people who overload themselves with thoughts are much more likely to suffer from alcoholism. </li><li>  Some people can write equally well with both hands. </li><li>  The human heart begins to beat as early as four weeks after conception. </li><li>  Blood moves through the capillaries at a speed of 109 cm / h, and through the heart it passes already at a speed of 1.6 km / h. </li><li>  <span>The taste buds of a</span> person change in 10 days, so for a short period of time the same products may seem different to us. </li></ul><h2>  A bit about the world around </h2><ul><li>  Scientific facts are encountered by us each in a different way.  For example, have you ever wondered why a rainbow appears in the sky?  This phenomenon causes refraction of light in droplets of rain and fog.  They react differently to light, so the rainbow is colorful. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="concept of scientific fact" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/749096.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Scientific facts will help to solve even some everyday problems.  For example, a simple knowledge of biology will help determine if an egg is fresh.  The fact is that gas is formed in stale and this keeps it on the surface in water, while fresh water drowns in water. </li><li>  Best of all, sunlight reflects snow, it accounts for about 90% of the reflected light, while land is able to reflect no more than 10-20%. </li><li>  The purest alcohol is vodka, because it contains the least amount of impurities. </li></ul><h2>  Space awaits us </h2><ul><li>  The length of the day on Mars is almost the same as on Earth, they last only 39 minutes. </li><li>  The fastest planet in the solar system is Jupiter.  He needs only ten hours to completely rotate around the axis. </li><li>  The galaxy in which we are located contains about 200-400 billion stars. </li><li>  At a decent distance, a spaceship can take a photo of a million square kilometers of our planet in just ten minutes.  You can do the same with an airplane in four years. </li></ul><h2>  Interesting, incredible </h2><ul><li>  Scientific facts can sometimes make you smile.  For example, the French scholar Jean-Antoine Nollet in his extravagant experiments once made two hundred monks jump. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="problem of scientific fact" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/749097.jpg" width="488"></div></li><li>  During the flight, the sensitivity of our receptors changes, so we otherwise feel sweet and salty. </li><li>  The semi-mythical point G was discovered by a German gynecologist in the 1940s.  However, she gained popularity only with the release of a book on sexuality in 1980. </li><li>  Whiskey is more useful than wine, because it contains elements that can prevent heart disease. </li><li>  The ignorant Spanish conquistadors were not very versed in precious metals, therefore, in translation platinum means "silver".  It seemed to them too refractory and therefore its cost was two times lower than the cost of silver. </li><li>  Have you ever wondered where the oil came from?  In fact, oil was once alive, that is, it was formed from plankton, which once, tens of millions of years ago, sailed into the sea. </li></ul><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The concept of a scientific fact is quite broad, therefore, this category of knowledge can include a lot of information from different areas of knowledge.  To recognize a fact as such, it must not only be proved, but also verified.  The problem of a scientific fact is that very often this evidence is neglected and presented in a raw form, but science can always distinguish truth from lies. </p>
