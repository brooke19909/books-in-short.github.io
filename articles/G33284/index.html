Located in the center of the modern city, it is a small, cozy space surrounded by sprawling, old trees.  A relatively quiet place for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  Once a year, on the day of the celebration of the Great Victory, the Defense Square in Yekaterinburg (at the address: Parkovy microdistrict) comes to life.  Thousands of jubilant citizens gather here and celebrations are held near the monument ‚ÄúGray Ural‚Äù. </p><h2>  Nochlechnaya square </h2><p>  At first, there was just a wasteland among urban houses, one end of which rested on Sennaya Square, the largest in Yekaterinburg.  Another approached the foot of the Bald Hill, 282 meters high, on top of which already in those years was a magnetic meteorological station.  Today it is a city observation deck. </p><p>  But in 1885, city authorities opened an overnight house for 600 people in a vacant lot.  Money for construction and maintenance was allocated by the Committee on the charity of the poor.  In 1888, the name of the new square appeared on the city map - Nochlezhna. </p><h2>  Simeonovskaya and Gorky Square </h2><p>  The city fraternity of St. Simeon of Verkhotursky, who was trying to allocate land for the construction of the church, in 1898 was allocated 2600 square meters.  fathom in the area.  Construction began immediately, collecting money from the whole world.  Most of the expenses were borne by the fraternity.  In 1906, a whole complex was opened here, consisting of the Simeon Church and two schools for 140 students.  The area began to be called the name of the saint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Defense Square" class="if uuid-3184949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3184949.jpg"></div><p>  With the onset of the 20th century, new buildings appeared here: a fire department, an elementary school, and a prison house.  Since 1918, in a modern kindergarten at the hospital, a building with potholes in the wall has been preserved, near which shots of dissident citizens were carried out.  In 1919, it was decided to change the church name of the square, and it became the name of Maxim Gorky.  The sign of love and respect for the proletarian writer was given during his lifetime. </p><h2>  Defense Square of Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the formation of military units took place within the walls of the school located on the square.  There was also a collection point where men called up for the front came.  From here, mothers and wives escorted their loved ones to war. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ekmap.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fighters venue" class="if uuid-3184951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3184951.jpg"></div><p>  In total, during the war years, more than 100 thousand inhabitants went to the front, more than 40 thousand did not return.

On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the Victory, in 2005, a monumental sculpture was erected here, called by the author ‚ÄúGray Urals‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monument "Gray Ural" </h2><p>  According to legend, the hero and giant Sedoy Ural is the defender of the Ural land.
