    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not without negative impressions of such an institution as Kirman Hotels Sidera Luxury Spa 5 *.  Reviews of tourists highlight such negative points: </p><ul><li>  rocky entry into the sea (you have to buy special protective slippers for your feet or, as an option, swim from the pier); </li><li>  for the use of a safe in the room an additional fee is charged (which is not typical for five-star hotels); </li><li>  diluted local alcohol on an all-inclusive basis; </li><li>  from three in the morning to seven in the morning the centralized air conditioning system in the hotel is turned off, so the rooms become very stuffy; </li><li>  tasteless cocktails in bars; </li><li>  in a la carte restaurants, the quality of dishes is not at the highest level (everything is much tastier and better in the dining room); </li><li>  inflated prices for the services of photographers (for one processed photo they ask for seven dollars); </li><li>  the dryer on the balcony is very small, only a couple of towels are placed on it (experienced tourists bring linen and clothespins with them); </li><li>  maids in most cases come to do cleaning after dinner, when guests relax; </li><li>  the fruits served in the restaurant have some kind of synthetic flavor; </li><li>  children's animation is not at the highest level (kids have practically nothing to do, parents have to entertain them on their own); </li><li>  water slides do not work all day, but turn on according to the schedule (because of this, a queue is accumulating near the rides); </li><li>  reception staff are cunning at the expense of room availability, so do not settle for their offers and insist on your own (they deliberately offer guests not the best rooms, so that later they will require a surcharge for relocation); </li><li>  terrible quality of cleaning (even dust from furniture is not really wiped clean); </li><li>  uncomfortable that there is no beach bar (there are only vending machines with a limited range of drinks); </li><li>  maids constantly forget to replace towels, they have to run after them with a request to refresh the kit; </li><li>  beds creak strongly at the slightest movement; </li><li>  when you leave the room and take out the key card from the special connector, the air conditioner is turned off, and therefore it will be hot and stuffy upon returning to the room; </li><li>  throughout the territory, except for the lobby area, wireless Internet is working intermittently. </li></ul>
