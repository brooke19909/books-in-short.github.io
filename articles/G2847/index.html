  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Semeykin island, Tomsk: affordable holidays within the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tomsk is the oldest city in Siberia, with ancient architecture and interesting places.  In addition, the city is an industrial and cultural center.  For this reason, in each district there are groves, parks and squares, recreational areas. </p><p>  One of such places is Semeykin island of Tomsk.  It is located between Nizhne-Lugovaya street and the river station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tv2.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomsk Semeykin Island" class="if uuid-2326438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2326438.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The island itself is separated from Tomsk only during the spring flood, and when the heat sets in, it again becomes the left-bank part of the city. </p><p>  Last year, only one beach was officially opened in the city - on Semeyky Island.  The entire infrastructure is equipped on the coastline, lifeguards and an administrator work.  The order is monitored by a private security agency, and all attempts to drink alcohol are thwarted. </p><p>  On Semeyky Island in Tomsk you can play basketball and volleyball.  There are stationary toilets and equipped with changing cabins.  There are sun loungers near the water, which can be used free of charge.  You can buy refreshments in the cafe.  There is a rental point for sports equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.vtomske.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children in the water" class="if uuid-2326442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2326442.jpg"></div><h2>  Reconstruction and events </h2><p>  Local authorities tried to reconstruct the beach on Semeyky Island in Tomsk several times.  But all the time, something was in the way: either the crisis came in 2008, or it turned out that this territory does not belong to the local authorities, but is in federal ownership.  The first real steps were taken in 2011, when toilet cabins and shady canopies appeared on the beach.  And most importantly, the road to the recreation area was made. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Last year, in addition to the festive opening of the bathing season, during the warm period, many interesting events were held.  First of all, on a regular basis in the morning (3 days a week) free classes were held with a qigong gymnastics trainer.  And on Sundays, training and sports exercises were held. </p><p>  Almost every weekend on the beach there are interesting events: </p><ul><li>  lessons from participants in a local dance school; </li><li>  performances by DJs and local musicians; </li><li>  workout-master classes; </li><li>  festival of colors and others. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="tv2.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach on the island" class="if uuid-2326449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2326449.jpg"></div><h2>  Origin name </h2><p>  Almost the entire city of Tomsk was built by local merchants, hence the names of streets and areas given in honor of enterprising people.  In the distant 1630, when the city was very young, the Nizhny Ostrog was recently built and trade relations were established, and trade missions appeared.  For example, from the Moscow merchants, the holder of the shops was Titov Semeykin.  He stored his goods lower along the mouth of the river - on Semeyky Island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tvtomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomsk Intersection" class="if uuid-2326460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2326460.jpg"></div><h2>  Tomsk Intersection </h2><p>  It is not the first year in the city that a regional festival of art song has been held.  Last year, he was held on the Semeyky Island of Tomsk.  There were 10 concert programs in which local bards took part.  The event began on Friday evening and lasted until Sunday.  Not only local authors, but also children's groups performed, construction brigade songs sounded and visitors from other regions of the bards performed. </p><p>  Local authorities took care of vacationers and participants of the festival: from the city to the island they increased the number of buses so that everyone could get home or, conversely, to a concert.  They also increased the number of water trams, and buses from different places of the city poured from the pier. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.4965883" data-lng="84.93033630000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/6/5/1465.png"></div><h2>  How to get to Semeykin Island in Tomsk </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to the island is to catch the "water bus", which leaves from the second pier of the River Station.  Motor ships depart every 30 minutes, starting at 10 in the morning.  The last flight from the island at 20:30. </p><p>  You can get to the beach by public transport.  A bus runs along the route No. 37 to the place. You need to get off at the Michurinskaya stop.  Further on foot, following the signs. </p><p>  How to get to Semeykino Island in Tomsk by car - go to the Timiryazevskoye-Eushta highway, the main thing is not to miss the sign where you need to turn.  In front of the beach there is parking for vehicles. </p>
