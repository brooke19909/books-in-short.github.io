To Abkhazia by train: ticket price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, a huge number of Russians are going on vacation to Abkhazia, where all the conditions for a full and comfortable stay are created.  Here, nature is amazing and unique in beauty, since the country is located in the subtropics, and the majestic mountains are striking in their power. </p><h2>  Travel benefits </h2><p>  Traveling to this amazing country attracts compatriots also by the fact that it is located next to Russia, so a lot of time is not required to get to it.  A significant advantage of a trip to Gagra or Pitsunda is the fact that there is no need to issue a passport, the local population speaks Russian, and the ruble is used as a monetary unit.  On the border between Abkhazia and Russia, you only need to present an <span>internal passport,</span> and if you travel with children, then their birth certificate. </p><h2>  The benefits of traveling by rail </h2><p>  At the same time, each resident of the metropolitan metropolis at his own discretion decides whether to go by train "Moscow - Abkhazia" or use alternative modes of transport. </p>

    <p>  And here it all depends on the individual preferences of the person.  Someone chooses a plane, and someone likes to ride a bus.  Nevertheless, a huge number of vacationers prefer to travel by train "Moscow - Abkhazia".  And, of course, there is a logical explanation for this.  Firstly, railway transport is classified as the safest option for passenger transportation.  If you, for example, take the Moscow-Abkhazia train, you can comfortably sit horizontally on one of the shelves, read a book, or relax in peace.  Someone wants to enjoy the picturesque nature from the window of the car.  Many vacationers prefer to spend their leisure time in a dining car.  Agree, traveling by train "Moscow - Abkhazia" is a pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  You can spend your holidays in the above country both in boarding houses and in the private sector.  Again, this issue is resolved depending on your preferences.  Whichever option you choose, it has pros and cons.  In particular, having a ticket to a boarding house on hand, you get some guarantees that upon arrival you will have a rest in comfortable conditions. </p>

    <p>  Rest in the private sector gives hope for better food and a warm welcome.  Here you should pay attention to the reviews that are available about certain offers. </p><h2>  Gagra </h2><p>  Of course, the lion's share of tourists rushes to Gagra, since this resort was popular in <span>Soviet times.</span>  There is a very developed infrastructure with an abundance of markets, shops, cafes, restaurants, hotels.  The resort is divided into two parts: Old Gagra and New Gagra. </p><p>  Regarding the first, it should be said that it was erected in the era of the Russian Empire.  Here is an amazingly beautiful park where you can admire tangerine, lemon, eucalyptus trees and cypresses.  In this part of the resort, the main part of the boarding houses is concentrated, while in the New Gagra the private sector is based. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pitsunda </h2><p>  This resort is nothing but a cape, which was formed by the efforts of a mountain river.  In the vicinity of Pitsunda there is a pine grove in which to breathe air is a pleasure, since it is crystal clear here.  In this amazing corner of wildlife, the heat is much easier to tolerate than in other resorts of the Black Sea. </p>

    <p>  Most of the local pensions were built during the Soviet era, so the spirit of the Soviet era is still preserved here, and every tourist can catch it.  It should be noted that the disadvantage of the resort is not too extensive network of catering facilities and shops compared to other places of recreation. </p><h2>  Sukhum </h2><p>  Sukhumi is the most remote area for leisure activities, so those tourists who like a secluded type of relaxation choose it. </p><p>  And, of course, Abkhazia is a storehouse of natural attractions.  What is only <span>Lake Ritsa,</span> surrounded by massive mountains.  Here you can fish, ride catamarans and take a boat trip. </p><h2>  How to get there by train </h2><p>  Of course, many beginner tourists are interested in the question of whether there is an opportunity to travel to Abkhazia by train.  Of course, yes.  Every day at half past three in the afternoon from the Kursk railway station of the capital, train No. 305 leaves for Sukhum.  And without any transfers.  The duration of such a trip is approximately 42 hours. </p><p>  It must be emphasized that with the end of the tourist season, the Moscow-Sukhum train schedule changes, after which it starts to run on certain days. </p>

    <p>  In any case, when traveling to Abkhazia by train, you will have fifteen comfortable cars equipped with dry closets and air conditioning, as well as a restaurant car. </p><p>  Previously, until the middle of summer 2011, in order to travel to Abkhazia, it was necessary to <span>buy a ticket</span> for trailed cars on the Moscow-Adler route, which carried passengers to Sukhum with a stop at the Veseloe border station.  There it was necessary to purchase a ticket again, but already from Abkhaz conductors. </p><p>  Now Russians can travel directly to Abkhazia.  Nevertheless, border control procedures are mandatory and today, as a rule, they take about an hour.  The Russian service conducts them at Veseloye station, and the Abkhaz service at Tsandripsh station. </p><h2>  Direction of the route and the cost of the trip </h2><p>  Going by train to Abkhazia from the Russian capital, you will transit through the Moscow Region, Lipetsk, Voronezh, Rostov Regions, Krasnodar Territory.  After the composition crosses the border of Abkhazia, the speed of its movement will significantly decrease.  You will pass such stations as Tsandripsh, Gagra, Gudauta, New Athos. </p>

    <p>  You can buy tickets to Sukhum at the box office of the capital station or order via the Internet. </p><p>  Do not forget that if you choose a train to overcome the Moscow-Abkhazia route, the price of a ticket to Sukhum will depend on the comfort level of the car.  In particular, a place in the reserved seat will cost you about 3,100 rubles, those who wish to go in a compartment will pay 5,500 rubles, but the cost of the ST is 11,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Train from Adler </h2><p>  Of course, many tourists are attracted to Abkhazia.  "How to get to this beautiful corner of nature by train on a different route?"  - those who intend to visit Sukhum, Gagra or Pitsunda may ask.  You can get from Adler to Sukhum by electric train, which runs in this direction every day, leaving for Abkhazia at 7.30 in the morning.  Ticket price is 200 rubles. </p><p>  If you do not have the time or desire to independently engage in the purchase of tickets and search for housing, but you really want to relax in Sukhum, then you can choose sightseeing tours to Abkhazia by train.  Such a vacation will also be comfortable for you, and you will get the most out of it. </p>
