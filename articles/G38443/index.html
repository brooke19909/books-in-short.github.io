But, when the tourism industry began to develop, then nearby settlements were also referred to Khao Lak.  So the resort has increased significantly in size. </p><p>  The airport is 65 kilometers from the hotel.  Just like Phuket.  And if visitors to this popular resort can have a good time immersed in the nightlife of Thailand, then Khao Lak is an ideal place to relax in a quiet and calm atmosphere and enjoy magnificent landscapes.  And yet this resort is famous for its amazingly clean beaches with white sand and clear sea water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Largely due to its location, this hotel has become famous.  Sentido Graceland Khao Lak Resort Spa has a private beach area that is within easy reach.  From here, you can drive to the city center and Khao Lak Lam Rou National Park in 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Facilities and service </h2><p>  Sentido Graceland Khao Lak Resort Spa, like any other self-respecting hotel, has everything that can make guests relax as comfortable and relaxed as possible. </p><p>  There is free high-speed Wi-Fi, private parking, concierge, 24-hour reception, separate luggage storage, laundry with dry cleaning, business center, tour desk and conference room.

A spacious balcony, a stylish living room, a cozy bedroom, a modern bathroom - what else is needed to make the rest as comfortable as possible?  Private pool.

And the conditions, for the rest, are the same as for the suite.  Only the price of a weekly stay for two people will be 160 thousand rubles. </p><p>  But the most luxurious and expensive option is a villa with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã255 square meters.  m. The terrace is equipped with decorative lighting, and a private pool is fenced off from prying eyes.  These villas also have garden views.  This is the best option, and looking at the above photo, you can verify this fact. </p><p>  But the price of the stay is appropriate.

If they are necessary, then it is necessary to inform about it in advance in the accommodation facility, even before your departure.  The administration must send confirmation of this service. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Buying tours at the Sentido Graceland Khao Lak Resort Spa, it is worth exploring as much as possible in detail everything related to relaxation in this place.  Fortunately, there is plenty of information. </p><p>  For example, tourists who have been here say that there is a free shuttle bus to the city center from the hotel twice a day.  And it‚Äôs very convenient - you don‚Äôt need to rent a car, just find out the schedule.  In the city you can buy fruits, souvenirs and gifts at modest prices. </p><p>  Still, if you want silence, privacy and comfort, it is better to book ordinary rooms, rather than villas or suites.  If you choose apartments with access to the main pool, you will need to get ready all day to hear the screams of children who are noisily having fun there. </p><p>  In general, the Sentido Graceland Khao Lak Resort Spa Hotel is ideal for a romantic getaway for two or for a company of friends.  Khao Lak, like the hotel itself, is designed for sophisticated tourists.  Huge palm plantations, picturesque landscapes, semi-empty and clean beaches, mountains and the jungle - this is what you can enjoy when you come here.  This is not a place for parties, active nightlife and unbridled fun.  Khao Lak is a place where you can enjoy solitude and nature.  Therefore, deciding to go here, it is worth remembering this. </p>
