They attract attention with their originality, bright colors and unusual manufacturing techniques.  Although such products are short-lived, they are loved by masters from all over the world, because it is not difficult to make them, there is little material left, and it is inexpensive.  You can update the interior every month, and in the halls for celebrations and even more often. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make paper flowers on a wall with your own hands, what material you need to prepare for work.  We will share our knowledge about the methods and methods of manufacturing different flowers and leaflets, how to fix them on the wall and among themselves.  The photographs presented will help to understand the material presented and choose something interesting for yourself. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Large paper flowers do it yourself with a variety of materials.  Bright and colorful, they are obtained from a thin isolon from 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm.  It is purchased in construction stores, as it is considered an insulating material.  You can cut it with simple scissors, since the sheets are quite soft.  It comes in different colors, so it‚Äôs easy to find the right one for the job. </p><p>  Simpler paper flowers are made with their own hands from a material with a density of 100 g / m <sup>2</sup> , rolls of corrugated paper, some products can even be made from thick napkins.  They glue together the parts with either hot glue or thick and fresh PVA. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper flower arrangement" class="if uuid-2768931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768931.jpg"></div><p>  In order to collect a beautiful and lush flower, you will need: cardboard for cutting patterns of petals and leaves, a simple pencil for outlining contours, scissors for cutting elements.  If you plan to make a rose, then you can bend the flower petals with a knitting needle or a round wooden stick. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To work, free up space in the room and prepare a flat surface on the table, removing all unnecessary.  We begin the explanation with the manufacture of do-it-yourself flowers from paper napkins. </p><h2>  Dahlia from napkins </h2><p>  For work, buy large dense wipes.  First, you need to deploy each on the surface of the table, then lay several products on top of each other and fold everything with an accordion, turning the product back and forth.  When you get a thin strip, bend it in half to accurately determine the center point of the craft.  It is on it that you need to tie a ribbon or a thin thread that will hold the entire flower.  Some craftsmen in the middle make small triangular cuts of paper so that the bundle squeezes the napkin as little as possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thesweethostess.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper napkin flower" class="if uuid-2768977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768977.jpg"></div><p>  The edges are cropped in a semicircle, as can be clearly seen in the frame under No. 3 in the photo above.  When everything is cooked, carefully, so as not to tear thin sheets, straighten all layers of paper to the middle.  You should get a magnificent flower-ball.  At the end of a thread or thin tape, it can be hung on a wall, chandelier, curtain rod or one above the other, like a garland.  The craft will also look beautiful and lying on a table or shelf. </p><h2>  Using corrugated paper </h2><p>  The principle of making such paper flowers on the wall with your own hands is similar to the ‚Äúaccordion‚Äù method of collecting it earlier, but it is composed of the folds of a whole roll of corrugated paper.  Each fold is made at a distance of 6-8 cm from the previous one.  The ends are rounded off with scissors, and in the center, be sure to reduce the paper size by making two triangular cuts.  After tying with kapron thread, the paper layers are gently straightened in all directions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper flower" class="if uuid-2768966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768966.jpg"></div><p>  To center the center of the contrasting color, slightly squeeze the paper, making a small dent.  The middle consists of a strip 10 cm wide, one edge of it is cut into "noodles".  After twisting the prepared strip around the rod (knitting needle, wooden skewer or pencil), smear the end with PVA glue and press it to the last turn.  Then attach the finished part to the center point of the flower.  Craft is ready! </p><h2>  Thick paper astra </h2><p>  With your own hands, a paper flower on a wall can be assembled from many details.  The following sample shows that the product consists of large petals of the same size, arranged in two rows.  The central part of the craft is assembled from 3 different parts in increasing order.  The middle hides all the joints and is made by the method, which we will describe later in the article. </p><p>  First, let's figure out how to do the biggest work items.  All of them are cut one pattern, folding the sheet in half.  At the junction in the center, a round base is glued, on which all the petals are glued.  Start work from the outside circle.  The middle is attached last. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower pattern" class="if uuid-2768963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768963.jpg"></div><p>  How to do it, consider further.  You will need a long strip of paper, on top of which make frequent cuts to the same depth with "noodles".  Then roll it around a thin knitting needle, tightly squeezing the coils together.  The remaining end is attached with PVA glue to the last turn.  It turns out the volumetric middle of the flower, which at the very end of the work is attached to the central point of the craft, smearing the end of the strip with glue.  At the same time, press down the circle so that the glue seizes.  You can attach such a flower to the wall on a double-sided tape for the middle.  Petals should remain voluminous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lush rose </h2><p>  Decorating the <span>wall decor with</span> paper flowers with your own hands is easy.  For example, such a magnificent rose, as in the photo below, is made up of petals cut out according to the pattern.  Their size and shape is visible in the lower frames.  In order for the rose to have a natural appearance, the edges of the blanks are twisted around the pencil or using a metal needle.  It is enough to stretch the edge on its surface, pressing the blank firmly with your finger, and the petal will gracefully curl the end of the paper with a wave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose out of paper" class="if uuid-2768945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768945.jpg"></div><p>  Begin sticking the petals from the outer edge.  Take the usual circle as the basis.  Each subsequent petal is placed with a slight overlap on the previous one. </p><h2>  Flower pattern </h2><p>  The next option is assembled from multi-colored parts of the same shape, but of different sizes.  Each petal consists of four elements.  Begin manufacturing with black paper flowers.  With their own hands, the largest details are glued to the wall around a small central circle, after bending the edges with a wave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multicolor flower" class="if uuid-2768961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768961.jpg"></div><p>  Then attach the parts in decreasing order of size.  The middle of the flower looks original.  The eyelets are long and thin.  To do this, take a wide strip and fold it in half.  Only then is the edge ‚Äúnoodle‚Äù cut, and quite thin.  If you do work on order, while earning money, then do not stint and get special scissors that have many parallel blades.  With one click, several cuts are obtained at once.  This is convenient when you need to do a lot of paper flowers on the wall with your own hands. </p><p>  When you cut the center, fold it in the usual way and attach in the center of the flower of the petals.  At the end, press the cut part of the strip in different directions, and in the middle attach a small butterfly. </p><h2>  flower composition </h2><p>  How to make paper flowers with your own hands, you already understood.  The principle of the work is similar in each product.  The differences are minor and understandable to the experienced master.  For example, in the photo below it is seen that the burgundy petals, first cut according to the template, were attached to the central circle, and the middle is made up of prepared strips of different widths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fluffy center flower" class="if uuid-2768937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768937.jpg"></div><p>  When winding the strips on the rod, they first performed an operation on a thin strip, then a wider part is glued to its edge, and the winding was continued to the end.  The edge was attached to the PVA to the last turn and the whole middle was placed at the center point of a large paper flower.  Carved curly leaves of the same color with the fluffy part of the craft itself complement the work interestingly. </p><h2>  Cone Craft </h2><p>  With your own hands, decorating the walls or doors with paper flowers can be composed of cones by gluing them with sharp tips to the center on hot glue.  For work, you can take both paper of the same color, and different.  The craftwork looks beautiful, in which all layers are multi-colored, but in harmony with each other.  For example, make the outer layer maroon, the next one red, then pink, pale pink and at the end lay the white middle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theartssection.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flower of cones" class="if uuid-2768974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2768974.jpg"></div><p>  Cone tubes are made up of square sheets of thick paper.  Some craftsmen make room decorations from magazine and even newspaper pages. </p><h2>  Additional items </h2><p>  Bright green leaves will decorate any flowers on the wall.  They are made in different ways, for example, curly sections are made on a sheet folded in half.  Corrugated crafts look beautiful.  In the sample below, we consider the original version of a sheet element assembled from separate parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper sheet" class="if uuid-2769004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2769004.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows that thick colored double-sided paper is used, which holds the necessary shape well.  On parts folded in half, rounded arcs with thin edges of different sizes are cut out.  The fold is carefully smoothed by the fingers.  The prepared parts are folded together, pressing them tightly at the base.  They are placed in order of decreasing size to the ends.  Some smaller leaves are inserted between large ones to make the finished product look natural. </p><p>  The lower part of the beam is first fastened together with a stapler, and then glued with a thin strip in several layers.  It turns out spectacular pointed palm leaves that will blend perfectly with any crafts on the wall. </p><p>  Knowing the principles of manufacturing large flowers, you can create your own compositions that correspond to the interior of the room.  Bring creative ideas to life by following our tips.  Good luck </p>
