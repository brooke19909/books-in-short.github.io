  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Activation iphone 4s</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you first bought a world-famous smartphone with a <span>bitten apple</span> on the back, then you may have questions about what Iphone <span>activation is</span> .  Indeed, in the products of competing brands HTC, Samsung, etc., activation is not applied.  But that's the whole Apple, guys know how to create difficulties for their users out of the blue. </p><p>  So, the topic of this article is <span>how to activate iphone</span> 4s, what steps you need to go through to successfully complete this procedure and what you need to do to get an <span>Apple ID (Apple account).</span> </p><p>  The material is suitable for verification with any phone running iOS 5 (it defaults to 4S). </p><p>  First, prepare a micro sim. </p><p>  Since iPhone activation is possible only through the Internet, you need to worry about finding a Wi-Fi zone, or connect using the cable that is included with the computer, (I hope it is clear that it must be connected to the <span>World Wide Web).</span>  Then download iTunes. </p><p>  If the phone is connected to the network, carefully read the instructions that appear on the screen and follow them.  First you should choose the country and interface language (I advise you to choose Russia and Russian). </p><p>  The next question will be: Allow me to determine the location of the phone (useful if you plan to use maps and navigation).  Here you can either allow or reject the offer, in any case later, in the phone menu, you can change this parameter. </p><p>  Then, activation of the iphone will ask if you allow the phone to connect to the Internet, given that this phone needs a network all the time, and not only for web surfing, but also for iCloud and other Apple‚Äôs online services, I advise you to answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù to this question. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then there will be a connection to the network of the telecom operator, with obtaining settings for connecting to its services SMS, MMS, gprs, etc. </p><p>  After successfully loading the communication parameters, you will be asked if you had a phone of this corporation before, if it was, you will be asked to restore all the settings from the backup stored in iCloud and iTunes, but since you are the first to use the device, select Configure New Phone menu. </p><p>  All the following menus and questions can be passed, or you can skip, they are not required.  The main activation of iphone 4s was successful.  But in order to feel the full power of the iPhone 4S, I recommend that you go through the remaining points to the end. </p><p>  So, we reconnect to the Internet via Wi-Fi or GPRS, log in with your ID if you have one, or create a new one (it's free) and enable or disable Siri (voice assistant). </p><p>  We choose to agree or refuse to send reports on the operation of your iPhone to Apple, and in the end, press the button ‚Äústart using the phone‚Äù. </p><p>  And what about those who own an unofficial iPhone, because in this case, with standard activation, the user will encounter great difficulties? </p><p>  Indeed, such a problem usually arises for those who reflash their phone and get a broken brick as a result.  Now the message ‚Äúactivation of iphone is required‚Äù is lit on the screen, and when you try to go through this procedure, an error appears about the impossibility of completing the process. </p><p>  Best of all, of course, if you have a SIM card of those operators for whose service your gadget is blocked: Vodafone, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T.  In this case, immediately after flashing the phone, install this SIM card on iPhone and connect to iTunes.  Then the device will do everything by itself.  But those who do not have such a card will have to fight with their phone on their own. </p><p>  In such situations, Cydia will help, or rather, a tweak with the name Subscriber Artificial Module, with its help it is quite possible to activate a locked iPhone without an operator‚Äôs SIM card. </p><p>  In order to find out exactly how this is done, refer to the Internet, in it you will find a lot of useful instructions on the topic of unlocking and jailbreak.  It remains only to recall that this is not entirely legal, and you will certainly lose the guarantee on your phone (if it was, of course). </p>
