This corner, located near Istanbul, has a very special atmosphere: huge columns resting in a blank arch, standing in dark water, resemble an empty flooded palace. </p><h2>  Water storage </h2><p>  The Basilica Cistern (Istanbul), built over 2 centuries, has survived to our time in good condition.  I must say that there were many such storages, because the state of siege, in which the city often found itself, forced the townspeople to make huge water supplies.  The inhabitants of besieged Istanbul often died of thirst, and <span>Emperor Constantine</span> I commanded by order to create capacious reservoirs for life-giving moisture.  And at that time a huge number of them were built, both underground and on its surface.  But not all of them have survived to our time, many have been destroyed, but the Basilica of the Cistern - the largest building of its kind - has become a pleasant exception. </p>

    <p>  When Istanbul was still called Constantinople and was not enslaved by Turkish troops, a basilica stood on the site of an underground water storage ("church" in Greek).  It was not just a religious building: at different times it was a library, a university, and a courthouse.  When the city came under the rule of the Turks, the reservoir changed its name, but not its purpose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Curious columns </h2><p>  The Basilica Cistern (Istanbul) with dimensions of 140 x 70 meters holds approximately 100 thousand tons of drinking water.  The brick walls of the storehouse were covered with a special solution to prevent their destruction.  Water was delivered through the constructed aqueducts from sources far beyond the city.  The enormous interest of visitors is caused by marble columns supporting the arch, many of which are not similar to others.  The thing is that they were brought from different ancient temples, so their style, designs and even varieties of marble are different. </p>

    <p>  Of particular interest are the columns depicting the <span>Medusa of the Gorgon,</span> whose gaze according to legend turned everyone into stone idols.  Often her head was used as protection against enemies, decorating weapons and the facade of buildings.  One of the columns is located on the inverted stone sculpture of the Gorgon, and under the second sculpture lies on its side.  Obviously, this was done so that her formidable gaze would not harm anyone.  Until today, it is not known exactly where these unusual objects were brought from. </p>

    <p>  The column, on the delicate patterns of which drops slowly flow down, like tears mourning those who died during the construction of slaves, also has its own history, although it was invented specially for tourists.  Now each visitor, after making a cherished desire, puts a finger into a small hole and rotates it 360 degrees.  It is believed that after such a secret ritual, any dream will come true. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From oblivion to the museum </h2><p>  After the arrival of the Turks in the 15th century, the Basilica Cistern began to be used exclusively for watering gardens, and then the structure was completely abandoned.  A century later, Europeans heard about the amazing building from the famous traveler Gillius exploring the Byzantine artifacts.  Having learned about the strange underground structure, he studied its structure in detail and described in his notes. </p><p>  Later, authorities recall the unique reservoir, carry out reconstruction and organize a museum that surprises visitors with an unusual setting.  In the darkness in the clear water of the pool, in which even small fish live, tourists throw coins for good luck.  The ancient Basilica Cistern, with its underground stone reservoir, recalls the mystical atmosphere of scenes from science fiction films. </p>

    <p>  By the way, previously fish were specially bred for the natural purification of drinking water, and now they attract the attention of all visitors with their golden sides, gleaming in the light of lanterns.  And before, local residents, not realizing the unique structure underground, were engaged in fishing for carps directly from the house, only by hollowing out small holes in the floor. </p><h2>  Basilica Cistern (Istanbul): opening hours and ticket price </h2><p>  Now the grand storey, which was built by 7 thousand slaves, is equipped after numerous reconstructions with all modern communications, a concrete floor was also poured and bridges for tourists were made around the entire perimeter of the tank. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this is not the most popular tourist route, sometimes queues are created at the entrance.  Therefore, guides warn that it is best to come here when it opens or, conversely, closes its doors to the last visitors to the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul.  Its working hours are from 09:00 to 17:30 in winter, and in the summer one hour is added to view impressive sights.  On all days of religious holidays, the storehouse starts working at 13:00.  The cost of a ticket for visitors is 7 euros, and there is a 50% discount for residents of Istanbul. </p><p>  The Basilica of the Cistern is an interesting object not only for all lovers of underground structures, it is a historical reminder of the greatness of the <span>Byzantine Empire</span> and the preserved heritage after the conquest of the Ottoman Empire. </p>
