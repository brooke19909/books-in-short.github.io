    <p>  Professional artists can create anything, from simple sketches to complex graphic designs.  Today's technology allows you to manipulate the brush as you like.  One of the striking examples of modern trends are graphic tablets, or digitizers, which allow you to digitize drawings made by hand, and in real time.  The main task of this device is to provide the user with a convenient and multi-functional tandem of traditional drawing and computer processing. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out which graphic tablet for drawing is better, consider the main characteristics of such devices and designate the most sensible models, taking into account the opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary users. </p><p>  To begin with, we will determine the manufacturers of such devices and the market situation in this segment. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Despite the abundant filling of the premium segment with apple and European devices, Asian models are considered the best graphics tablets.  A good half of companies have long been working in the IT field and have an excellent base for the production of such gadgets.  Others just came into the world, but with serious, and justified, claims to leadership in their segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you ask any professional artist or designer which graphic tablet is better, then the models from the Wacom company will surely appear in the top three of his own list.  The brand, as they say, ate a dog on such devices and offers its consumers a lot of options: from a simple gadget for amateurs to multifunctional and complex devices for specialists in their field. </p>

    <p>  The device has a rather big working surface - 250 by 160 mm, and wireless stylus control.  The matrix recognizes the accuracy of manipulations very well, and the response to the styles is barely perceptible.  Among the other advantages of the model, one can note the capacious battery of the stylus, which allows working without problems up to 800 hours on a single charge, 12 additional controls, which can be programmed for almost any action and convenient touch soft keys. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  As for the degree of sensitivity to pressing, everything is also good here: 2048 levels are more than enough.  In addition, this good graphics tablet is equipped with a USB interface and a slot for external SD media (up to 64 GB).  Users respond very warmly about the model.  Especially she liked the beginner artists who are not yet ready to pay substantial money for a premium device, but want to maximize their creativity to the professional environment. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  good looks; </li><li>  lightweight stylus, despite the capacious battery; </li><li>  multifunctionality; </li><li>  perfect value for money. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  the stylus is deprived of the eraser familiar to such devices; </li><li>  the matrix does not distinguish between the angles of the pen. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 10,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Genius EasyPen i405 </h2><p>  Despite its more than affordable price tag, this good graphics tablet is enviable in both amateur and professional environments.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, the model liked many of its ergonomics.

    <p>  The M708 received a fairly spacious working area - 250 by 160 mm and 8 programmable controls.  The gadget matrix easily recognizes 2048 levels of stylus pressure, and the pen itself is equipped with two additional function buttons. </p><p>  The device connects to a PC via a USB cable, and the stylus itself is devoid of wires.  In addition, complete with the device, the manufacturer put a lot of useful documentation and drivers for all occasions.  So there will be no problems with any versions of Windows or Mac.  It should also be noted that in the box, in addition to the usual set for the pen, there are eight removable nozzles, special tools for replacing them and convenient gloves for drawing. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the device </h2><p>  Judging by the gadget by user reviews, the model is deprived of any critical flaws, and high-quality assembly, multifunctionality and a very affordable price tag only add credibility and popularity to it.  Some owners complain that the stylus battery is running out too quickly, but the problem is solved by buying another pen (of the same brand) with a more capacious battery.  Someone also noticed a slight delay in response in some graphic editors, since this does not apply to Photoshop. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  affordable cost; </li><li>  original appearance; </li><li>  good ergonomic performance; </li><li>  an attractive feature set for a budget gadget; </li><li>  high sensitivity pen. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  stylus battery runs out quickly; </li><li>  a bit late response in some graphic editors (not in Photoshop). </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 5000 rubles. </p>
