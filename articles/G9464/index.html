A quiet holiday in these places successfully combines with a vibrant nightlife - there is a huge variety of restaurants, bars and clubs.  Everyone will find something to their liking - it can be a beach holiday, anti-aging treatments or unbridled fun in the nightlife of Hammamet.  But for whatever purpose a tourist goes here, he needs to solve the issue related to temporary residence.  Cheap <span>hotels of Tunisia</span> are especially popular <span>.</span>  However, the low price does not mean that the hotels are of poor quality.  Quite the contrary.  And one of the most striking examples is the Bravo Garden 4 hotel complex. </p>

It is absolutely free.  The hotel has a 24-hour front desk, accelerated check-in or check-out is possible.  Other facilities offered include currency exchange, luggage storage and even a tour desk.

By the way, on the territory of the hotel there is even a souvenir shop selling various pleasant little things that you can bring home as gifts to your friends. </p><h2>  Staff and service </h2><p>  In addition to all of the above services, several other important factors are important.  For example, cleanliness and hygiene are very important, as is nutrition.  In this case, do not worry about this.  Daily trained staff conducts a thorough cleaning in all rooms of Bravo Garden 4. Photo of the apartment, by the way, can fully convey to the potential guest a picture of reality.  Moreover, this is not a formal dust removal from surfaces, but a thorough cleaning.  It is spent in the afternoon.  About staff should be said in more detail.  All hotel staff speak four languages: German, French, Arabic and English.  So if potential tourists are afraid not to understand a foreign country, you should not worry - if you know at least the basics of one of the languages, you will be able to quickly get comfortable in a new place. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It was said about the sights and entertainments available on the territory of the hotel, now a couple of words should be mentioned about a beach holiday, for the sake of which many people come here.  The beach is very close, just a few steps from the hotel complex.  Tunisia's few budget hotels boast such an advantageous location.  You should take into account the fact that this is not a city, but a private beach, respectively, it will be spacious and the sea will be clean, even in the midst of the season, because there will not be as many people going to it as to the public.  In the summer season, a bar is open there - from ten in the morning until 17:00.  In it you can try new alcoholic drinks for yourself.  By the way, there is a barbecue on the beach, only for an additional fee.  If potential tourists have a question ‚Äúwhat should I take with me to the beach?‚Äù, We can safely answer: ‚ÄúOnly a swimsuit!‚Äù  - since the hotel will provide its guests with umbrellas, sun loungers and towels. </p><h2>  Tips for experienced guests </h2><p>  Based on the foregoing, it can be noted that by staying at this hotel you will make your vacation in Hammamet <span>(Tunisia)</span> unforgettable <span>.</span>  <span>The reviews</span> that people who come from there regularly leave, confirm this.  Many guests are advised to visit the entertainment center called Carthage Land, located near the hotel complex.  The only nuance that guests notice is that the rooms with windows facing the street are much quieter than those with views of the territory with the pool. </p>
