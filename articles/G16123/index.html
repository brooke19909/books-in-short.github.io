  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is explication of premises and why is it needed</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The word "explication" is translated from Latin as "explanation" or "interpretation".  This concept has found wide application in various spheres of life - in museum business, cartography, and film making.  In museums, explication is signs with explanatory texts, which are usually posted next to exhibits.  When filming a movie, the director creates a text explication (thoughts, notes, details of the future film), the cameraman - in the form of a series of drawings (lighting scheme, storyboard plans, etc.), the sound engineer - in the form of a graphic display of the soundtrack of the film. </p><p>  Explication of premises is a reference material in the organization of space and must be present as part of any planning project.  It decodes the legend on the drawing of the planned premises, the list of premises, their total number, quality and detailed technical specifications. </p><p>  The most common form of explication is a table placed on the plan.  It may also be present in the form of a separate document with legal force.  In <span>architectural projects,</span> explication is included in the explanatory note. </p><p>  In what cases is explication of premises required?  This document is necessary in the process of legitimizing unauthorized alterations and redevelopment of the premises by the owner, as well as for carrying out all <span>types of transactions</span> with real estate - purchase, sale, gift, exchange, etc. When collecting a package of documents required to complete a transaction, it is mandatory to check compliance of the composition, space and layout of the available premises with those indicated in the technical passport. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the case of a redevelopment, all changes must be legalized and made to the technical passport, or the room must be restored to its original state. </p><p>  This procedure is carried out by specialists of the <span>bureau of technical inventory.</span>  The owner of the premises (in the presence of legal documents) submits an application to the BTI.  This service is paid, it is necessary to present a receipt for payment.  On the appointed day, the BTI technician inspects the room with the measurement of the available space and the necessary changes to the initial project.  Then, within a month, as a rule, a new <span>technical passport of an</span> apartment or house is drawn up, which will be valid for one year. </p><p>  Another person may submit such an application (if there is a notarized permission of the owner of the premises). </p><p>  The explication of an apartment (or apartment building) includes detailed information about the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment as a whole and separately for each room.  At the same time, they distinguish between the <span>living area</span> (it consists of the areas of all living rooms separately), the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment (the area of ‚Äã‚Äãutility rooms is added to the living area, not counting the size of balconies, verandas, loggias and unheated pantries), as well as the total area (it also includes the size of the cold storerooms <span>and terraces, and the</span> area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe loggias, multiplied by a factor of 0.5, is added, and the balconies - a factor of 0.3). </p><p>  The explication of the premises of an apartment or residential building includes, in addition, technical specifications.  It: </p><p>  - materials and foundation construction; </p><p>  - material and wall thickness (for brick buildings).  For a log house - the average diameter of the logs. </p><p>  - construction and material of ceilings and roofs; </p><p>  - for windows - single or double binding, type of coloring, etc .; </p><p>  - explication of floors describes the construction of the base and coating, the material (for planks, the presence or absence of color is specified). </p><p>  The explication of the premises contains, in addition, information on the interior decoration of walls, partitions, ceilings, electrical wiring, heating (type of fuel, heat source), gas supply (centralized supply or bottled gas).  As well as water supply (from the city network or local source) and sewerage (central or by dumping into a sump). </p><p>  The normative document for the compilation of the explication is GOST 21.501 - 93SPDS "Rules for the Execution of Architectural and Construction Drawings". </p>
