At the same time, our hero managed to stand out from this series through his activities.  First of all, by laying the foundation for the future economic and political power of Moscow.  What in the future became a springboard for the great achievements of <span>Ivan the Terrible</span> was largely created by Ivan Kalita.  A brief biography of this prince begins in the second half of the 13th century.  Presumably in 1283. </p><p>  <strong>A brief biography of Ivan Kalita: the early years</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="short biography of Ivan Kalita" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/289969.jpg" width="289"></div>

    <p>  The future ruler was the youngest son of Moscow <span>Prince Daniil Alexandrovich</span> (and grandson of the famous Alexander Nevsky).  Already in 1296, he became paternal governor in Novgorod.  In 1304, he received his first important military experience in battles with the Tver princes for the city of Pereyaslavl.  This episode ended with the victory of the young prince.  For a long time, the young representative of the princely family was in the shadow of <span>Yuri Danilovich,</span> his older brother, who ruled Moscow.  But a brief biography of Ivan Kalita takes on a sharp turn in 1320.  Both brothers go to the Horde for Khan labels on the rule of Russian lands.  As a result of this voyage, the elder brother is going to reign in Novgorod, and the younger is at the disposal of Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Ivan Kalita.</strong>  <strong>Executive Summary</strong> </p><p>  The prince who ascended the throne of Moscow proved himself to be a stubborn and persistent politician.  He regularly traveled to the Horde, which allowed him to gain confidence and favor of the khan of Uzbek.  In material terms, this resulted in relative calm and a blessed calm for his inheritance at a time when the rest of the Russian lands were forced to pay a rather high bribe to the Khan‚Äôs </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Kalita short biography" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/289973.jpg" width="600"></div>  Baskakam.  As a result of such a favorable climate, the <span>Principality of Moscow</span> began to be replenished intensively with refugees from other lands.  Cities grew, the welfare of local boyars, crafts revived.  A brief biography of Ivan Kalita is inextricably linked with the <span>rise of Moscow</span> over the rest of the <span>Russian principalities.</span>  In 1325, the department of the Orthodox Metropolitan was transferred to Moscow, which made it not only an important economic and craft center, but also the spiritual center of all Russian land.  Ivan Kalita skillfully enough used the favorable circumstances for him. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivan Kalita briefly" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/289974.jpg" width="552"></div>  Cunning, cunning, political decisiveness and the ability to use the weaknesses of opponents allowed him to significantly expand the boundaries of his destiny.  They bought Uglich.  The struggle for domination with the old rival, the Tver prince Alexander Mikhailovich, continued for a rather long time.  In 1327, in Tver, the Horde Baskak was killed.  Ivan Kalita hastily assured the Khan of Uzbekistan of his loyalty and willingness to contribute to the punishment of those responsible.  This gave him the approval of the khan for a military campaign against Tver with the help of the Horde army, as well as the further right to rule this city and independently collect tribute for the khan.  The Moscow prince tried to add to his possessions the largest city of northern Russia, Novgorod.  However, <span>this campaign</span> ended in defeat for him.  Ivan Kalita died in 1340, leaving the Moscow throne to his heir Simeon Proud.
