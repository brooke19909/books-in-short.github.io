  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Great battles of antiquity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The great <span>battles of antiquity</span> at all times cause unquenchable interest.  The debate around many battles, and especially around individual nuances among historians, is ongoing.  As new facts appear, entire pages of history are revised.  Of course, this is a continuous process, since the collection of materials is done bit by bit, and sometimes decades are needed to confirm a fact.  Most of the difficulties are caused by the great battles of antiquity that took place <span>before our era.</span>  Consider one of them - the battle of Megiddo, information about which came to us almost exactly. </p><p>  Ancient Egypt has a rich history.  It was there that one of the most powerful civilizations existed.  The battle of Megiddo did not take the last place in the history of this country, and historians are still trying to reproduce its course.  How did scientists manage to restore as accurately as possible the chronology of events preceding it?  This is explained quite simply.  In Egypt, in the ancient <span>Karnak Temple of</span> Amon there are priceless records that describe in detail the military operation during the capture of Megiddo.  Not all the great battles of antiquity are reflected so reliably. </p><p>  The chronology of the events of that time is also preserved in one of the temples in the Hall of Annals.  It was a true story of rule and heroism, in which the great role was played by the great warriors of antiquity.  In this case we are talking about the reign of the <span>famous commander of the</span> Ancient East, the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmosis III, namely the 23rd year of his reign. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This is the first ever detailed armed conflict in world history.  The hostilities took place between the nomadic Hyksos tribes who seized the territory of Egypt, and the people passionately wanting to expel the enemy.  The main opponent of the fearless pharaoh was the king of the Hyksos by the name of Kadesh. </p><p>  Megiddo Fortress was an important strategic object and a stronghold of the anti-Egyptian Union, the shortest route from Egypt to the valley of the Oronta River passed through it.  The great battles of antiquity, which, of course, include the Battle of Megiddo, amaze the heroes of the participants.  This operation was described as the most prepared and correct from the point of view of military affairs.  The tactics of the Hyksos were not to disperse forces, but to deliver concentrated powerful blows to strategic points. </p><p>  The legendary campaign, which began in 1479 BC, was carefully prepared by Pharaoh Thutmose.  His army was well equipped and took a position in the city of Ihme, which is located on the southern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. </p><p>  The great warriors of antiquity, the sons of Egypt, were preparing to overcome a dangerous mountain range, and the enemy, meanwhile, concentrated in Megiddo to keep an important strategic point on the northern slopes of the mountains at all costs.  The shortest path to the fortress was a very narrow path, but the pharaoh took a chance and personally led a column of soldiers to the bastion. </p><p>  As history repeatedly confirms, the great battles of antiquity were won most often when the leader himself was fearless and, by his own example, led the soldiers to victory.  So it happened in this case.  The enemy did not expect that the brave pharaoh would venture to go through the mountains. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The attack of the Megiddo fortress by the army of the pharaoh began in the early May morning.  The enemy defended in the southwestern part of the fortress.  Pharaoh was the first to join the battle.  On a royal chariot, he threw himself into a deadly attack, dragging warriors behind him.  The enemy army fled in panic, and the king of Kadesh left the fortress with shame.  The winners built a fence around the city from gigantic tree trunks.  They called her "Thutmose, besieging Asians." </p><p>  Pharaoh continued to wage war and subsequently conquered hundreds of enemy cities, secured the territory of Palestine and Syria to Egypt.  Now it becomes clear why the battle of Megiddo was crucial for the country.  She allowed to preserve the integrity of the state and get rid of the dangerous invader.  The great battles of antiquity (and this battle is just such) is a clear example of the wisdom of generals and true courage. </p><p>  Glorious battles also took place between the <span>Persian Empire</span> and Greece.  In 480 BC  e.  the king of Persia, named Xerxes, sent an enormous army to Greece, but he was so active a leader that he immediately managed to build a battle-worthy and numerous fleet on the spot. </p><p>  The king of Persia was opposed by a union of Hellenic warriors led by a Spartan king named Leonid.  A battle ensued in which Tsar Leonid and his army died completely.  The governor Themistocles, who remained to rule in Athens, evacuated the civilian population of the city to the remote island of Salamis.  Here was the entire Greek fleet.  The Persians managed to burn Athens almost completely, but a crushing defeat awaited them at sea.  Greeks in September 480 BC  e.  completely destroyed the Persian fleet at the battle of Salamis.  King of Persia Xerxes admitted defeat and ordered his army to withdraw from these places. </p>
