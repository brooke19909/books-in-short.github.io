Big Ben, whose beats are broadcast on BBC every hour, begins the countdown with the bells ringing.  And the first blow of the hammer will coincide with the first second of a new hour.

    <p>  Like all the <span>sights of England,</span> Big Ben is closely watched by the authorities.  To get to the upper platform of the tower, it is necessary to go through 334 narrow steps along a spiral staircase.  However, tourists inside the tower are not allowed.  Several times a week, the entire mechanism is carefully inspected and lubricated. </p><p>  So that the hands on the clock are not in a hurry or late, their movement is controlled by old English coins.  How?  Very simple.  One penny placed on top of the pendulum speeds up its work by two and a half seconds in 24 hours.  So, a different number of coins makes it possible to achieve their accuracy even after a century and a half. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The tower rises above London at an altitude of 98 meters.  The dials made of Birmingham Opal are located on four cardinal points.  Large hands are cast from copper, and small ones are from cast iron.  For a year, the minute hand travels a distance of 190 kilometers.

    <p>  The history of this architectural monument began more than 160 years ago.  In 1844, architect Charles Barry sent a request to Parliament for additional subsidies for the construction of watches.  According to his idea, the largest clock with the heaviest bell and the most accurate mechanism should have appeared on the tower of St. Stephen, where Big Ben is located. </p><p>  Further disputes over the technical implementation of the project could not subside for five years.  New chores appeared at the time when it was necessary to cast the bell.  Officially, he got his name from the superintendent, who was Benjamin Hall, who was nicknamed Big Ben because of his obese figure.  Other sources say the bell is named after the boxer and strongman Benjamin County, who lived during the time of Queen Victoria. </p><p>  The finished <span>architectural structure</span> has become a symbol of the dawn of the <span>British Empire.</span>  In memory of this, inscriptions were made in Latin at the base of each dial and around the perimeter of the tower, praising the Queen and the Lord God.  Currently, this is probably the most recognizable landmark in England. </p><p>  By the way, today it would be more correct to ask "where is the Tower of Elizabeth" instead of "where is Big Ben."  The thing is that in the fall of 2012 an official decision was made to rename.  The occasion was the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the reign of Elizabeth II.  A new nameplate was presented at the opening on September 12th.  Although probably tourists, and locals this bell tower will be called Big Ben for a long time. </p>
