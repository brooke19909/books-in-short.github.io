To achieve the best result, it is necessary to attract and interest as many customers as possible.  In turn, the client among the many banks selects the most comfortable option.  One of the important selection criteria is a modern approach.  Remote maintenance is included in the list of services of 80% of Russian banks.  In this article, we will consider what constitutes a remote banking system and what is the direction of its development. </p><h2>  The concept of RBS </h2><p>  Banking remote banking is a technology developed specifically for remote work with the bank.  RBS involves comprehensive <span>customer service</span> at a bank without a personal presence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="banking remote service" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35048/920034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The RBS system has long been used in Europe and the United States.  A similar system has been integrated into Russia quite recently.  However, a stable development of the RB system is observed annually.  Every year an increasing number of customers actively use virtual banking. </p><p>  The essence of banking remote servicing is that a large number of banking operations ‚Äî paying bills, receiving statements, processing applications, registering payment documents, etc. ‚Äî can be carried out in absentia without a personal presence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Remote banking services include: </p><ul><li><p>  The Bank-Client system. </p></li><li><p>  System "Internet Client". </p></li><li><p>  System "Phone-client". </p></li><li><p>  ATM-banking service and use of banking devices. </p></li></ul><h2>  System "Bank-client", or "Fat client" </h2><p>  The principle of the system is to remotely access the client through a computer program.  For this type of work, you must contact the bank for technological guidance and program installation.  The remote banking system also has a second name - "Fat Client".  It integrated from abroad (remote banking, home banking).  A specialized program stores personal data of the client and the history of transactions with the bank.  An individual communication channel connects the client program with the banking one.  For continuous operation, the client requires constant communication through a modem or stationary Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="remote banking system" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/923188.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The largest number of users of the Bank-Client system is observed among legal entities.  Convenience of work consists in the fact that obtaining information, displaying the current status of the account and performing many operations is carried out remotely. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A well-functioning system of mutual cooperation called ‚ÄúClient-Bank‚Äù is used by many large enterprises.  The banking program provides for the creation of payment documents, as well as full tracking of all movements of funds in accounts. </p><h2>  System "Internet Client", or "Thin Client" </h2><p>  At present, more than 50% of the country's population uses Internet banking services.  Most Russian banks already use this system.  Almost every bank has its own website where you can get all the information you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="remote banking services" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35048/920039.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúInternet-client‚Äù system, or ‚ÄúThin client‚Äù <span>(Internet banking, Web-banking),</span> does not imply the installation of additional software.  To work in the system, it is enough to have access to the Internet.  In your personal account, each client has the opportunity to view data on his account, receive statements, pay for services, as well as fill out applications for certain banking services. </p><p>  For convenience, mobile versions have been created with which the user can carry out the same operations from a smartphone. </p><h2>  Telephone Client System </h2><p>  The simplest form, which involves remote banking services, is the provision and processing of information by telephone.  ‚ÄúPhone-client‚Äù includes phone-banking and SMS-banking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Remote Banking" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35048/920046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Banking service requires a call center, through which you can contact a bank representative. </p><p>  The information processing and transmission scheme has several options: </p><ul><li><p>  the client communicates with the operator; </p></li><li><p>  the client receives information using the voice menu; </p></li><li><p>  the client receives information via SMS banking; </p></li></ul><p>  The list of services provided to the client is limited: by phone you can only get information of interest and enter several types of applications.  However, further cash withdrawal or transfer operations require identification and personal presence. </p><h2>  ATM-banking service and use of banking devices </h2><p>  One of the most developed remote banking networks in Russia is considered to be ‚ÄúATM banking‚Äù and the use of banking devices - these include a network of terminals and ATMs.  The level of the most widespread and recognizable institution in terms of the number of branches and ATMs is occupied by Sberbank, in which remote banking services are considered to be one of the most developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="use of remote banking systems" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/922012.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Development of RBS in Russia </h2><p>  In <span>neighboring countries, the</span> RBS is several steps higher than in Russia.  At the moment, the development of remote banking services is in a somewhat frozen state.  The problem is that neither the banking system, nor the population are ready for such significant changes.  For a somewhat volatile financial situation, excessive cash investments will be unreasonable.  A large number of settlements do not have normal Internet access, not to mention the level of computer use by the older generation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="development of remote banking" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35048/920048.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such innovations as video communication with a bank employee or a complete transition to Internet banking, we can see in the near future unless in Moscow or large regional centers.  Currently, the use of remote banking systems in Russia is aimed at improving the security system and achieving a higher level of service. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of RBS </h2><p>  As in other countries, Russian banking remote service has one main drawback: it is a security system.  Hacking an account and stealing funds from any user's personal account is considered too easy for an experienced programmer.  Despite the fact that banks are constantly improving their system, nevertheless there are scammers who can crack any security system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disadvantages of remote banking" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35048/920047.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The bottom line is that the bank invests enough money to protect its data from intruders, but at the same time, customer funds are under attack.  This is due to the fact that they invest a minimum of funds in the customer‚Äôs channel protection system, because these costs are borne by the client. </p>
