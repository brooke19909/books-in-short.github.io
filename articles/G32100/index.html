Recently, it has been leaking out literally everywhere, from applications to web services.  You can‚Äôt even take a step on the same YouTube without stumbling upon yet another extremely ‚Äúattractive‚Äù offer to buy something or use some services. </p><p>  Therefore, many users are asking a completely logical question: ‚ÄúHow to remove pop-up advertising windows on Android?‚Äù  In addition to the fact that banners and teasers bother owners of smartphones and tablets, they also load the local set of chipsets - RAM with a processor.  This not only slows down the operation of applications, but also reduces the autonomy of the gadget, and also consumes Internet traffic. </p><p>  We‚Äôll try to find out how to remove <span>pop-up</span> ads on an Android device and do it as painlessly as possible for the device and for the user himself.  Consider the basic tools and methods for implementing this enterprise. </p><h2>  Free adblocker browser </h2><p>  First, let's figure out how to remove pop-up windows on Android that appear on websites.  Many advanced users recommend using a special browser - Free Adblocker for these purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Free adblocker browser" class="if uuid-3220722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220722.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, the browser creates the most comfortable web surfing, removing annoying advertising, which is replete with almost every site.  The application has several advantages over other analogs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The program not only allows you to remove pop-ups on your Android phone, but also blocks other unwanted elements: promo videos, banners, commercial links, etc. In addition, the utility prohibits the loading of cookies into the device‚Äôs memory and quickly alerts you to any threats site. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the program helps not only to disable pop-ups on Android, but also significantly increases the battery life of the gadget, and at the same time reduces traffic consumption.  In addition, after installing the application, web pages open much faster. </p><h2>  Adguard content blocker </h2><p>  This product also allows you to remove pop-ups on Android.  But it has some limitations regarding browsers.  The utility works only with browsers from Samsung and Yandex.  On other browsers, stable operation, alas, is not guaranteed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Adguard content blocker" class="if uuid-3220723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220723.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the limitations, the product is enviable among a large number of users.  Firstly, the application is distributed free of charge and is free from annoying advertising of other products of the developer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Secondly, the program allows not only to remove pop-ups on Android tablets, but also saves up to 79% of traffic, which is extremely attractive for mobile platforms with limited Internet tariffs. </p><p>  Well and the third, it is flexible functionality.  The abundance of settings pleases even the most fastidious users, offering a lot of individual presets, ranging from the appearance of the utility to the filtering of unwanted web elements. </p><h2>  Netguard </h2><p>  This is a more global tool.  Mobile firewall tools not only allow you to remove pop-up windows on Android, but also control all network connections.  Judging by the reviews of advanced users, the utility does not track user actions and does not transmit information to third parties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Net guard" class="if uuid-3220724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220724.jpg"></div><p>  The program supports all the necessary network connection protocols - Pv4 and IPv6.  There were no complaints regarding the stability of the product.  The application feels great both on the old classic Android platforms, and on new proprietary shells. </p><p>  Also worth noting is the intuitive and simple interface of the program.  If the settings of the previous product are easily confused, then in the case of NetGuard there are no such problems.  So even a beginner in this business will cope with filters and other presets. </p><h2>  Addons detector </h2><p>  This is an anti-virus product that fights aggressive advertising and other unwanted elements.  The latter, as a rule, arbitrarily integrate into browsers or platform software.  If your notification bar and desktop are filled with some left-handed applications, messages, shortcuts and the same pop-ups, then Addons Detector will come in handy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Addons detector" class="if uuid-3220725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220725.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the product will notify the user of any problems with the installed programs: the contents of worms, trojans and adware viruses.  The utility interface cannot be called complicated or confusing, so there should not be any serious issues regarding the configuration. </p><h2>  Malwarebytes Anti-Malware </h2><p>  It is also a powerful anti-virus product that allows not only to remove pop-ups on Android, but also helps to neutralize other elements dangerous to the operating system: trojans, worms, banners, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Malwarebytes Anti-Malware" class="if uuid-3220726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220726.jpg"></div><p>  After the first launch, the program will scan your device for vulnerabilities and take control of important system files, as well as RAM.  One of the main advantages of the product is its undemanding set of gadget chipsets.  The utility works stably and fairly quickly even on older smartphones and tablets. </p><p>  The program is also not picky about the Android firmware version.  The only negative that users often complain about is their own commercial banners advertising other developer products.  Although not aggressive, they sometimes interfere with the normal operation of the application.  In any case, the product is distributed free of charge, so you can tolerate while scanning the device. </p><h2>  AD Detector </h2><p>  This is a detector based on almost all well-known advertising elements, including annoying pop-ups.  The utility database is regularly updated with new virus signatures, so that protection is organized by relevant tools and methods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="AD Detector" class="if uuid-3220727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3220727.jpg"></div><p>  Advanced users (typesetters, developers) use this application as an addition to the main anti-virus product, but only the installed AD Detector is enough for the ordinary owner of a mobile gadget. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the utility copes with pop-up blocking very well.  The application interface is ascetic, so there‚Äôs nothing to deal with.  Simply run the program and check the box in the content blocking window (prohibit banners, windows, links, etc.). </p><h2>  Features of the work of ad blockers </h2><p>  Applications of this plan are most effective when administrator privileges are set on the mobile gadget.  The fact is that some, especially aggressive virus elements embed their code in system files and applications. </p><p>  For lack of root rights, ad blockers have their hands tied, and the maximum that they can do is simply scan the device for unwanted code.  Yes, sometimes they block pop-ups, but by no means in all cases. </p><p>  The software described above, in principle, does not require administrator rights, but the effectiveness of the blockers is noticeably reduced. </p><h2>  Suspicious applications </h2><p>  If you do not want to communicate with third-party software and clog your gadget with unnecessary utilities, then it is worthwhile to audit the installed products.  To do this, go to "Settings" and open the "Application Manager". </p><p>  If you think that you have a suspicious program, you need to click on it, after which a page with information about this product will open.  System files cannot be deleted in this way, so you will not cause serious harm in the event of a platform audit. </p>
