If necessary, an extra bed can be added to the room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The number of rooms is represented by standard category apartments in the amount of 131 units, each area is 20 square meters.
