It is located high above the Tauber River Valley.  The name of the city of Rothenburg comes from the merger of the two German words rot ("red") and burg ("fortress") and literally translates as "red fortress".  There is no red fortress in this area, however, the roofs of all houses in the city of this color, probably because of this it was named in this way.  The location above the Tauber river valley added a piece of ob der Tauber to the name, and today its full name is Rothenburg ob der Tauber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rothenburg on tauber" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/459332.jpg" width="600"></div>

He received the status of the city in 942.  Until 1108, he was in the possession of the counts of Rothenburg-Komburgsky, and after the death of the last representative of this kind passed by testament to the Komburgsky monastery.  However, eight years later, Henry V presents Rothenburg ob der Tauber to the Duke of Swabian, his nephew from the Hohenstaufen dynasty.  Since then, a new era begins in the development of this city: fortified walls and other fortifications are being built, new houses of three and four floors, squares, pavements, etc. appear. Most of them, thanks to the concerns of the owners and local residents, have survived to our days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rothenburg on tauber" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/461075.jpg" width="232"></div>

    <h2>  "Master's Sip" saved Rothenburg from ruin </h2><p>  In the 70s of the 13th century, Rothenburg ob der Tauber became a free <span>imperial city,</span> growing and extending beyond the walls of the fortress.  There is a need for the construction of new protective structures.  By the beginning of the 14th century, Rothenburg was considered one of the 20 largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire.  Its population by this time amounted to about 6,000 people, who mainly professed Protestantism.  It was because of faith that the city was embroiled in a 30-year war between Catholics and Protestants, during which it was badly damaged.  According to legend, Rothenburg was saved from ruin by the burgomaster Georg Nush, who fulfilled the condition of the invaders - he drank 3.5 liters of wine in one gulp.  The story of the "masterful sip" of the burgomaster is recorded in the annals of the city.  In memory of this event, locals annually organize festivities that begin with a theatrical performance called "Magic Drink." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rothenburg on tauber photo" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/459335.jpg" width="600"></div>

As a result of this, his economy suffered great losses, he lost his former independence and moved to the <span>lands of Bavaria.</span>  However, by the beginning of the 19th century, when a railway was laid to the city, it again began to revive due to tourism.  The beauty of the small provincial town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber (photo can be seen in the article) and its fabulous atmosphere attracted artists, musicians, writers and poets.  Entire crowds of tourists sought to visit places sung by famous poets, to see firsthand the beauty captured on the canvases of talented artists, etc. The wise city authorities realized that luck and prosperity depended on the preservation of the medieval appearance, and decided to completely abandon modernization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rothenburg at Tauber Attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/459334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Another city salvation </h2><p>  During the Second World War, danger reappeared over the city.  Some buildings were destroyed by aerial shells.  But, like 300 years ago, the city was saved from complete destruction, this time thanks to the American General John McCloy, who was subsequently granted the honorary title of "Noble Defender of Rothenburg." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rothenburg on tauber how to get from Munich" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/459333.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How can I get there? </h2><p>  This beautiful town, part of the federal state of Bavaria, is located in the center of the German Romantic Road, the most popular tourist destination in Germany.  It stretches from Main to alpine peaks.  Along the way there are ancient castles, cozy and well-preserved cities with medieval architecture, etc. However, many tourists want to visit Rothenburg ob der Tauber.  How to get from Munich <span>(the capital of Bavaria)</span> to this town?  The distance between them is 204 km.  If desired, you can take a <span>trip by car</span> or bus.  However, as already noted above, a railway was laid to the city, therefore, from Munich you can also come here by train. </p><h2>  Things to do in Rothenburg ob der Tauber </h2><p>  Rothenburg is a kind of <span>open-air museum.</span>  Its uniqueness lies in the preservation of its integrity as a <span>medieval city.</span>  Here you will not find a single modern building.  City Hall (built in 1419), market square, central <span>Gothic</span> St. Jacob's <span>Cathedral</span> (1311), narrow streets, brightly painted houses with balconies decorated with flowers, and windows with carved shutters and lace curtains, winding ramparts around the perimeter cities, manicured fields and meadows behind them - such a beautiful Rothenburg ob der Tauber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rothenburg on tauber" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/459331.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <p>  One of the main attractions of Rothenburg is the unique Museum of Christmas decorations, and in the chambers of the Benedictine Convent there is a Museum of Local Lore, the main exposition of which is an exhibition of armor and weapons.  In the southern part of the fortress in the park of Burggarant is the ancient chapel of St. Blasius.  Along the walls you can also find many interesting buildings, and from the walls - look at the beautiful panorama of the surrounding area and the Tauber River valley.  The atmosphere of the Middle Ages is created most of all by the cozy P√∂llein square.  However, here every centimeter is saturated with antiquity.  Walking through the streets of the city, you involuntarily plunge into the Middle Ages, and with a knock, you freeze waiting to meet knights in armor, riding horses or women in old costumes and a veil on their faces due to turning. </p>
