Stylish and powerful smartphone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now, the ZTE Nubia Z5 smartphone will be presented to your attention.  And we have to find out what it is.  Many claim that this phone is a real "beast" among its counterparts.  And everyone and everyone should buy it.  However, sometimes you can also find reviews saying that buying a ZTE Nubia Z5 is a stupid and useless action.  Allegedly, you just throw money away.  And how do you understand what our current model of smartphone really is?  To be honest, only a clear analysis of all the opinions expressed on this phone will help here.  It is also worth considering that the quality of equipment is judged on the basis of many specific criteria.  Perhaps, if you try to figure out what customers think about the ZTE Nubia Z5 with respect to each factor, then you can really understand what kind of smartphone we are dealing with.  Let‚Äôs try to do this, while considering the characteristics of the proposed technology. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  For example, it‚Äôs worth starting with a concept such as screen size and quality.  The thing is that this indicator often reflects most of the capabilities of a modern phone.  The ZTE Nubia Z5 display, according to the manufacturer, is of excellent quality.  So good that it is simply impossible to find better.  But is it really so?  Or is it just loud promises before us? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z5" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To be honest, not at all.  Indeed, as many users assure, the <span>ZTE</span> Nubia Z5 also has a beautiful display.  Let's start with its size.  It is 5 inches diagonal.  For a modern smartphone, this is the norm.  Although sometimes potential buyers give preference to smaller models.  On such a phone it is very convenient to play, read, and also browse the Internet. </p><p>  Of course, the brightness of colors is also present here.  They say that this screen can transmit us up to 16 million colors.  Just what you need for excellent image quality.  We can say that when working with the ZTE Nubia Z5, you watch a LCD TV with a Full-HD picture. </p><p>  The resolution of this model is also quite good.  Moreover, it is considered large among analogues.  After all, you get a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels with ZTE Nubia Max.  In principle, this should be enough to watch high-quality films in excellent quality.  This is often what many buyers crave.  It‚Äôs not good when Full-HD quality is not visible.  But there will be no such problems with our smartphone today.  No way. </p><p>  Also at ZTE Nubia Z5 the touchscreen is also notable for its quality.  It responds to touch quickly, accurately and without misfires.  And you don‚Äôt have to press the screen hard.  A light touch is enough.  So, as you can see, everything is in order with our current smartphone model.  But this is only the first selection criterion.  There are still a lot of important points that can affect the final decision when buying. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  System and processor </h2><p>  The next two very important indicators are the operating system of the selected smartphone, as well as processor power.  To be honest, without taking these features into account, you can buy absolutely any phone - there will be no difference.  Is that in the price.  But if you need this technique as a multifunctional device, you will have to pay special attention to the processor and system. </p><p>  In order to comfortably work with the phone, as well as quickly receive a response from it, you need a powerful processor.  In addition, if it is important for you to launch various new programs and games on your smartphone, you will have to worry about the operating system.  The newer it is, the better. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the ZTE Nubia Z5 firmware is quite good.  And the version of the operating system is also pleasing.  Now it is "Android 4.1".  To be honest, you can find a smartphone with a newer version.  But if quality is important to you, then this is not worth it.  Indeed, in our current model there is the possibility of updating the system.  So, with the help of the Internet and a certain period of time (no more than 30 minutes), you can update your "OS" to the latest version.  And all this without prejudice to the hardware and the phone‚Äôs performance.  In principle, if you do not chase the latest innovations in applications and games, then ‚ÄúAndroid 4.1‚Äù is a great solution. </p><p>  Regarding the processor, we can say that it has average performance.  Yes, now you can easily and simply find yourself an option with a higher clock frequency.  But in terms of quality and speed, the processor of the ZTE Nubia Z5 is considered one of the best.  By purchasing this device, you will get 4 cores with a frequency of 1.5 GHz.  This is enough to simultaneously launch 10 different applications or games, as well as for the functioning of the Internet and a music player.  Just what the modern buyer needs.  However, in its power, our today's smartphone is noticeably inferior to its counterpart - Samsung Galaxy S4.  But far from all indicators.  But only on the processor.  Otherwise, as buyers assure, ZTE Nubia Z5 is better several times.  But is it really so?  Let's try to deal with you in this difficult question. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z9" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952986.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  There is another important parameter that even schoolchildren are now paying attention to.  This is nothing but the memory of a telephone.  Both operational and conventional.  Without these indicators, it is impossible to imagine the quality work of a powerful processor.  After all, if you do not have enough memory, then you can not even hope for the speed of the system.  Even if it is powerful, fast initially, as well as high-quality.  And how are things going with the ZTE Nubia Z9 (or Z5 - the differences are mainly in design only)? </p><p>  Honestly, it‚Äôs worthy.  After all, the RAM in this smartphone is 2 gigabytes.  Yes, you can find models with a large indicator.  However, it is often extremely difficult to find a balance between processor power and RAM.  And this, of course, leaves its mark on the performance of the equipment.  Thus, a smartphone with a 4-core processor and 1.5 GHz clock speed goes well with 2 GB of RAM.  As already mentioned, the smartphone will simply perfectly respond to your "calls" to action.  And with all this, there will be no need to worry that the system will begin to "slow down". </p><p>  In addition, regular memory is also an important indicator.  That is a space that can be used for personal data.  The ZTE Nubia Z9 (and its analogues) now costs 32 gigabytes of free memory.  And of these, approximately 2 GB is given to the Android operating system.  There are about 30 left.  And this is enough for a modern user.  But just not a music lover or gamer.  In practice, it is noticeable that a special memory card is usually inserted into ordinary memory.  It adds free space, and also allows data to become mobile - they took out a card, moved it to another phone - and use it further. </p><p>  It should be noted that the ZTE Nubia Z5S does not support the ability to connect miscroSD.  Anyway, in this model there is no connector for additional memory.  That is, you will be severely limited in space.  Yes, often 30 GB is enough for users, but if you like to play or listen to music in excellent quality, you will have to moderate your ardor.  Otherwise, there will not be enough system resources for the phone to function.  In truth, many users try to abandon the ZTE Nubia Z5S precisely because of the small amount of space.  More precisely, since in this model there is no way to connect additional memory.  This is extremely inconvenient.  In principle, if you do not plan to "clog up" your phone, then the proposed place should be more than enough for you.  So we‚Äôll go with you to other indicators that may affect the decision to purchase a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z5s" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952987.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Modern phones are multifunctional devices.  So, at least there should be a camera in them.  And pretty good.  After all, a normal modern smartphone replaces the camera, and also allows you to shoot video in good quality.  And how are things going with the ZTE <span>Nubia Z5 (Mini</span> or equivalents)? </p><p>  The thing is that with respect to this indicator, buyers express their admiration.  After all, our current model is specially equipped with two cameras.  Such an opportunity is not present everywhere.  On this smartphone you can see the front camera.  She is a great helper for selfies, as well as when talking on a video call.  However, in terms of quality, the front camera is not the best of its kind - only 1.9 megapixels.  After all, it is now extremely common models of smartphones with a 2MP front-end camera, or even more.  In principle, this is enough for talking and taking a selfie.  After all, the main camera plays a more important role. </p><p>  And with her in our model everything is in perfect order.  A conventional camera on the ZTE Nubia Z5 (Mini or equivalents) is notable for its quality.  It is 13 megapixels.  This is an average for a modern phone.  Sometimes there are models with 15-16 megapixels.  Only now it is difficult to find them.  Yes and no need at all.  After all, 13 megapixels is a great indicator.  Now far from all cameras and camcorders (amateur) have this quality of shooting. </p><p>  In addition, we will be able to shoot video in Full-HD format.  With all this, some inconvenience will still appear.  The whole problem is that the ZTE Nubia, a review of which is presented to our attention, as mentioned earlier, does not have the ability to attach additional memory.  Of course, the high quality of the clips, as well as the photos, requires a lot of free space.  Planning to use your smartphone as a camera or camcorder, and even without constantly cleaning up unnecessary files?  Then you have to abandon the Nubia Z5.  After all, with such use, the place on the phone will end extremely quickly.  But in the event that you plan to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the camera only if necessary, as well as if you are not too lazy to conduct continuous cleaning, you can turn your attention to this model.  Indeed, in many respects it really deserves a good place in the market of modern technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z5 mini" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952988.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  Also, the rear (main) camera has its advantages.  In addition to high quality, you can detect the flash, as well as autofocus.  It will help to make your pictures high-quality and without streaks.  So you can hope that your video and photos will turn out to be extremely beautiful and unforgettable thanks to the rear camera on our today's smartphone. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Plus, some particularly picky buyers when choosing a smartphone pay great attention to the size of the device.  Current phones are distinguished by their overall dimensions.  And not everyone likes it.  But if you want to play on the big screen, you have to make some sacrifices. </p><p>  The ZTE Nubia Z5 is not cumbersome.  After all, it is not very long and wide.  In addition, this model has an extremely small thickness.  Some buyers call it ultrathin.  But what are the indicators in this area? </p><p>  In length, our smartphone reaches only 138 millimeters.  For a modern smartphone, this is an average.  After all, often now models from 142 millimeters appear on store shelves.  The width of the "body" is 6.9 centimeters.  Also not very much.  But not a little.  Enough for comfortable work with the device.  But the thickness of this model is small - only 7.6 millimeters.  This model is convenient to hold in your hands, as well as carry in your pocket. </p><p>  Physical indicators of the screen (except for the diagonal) are often also important for buyers.  ZTE Nubia has the following features: </p><ul><li>  screen size - 62 by 110 millimeters; </li><li>  diagonal - 12.7 centimeters; </li><li>  resolution - 1080p. </li></ul><p>  To be honest, this is enough to watch the video, as well as comfortable work with the device.  Yes, you can find yourself a more bulky model.  Only now talking on it will be extremely uncomfortable.  And with Nubia Z5 everything in this regard is in perfect order.  So there is no doubt - the dimensions of our current model are acceptable even for the smallest female pen. </p><h2>  Communication support </h2><p>  If you have not forgotten, then the main task of any phone is communication.  And the ZTE Nubia smartphone has very interesting indicators in this regard.  It should be noted right away that this model is not only suitable for multimedia, but also excellent in relation to the supported communication options. </p><p>  For example, it has GPS and GPRS.  Now it‚Äôs hard to imagine a phone without the support of these networks.  Also, among the means of communication, they note the possibility of connecting <span>to 3G</span> and even to 4G.  True, the latter option is far from functioning in the best way.  Some minor glitches are observed.  This is not so scary - very soon 4G networks will work on smartphones without interruptions and malfunctions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z5 firmware" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952989.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, special attention should be paid to the presence on the phone of at least 3 more types of networks.  This is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and also USB.  Fortunately, all of this is in our model today.  Moreover, Bluetooth is the latest version - 4.0.  What does it mean?  When transferring data via Bluetooth, you can hope for a fast and high-quality flow of the process.  Compared to other versions of this connection, the difference is visible to the naked eye.  However, to notice it, you need to try to transfer data through Bluetooth 4.0 with your own hands. </p><p>  In addition, the quality of the entire connection (with the exception of rare 4G incidents) is pleasing.  You will receive a good signal, and you can also hope that there will be no network failures and malfunctions.  In addition, the smartphone picks up the network even in the most remote places.  For example, in basements or elevators.  So you can always stay in touch.  This is exactly what any person who buys a phone needs. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  It's no secret that another extremely important indicator for any smartphone is the battery charge.  Many manufacturers are tormented by the fact that their offspring quickly run out of energy.  And, as a result, buyers leave far from the best reviews about such models. </p><p>  ZTE Nubia Max (or analogues), to be honest, have far from the best battery.  Nevertheless, it is still considered to be of high quality.  Indeed, in standby mode, the smartphone works for a month and a half, while talking (systematic) - about three weeks.  But in the case of active use, it all depends on each user.  But on average, without recharging, this model is able to last about 3 days.  This is quite a normal indicator for a modern phone.  But such a period will only be possible if you play a lot, browse the Internet, and also listen to music all the time. </p><p>  In addition, the ZTE Nubia has a standard charger connector.  And the ‚Äúcharger‚Äù itself is quite small.  You can always take it with you on the road or travel.  It will fit even in a <span>female clutch.</span>  So if you are afraid that you will not have enough battery power on the way, then you can take a device for charging with you, and then use it when you get to the first outlet you get. </p><p>  By the way, our today's model is charging very quickly.  In a state of battery charge of 0% (if the smartphone turns off and does not turn on), you will have to wait only 1.5 hours.  After that, you can use the phone again.  Basically, most modern phones now charge for about 120 minutes.  So the ZTE Nubia Z5 has a significant advantage in this regard. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  But this is far from everything that potential buyers can turn their attention to.  In addition to all these items, the ‚Äúappearance‚Äù of the device also plays an important role.  It is believed that sometimes it is able to impose the brand of low-quality and unpopular goods on a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia specifications" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952991.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How's the Nubia Z5 doing?  The thing is that this model has far from the most elaborate design.  Nevertheless, it pleases many buyers.  A kind of minimalism with a velvet tint.  Initially, several color options were provided - white, black and gray.  However, each buyer has a great opportunity to change the design to their taste.  After all, removable panels come to the rescue.  They are not included in the configuration, but separately such gizmos are sold everywhere.  So you can easily and simply choose your own different colors, as well as options with print or photos.  That is, independently create your own original design.  This is a fairly common technique with many manufacturers.  Just remember - all the panels are made of plastic.  So to keep the phone in working condition and without scratches, you need a cover.  For ZTE Nubia, this is not such a problem right now.  After all, a cover is included in the standard equipment.  Yes, and you can buy it separately at any hardware store. </p><h2>  Component Repair </h2><p>  So, we have already figured out the characteristics of the smartphone.  But there are still some points that can affect the final decision to purchase our today's product.  For example, repair of its components. </p><p>  It's no secret that over time, different details break down in phones.  And they need to be changed in a timely manner.  Otherwise, you will not be able to work normally with the device.  A fairly popular problem on Nubia is the display replacement.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The thing is that it works well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when dropped, it is easily damaged. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially if the smartphone falls from a great height. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the replacement of the display in this case is simply necessary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cost of such a service is about 3-4 thousand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The price tag, as you see, is quite high here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same applies to the repair of other parts.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This fact is extremely upsetting customers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, initially ZTE Nubia is not so cheap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, if you pay a solid amount once, and then use a high-quality smartphone for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you regularly pay for the replacement of the components of the phone, and even in such quantities, then it‚Äôs more advisable to just buy a cheaper model for the same 4 thousand rubles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, the repair of our today's smartphone may be needed only if the operating rules are not followed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or after approximately 5 years of service.</font></font></p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Price tag and impressions </font></font></h2><p> The last point that can only be distinguished when choosing equipment is the <span>price tag for the goods.</span>  To be honest, this criterion is almost at the very beginning of the equipment selection process.  It‚Äôs good if we have a really good and high-quality model in front of us - it‚Äôs not a pity for money.  But I do not really want to overpay for the cheap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zte nubia z5 display" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/952990.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <p>  The ZTE Nubia Z5 has an average price.  As many buyers say, it could be lower.  After all, this smartphone has its own significant drawbacks.  In particular, those that are found on phones today are extremely rare.  For example, the inability to connect a memory card, costly component repair.  On average, you can buy Nubia for about 17-20 thousand rubles.  When ordering online, you can often buy it for 13-14 thousand.  In principle, not such a large amount for a powerful and stylish smartphone. </p><p>  In general, buyers are satisfied with this model.  Of course, there were some flaws, but we have already taken them into account.  Should I pay attention to this product?  If the budget allows, then yes.  Otherwise, you can always pick up a cheaper analogue.  No need to think that the ZTE Nubia Z5 is the best smartphone in the world for which you can pay the last money.  Yes, this model is really worthy, but it is not so good as to rush to buy it right away.  Weigh carefully all the pros and cons, only then draw the final conclusion. </p>
