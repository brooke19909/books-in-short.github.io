Nokia Phones with QWERTY Keyboard</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nokia devices with QWERTY keyboards were once very popular.  They were ideally suited for communication on social networks and correspondence via SMS messages.  However, in our age of smartphones with huge touch screens, there are those who want to buy a Nokia phone with a keyboard.  And there are quite a lot of such people.  Therefore, you need to talk about the best models. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia with keyboard" class="if uuid-3246579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246579.jpg"></div><h2>  "Nokia Asha 200" </h2><p>  The Asha line was born in 2011.  Then this device made a real revolution.  Kilometer queues lined up behind him.  Still would.  Nokia Asha 200 was equipped with an excellent screen, it worked very fast.  But most importantly - she had a full-fledged physical keyboard.  It was her presence that forced users to purchase this device.  The phone was able to work with 2G and 3G networks.  There was a very good built-in browser.  As the operating system, the legendary S40 platform was used.  Of course, the functionality in this phone was less than in modern smartphones, but for 2011 this was quite enough.  It was one of the best variations of Nokia with a keyboard.  Even in our time, many flaunt this rare device.  By the way, this model was equipped with a very good camera.  She knew how to take decent pictures.  And many liked it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia phone with keyboard" class="if uuid-3246582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246582.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on "Nokia Asha 200" </h2><p>  Now about what users say about this interesting device.  It is worth noting that there are a lot of those who purchased this device for themselves.  And almost all of them speak about the device in a positive way.  Almost everything suits them.  The phone works very fast, texts are typed at lightning speed, the sound in the headphones is decent.  The only upset for the owners is that this Nokia with a keyboard does not support modern applications. And this is really a problem. Although for those who want to purchase this device, applications do not play any role. The quality of communication is important to them. There are no problems. He catches the network where modern smartphones are powerless. And this can be considered the most important advantage of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forsale16.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone with a quarter keyboard" class="if uuid-3246587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246587.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia E71 </h2><p>  The coolest device "Nokia" with a quarter-keyboard.  At one time, many dreamed of him.  He appeared in 2009 and at that time looked like an incredibly innovative device.  The device had a high-quality TFT screen, an excellent camera, an excellent transmitter and a mechanical keyboard.  All this made the device very attractive.  Also, the device has a very interesting camera.  The number of megapixels does not shine, but at the same time manages to make high-quality pictures.  That's just in the twilight of it is no use.  Although modern budget smartphones with a camera are exactly the same.  This "Nokia" with a full keyboard also features an incredibly responsive interface.  The device does not think for a second before opening any menu.  Although he is already quite a few years old.  So if you want to buy a phone with a keyboard, then this is still a very good option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="forums.vrzone.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://forums.vrzone.com/handphones-gadgets-garage/529740-nokia-e71-white.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia with a quarter keyboard" class="if uuid-3246589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246589.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia E71 Reviews </h2><p>  At the time, the owners of this model idolized the phone.  But now he has a catastrophic lack of functionality: there is no 3G support, you cannot work with applications and so on.  But those who still have this device, claim that it excellently catches the network and copes even where new smartphones can not do anything.  For many, this is still the most important.  And let's not forget about the battery life.  These devices are able to live almost a week from a single charge!  These are not modern smartphones with one and a half days of autonomy.  The phone is perfect for those who want to constantly be in touch and ready to sacrifice for this the modern options of expensive smartphones.  It is worth noting that there are quite a few such people.  Therefore, phones with a querty keyboard are still popular.  But they, unfortunately, are not able to overtake modern smartphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knowyourmobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia asha" class="if uuid-3246590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246590.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia C3 </h2><p>  One more legendary device from "those very times".  The phone has good features and a very advanced operating system.  There is built-in support for the most popular (in the past) instant messengers.  However, the phone does not support modern applications.  But this is understandable.  Then there was no such technology.  However, there is a noticeable difference from the previously reviewed devices - the built-in Wi-Fi module.  It allows you to connect to wireless Internet and not consume SIM card traffic.  However, 3G support in the smartphone, unfortunately, is not.  This will probably upset some users.  But at the same time, this has a positive effect on the autonomy of the device.  The device is able to live on one battery charge for 5 days.  For modern smartphones, this is an unattainable figure.  This Nokia phone with keyboard also has a camera.  But it can be considered solely as an ‚Äúinterior item‚Äù.  She doesn‚Äôt know how to shoot at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="toolsmust.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="full keyboard nokia" class="if uuid-3246592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3246592.jpg"></div><h2>  Nokia C3 Reviews </h2><p>  The owners of this wonderful device note that he has an incredibly responsive keyboard.  Typing messages with her help is sheer pleasure.  Also, many are pleased that the device perfectly catches the network even in the most remote places.  Many people like working with this device also because it provides the highest sound quality during a conversation.  And that is a fact.  This "Nokia" with a keyboard really looks good against the background of its colleagues.  And this is another reason to purchase this phone.  Moreover, it can easily handle calls and SMS messages.  And with some modification, even suitable for communication on social networks.  However, you should not rely on any special functions.  The device is quite old.  But it will work well.  Previously, Nokia was able to make high-quality and reliable phones. </p><h2>  Which phone to choose? </h2><p>  The answer to this question should be based on specific user preferences.  However, based on practical considerations, compared to all of the above devices, the Nokia Asha 200 looks the most profitable option. This device is not as old as everyone else, and supports a fair amount of modern communication standards.  Of course, LTE will not be there either.  But 3G is definitely present.  Therefore, Asha is the first bidder for the purchase. </p><p>  Externally, the phone is noticeably different from modern smartphones, and it will be to the delight of those who just want to stand out from the crowd.  In addition, this device has a completely modern hardware (albeit not very powerful).  Therefore, problems with work should not arise.  All other models discussed in this review are suitable only for those who like old phones.  However, in terms of functionality, they are very far from what they are offering now.  In addition, old devices support exclusively outdated communication standards, which may adversely affect the process of use.  Therefore, you need to understand that although they are very good, they will not be of much use. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So to summarize.  We tried to find the best Nokia phone with a keyboard.  We have considered the most popular (in the past) models.  Among them there are very interesting and legendary phones, for which at one time lined up kilometer queues.  But now it is nothing more than fragments of the past.  Although very glorious.  Most of all, the notorious Nokia Asha 200 is suitable for acquiring in modern realities. When working with this phone, the user will not feel any discomfort.  Yes, and communication via 3G will also be present.  But this is the most important thing.  But it is worth noting that this phone receives a signal much better than modern smartphones.  And therefore, it is suitable for those who want to constantly stay in touch.  Under any conditions. </p>
