So, some tourists expressed the wish that the food was varied, but even they agree that the choice of dishes here is scarce. </p><p>  Pleased travelers and hotel staff.  All the staff here are very polite, friendly and quick.

However, having basic knowledge of the English language, you can communicate without problems. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel made a positive impression on most vacationers.  There is always a sufficient number of sunbeds and umbrellas for everyone.

The sea is very clean, warm and pleasant. </p><p>  Also, a lot of enthusiastic comments from our compatriots relate to the entertainment program that the Sultan of Dreams hotel offers its guests.  So, in addition to an interesting daytime animation, evening shows are held daily with invited artists.
