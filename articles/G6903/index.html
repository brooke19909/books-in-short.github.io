The origin of the name is directly related to the concept of the establishment: opening the door, the guest enters the interior resembling a sauna.  Along the walls here you can see the arranged shops, under the bar - salt bricks.  The working smoke machine enhances the effect.  But undressing in the bar, it turns out, is not necessary. </p>
