As in the girl from birth, at the genetic level, the maternal instinct is laid, so in most representatives of the weaker sex the instinct of the hostess is laid.  Therefore, girls sew dresses for their dolls, like to swaddle and cradle baby dolls, and dream of doll houses. </p><p>  <strong>House for barbie</strong> </p>

Moreover, bright, elegant houses for doll beauties and their halves - Kenov - became a real temptation for them.  But in the whole post-Soviet space they were very expensive, they were available literally to a few, and many enterprising parents learned how to make a house and a crib for toys themselves.  And very successful in this!  And therefore, before talking about how to make furniture for Barbie with your own hands, we will make a house for her.  If she‚Äôs already at a suitable age, bring her daughter to the process: it will be fun, interesting, and will contribute to your communication.

    <ol><li>  Take a large cardboard box, square or rectangular.  Square is better, because  "Furnish" a future apartment in it is more convenient. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself house for Barbie" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/86347.jpg" width="400"></div>  How many windows will there be in a room?  Draw the appropriate number of rectangles and cut out the holes.  As glass, you can use transparent tape.  And glue the tulle pieces from the old curtain, too, with adhesive tape inside - here you have the curtains!  Also, if desired, make curtains.  Only at first, if the daughter has a desire, paste the box on the inside with wallpaper.  So the house will look much more beautiful and more comfortable! </li><li>  Now let's think about how to make Barbie furniture with our own hands and where to arrange it.  Based on this, we plan the functional areas of the room.  Cardboard is also suitable for a bed.  It is strong enough to withstand a light doll.  Take a piece so long that it is slightly larger than Barbie herself, and also wide enough.  Draw 2 lines on the surface: they indicate the width of the bed and the ‚Äúlegs‚Äù.  Carefully bend the edges of the cardboard inward along the line, then straighten them slightly.  What happened?  Great sofa, isn't it?  Here is the first example of how to make furniture for Barbie with your own hands. </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="furniture for barbie" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/86346.jpg" width="400"></div>  Put the crib in the sleeping area.  If there is a flap of colored thick material, make a carpet out of it and hang it over the bed.  Or do it easier.  Let her daughter simply draw it on the album sheet, paint, cut and paste on the right place.  You should not worry about bedding: a small pillow can be sewn, and material from mother's stocks will be suitable for sheets and blankets. </li><li>  But we continue our experiments in the field of how to make furniture for Barbie with our own hands.  If your daughter is friends with a thread and a needle, she must have found a lot of outfits for her darling.  And they need to be put somewhere.  Therefore we make a cabinet or chest for a doll dowry.  Small cardboard packaging or boxes from any household appliances will play the role of auxiliary material.  Or plastic boxes, chests from your cosmetics, if any.  In a word, when dealing with a chest, experiment how to make furniture for Barbie with your own hands, how to decorate it better to get stylish and elegant. </li><li>  Advice along the way: both the bed and the chest cabinet can be painted with ordinary paint for painting, depict stylish patterns or instructions on the outside of the chest cover.  And from the inside, paste it with chocolate foil - why not a mirror? </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade dollhouse furniture" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/86359.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, we continue to make furniture for Barbie.  We will now arrange the <span>dining area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe</span> room by making a table and chair.  We master the chair in the likeness of a sofa, not forgetting the back.  We paint in the same color as the crib with the chest.  We cover with a shred of material - this will be a plaid.  The flap of the same color can be used as a bedspread.  A table will be good if you use round or rectangular boxes of butter or cheese as its quality.  Tablecloth, of course, required! </li><li>  So practically you made a house for Barbie with your own hands!  Some little things remain: rugs - small by the bed and large in the middle of the room, closer to the table, several bright spots in the form of paintings on the walls, a couple of small toys from Kinder surprises as decoration on the chest.  These cute trifles will give the house a residential look, create an atmosphere of comfort of a real home.  By the way, if desired, you can draw a flaming fireplace on one of the walls and put a table with an armchair closer to it! </li></ol><p>  Let your daughter rejoice at a beautiful toy made together with you with such love and diligence! </p>
