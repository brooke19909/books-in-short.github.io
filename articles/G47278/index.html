  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is led technology in monitors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many years, computer monitors were created on the same principle as televisions.  Differences, of course, were, but, rather, of an evolutionary nature.  For example, the dot (grain) size of monitors was much smaller than that of televisions, and the horizontal and vertical frequencies were different.  High resolution can also be attributed here.  Still, not too much as we would like.  However, progress does not stand still, so a new image display technology was proposed, which made a quiet revolution in the field of television and monitor engineering.  Now the 21st century is outside the window, and liquid crystal monitors (TFT, LCD, led display) have finally settled on the tables of computer owners. </p><p>  The basis of such a monitor is a matrix.  In fact, it is a huge field of thousands of pixel dots with a control circuit.  Since the matrix does not emit light, it is impossible to directly see the image on it.  To do this, you need to direct a stream of light at it either in front (the screens of calculators, hours work this way), or shine through it.  "Frontal" backlighting is used in specific devices, but in monitors - through.  There are two ways to implement it: fluorescent lamps and diodes (read on if you don‚Äôt know what led is). </p><p>  Everyone is familiar with <span>discharge lamps</span> , these are the same luminous tubes in supermarkets and their successors - household ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù lamps.  For monitor backlighting, miniature types of tubes are used, with improved color gamut and increased frequency (did you think the <span>LCD monitors</span> do not flicker? <span>This is a mistake!).</span>  Currently, this technological branch is being actively replaced by a more progressive one.  This can be easily verified by reading the inscription ‚Äúled screen‚Äù on most boxes with monitors in stores.  Often, there is nothing to choose, especially, from which everything is based on this technology. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is clear the interest of buyers in the question of what is led.  The word "led" is an abbreviation from English, meaning "diode emitting light."  Backlight <span>fluorescent lamps</span> replaced by LED lines.  In budget models, they are placed on the sides of the matrix, and a diffusing filter is used to obtain uniform illumination. </p><p>  A person who is interested in what led is for monitors should have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe advantages and, alas, the disadvantages of this technology. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the backlight flickers.  This is due to the gas-discharge nature of the generation of the <span>light flux.</span>  True, the frequency is so high that it is not fixed by the eye (about 400 Hz).  In turn, diodes are spared from this drawback. </p><p>  The consumed <span>electric power of the</span> lamps exceeds several times this indicator for diodes.  Clear advantage. </p><p>  Often a buyer who knows what led is, chooses such a monitor because of its smaller size.  Screen thickness usually does not exceed 20 mm.  The advantage is quite controversial, but it sometimes encourages the choice of just such models. </p><p>  However, <span>led-backlight technology,</span> compared with the lamp, has a significant drawback - a narrow light spectrum.  Because of this, the color rendering quality suffers.  For the same reason, many owners of LED monitors quickly get tired of their eyes while working at a computer.  On forums on the network, entire branches are created to discuss this problem.  If desired, they can be easily found and familiarized with the described situations.  In general, liquid crystal monitors are a rather mixed decision.  Although they are considered less harmful to vision, when switching from a CRT to an LCD, almost everyone at first noticed discomfort, right down to returning to a proven device.  With led, the story repeats.  Although no one has yet given an exact reason, there is reason to think.  At a minimum, you can recommend the purchase of a mid-range or high-price led monitor in which the backlight lines consist of color diodes and are placed evenly behind the matrix, and not along its edges. </p>
