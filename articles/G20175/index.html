A trip to its attractions can bring a lot of emotions, but before choosing a tour you should get complete information and read reviews from travelers.  This material will help. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The Kwai River actually has a different name, but it is this name that has become world famous.  The reason lies in the popular film co-produced by American and British.  Its name is ‚ÄúBridge over the River Kwai‚Äù, and because of this, the water body received a distortion of the name.  In the country, this attraction has the name Khwayai. </p><p>  A river flows near the city of Kanchanaburi, and its total length is 380 kilometers.  Among tour companies, this place is promoted as exotic tourism, thanks to which you can enjoy the true culture of Thailand and plunge into an unforgettable atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lokopoko.travel" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.lokopoko.travel/product/bangkok-full-day-river-kwai-tiger-temple/"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge over the river Kwai" class="if uuid-2390413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2390413.jpg"></div><h2>  Start of the excursion program </h2><p>  The Kwai River is not in vain advertised in various places as a great place for all tourists.  The route created for excursion groups can open up a huge number of beautiful and colorful places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first stop on the journey is usually the floating market.  Tourists get into boats and go to the most unusual market among all possible.  It is located directly on the water, and the culture of trade in Thailand is shown at its best.  Sellers using the most elegant epithets describe their products.  Basically, people are offered to buy bags and figurines of elephants, which are associated with one of the local attractions. </p><p>  A further stop on an excursion to the Kwai River from Pattaya or another city is a place with the ruins of a Khmer temple.  Here you can see the construction of the ancient people who once inhabited this area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kwai river in thailand" class="if uuid-2390443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2390443.jpg"></div><h2>  Continuation of the tour </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the nuances of a trip to the Kwai River from Pattaya or any other settlement may vary depending on the choice of a travel company.  The organizers plan their routes in different ways, although there are obligatory places in them that cannot be missed.  These include the Death Road. </p><p>  This path got its name because of the incredibly complex construction.  He was attracted by a huge number of prisoners from prisons who died daily.  Over the entire period of the construction of the road, more than hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives here, and therefore it was given the corresponding name. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The construction of the road during World War II was necessary because of the needs of transporting resources and soldiers. </p><p>  From this place a beautiful view of the surrounding area.  Tourists here can feel mixed feelings of fear and admiration for natural beauty.  It is worth noting that on the way to this place travelers can be shown a coconut farm, a craft center and other interesting sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": David McKelvey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="tour reviews" class="if uuid-2390448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2390448.jpg"></div><h2>  A number of attractive places </h2><p>  The Kwai River is considered not only interesting, but also a diverse area.  Here you can easily escape from historical and cultural places to get in touch with nature.  For this, most excursions include visits to the village of elephants and feeding the monkeys. </p><p>  In the first case, travelers are expected to ride exotic animals.  But with monkeys you need to be careful, because they strive to get accessories from tourists by theft. </p><p>  With accommodation for an overnight stay on the river there is no problem at all.  There are hotels for every taste and with different levels of luxury, although the tour always provides a place to stop. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the river there are many other attractions worth seeing.  For example, the temple of the Tiger Cave, a Buddhist monastery, <span>Erawan waterfall</span> or Ayutthaya town.  The last place is significant because in ancient times there was the capital of the state, and a trip here can drag on for the whole day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businesseventsthailand.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.businesseventsthailand.com/th/nc/plan-your-events/touring-leisure/attractions/detail/touringLeisure/603/type/55/"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the river Kwai from Pattaya" class="if uuid-2390446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2390446.jpg"></div><h2>  Enthusiastic reviews from tourists </h2><p>  Every traveler‚Äôs reviews of the Kwai River excursion sound enthusiastic.  No one is left disappointed.  This place captivates with its magic with a variety of attractions that people will want to visit and see.  You can go here several times on different routes, and the emotions can be completely different, but only in a positive perspective. </p><p>  Tourists note that aesthetic pleasure is sometimes obtained from viewing not all places on the tour, but most of the stops nevertheless pleasantly surprised.  Judging by the reviews, you can buy a trip to the Kwai River to any public.  In each of the routes there are places that are breathtaking. </p><p>  For some, it will be the Death Road, others will like elephant riding, and others will be impressed by the ascent to the seventh cascade of Erawan Falls.  The mere fact that every tourist gives a rating of at least four out of five points speaks of the magic of such a trip. </p><p>  The only minus can be a long road to the described place if you are resting in a region far from the city of Kanchanaburi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.firotour.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge ride" class="if uuid-2390454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2390454.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Kwai River in Thailand has become a tourist destination due to various factors.  The film mentioned above and the development of infrastructure played a role, but the main merit of popularity lies in the surrounding area. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to raft along the river in the early morning, which will bring an unforgettable experience.  You can choose the excursion in accordance with your preferences.  History buffs will be offered to visit the temples, the Road of Death and the necessarily settlement Ayutthaya.  If you want to plunge into the nature of the region more, then riding on elephants, feeding monkeys and visiting waterfalls will be the right decision.  In any case, the trip will bring pleasure and will be remembered for a long time. </p>
