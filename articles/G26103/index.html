    <p>  The self-portrait is translated from English as ‚Äúself-portrait‚Äù, that is, a portrait made by a person on the front or rear camera of the phone.  Initially, self-photography was considered a disease of adolescents: young people take photos of every step they take and post it on social networks, where other users give them comments.  People demonstrate their new outfit, hairstyle, makeup, pets, repairs in the apartment, a delicious dinner.  In Russia, users of social networks often call self-portrait "self" from the phrase "I photograph myself." </p><h2>  How to take a selfie? </h2><p>  In order to make a self-portrait, you need to know a few simple rules. </p><p>  1. On the "self" should be as much as possible details on which people can focus their attention. </p><p>  2. The process of photographing takes only a few seconds, and at this time it is important not to be too lazy and keep your hand as high as possible above the level of the head so that the face acquires elegant features and the body appears more elongated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. It is necessary to choose a good perspective so that the virtues look in the best light. </p><p>  4. Charming girls choose about the same ideas for a selfie: full-breasted beauties take pictures of themselves to breast level, and owners of <span>aspen waist</span> try to capture this particular part of the body in the pictures. </p><p>  5. Girls with <span>long legs</span> should take more photos in the mirror, which favorably emphasizes their beauty. </p><p>  6. Make sure that there are no unnecessary objects in <span>the background</span> : an unmade bed, dirty dishes, sinks. </p><p>  7. Your face should occupy at least 80% of the total space in the photo. </p>

    <p>  8. Make sure that your fingers do not block the lens and that <span>sun glare</span> does not get on the camera.  If you don‚Äôt know about a selfie - what it is, and how to make it right, search for this information yourself, and then wait for the release of the book by Kim Kardashian, which she will devote to her self-portraits.  Secular lioness prepares more than three hundred shots in different outfits and poses. </p><h2>  Oh, these selfies! </h2><p>  An ordinary photo of a barbie girl loses its relevance - original pictures are used, where people are not shy about looking ridiculous.  The main thing is that the self-portrait conveys emotions, and subscribers do not skimp on positive ratings and comments.  In the West, boys and girls begin to wrap themselves with tape to make their faces more expressive.  Pictures with animals on their heads are becoming popular. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The most witty ones choose bold ideas for selfies and do not hesitate to photograph themselves while sitting on the toilet with bulging eyes.  The fashion for "selfies" comes and goes, and on social networks there are ridiculous pictures, after watching which you want to laugh and cry.  Many stars take a smartphone with them to the cosmetologist‚Äôs office and take pictures of themselves with clay masks on their faces, which, to put it mildly, is not very pleasant.  Girls believe that without clothes they look much better and stand in front of a mirror in a half-naked form, demonstrating their charms.  No matter how crazy your idea may be, the main thing is for subscribers to approve it.  Sociologists at an American university conducted a study and found that sensual pictures of lovers were recognized as the most annoying selfies. </p><h2>  Be more original </h2><p>  In order for your subscribers to have a sense of admiration when <span>viewing photos</span> , you need not only to demonstrate your delightful smile and beautiful outfit, but also to think up interesting ideas for a selfie. </p>

    <p>  Let me make my self-portrait your pet: at the moment when the cat is lying peacefully, put a smartphone with the camera on next to it, and take a picture of it yourself.  Hold the pet to your chest and take a selfie with it.  Put on <span>a Superman costume</span> and you will seem like a savior of animals.  Future mothers can show imagination and take pictures in the early stages of pregnancy, and in the final photograph get into the lens with the baby.  So that the photo in the mirror is not boring - draw color pictures and patterns on it.  Do not forget about the "duck lips" if you do not like to smile.  If you do not look well, but are in a beautiful place or at a party, and you want to take a picture, cover your face with any flat subject.  Apply bright makeup on your face, put on masks and make silly faces - beautiful selfies will be bright and interesting. </p><h2>  Popular mistakes in self-portraits </h2><p>  Most young owners of smartphones take pictures of themselves almost every hour and sometimes do not pay attention to the quality of the photos, upload them to social networks, and then find that due to the strong light on their faces, age spots and rashes are visible.  Even out skin tone and focus on the eyes and lips - for this there is no need to visit a makeup artist, because minor flaws will not be visible in photos of poor quality.  The best ideas for selfies suggest good lighting and angle, in which the presence of cosmetics will be completely invisible, and your subscribers will think that you have a natural blush, long eyelashes and <span>puffy lips.</span>  Agree, it will be a shame if for technical reasons you can‚Äôt realize an interesting idea.  Pinning your hair with a tight elastic band, make sure that no bald patches form at the temples.  When taking photos with several people, make sure that everyone gets into the frame. </p>
