The sea, the sun, beaches and its climate suitable for sea holidays - this is what Eilat is known all over the world for.  The weather here is excellent for sunbathing.  There is practically no rain.  Diving enthusiasts come here because Eilat has the only marine reserve in Israel with a huge variety of underwater inhabitants.

Indeed, there are ancient mines for the extraction of copper, which are almost ten thousand years old.  In addition, ancient cave paintings can be seen in artificially hollowed caves, and in the evenings there are various concerts and shows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get when it's better to come </h2><p>  To get to <span>the C-Hotel</span> Eilat 3 * <span>hotel</span> <span>(Israel, Eilat),</span> you need to buy a ticket, as a rule, on a charter flight.

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the center of Eilat.  At the same time, it takes about ten minutes to go from it to the coast of the Red Sea.  Tourists noted that from any end of the city it is convenient to get to the C-Hotel Eilat 3 *.  The location of the hotel is close to the promenade, and from the bus station, and even from the airport of local airlines.  After all, the Eilat hub is located right in the center of the city, and guests can watch takeoffs and landings right from the window.  But it is not noisy, and planes do not interfere with sleep.  They fly only during the day.  Three minutes walk to a large grocery supermarket with not too high prices.  In other shops, those that are directly at the exit from the hotel, the set of goods is small, and its cost is much more.  There are also many cafes and currency exchange points around the hotel.  Nearby bus stop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  We already wrote that this is a city hotel - C-Hotel Eilat 3 *.  The hotel infrastructure is appropriate.  This is a seven-story building.  Almost next to it is a shopping center.  On the first and second floors there is a synagogue and rooms for staff.  On the third - the lobby and administration, as well as the restaurant.  The building has an elevator.  At the reception there is a room where you can check in your luggage.  The restaurant has an outdoor terrace.  And his banquet room, if necessary, can be turned into a room for conferences or seminars.  Since the hotel has almost no territory of its own, or rather, it is very small, sports and playgrounds, swimming pools and a spa center are located on different floors of the building or on the terrace.  The hotel has a large parking lot, but if there is still not enough space for a car, you can leave it in the parking lot of the shopping center. </p>

Amazing cakes.  If you are going on an excursion, huge lunch boxes are collected for you.  If you arrive late, then dinner will also be served in your room.  There is a children's menu.  You can even take food with you from the restaurant.  Israel is a rather expensive country, so travelers are mostly satisfied that the food is organized at the hotel.  After all, if they ate in restaurants on their own, it would cost a lot more.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  It's not boring to spend evenings at the C-Hotel Eilat 3 * hotel.  Entertainment here is quite diverse, despite the fact that the hotel has only three stars on the sign.  There is a good team of animators.  If you come to be treated and recovered, or just want to keep yourself in good shape, we offer a massage parlor, beauty salon, fitness center, hammam and sauna with a jacuzzi.  Near the hotel is the <span>Central Park of the</span> city.  It is small but pleasant, decorated with colorful statues of fish.  In the center of it is a "dancing fountain", which works in the evenings. </p><h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  Many tourists, coming to rest in Eilat, choose this particular hotel - C-Hotel Eilat 3 *.  The beach is municipal.  It starts directly from the Shopping Center and goes into the distance, towards Jordan.  Walk to him from the hotel for about ten minutes, first along the central park, and then after a few more streets.  The beaches here are mostly strewn artificially.  They are sand and pebble, equipped with sunbeds.  All the best beaches belong to expensive first-line hotels. </p><p>  Along the shore there is a promenade - a promenade with shops, attractions, souvenir stalls.  When it ends, the so-called wild beach begins.  In fact, it is also municipal and equipped, with large parasols.  Just few people come here, so it‚Äôs spacious.  This coast is not necessary to walk.  You can get on bus number 15. The fare costs a little more than four shekels.  In the opposite direction, the same bus runs already at number 16. If you drive to the end, you will fall almost under the Egyptian border.  There is a decent beach of the already closed Princess Hotel.  You can snorkel here because there are two coral reefs. </p><p>  Two hundred meters from the aquarium is Migdalor Beach.  It is the best for snorkeling, because the fish swim there already two meters from the shore.  But swimming there is bad, everywhere there are sharp rocks and reefs, so it is better to have special shoes with you.  Beach towels are taken at the reception.  When you use them, you just need to drop them in a special box in the lobby.  There is also a pool at the hotel.  It is located on the fourth floor.  Around him there are not only sunbeds, but also sofas and a relaxation zone.  Towels are also given there.  There is a toilet and an apparatus from which they collect drinking water.  From December 1, the pool is usually heated. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A travel agency works directly in the building of the C-Hotel Eilat 3 * hotel.  But tourists are advised to first take a walk around the resort itself and get to know it well, and then, if there is time, go on longer trips.  For starters, you can just take a bus number 15/16, which goes from one end of the city to the other and passes through the entire center.  Only at bus stops you have to wave your hand, otherwise transport can pass by. </p><p>  If you are with children, be sure to visit the aquarium.  There are very interesting and informative programs, and on the purchased tickets there you can go for another two days for free.  Officially, it is called the underwater observatory.  Even with children, they are advised to go to the biblical theme park ‚ÄúCity of the Kings‚Äù and to the Ice Palace, where the rink works. </p><p>  Of the long excursions, tourists, of course, recommend a <span>trip to Jerusalem.</span>  Moreover, on the way you will be brought to all the most interesting places in Israel - the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, Bethlehem.  And it‚Äôs very easy to drive through neighboring Egypt or Jordan from Eilat. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Guests of the C-Hotel Eilat 3 * hotel are advised to buy Dead Sea cosmetics in Eilat - shampoos, scrubs, creams.  In some stores, prices are lower than the national average.  Near the hotel, on Finikov Avenue, an agricultural fair is held on Fridays.  There you can buy fruits and strawberries.  Note that on Shabbat, of course, nothing works.  Eilat is a duty free zone.  The most popular souvenir that tourists take away from here is a decorative ‚Äúmenorah‚Äù (ritual candlestick) and a pendant in the form of a star of David.  Handcrafted Israeli precious jewelry is also famous.  From the products brought olives, dates, hummus and Israeli wine. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hotel travelers like, despite its simplicity and lack of frills.  She is very functional.  Tourists write that the C-Hotel Eilat 3 * hotel is cozy and extremely clean, there is a pleasant smell everywhere.  On television, you can watch several Russian channels.  Good prices, excellent service, excellent location - this is the main thing that attracts guests to the hotel.  It is suitable for a beach holiday, as well as for excursions and sightseeing.  In Russian, staff often do not understand, but if you know at least a few words in English, there will be no problems. </p><p>  Many Israelis stay at the hotel, which already indicates that the hotel is excellent and inexpensive.  The atmosphere is calm, pacifying.  If you come here out of season, then there are fewer people and prices are lower.  At the disposal of vacationers not only the sea with empty beaches, but also a warm pool, you can go on excursions without suffering from the heat. </p>
