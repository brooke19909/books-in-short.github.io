    <h2>  Jumeirah in Dubai: Description </h2><p>  Until 1960, this land was inhabited by fishermen, Arab merchants, divers for pearls.  Then, Europeans who came to these places to work began to settle on the coast.  Since 1995, the territory has been actively built up with world-class chic hotels and residences, turning Jumeirah into an elite seaside resort, which has no equal in the world today. </p><p>  This area begins at the port of Rashid and stretches from its western moorings to the western part of the city, where the Dubai Marina skyscrapers are located.  The southern border runs along Al Wasl Road and Al Wasl.  The district is divided into three parts: eastern, central and western.  Along the coast of the Persian Gulf, the Jumeirah Beach promenade, built up with luxurious skyscraper hotels and very expensive shops, is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai jumeirah hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2081809.jpg"></div>

The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe district is 6.9 km¬≤.  No more than twenty-five thousand people live here permanently.  Dumeirah is one of the most expensive areas of Dubai.  The huge influx of tourists gave impetus to the construction in the city and on the coastline of dozens of luxury hotels that are known throughout the world. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  This area with impeccable sandy beaches, the blue sea and hotels that are simply immersed in luxury, like a magnet attracts thousands of tourists from around the world. </p><h2>  Jumeirah Mosque </h2><p>  Almost every Arab city has a mosque.  Dubai was no exception, where one of the most famous Islamic temples is located - the Jumeirah Mosque.  This is a vivid example of modern cult architecture.  The mosque was built in Fatimid medieval style.  The magnificent dome and two minarets are its special elements.  This building looks extremely impressive at sunset and in the evening, when the grace of its forms is emphasized by correctly executed artificial lighting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dubai jumeirah reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2081812.jpg"></div>
