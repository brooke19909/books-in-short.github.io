Short description, table</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù - this is how the reign of Alexander 3 was described. Domestic and <span>foreign policy</span> was carried out brilliantly by this sovereign.  He was not prepared for succession to the throne, but due to a combination of tragic circumstances, Alexander had to become one.  Loving the homeland, rejoicing for his people, his identity, he managed to raise the state, exhausted by the war with the Turks, financially and morally.  This is one of the few sovereigns who managed to provide their people with life without wars, because for his reign the Russian Empire had no conflicts with any of the states.  In the article we will tell you what emperor Alexander 3 was. Domestic and foreign policy is also briefly described and analyzed. </p><h2>  Alexander III: accession to the throne </h2><p>  How did Alexander come to the Russian throne?  He was not born the heir to the throne.  The eldest brother, Nikolai, was to inherit the crown.  However, the latter dies at a <span>young age.</span>  Accordingly, they start to prepare young Alexander urgently so that he can with dignity adopt the work of his father, Emperor Alexander II. </p><p>  In general, Alexander III was preparing for a brilliant military career, but the plans were not destined to come true.  After the death of his brother, Tsarevich Nikolai, Alexander was urgently taught foreign languages, geography and other sciences necessary for the future emperor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="domestic politics and foreign policy of alexander 3" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/1125338.jpg" width="600"></div>

The young people were so shocked by the death of the prince, with whom they were on friendly terms, that the first-born was called Nikolai. </p><p>  What did Alexander III get by the beginning of the reign?  A country devastated and exhausted by the Russo-Turkish war, rampant anti-government sentiment in all social groups.  Recall that the father of Emperor Alexander II died at the hands of terrorists. </p><h2>  Zemsky and judicial reforms </h2><p>  On March 1, 1881, Alexander 3 ascended the throne. Domestic and foreign policy can be briefly characterized as follows: firmness and decisiveness.  Let's analyze the main aspects. </p><p>  The first thing the new sovereign took up was the suppression of all kinds of freethinking.  He believed that it was she who was guilty of most of Russia's ills.  Do not forget that his father also became a victim of terror, which arose from excessive education.  Alexander II was the guardian of enlightenment, in contrast to Alexander III accepts a number of mistakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexander 3 domestic and foreign policy briefly" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/1125339.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1884, a decree was issued concerning the activities of universities (it was their emperor who considered the center of free-thinking).  The document abolished all kinds of meetings in the framework of educational institutions, banned student courts;  access to higher education was closed to the lower classes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the local authorities, it was strengthened by the following measures: the zemstvos began to be rigidly led by governors, the rights of officials were sharply curtailed.  The officials were only from the upper classes, the peasantry was not allowed into power and did not participate in the elections. </p><p>  There have been changes in the judicial system.  They are closely connected with reforms in zemstvos.  The courts were now directly subordinate to the state, publicity in the meetings was rather strictly limited, and qualifications were also imposed on jurors. </p><h2>  The situation of peasants </h2><p>  <span>The domestic policy of</span> Alexander III also affected the peasantry.  After the famous reform of 1861, their situation was unenviable: the lack of money for the purchase of land, debts, inability to conduct their business - all this made ruined people leave for cities.  Alexander III makes a number of decisions stabilizing the situation.  Thus, debts are forgiven to peasants, the tax rate on the purchase of land is reduced.  A special Peasant Bank is also being created, where people could take loans for housekeeping (interest was low). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexander 3 foreign and domestic policy table" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/1125337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, agriculture in the country begins to develop, centers specializing in a certain direction appear: industrial crops (Baltic States), cereals (Ukraine), livestock (Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, etc.) </p><h2>  Military reform </h2><p>  The domestic policy and foreign policy of Alexander 3 were aimed at strengthening the autocracy within the country.  Many of these contributed to military reform. </p><p>  Do not forget that initially Alexander was prepared for a military career, he knew this matter well and knew about it.  Although Russia did not wage wars for his rule, the army intensified very well.  All kinds of defenses, mountain divisions were created, great importance was given to <span>army reserves,</span> both horse and infantry. </p><p>  For the purpose of training, military schools are opening cadet corps.  Not only young soldiers are being trained, command personnel are also being trained.  Promotion is only in seniority. </p><p>  A special role is given to military infrastructure.  So there are special railway brigades, called upon to deliver employees to places of deployment, if necessary. </p><p>  Another innovation is the armament of the army.  The three-line rifle becomes the main weapon, the shape changes (it is now more convenient for soldiers). </p><h2>  National reform </h2><p>  The domestic policy and foreign policy of Alexander 3 was strengthened by a tough national position.  The idea that the Russian Empire was intended only for the Russians came from the lips of Alexander III.  Many <span>political decisions</span> are based precisely on this idea. </p><p>  The emperor takes serious steps to strengthen the Orthodox faith.  Especially in this matter, the border regions of the country were weak.  The active construction of Orthodox churches begins.  At the state level, they begin to oppress citizens of the non-Orthodox faith and non-Russian nationalities.  Most of all "went" to the Poles and Jews.  Russification work is underway in Ukraine and the Baltic states. </p><h2>  Financial system and industry </h2><p>  The domestic policy and foreign policy of Alexander 3 proceeded from the realities of which emperor received the country.  She was in great economic decline.  Accordingly, one of the main tasks that needed to be solved was to lead the country out of the economic crisis.  To this end, the best figures of the era are involved in reforms in the financial and industrial sphere. </p><p>  So, Bunge proposed to abolish the poll tax, instead of which it was proposed to pay excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, sugar or oil.  In addition, the tax rate on property, for example, on land, urban real estate increases.  In order to reduce the budget deficit, customs duties are increased. </p><p>  As for industry, it is growing rapidly.  Particularly thriving metallurgy, textile and engineering.  Developing the latest methods of oil production.  Thus, in this indicator, Russia comes out on top. </p><p>  Briefly show what reforms Alexander 3. carried out.

    <h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  As for foreign policy, it is not in vain that this emperor is called a ‚Äúpeacemaker‚Äù - he did his best to protect his country from military conflicts.  Also involved other countries in similar actions. </p><p>  In his reign, the Russian Empire became closer to Great Britain and France, but in the Balkans it weakened its position. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="domestic politics alexander 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/1125361.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The confrontation with Germany in terms of customs relations exacerbated economic relations. </p><p>  Thus, the domestic policy and foreign policy of Alexander 3 contributed to the economic, national and industrial recovery of the country. </p>
