This question is of interest to the majority of the population.  Moreover, it is quite justified - because for the property that is owned, you have to pay annually.  The specified payment has not been canceled.  This means that if there is no receipt for payment, there is a high probability of debt.  Accordingly, certain penalties for debtors may be applied.  And with a lot of debt, a person‚Äôs property is seized. </p><p>  That is why the population is thinking about how to pay taxes for an apartment, and also why the necessary receipts do not come.  What to do in such cases?  And what to look for?  All the features of taxes for an apartment or other property will be described below.  In fact, it is not so difficult to understand what to do under the circumstances described.  It is enough to look into the normative acts of the Russian legislation. </p>

    <h2>  What kind of payment? </h2><p>  What kind of payment are you talking about?  This is the first question to focus on.  After all, taxes in Russia can be different.  And not everyone receives certain receipts.  Apartment tax is the same as property tax.  These accruals come to all property owners.  This is an annual payment that will have to be paid without fail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Typically, taxes come for apartments, rooms, cottages, houses, buildings, shares in the specified property.  If the property does not have anything from the previously listed list, then it is not necessary to think about why the apartment tax does not come.  This is a normal occurrence. </p>

    <h2>  System crash </h2><p>  But the rest should be paid.  In any case, it is precisely such a system of notifying citizens about upcoming payments that takes place in Russia.  Why doesn‚Äôt the apartment tax come in? </p><p>  The first scenario is a malfunction of the relevant authorities.  The thing is that if somewhere in the system of the specified organization a particular incident occurred, taxpayers may not receive a receipt for payment.  This is not the best phenomenon.  With all this, if you do not pay the debt, you may encounter a penalty for property tax. </p>

    <h2>  No time </h2><p>  Why don't taxes on the apartment come?  The next scenario is a situation that is more common.  It has already been said that property tax is a <span>mandatory payment,</span> moreover, annual.  If there is no <span>receipt for payment</span> , it is likely that there is still no time to receive a payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a rule, tax receipts for property to citizens come in the fall: from September to November.  At the legislative level, it is possible to receive a payment no later than 30 days before the deadline for tax payment.  Therefore, you should be patient and wait a bit.  It is likely that the dispatch of receipts, in principle, has not yet been made.  Then you do not need to panic. </p><h2>  Tax overload </h2><p>  Why doesn‚Äôt the apartment tax come in?  Further, it can be assumed that in the tax authorities at the moment there is an emergency, there is a high burden on employees.  And so the distribution of paychecks was postponed a bit.  Panic is not required until around early November.  Otherwise, you will have to somehow worry that the owner of the property has the details for paying the receipt, and also that he knows the exact amount to be paid to the state treasury. </p>

    <h2>  We call the inspection </h2><p>  Perhaps these are all common causes.  Now it‚Äôs clear why the tax on an apartment or a house does not come.  What if the calendar is already November and there‚Äôs still no payment?  First of all, it is recommended to call the tax district of residence.  And already from the employees of the organization to find out what is the matter.  They should explain the reason for the lack of payment. </p><p>  If the mailing time has not arrived, they talk about it.  After you can ask when tentatively to expect a tax receipt.  If employees of the department claim that there is no information about the house (sometimes they are missing for several years), then you do not need to pay without a receipt for the property.  Otherwise, a high probability of debt. </p>

    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like waiting for the payment to be sent out, you can try to personally go to the tax authority of the area in which the citizen‚Äôs real estate is located.  And get a receipt there yourself.  Quite often, tax officials without any problems print out a payment with all the data for payment.  Especially when it comes to a visit in November. </p><p>  You will have to take with you an identity card, certificates of ownership of real estate, a cadastral passport (preferably, but not required).  It is also recommended to grab the TIN (if available) and SNILS.  With a receipt issued to a citizen, you can pay tax.  But until what time will Russia have to pay? </p><h2>  Terms of payment </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear why the <span>tax on a privatized apartment</span> does not come <span>.</span>  Moreover, several tips for resolving such an unpleasant situation are also known.  But we do not yet know how long it is required to pay property tax.  Everything is also simple here. </p><p>  In 2016, all property owners must pay for their property until December 1, 2016. Moreover, inclusive.  This is the deadline set in Russia for property tax fees.  No exceptions and concessions.  Temporary restrictions apply to all citizens. </p>

    <h2>  New rules </h2><p>  Why doesn‚Äôt the apartment tax come in?  2016 is the period in which the new rules regarding tax payments came into effect.  What is it about?  The thing is that not all property owners will receive receipts from the tax authorities.  If a citizen has a profile on the State Services portal, then it will be in electronic form that a payment will come.  Mailings in this case are excluded. </p><p>  Thus, since 2016, receipts on the payment of property tax have been issued only to those who do not have an account on the State Services website.  They can wait for the appropriate payment or apply for it to the tax.  All others will receive a notification about the need to deposit funds in the state treasury for their property in electronic format. </p>

    <h2>  New Year - New Calculations </h2><p>  Another question that worries citizens: why big taxes come?  The privatized apartment, even the smallest, according to the rules established in Russia, will have to be evaluated.  According to the new calculation rules, payments for property will be formed on the basis of the cadastral value of real estate.  And with a certain coefficient.  Therefore, it is likely that the payment received in 2016 will be with a lower amount.  And then the payment will increase.  True, gradually. </p><p>  Why did the big apartment tax come?  Probably the cadastral value of real estate is high.  And therefore, payments require quite large amounts.  The cadastral value of housing can be found in Rosreestr.  And the amount of property tax for individuals is calculated on the website of the Federal Tax Service using a specific calculator. </p><p>  Accordingly, it is not necessary to be surprised at high taxes.  The final amount, as already mentioned, is added up based on the cadastral value of the property.  Therefore, an apartment of the same size in different areas of the city and in different regions of the country will have to pay not the same amount. </p>

    <h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  From now on, it is clear why taxes on the apartment do not come, and also what to do if there is no payment for a very long time.  And how is it proposed to pay property tax?  At the moment, every citizen himself chooses the best solution.  Among the proposals, the following methods are distinguished: payment by credit card, contacting the Sberbank cash desk (cash payment), using the "Payment of public services" portal, through the "State services" website, through an electronic wallet, through payment terminals (in cash) at tax authorities. </p>
