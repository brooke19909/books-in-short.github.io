Electronic wallets, bank card passwords require reliable protection from fraudsters.  But it happens that the secret code ‚Äúflies‚Äù out of my head, and attempts to remember it are futile.  As a result of this, the device is blocked, and you have to go to the service center and spend money to solve the problem.  In this article, we will consider all options for how to restore the iPad at home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techeneis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore device via itunes" class="if uuid-3018171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3018171.jpg"></div><h2>  Useless Internet tips to ignore </h2><p>  Each of us, when a problem arises, first of all enters the Global Network to get useful information.  But it often happens that the recommendations of the ‚Äúadvisers‚Äù are false, or the version of the firmware with which they worked is different from yours.  The following options will definitely not work: </p><ul><li>  Trying to bypass protection through an emergency call (this method was once used for an iPhone). </li><li>  Using the software ‚ÄúFind iPhone‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  If you are looking for an effective way to recover your password on the iPad, you should not even look at reviews that mention outdated iOS.  Device models are constantly being improved, so the use of many programs and applications for recovering passwords is pointless. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pasha4ur.org.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="unlocking process is not as complicated as it seems" class="if uuid-3018167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3018167.jpg"></div><h2>  A way that will work for sure </h2><p>  How to restore iPad via itunes quickly and easily: </p><ol><li>  The tablet must be connected to the computer.  After connecting, itunes will start saving all the information from the iPad to the computer.  However, the password-protected tablet will have to be manually synchronized. </li><li>  If before this information was stored on the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, now it is now necessary to put a check mark ‚Äúsave to computer‚Äù.  All data from the iPad will be transferred to the PC. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="errorcodespro.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blocked ipad" class="if uuid-3018170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3018170.jpg"></div><h2>  Lock bypass </h2><p>  Detailed instructions - how to restore the iPad if you forgot your password: </p><ol><li>  First, the tablet must be entered into recovery mode.  The device must first be turned off.  Hold down the power button and the Home key at the same time.  The ‚Äúapple‚Äù logo should appear on the display.  Remove your finger from the power button and hold only the Home key for a few seconds.  After some time, the device will require connecting to itunes via a USB cable. </li><li>  It is necessary to synchronize data by transferring them back to the iPad.  The device will request a personal id attached to the tablet.  The result is a device identical to the original, but without a secret code. </li><li>  When connecting to itunes, you will be asked if you agree to go through the procedure for recovering iPad information. </li></ol><p>  It is strongly recommended that you do not enter the password at random, if you do not even remember it at least, because after several failed attempts, the tablet will turn off.  You can restore it only as a ‚Äúnew device", so if you have not transferred the information to the computer, then all the data will disappear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you know how to restore the iPad, and this mission will no longer seem impossible or require special skills.  But it‚Äôs worth noting that before flashing it is necessary to transfer all important documents to the computer, otherwise they will be irretrievably lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zhidao.baidu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="update process" class="if uuid-3018162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3018162.jpg"></div><h2>  How to restore iPad 2 in DFU mode </h2><p>  DFU mode is designed to completely reinstall the gadget.  First you need to disconnect the iPad from the computer and turn it off.  The device is restored as follows: </p><ol><li>  Download iOS 8 firmware. </li><li>  Exit itunes on your computer. </li><li>  Then you need to connect the tablet to your PC. </li><li>  Turn off the device completely by pressing the power button and moving the ‚ÄúShutdown‚Äù slider. </li><li>  Hold down the Home key and power button at the same time for several seconds. </li><li>  Then release the power button, but continue to press ‚ÄúHome‚Äù.  This is necessary for the computer to detect your tablet.  The process will take about 10 seconds. </li><li>  The display of the device during firmware will be black, without changes. </li><li>  Log in to itunes. </li><li>  To start flashing, hold down the Shift key (in the macbook - the option key) and click on ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù.  In the file selection window, select the new firmware. </li><li>  Flashing mode started.  It remains only to wait for its end. </li></ol><p>  After that, the system can be updated in the standard way.  Now the question of how to restore the iPad will not bother you.  Just remember to back up the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zhidao.baidu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connection to aityuns" class="if uuid-3018159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111288/3018159.jpg"></div><h2>  Errors during recovery </h2><p>  Sometimes itunes crashes in the itunes system, and error 4013 pops up.
