  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Volga Arena Stadium, Nizhny Novgorod</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the objects built in the Nizhny Novgorod region in 2018 was the Volga-Arena stadium in Nizhny Novgorod.  Its construction transformed the city, changing the entire surrounding landscape.  Architects managed to harmoniously fit the sports complex into a territory limited by historical buildings, the Volga and the housing estate.  The stadium is equipped with all the necessary infrastructure and is an example of domestic architectural art of our days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="f.jwwb.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volga Arena" class="if uuid-2879626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2879626.jpg"></div><h2>  Stadium parameters </h2><p>  During the construction of the facility, domestic materials were used instead of originally planned materials.  Russian equipment was used in the installation of lighting, ventilation and air conditioning systems, space heating.  The stands for the audience, the decoration of the interior space and facades were also built from domestic materials. </p><p>  The stadium area is 127,500 square meters.  The building itself, in which stands, dressing rooms, cafes, toilets and other premises are located, has the shape of a flattened cylinder with an open football field in the center.  It has five tiers and more than 50 meters in height. </p><p>  If you look at the Volga-Arena stadium (Nizhny Novgorod) from the side, its main distinguishing feature will be a colonnade of trihedral pillars, on which a roof made of metal is held over the stands and interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pathdecor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Football field" class="if uuid-2879631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2879631.jpg"></div><p>  The project cost exceeded seventeen billion rubles. </p><p>  The spectator stands of the arena are divided into four sectors, denoted by the letters A, B, C, D. Sector A has the most expensive seats; ticket holders have access to the stands of other sectors here.  This is done because under these stands are the changing rooms of football players.  Sectors B and D are located outside the gates, so the most accessible places are on their upper tiers.  It is worth noting that the field is perfectly visible from almost anywhere in the stands. </p><h2>  Why build a stadium </h2><p>  As in many other cities of our country, the Volga-Arena in Nizhny Novgorod was erected to host the 2018 World Cup.  Designed for 45,000 spectators, built in accordance with all modern norms and standards, he certainly coped with his task.  At the <span>stadium Nizhny Novgorod</span> played 6 matches.  All of them passed with the inherent scope of such competitions and gathered a large number of spectators.  Tourists flooded the Volga-Arena complex in Nizhny Novgorod.  Everyone tried to provide comfort for the fans and show their city from the best side.  At the Nizhny Novgorod stadium, guests of the country were welcomed by an army of volunteers and staff.  Foreign tourists were helped to navigate the city, use transport, find objects of interest to them and get other services.  The ordinary townspeople also helped with pleasure.  All matches were excellent.  The organizers received from FIFA a high appreciation of their work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="f.jwwb.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stadium field" class="if uuid-2879629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2879629.jpg"></div><h2>  Surrounding area </h2><p>  The Volga-Arena in Nizhny Novgorod was built very close to the place where the river port used to function.  It was one of the largest river tourist centers based on the confluence of the Oka and Volga.  Mention is worthy of the pride, which generously endowed the nature of Nizhny Novgorod - Strelka.  This is the name of the confluence of two mighty Russian rivers - the Volga and the Oka.  The stadium is nearby, and therefore visible from the main viewing platforms of the city, located on the Dyatlovy Mountains in the vicinity of the Kremlin, as well as from embankments and bridges. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lookmytrips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arrow Nizhny Novgorod" class="if uuid-2879633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82425/2879633.jpg"></div><h2>  The fate of the stadium </h2><p>  After the completion of Mundial, the sports complex will become the base stadium of the Nizhny Novgorod football club.  It is worth mentioning that his name changed to "Nizhny Novgorod".  Just like the team of the capital of the Volga region.  Now part of the stands has already been dismantled and the capacity of the facility is now 35,000 people.  However, this is more than enough to hold matches of the national championship and international competitions on a smaller scale than the World Cup.  Note that now the stadium is already operating in the new mode and regularly hosts the home games of FC Nizhny Novgorod.  And more recently, a match of the youth teams of Serbia and Russia was held on this site.  In the future, the object is planned to be used for city holidays, concerts, other events associated with a large crowd of people.  This is facilitated by the developed parking space around the stadium, its convenient geographical location and, of course, compliance with the highest safety standards. </p>
