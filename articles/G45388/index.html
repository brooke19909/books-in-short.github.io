You will not only improve your motor apparatus, but also develop as a person.  In addition, you will get a huge number of cute paper figures.  How to master this useful and interesting activity?  You can, of course, sign up for origami courses, but you can learn how to fold paper figures on your own, at home.  How to do it? </p><p>  In this case, the Internet can become your mentor at the origami rate.  Judge for yourself how convenient it is: you can do it at any time when it works out for you.  And, besides, no one gives you knowledge in a clear program - you decide what, when and why you want to do.  So, in this case, you are your own boss.  And we ourselves want to help you at the initial stage, and we offer you instructions on how to complete one of the figures - the origami ‚ÄúHorse‚Äù. </p><p>  In order to independently make this intricate figure out of paper, you will have to watch a video on the origami masterclass so that you can understand the basic principles of folding.  And of course, take advantage of the recommendations in this regard.  A simple scheme helps a lot when folding. </p><p>  An origami horse is a structure that is built from several components.  Therefore, one sheet of paper is not enough for you.  This method is called modular.  For work, it is better to choose high-quality quality paper - it will not turn yellow so quickly from time to time.  You will also need glue. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When folding, do not deviate from the scheme - check what you have with the picture so as not to make a mistake.  Because your one wrong move, and the figure will be ruined.  Therefore, if you want your origami "Horse" to be similar to artiodactyls, take the trouble to do everything according to the instructions. </p><p>  So, you will need to take a square sheet, fold it in half two times, then unbend it - these will be your reference lines - crosswise.  We bend the corner, and then, bend the remaining corners. </p><p>  The side parts will remain in the middle.  After that, our product will need to be turned over and a pocket extended.  Your origami horse will be winged. </p><p>  Corners need to be bent inward.  We make the necessary cuts. </p><p>  Corners on the front of the horse need to be made smoother - try to smooth them out as much as possible.  Then try to make the legs on the principle of folding the origami of lightning, glue all the parts together.  Origami "Horse" is ready.  By the way, if you know how to make this figure, then by its own principle, you can make an origami of a camel. </p><p>  You can use white paper for this figure, or you can make your origami ‚ÄúHorse‚Äù more like a real one and make a product from colored paper.  There is another option - to decorate the product.  The figure will be bright and picturesque. </p><p>  The modular origami "Horse" is not the easiest figure.  In order to make out the scheme, you will need to know the basic techniques and terms of the paper folding technique.  After all, origami is a whole science that has existed on Earth for more than one millennium.  Therefore, we decided to explain a few terms for you: </p><p>  1) The valley is the fold of the top corner over the paper.  The bent corner looks down. </p><p>  2) A mountain is a fold of the lower corner on top of paper.  The bent corner looks up. </p><p>  3) Lightning - a fold, which is a duet of two folds - valleys and mountains. </p><p>  4) A module is one part that is repeated several times in a product, that is, it is part of the whole. </p><p>  5) So, we hope that our little excursion will help you master the art that has captured the whole world.  By the way, the origami technique was invented in Japan by Akira Yoshizawa.  It was this man who created both the notation system and the terminology into which no one has made changes since the mid-twentieth century! </p><p>  Why is origami useful?  This lesson calms the nerves: after a long and hard day you can escape from worries and switch to a new type of activity. </p>
