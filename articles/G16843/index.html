  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Israel, Tel Aviv: photos, attractions, leisure, reviews from tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern metropolis, whose name translates as "rebirth hill", is a rather young city famous for its frantic pace of life, which attracts young people from different countries.  Founded in 1909, it delights in a special atmosphere. </p><p>  The vibrant and vibrant Tel Aviv (Israel) attracts tourists with interesting contrasts.  It is very different from religious Jerusalem, since there are no ancient architectural monuments and shrines, and pilgrims most often go around this corner.  However, the spirit of faith and history is in the air of a tourist paradise, which ranks second in the population of the state. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  At the beginning of the last century, around the old Jaffa, a city with a long history, where Noah built his ark, and the apostle Peter had a vision, a small Jewish quarter arose almost from scratch.  Soon, Akhuzat-Bait was renamed Tel Aviv (Israel) and began to accept Jews repatriated from Russia and Poland. </p><p>  In the 30s, when the Nazis came to power in Germany, German Jews returned here.  Talented builders designed concrete houses and paved streets that ran perpendicular to the waterfront.  In 1948, a noticeably grown city was proclaimed the capital of the new Jewish state.  And soon the oldest Jaffa was merged with Tel Aviv, after which the merger of the administrative center with the surrounding area begins.  The population of the capital is approximately 400 thousand inhabitants, and taking into account the suburbs, this number increases by 8 times. </p><h2>  Jaffa Old Town </h2><p>  Tourists who find themselves in this paradise will always find what to do with themselves.  Fans of outdoor activities will not remain disappointed, and fans to soak up the golden beach under the rays of the gentle sun receive a charge of positive emotions.  Walking is an ideal option for exploring a charming metropolis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="people-dont-have-to-be-anything-else.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jaffa old town" class="if uuid-2356831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356831.jpg"></div><p>  It is no coincidence that all guests go to Jaffa, because it is from this port city that the cultural and economic capital of the country grew.  The oldest attraction has retained its uniqueness, and the narrow streets with pretty stone buildings are noticeably different from the modern buildings of Tel Aviv (Israel).  The old Arab city, located within walking distance from the center, preserves the ruins of an ancient temple, as well as restored stone buildings.  Many tourists flock here, marveling at the calm atmosphere prevailing in Jaffa. </p><h2>  Bauhaus-style houses built internationally </h2><p>  Tel Aviv (Israel), whose photo makes tourists go on an exciting journey, is often called the "White City".  In the 30s of the last century there appeared houses painted in a snow-white shade.  Over 4 thousand buildings built in an aesthetically attractive Bauhaus style are located in the very center of the city.  The architects who fled from Germany worked in a manner prohibited by the Nazis.  Having become full-fledged residents of the young settlement, they created amazing structures that have been protected by UNESCO since 2003. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White City (Tel Aviv)" class="if uuid-2356838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356838.jpg"></div><p>  A very young city needed new residential buildings, and architects provided it with a unique model that reflected the integrity of simplicity, functionality and art.  The Bauhaus style turned out to be ideal: light colors reflect heat, small windows do not let in bright light, and in the evening, when a light breeze blows from the sea, residents gather on flat roofs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now the government is thinking about turning the neighborhoods into a real open-air museum, and is allocating huge funds for the reconstruction and restoration of the lost original appearance of the monument of world architecture. </p><h2>  Pagoda House </h2><p>  Speaking about the architectural attractions of Tel Aviv (Israel), one can not help but mention the luxurious villa, which is breathtakingly beautiful.  The pagoda house, combining several areas of architecture, is the most famous building in the country.  This is the eclecticism of the modern capital of the state and the first residential building in which an elevator and central heating appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House Pagoda in Tel Aviv" class="if uuid-2356839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356839.jpg"></div><p>  The most interesting monument erected in 1925 consists of four floors, and each has elements of a certain direction.  The motifs of medieval basilicas and Greek temples with magnificent colonnades can be traced here, and the Byzantine style is adjacent to the Moorish and Chinese.  The unique construction ends with a multi-tiered roof resembling a pagoda, and it is to this pyramid that it owes its name.  Now the house is owned by a Swedish millionaire who has restored an architectural marvel controlled by a computerized system.  More than $ 90 million has been invested in restoring the most luxurious villa in the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Crazy House </h2><p>  Among the many boring buildings in Tel Aviv (Israel), the so-called Crazy House stands out.  In 1982, the construction of an amazing structure began, which caused an ambiguous reaction of residents.  The building, to which the public regarded it as a curiosity, resembled the works of the talented Gaudi - a Spanish architect who created incredible masterpieces.  The architect L. Guinev did not hide that he imitates the Catalan genius, who left behind an invaluable legacy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crazy House (Tel Aviv)" class="if uuid-2356840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356840.jpg"></div><p>  However, all the creations of the master are solid structures that fit organically into the environment, and the building of the Israeli capital is ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù in snow-white twisted sheets, which, according to professionals, distorts the shape of the structure.  At its core, it is devoid of the usual curves and broken lines and is a concrete box, divided into residential apartments.  The "Madhouse", whose architecture has a bizarre shape resembling a floral ornament, is a kind of dividing line between the sea and the city.  It stands alone and is not connected to the buildings surrounding it. </p><h2>  Old port </h2><p>  In the 30s of the XX century, the old port appeared, which now represents one of the main centers of cultural life in the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv.  Anyone who expects to see the familiar harbor will be very surprised.  This area has undergone reconstruction and was filled with trendy establishments.  An interesting attraction, which turned into a giant recreation area, was chosen by local youth, and couples flock here on weekends. </p><p>  Inside the port there is a covered market, where people often come not only to make purchases, but also to imbue the local flavor. </p><h2>  Luxurious beaches </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in what kind of sea is in Tel Aviv (Israel).  It is curious that the cradle of many world cultures is the Mediterranean, where the first societies arose.  One of the main cities of the historical region is the famous resort, which is located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tel Aviv beaches" class="if uuid-2356843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356843.jpg"></div><p>  All architectural delights are perfectly combined with the golden beaches of the charming city.  The coastal part is a giant recreation area with access to the water.  All the beaches of the city, well-equipped even for people with disabilities, are very clean, and they are cleaned every day.  Comfortable hotels are located along the coastal line, designed for every taste and budget. </p><h2>  Yarkon Park </h2><p>  Tel Aviv (the capital of Israel), whose photo excites the imagination, boasts a picturesque park where it is so nice to relax and forget about the problems.  Located on the banks of the Yarkon River, it will surprise even many travelers who have seen it.  A quiet corner, hiding from a busy metropolis, will allow everyone to get lost among the emerald greenery, have fun in the water park, watch animals, indulge in romantic dreams. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shalomisraeltours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarkon Scenic Park" class="if uuid-2356844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356844.jpg"></div><h2>  What attracts foreign visitors? </h2><p>  The most famous resort of the state is an ideal place for relaxation.  In Tel Aviv (Israel), life never stops, and tourists will not be bored.  Daytime life, which includes excursions and relaxed pastime on the beaches, is replaced by night, boiling until the morning. </p><p>  In addition, foreign visitors are attracted by the medical infrastructure, because there are many institutions that treat cancer.  And fresh sea air and healing clay have a beneficial effect on patients suffering from respiratory and skin diseases. </p><h2>  Tel Aviv (Israel) travel reviews </h2><p>  As guests of the modern metropolis admit, a well-developed tourist infrastructure, luxurious nature and plenty of entertainment for every taste create ideal conditions for relaxation.  According to many guests, well-equipped beaches are the main attractions of the administrative center of the country. </p><p>  One of the most beautiful coastal cities in the world surprises with its contrasts.  Modern quarters with skyscrapers are combined with narrow streets, expensive restaurants with cheap eateries, and business centers with a huge number of green oases. </p><p>  Young people at first sight fall in love with a city that never sleeps.  Thousands of bars, cafes and clubs are open until the morning, entertaining guests.  Many claim that they did not see such an easy and relaxed atmosphere in other cities. </p><p>  According to tourists, the best time to visit is the period from April to October, when the average monthly temperature is 30 ¬∞ C. And the rest of the time it can reach 45 ¬∞ C. However, not everyone prefers to relax in the high season, choosing the end of spring and the beginning of autumn, when there is no large concentration of travelers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eipa.eu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Tel Aviv" class="if uuid-2356845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2356845.jpg"></div><p>  All guests agree that the capital of Israel, looking to the future, does not forget about its past and treats it with care.  Residents take care of their beloved city and are actively engaged in preserving all the attractions that emphasize the history of the colorful resort. </p>
