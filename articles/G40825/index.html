Resort Hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tunisia, Monastir ... Hotels in this region experienced the peak of their heyday in the 90s.  After all, the resort town was the birthplace of the former president of the country, now shamefully banished.  And the latter did not spare funds for his small homeland.  Good roads, lots of greenery, everything is clean and tidy - this is what Monastir presented to tourists from different countries, including Russia.  If initially the hotels here were located mainly in the city, close to medieval attractions, now a huge resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes is located north of the center.  It is there that most vacationers who come to Tunisia, Monastir aspire to.  The hotels here are popular with budget vacationers, as well as with people who have come to inexpensively improve their health with local thalassotherapy, and, of course, with party people.  Skanes has grown so much lately that it reaches almost the outskirts of Sousse, and from some of its hotels it‚Äôs literally ten minutes walk to the airport.  Therefore, tourists who do not want a distant transfer, love this area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Monastir Hotels" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/316647.jpg" width="410"></div><strong></strong>

    <h2>  Tunisia, Monastir.  Hotels by the "table of grades" </h2><p>  You can start the review of hotels with the most budgetary - three rubles.  These hotels are mainly located in the city itself.  They offer basic service and amenities.  In addition, the sea from them is across the street, and even further.  But you can feel the exotic of eastern life and enjoy the sights.  Not far from these hotels are the Bourguiba Mausoleum, the Big Mosque, and other monuments.  In addition, the port for pleasure yachts is located very close by, and on the promenade near it are the best fish restaurants.  Here you can eat cheaply and really well, as well as take pictures - Marina (harbor) is unusually picturesque and famous throughout Tunisia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Almost all of them are located in Skanes and are located right on the shore.  There are wide sandy beaches, so you can put your sunbed away from other vacationers and indulge in solitude.  By the way, this resort area cannot boast of nightclubs or other entertainment, so those who crave such comforts should go to Sousse for them.  Of the hotels, Royal Miramar, Thalassa Monastir and Village Skanes are most recommended.  But there are fours right in the center.  There are several ‚Äúfives‚Äù, very good both in location and in service, but far from being as luxurious as in other regions, for example, in Hammamet.  In order not to be unfounded, let us consider the amenities of the hotels of this resort by the example of two of them located in different places.
