It is one of the oldest, and therefore arouses trust among millions of customers.  Today with the company logo you can see the QIWI symbols.  This is another popular payment system.  In addition, the company has a name that is found in other variations, but relates to a completely different field.  Therefore, users sometimes wonder why, when asking how to set up the Rapid split system, they receive information about the payment instrument, and vice versa.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to dwell on this in order to eliminate misunderstanding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="securenews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="System logo" class="if uuid-3166271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166271.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a </h2><p>  Today, cars under the name Skoda Rapid drive on roads, there are engineering systems with the same name and much more.  But in search of feedback on the Rapid split system, experts sometimes get to the payment system page, and those who plan to connect an online cashier to their site are wondering why they are given information about air conditioning systems.  Therefore, clarification is required. </p><p>  The Rapid split system is an air conditioner.  And if we are talking about a payment service, then in this case you need to write and say ‚ÄúRapida‚Äù.  Since 2017, this platform has come under the control of QIWI, which is why these two logos began to meet together so often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Payment Service Features </h2><p>  "Rapida" is both a standard payment tool and a service for connecting payment modules to your website.  In the first case, we are talking about the possibility of paying bills via the Internet.  If we are talking about the owner of the site, then he can integrate a module on his resource with which the buyers of the online store will make payments. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that the Rapida payment system is suitable for both individuals and legal entities.  Consider its capabilities, depending on the category of client platform. </p><h2>  For individuals </h2><p>  Today, it‚Äôs not necessary to go to the bank branch and pay a long queue to pay bills.  The Rapida system offers users several options for depositing funds at once.  If a person decided to go shopping or take a walk in the entertainment center, then it would not be difficult for him to find a payment terminal for this company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finansoviyblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Accept payments" class="if uuid-3166272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166272.jpg"></div><p>  Those who do not want to leave home like to use this service as a virtual wallet.  For example, using the Rapida payment system, you can pay for your phone in seconds.  Also, users can deposit funds to pay for loans, fines, the Internet, utilities and many other services.  It will be useful to those who own the information site.  Such webmasters make a profit due to the fact that they install ads on the pages of the resource from the Google search engine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Withdrawing funds from Google AdSense </h2><p>  "Rapida" is the only payment system with which you can withdraw money received for advertising to a bank account or in favor of other virtual wallets.  This is very convenient, because today the Google AdSense service does not offer a wide variety of methods for earning money.  For example, you can withdraw money using a check, which then must be issued through the post office.  This is not the most convenient option.  Other methods involve not paying the most profitable commission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcquest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="POS system logo" class="if uuid-3166276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166276.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews by webmasters, the Rapida system is the best option.  Money comes to the account quickly.  The payment system itself does not charge any commission.  At the same time, you can transfer funds both directly to a bank account, and in favor of WebMoney and other intermediaries.  You can also withdraw money to the Rapida wallet itself.  But for this you will need to confirm your identity. </p><h2>  Identification </h2><p>  This procedure is necessary not only to withdraw money for displaying ads, but also, for example, if the user plans to repay the loan using this platform.  You need to confirm your identity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unfortunately, today this can only be done by a personal visit to the nearest Contact office.  This is another payment service that QIWI owns today. </p><p>  At the Contact office, you need to tell the employee that the client wants to go through the personification process for Rapida Online.  After that, you must present your passport and pay 250 rubles to the cashier.  The check must be saved without fail.  If the system suddenly crashes, it will help confirm the payment. </p><p>  Also, users note that 100 rubles of those that were paid to the cashier are immediately credited to the virtual wallet.  Therefore, in the end, the service is not so expensive.  If the procedure was successful, then the status of the account in the Rapida system will change and turn green.  After that, it will be possible to make any payments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bamabydistance.ua.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The man is sitting" class="if uuid-3166282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166282.jpg"></div><p>  But this is not all the functionality of the service. </p><h2>  For legal entities </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, this platform offers entrepreneurs convenient tools for online sales.  To do this, it is enough to conclude an agreement with the service and install the appropriate module on your website.  The platform offers a solution for owners of resources on CMS Joomla and other popular ‚Äúengines‚Äù. </p><p>  Additionally provided software that is installed on the computer.  This program allows you to track payments and analyze them.  But in order to use the full functionality of the service, you need to check your resource for errors. </p><h2>  How to start collaborating </h2><p>  First of all, you need to make sure that the site of the new system partner meets the standard requirements.  If we are talking about an online store, then all products should be with a description.  Sale of products or services that are prohibited on the territory of the Russian Federation is not allowed.  All pages of the site must be correctly designed.  They can not be errors or links that lead to completely third-party resources that are in no way associated with the goods presented. </p><p>  On the main page of the online store should be indicated information about the individual entrepreneur or LLC.  You must enter the physical and legal address.  In addition, the resource must contain information about the purchase and delivery of goods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rueconomics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Card in hand" class="if uuid-3166281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166281.jpg"></div><p>  To start cooperation with Rapida, you need to conclude an agreement.  Also, the service manager is presented with all documents that confirm that the business is registered in accordance with the law.  After checking all the papers, the tools of the so-called online cash desk become available to the client. </p><p>  Cooperation is possible with non-residents of the Russian Federation.  In this case, it is necessary to submit scans of the constituent documents, as well as confirm the status of this or that enterprise. </p><h2>  Rapida system: reviews </h2><p>  In general, users are satisfied with this service.  Payments are fast, and for some, Rapida is the only way to withdraw money from working with Google AdSense.  In addition, many pay attention to the versatility of the platform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iprodvinem.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="System site" class="if uuid-3166273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166273.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes problems arise only with the owners of credit companies.  In this case, most likely we are talking about limits on the services provided.  There are no complaints about the operation of the system. </p><p>  In the reviews, users note the reliability of the service.  All payments go through several stages of encryption, therefore the possibility of fraudulent activity is excluded.  That is why this platform remains one of the most popular. </p><h2>  Registration Features </h2><p>  If you need to quickly open an online wallet on this platform, the registration process will take only a few minutes.  To do this, go to the desired section and enter your data, including a mobile phone number.  After a few seconds, a text message with a short code will come to it.  It should be entered in the desired window and confirm your actions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ktonanovenkogo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Registration process" class="if uuid-3166279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3166279.jpg"></div><p>  A personal account is available immediately, but with limited functionality.  To expand it, you will have to contact the Contact office.  If we talk about the registration of a legal entity, then it occurs due to the conclusion of the contract.  Conditions can be clarified by managers through the feedback function implemented on the site.  You can also write a letter directly.  Addresses are also indicated on the site. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Rapida is a reliable platform for conducting cash transactions.  In almost every city you can find the terminals of this company.  If desired, all operations are carried out online.  This is a modern method of paying bills, which is used by more and more people today.  In addition, Rapida allows you to transfer funds to other virtual wallets. </p><p>  In addition, you should not confuse the payment tool with engineering solutions, air conditioners and cars. </p>
