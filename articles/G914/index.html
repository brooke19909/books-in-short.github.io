Programs can be installed on mobile gadgets and purchased separate devices for navigation.  Users can easily find interesting places to visit and build a route to travel to the desired address using GPS satellites.  However, not every gadget owner knows how to install a map on the navigator or update an existing one. </p><h2>  The most common navigation apps </h2><p>  There are many services for laying routes today.  However, not everyone was able to gain popularity and reach a wide audience of users.  The situation on the roads is constantly changing: new interchanges are being built, new lanes for traffic are added. </p><p>  Not every developer is able to cope with frequent updating of the system and entering reliable data into maps, therefore it is worth highlighting the most reliable navigation systems: </p><ul><li>  "Yandex maps"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúNavitel Navigator‚Äù; </li><li>  Maps.Me. </li></ul><p>  Each application contains the necessary set of functions for building a route and is equipped with an extensive and accurate base of terrain maps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="politeka.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Navigator on a mobile device" class="if uuid-2711930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711930.jpg"></div><h2>  "Yandex maps" </h2><p>  Yandex.Navigator is on the first lines among all navigation systems for Android, iOS, Windows Phone.  The necessary sections of the cards are loaded into the internal memory of the device, then deleted automatically.  When driving on a route, the user receives the latest data on traffic events and traffic jams.  The service is equipped with all the necessary functionality: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Maps are drawn with a high level of detail. </li><li>  The route is built taking into account traffic jams and congestion of road sections. </li><li>  The Traffic function is displayed on the device screen and off-route. </li><li>  Ability to leave a notification about a traffic event on the map. </li><li>  Filters of necessary POI objects (gas stations, hotels, cafes, shops, recreation parks). </li><li>  Built-in voice search and assistant, the voice of which can be changed. </li><li>  High-quality and intuitive interface with automatic transition to night mode. </li><li>  The speed indicator in the upper left corner and the maximum allowed in the right. </li><li>  The ability to switch to different modes of movement: on foot, by car, by bus, by bike. </li></ul><p>  For the full operation of most functions, a permanent Internet connection is required.  Maps and escorts along the route retain functionality if they are preloaded into the device‚Äôs memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Yandex Navigator Interface" class="if uuid-2711972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711972.jpg"></div><h2>  Uploading maps to Yandex.Navigator </h2><p>  The program is free and available for download in the official application store on your smartphone.  You can install Yandex.Maps on the navigator from the application menu.  To do this, follow these steps: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Launch the navigator on the device. </li><li>  Tap on the menu key in the lower right corner of the display. </li><li>  Click on the line ‚ÄúDownload maps‚Äù. </li><li>  In the search window, write the desired city or region. </li><li>  Click on the arrow icon to load the required map. </li></ol><p>  During the download, you should connect to Wi-Fi networks to speed up the process and save Internet traffic. </p><p>  A map-navigator on a phone or tablet is free of charge and will work even in the absence of mobile networks using a GPS signal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Download additional maps" class="if uuid-2711974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711974.jpg"></div><h2>  Navitel Navigator </h2><p>  The application is widely used on smartphones and special GPS devices for accurate route guidance.  The system is equipped with cards of the nm2, nm3 format, which require updating to provide correct data. </p><p>  On sale, there are often branded devices by Navitel or other manufacturers with built-in maps and the necessary functions for routing.  Additional purchase of a key for full work in this case is not required.  The devices are equipped with special power adapters for the car and proprietary fasteners on the windshield. </p><p>  Functionality of the Navitel system: </p><ul><li>  Detailed drawing of the atlas. </li><li>  Built-in services with traffic jams and weather. </li><li>  Automatic transition to night and day mode. </li><li>  Using the Speedcam file for speeding warnings, speed bumps, sharp turns and other traffic events. </li><li>  Frequent application updates and a rare occurrence of errors during operation. </li></ul><p>  Cons include the need to buy the full version when installing on a smartphone through the official app store.  You will have to pay for such a function as downloading a map to the navigator.  The health check is given 7 days, after which the purchase of the key from the developers is required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apptoko.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Navitel Interface" class="if uuid-2711984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711984.jpg"></div><h2>  Loading maps on Navitel Navigator </h2><p>  There are two ways to install Navitel maps on the navigator: through the application menu and by downloading a file to the device‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  The first method is quite simple: </p><ol><li>  You need to enter the navigator menu. </li><li>  Go to the "My Navitel" tab. </li><li>  A window opens with options for updating the atlas or loading new maps. </li><li>  The device will require you to pay after choosing a card and enter the key. </li><li>  To do this, go to the official website of the application and log in to your account. </li><li>  Pay by card by bank transfer. </li><li>  Enter the received key into the device. </li><li>  Map loading will start automatically. </li></ol><p>  You can install maps on your <span>Explay</span> or Prestigio <span>navigator</span> in the same way. </p><p>  A second way to install cards is also available.  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Log in to your account on the official Navitel website using your computer. </li><li>  Purchase the necessary card package. </li><li>  Download the file in your account. </li><li>  Connect the device to the computer. </li><li>  Copy the file with the replacement of the old one to the Maps folder on the device. </li></ol><p>  When you turn on the device will create a new atlas to replace the old one.  The procedure for installing the atlas on a smartphone or tablet is no different from how to install the map on the navigator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="br39.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car navigation device" class="if uuid-2711949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711949.jpg"></div><h2>  Maps.Me </h2><p>  A free application that is only available for download on mobile devices.  The system supports all common gadgets on the Android, iOS and WindowsPhone operating platforms.  Before installing in an outdated smartphone, you should make sure that you have a built-in GPS receiver. </p><p>  The main advantage of the system is the autonomous work with maps using GPS satellites.  A mobile Internet connection is only required to update the atlas or download a new area. </p><p>  The pluses include: </p><ul><li>  Convenient and intuitive interface. </li><li>  Autonomous work. </li><li>  Possibility of route guidance. </li><li>  Built-in voice assistant. </li><li>  The availability of comprehensive information about interesting places and places. </li><li>  Frequent updates and the ability to make changes to the object directly from a mobile device. </li></ul><p>  Cons include the lack of the Traffic service and the need for free space for cards, which often take up a lot of space. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Maps.Me Interface" class="if uuid-2711975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711975.jpg"></div><h2>  Loading maps on Maps.Me </h2><p>  An Internet connection is used to download new atlases, so you should take care of a stable signal in advance.  How to install the map on the navigator: </p><ol><li>  Launch the application. </li><li>  Enter the menu. </li><li>  Tap on the line "Download maps". </li><li>  In the search window, select the required region or city and click on the download arrow. </li></ol><p>  Maps are automatically saved in the device‚Äôs memory and will be accessible even without an Internet connection.  Automatic atlases will be updated once a month when a smartphone or tablet is connected to a Wi-Fi network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Search for maps in Maps.Me" class="if uuid-2711978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96817/2711978.jpg"></div><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Each navigator application is equipped with rich functionality and a good set of maps.  Free distribution of Yandex and Maps.Me navigation systems is provided through advertising, which may appear on the display at an uncomfortable moment.  The rest of the work of the services is organized at the highest level. </p><p>  The Navitel platform can be built-in when purchasing a navigator for a car or installed in a smartphone or tablet system.  The disadvantages of the platform include such difficulties as installing a map on the navigator and paid use. </p><p>  Downloading navigation from Yandex or Maps.Me into a car gadget is not possible due to the closed platform. </p>
