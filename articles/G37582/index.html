Far Eastern Avenue</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Far East Avenue of St. Petersburg is one of the main highways on the right bank of the Nevsky District.  The main part of this <span>district of St. Petersburg</span> is called the "Cheerful Village".  This historical part of the city, located on a stretch from the Neva to Novoselov Street, includes the Far Eastern Avenue, Kollontai, Dybenko Streets, Bolshevikov Avenue and several others.  There are several versions of the origin of the name of this area.  According to one - on this territory gypsy camps stayed for a while, on the other, it came from the name of a German settlement called the "Fun Colony". </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Far East Avenue, which is a continuation of Novocherkassky Avenue, starting from Zolnaya Street and ending with Bolshevik Prospect, is the main transport channel of the Vesyoloy settlement.  Trolleybus, bus (commercial and social) routes run along it, in the center, between two-way three-lane traffic, <span>tram tracks</span> are located on a special dedicated canvas <span>.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Far Eastern Avenue" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12952/320466.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The Far Eastern Avenue received its name in honor of the Far Eastern Territory.  For 16 years, from 1940 to 1956, it was a segment from Republican to Granite Street and was part of Novocherkassky Prospekt.  Only in 1962 this name was received by a new avenue, stretching along the right bank of the Nevsky district. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  At the postal address: Russia, St. Petersburg, Far Eastern Avenue, a large number of institutions.  Including commercial and social purposes.  On the site from Kollontai Street to Podvoisky Street, there are a number of large shopping complexes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia St. Petersburg Far Eastern Avenue" class="if" height="467" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12952/320467.jpg" width="600"></div>  These are round-the-clock chain hypermarkets “Carousel” and “Lenta”, construction hypermarkets “Leroy Merlin” and “Castorama”, furniture center “Furniture Wood”.  In 2010, the Felichita shopping and entertainment complex began operating, which, after reconstruction in 2012, to which British architects were involved, was renamed the London Mall.

On the left side (from Zolnaya street to Podvoisky street) there was an ash dump.  However, in 2007, at the intersection where the Far Eastern Avenue intersects with Kollontai and Badayev Streets, the Temp construction company began construction of a new residential complex, which includes 5 multi-storey brick and panel houses.  Nowadays, other construction companies are working on this site.  Large residential complexes Aurora and Vostok were built and commissioned.  Each year, the development of the territory of the former ash dump continues.  In 2012, the garages located on the site along the Far Eastern Avenue to Kollontai Street were demolished, a huge amount of cubic meters of land was removed, and construction of the Rio Housing Complex and social institutions was started. </p>
