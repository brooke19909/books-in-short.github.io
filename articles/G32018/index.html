Electrical equipment requires special attention, so the maintenance of this area is often entrusted to specialists.  But also there are simple and often preventive measures that can be performed even by an inexperienced motorist.  For example, it can be a test of the voltage at the terminals or a <span>measurement of the</span> current <span>resistance</span> of the on-board network.  For such operations, special testers are purchased - multimeters.  This is a small device that allows you to take the necessary measurements in minutes.  Which multimeter is better to choose is a controversial question, and the answer to it can only be given if individual needs and preferences of the user are taken into account.  Nevertheless, there are general rules for such a choice, the knowledge of which will help solve this problem. </p>

    <h2>  Multimeter Overview </h2><p>  The device is a measuring tool of small dimensions, which allows using its functionality to assess the state of the electrical circuit, as well as reflect its specific characteristics.  As standard, such devices serve as voltmeters, ohmmeters, and ammeters.  We can say this is a set of operations that characterizes a universal multimeter.  Which is better to choose for home?  Perhaps, in terms of the functional content of this set of operations is quite enough for domestic needs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, it will be useful for the car to provide additional functionality.  In particular, some of the specialized models of this type also allow you to work with specific on-board equipment.  Such devices allow you to determine the performance of the tachometer and speedometer.  True, excessive filling with functions is not always a plus to the quality of measurement.  Therefore, it is still worthwhile to adhere to standard modifications in which a modern multimeter is produced.  Which is better to choose from the point of view of ease of use is also an important issue, which takes into account the nuances of handling the tool.  In particular, the usability of the device will depend on its type. </p><h2>  Types of device </h2>

    <p>  Fundamental separation takes place according to the method of management and presentation of measurement data.  Morally obsolete, but reliable analog instruments with mechanical controls are still in demand on the market.  These are pointer devices that differ in poor functionality, but at the same time they are understandable to most even novice users.  But classic testers are being replaced by a <span>digital multimeter.</span>  Which is better to choose for a car in this case?  It is advisable to focus on models with ticks.  Such modifications, in particular, are optimally suited for working with battery packs, since they eliminate the need for additional equipment.  The digital model of the multimeter itself is also advantageous in a modern way of presenting data that is displayed on a liquid crystal display.  In the improved versions, computer filling is also used, thanks to which it is possible to process the received data. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2>

    <p>  Technical parameters should be the basis for making a choice.  This mainly concerns the range of measured values.  In particular, using a multimeter with a wide range, the user can determine the current strength in the spectrum from 0.1 ŒºA to 10 A. Also, the resolution that the multimeter provides is taken into account - which is better to choose for this indicator?  Of course, the higher the bit depth, the better the measurement quality.  This allows you to more accurately evaluate the measured values.  Another thing is that small gradation is far from relevant in all cases. </p><p>  An essential selection criterion is the accuracy of the device.  Officially, it is presented as an error coefficient.  For example, for digital testers, this value usually varies from 0.02 to 3%.  But on the question of how to choose a digital multimeter, the measurement principle itself is important, since low-power equipment is often examined.  And in terms of measurement stability, by the way, it is sometimes analog modifications that manifest themselves better. </p><h2>  Model FLUKE 15B </h2>

    <p>  A compact device suitable for universal needs, including operation changes in the vehicle electrical system.  The model is a classic representative of the digital testers segment.  It is distinguished by a low error rate of 0.5%, as well as the presence of automatic control systems.  For example, if the question is which multimeter is better to choose from the point of view of optimal bit depth, then you can safely give preference to this device.  Its automation allows you to determine the most suitable bit depth without user intervention.  And after making the measurement, the device will give characteristic sound signals.  By the way, data is updated every 3 sec., Which contributes to the rapid implementation of complex measurements. </p><h2>  Model Mastech MS8040 </h2><p>  A representative of a rare class of industrial testers that are rarely found in everyday life, but sometimes such models justify themselves in the economy of ordinary motorists.  Especially if, in addition to servicing the battery, the user is dealing with electrical work.  High bit depths, the ability to work with circuit chimes, the evaluation of linear frequencies and amplitude values ‚Äã‚Äãare only part of the advantages that this stationary multimeter has.  Which is better to choose a tester from the segment of professional devices?  This question is asked by motorists who, in addition to the main indicators, also plan to fix the circuit capacity, frequency and temperature.  And the modification of the MS8040 is just right for such needs.  For this reason, many car service employees use the model, although, of course, the lack of mobility is its serious drawback. </p>

    <h2>  Model  DT-101 </h2><p>  If you need a very simple model to perform infrequent measuring actions in the main list of indicators, then this option may be suitable.  In the budget segment, he is one of the most reliable, although significantly limited in his abilities.  The advantages of the device include compactness, lightness and ease of operation.  In answer to the question of which multimeter is better to choose for quick and hassle-free measurement of circuit performance, this model can be considered.  In addition, the tester in this modification has a digital display and optimized controls, so for a beginner it may be the best choice. </p><h2>  How much is a multimeter? </h2>

    <p>  The above version costs 700 rubles.  In the segment up to 1000 rubles.  many interesting offers with more features are also presented.  The middle class offers devices with price tags of about 1.5-2 thousand rubles.  These are multifunctional devices with a reliable elemental base and a modern option.  Apart from the general segment is a <span>professional multimeter.</span>  Which is better to choose?  The price, which in this case is about 20 thousand, can complicate the choice or, at least, make it more accurate to determine the spectrum of the necessary functions.  For home car maintenance, it is entirely possible to limit yourself to cheaper devices.  But, as already noted, if you plan to use the device for other, more responsible and time-consuming measuring tasks, it makes sense to get a professional model like the MS8040 from Mastech. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  In multimeters, regardless of their belonging to one or another class, indirect parameters are often not the last value.  This applies, in particular, to the nutritional method.  Which multimeter is better to choose by this criterion?  The battery must be capacious and reliable so that it does not fail in conditions of temperature changes.  The quality of the battery is difficult to evaluate in the selection process, but manufacturers of the FLUKE or Mastech level rarely supply their products with power supply units that are frankly weak and sensitive to external influences. </p>
