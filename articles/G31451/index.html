    <p>  To get to the city beach, you need to walk only 600 meters. However, it is not famous for its cleanliness, so many people prefer to go to the local port and from there go by boat to the island of Koh Lan.  This small island has excellent sandy beaches, which is why most of the guests of the city tend to get here.  The port itself is also within walking distance of the hotel, which is very convenient. </p><h2>  Hotel services Beverly Plaza 3 * </h2><p>  In one of the hotel buildings there is a fully equipped conference room that can accommodate up to 100 guests.

For a fee, you can also use the laundry service, call a nanny for the child, order a Thai massage. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily. Bed linen and towels are also changed every day.  In the restaurants for the youngest guests there are highchairs, and in one of them there is even a special children's menu.  However, there are no special entertainments for children here, there is only a small playground. </p>

    <p>  So, a superior room will cost 1800 baht per day (about 3500 rubles with a rate of slightly less than 2 rubles for 1 baht), a deluxe room will cost 2000 baht (almost 4000 rubles), a junior suite - 3000 baht (almost 5800 rubles. ), and for the most expensive exclusive one you will have to pay 3,500 baht (almost 7,000 rubles).

This is very simple in our century, because there are a large number of resources on which tourists post their travel reviews. </p><p>  Of course, reviews about the Beverly Plaza hotel can also be easily found on any such portal.  Judging by them, this hotel is more suitable for single people or young couples who come to Pattaya and are going to actively attend excursions and various entertainment places.  Indeed, animation is practically absent in the hotel itself, and for the children there is almost no service at all. </p><p>  But guests speak very well about the varied food in local restaurants, as well as about very affordable prices.  So, for example, for an excellent lunch you will have to pay only 300 baht.  They leave normal reviews about the hotel rooms, however, many say that it would be nice to have them repair and renovate old furniture.  Complain about the noise from the street, which often interferes with a comfortable stay. </p>
