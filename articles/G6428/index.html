There were no freezes in all game applications, the picture remained smooth with any parameters.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The heating of the smartphone was negligible, which can also be attributed to the pluses.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>The Chinese are very proud of the results of synthetic tests of their offspring.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In terms of performance in the AnTuTu program, he almost caught up with such monsters as the Samsung S8 and iPhone 7 Plus.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>We can say with confidence that gamers will like the smartphone.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>A powerful processor, coupled with 6 GB of RAM, will allow you to run almost any game application on your smartphone.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>Unfortunately, the smartphone does not have the ability to expand the amount of internal memory.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The owner of the device will have to be content with the available 64 GB from the younger version.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>If you have the finances, you can purchase the top version of the device, offering the user 128 GB of internal memory.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  "The battery drained sharply on my phone ..." </h2><p>  <span><span><span>It's time to analyze the autonomy of the device.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The smartphone uses a 3350 mAh battery.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Given the stuffing of the smartphone, we can assume that it is better not to expect a long time without recharging from the device.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>In principle, it turned out that way.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>With the active use of "heavy" functions, the gadget does not survive until the end of the day.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>You have to either carry the charger with you to work, or buy an extra one for use in the office.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span><span><span>To be honest, the flagship of this level wanted more battery life.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Well, why was it impossible to put a battery of</span></span></span> <span><span><span>increased</span></span></span> <span><span><span>capacity</span></span></span> <span><span><span>in it</span></span></span> <span><span><span>?</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It would be very convenient if the smartphone reached the end of the day without using an outlet.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It will not be superfluous to note that there are often negative ones on the network among Xiaomi Mi6 battery reviews.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Comparison with iPhone 7 Plus </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Smartphones of the Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi are striving to compare with Apple products.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Yes, and the smartphone Xiaomi Mi6 in some details repeats the solutions used in the iPhone 7 Plus.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For example, it has two cameras.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>And</span></span></span> <span><span><span>at the same time it</span></span></span> <span><span><span>does not have a standard</span></span></span> <span><span><span>output for stereo headphones, which is repeated by a colleague from Apple.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The Mi6 screen also does not lose much in terms of the characteristics of the iPhone 7. The performance is almost the same level.</span></span></span> </p>
