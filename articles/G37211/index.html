In the thirteenth century, the state consisted of only two principalities: Novgorod and Kiev.  How did it happen that the Golden Horde and Russia were so heavily dependent on each other for such a long time? </p><h2>  <span>Foreign policy of</span> Ancient Russia </h2><p>  Before the invasion, the Mongol Russia lived its own life and developed according to the Western model.  It cannot be said that she did not pursue any foreign policy: various kinds of ties were established with countries that were located in the north, west, and south of the borders of the principalities.  Cultural, commercial, military relations were established with neighboring peoples.  Such a policy was carried out from the ninth to the twelfth century.  <span>The Khazar Khaganate,</span> which was located on the eastern borders of the land, the Russian princes did not recognize.  They defeated the capital of the Kaganate, the city of Itil in 965, and no longer entered into any diplomatic relations with him, which was their biggest mistake.  Kievan Rus and the Golden Horde were on the verge of events that would be called the "Tatar-Mongol yoke." </p><p>  All eyes of Kievan Rus were turned to the West, whose ancient civilization, culture, Christian ideology influenced many developing countries.  The Balkans, the <span>Roman Empire,</span> Germany, France are countries with which relations have been strengthened.  When did Russia and the Horde collide?  The problems of the mutual influence of these countries subsequently lasted for such a long time. </p><h2>  The situation in the Middle East </h2><p>  At that time, when Russia was engaged in building relations with Europe and its own development, Asian peoples conquered the Arab countries and the Middle East.  They tried to spread their Islamic faith among these peoples.  In the 20s and 30s of the thirteenth century, the influence of the peoples of Asia began to spread to the countries of southern Europe and even to Hungary.  But the Eastern European part and especially the territory of Russia suffered the most. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Tatar-Mongols conquered its disparate states and thereby slowed down their development.  Russia and the Golden Horde, the history of their relationship, which lasted more than two centuries, had an impact on the geopolitical situation.  The interests of the princes moved from West to East: to Asian countries.  The status of Russia has changed: the country has ceased to be independent.  Now it was a vassal state with the psychology of Asians. </p>

    <h2>  Russian-Horde relations </h2><p>  This mutual dependence lasted almost 250 years.  Over such a historical period of time, much can change that has happened with Russia and the Horde state.  This is a natural process of mutual influence of two closely interconnected states.  The Golden Horde and Russia over the entire historical period of involuntary communication underwent evolutionary changes that reflected on the political and moral condition of the two countries.  The Mongol-Tatar yoke, which lasted from 1243 to 1480, began as early as 1237.  Then, when Batu was raiding.  Russia and the Horde, the problems of mutual influence that are still being felt, during this period only began their long historical relations and development. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During the campaigns of Batu, the northeastern part of Russia suffered devastation, ruin and loss of population.  Some of them were killed, some were taken prisoner.  The damaged military forces needed to be restored, and this took a lot of time.  Thanks to the efforts of Alexander Nevsky, the forties of the thirteenth century were calm regarding raids: both diplomacy and the moment of the formation of the Horde itself played a role.  The khans were busy building its internal structure. </p>

    <h2>  Basquality and requisitions in Russia </h2><p>  The task of the Mongol khans was to capture new lands and tax them.  They did not change anything in these territories and did not try to attach them to themselves.  But the tribute with which they taxed the nations was predatory.  The relations between Russia and the Horde became tense: internecine problems in the principalities affected.  In the mid-fifties there were military conflicts with the Mongols.  The oppression of the Golden Horde intensified every year, and the population was not able to pay tribute, and therefore opposed extortion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The people were enumerated for two years - from 1257 to 1259, and imposed a double tribute for the khans: the Horde and the Mongols.  And gradually Basquiatism was introduced.  Sent governors who monitored the collection of tributes were called Basques.  With the help of their population held in obedience.  In addition, the duties of residents included military service, which should be performed.  The Baskaki were provided with detachments of soldiers and administrative powers, with the help of which they monitored the order in the territories entrusted to them. </p>

    <h2>  Princes in the service of the Horde </h2><p>  The farmers collected tribute from the population and played the role of money lenders: the buy-in system had difficult conditions for payments.  So people fell into a lifelong bondage.  Severe demands led to the discontent of the population, the attitude of Russia escalated, and the Horde representatives felt this.  The wave of uprisings that swept through many principalities became an indicator.  The central place where the people rose against the farmers was Rostov.  Behind him rose Yaroslavl, Vladimir, Suzdal.  In many cities, rebellions took place in 1289.  In Tver - in 1293 and 1327.  After Cholkhan, a relative of the Uzbek khan, was killed, and farmers were repeatedly beaten, the authorities of the Golden Horde decided to transfer the collection of tribute to the Russian princes.  They had to do requisitions themselves, and the Horde had to pay a "way out." </p><h2>  ‚ÄúExits‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequests‚Äù </h2><p>  There was another kind of requisitions - this is a ‚Äúrequest‚Äù.  Additional funds that were collected from the population when the khans were preparing new military campaigns.  Russia and the Horde, the problems of their mutual influence on each other, made the life of the people intolerable.  The rulers of the Horde were beneficial that in Russia there was fragmentation between the feudal principalities.  They deliberately pushed the princes between themselves, sowed discord between them. </p><p>  There was also a system of labels during this period: these were letters that were awarded to those who could have a grand princely throne.  Supporting one prince, the khans of the Golden Horde set another against him.  Those who were dissatisfied with the rule of the Horde were summoned to the khan and there they were already punishing him.  Such a fate befell Mikhail Yaroslavich Tversky and his son Fedor.  Many princes and boyars were taken hostage by the Mongols. </p><p>  Horde officials were always with the princes and carefully watched their moods: they kept a finger on the pulse.  In such an environment, relations between Russia and the Horde developed. </p><h2>  Golden Horde from the inside </h2><p>  When Genghis Khan pursued his policy in the conquered lands, he recommended that he be very tolerant of religion.  The ruler bequeathed this principle to his followers.  Therefore, the khans tried to maintain friendly relations with the church: they exempted from tribute, gave labels - letters.  By their influence on the church, the Horde khans hoped to conquer the resisting Russian people.  Such a relationship between Russia and the Golden Horde lasted for many years.  But not everything was in order inside the Mongolian state either: it was also torn by feudal contradictions, and it was weakening. </p><p>  And in Russia at that time, in the <span>XIV century,</span> popular movements tried to undermine the Mongol-Tatar yoke.  In order not to lose influence on the people, the church and the ruling circles changed their position.  Now they advocate the liberation of Russia from the Mongols. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  The first to voice support for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãliberation were Sergius of Radonezh and Metropolitan Alexei.  <span>The Battle of Kulikovo,</span> which took place in 1380, defeated the troops of Mamaia and significantly weakened the Horde.  In 1408 - Edigey, in 1439 - Khan Ulu-Muhammed made unsuccessful campaigns in Russia: their attacks were repelled.  But another 15 years paid tribute to the Mongol-Tatar government.  Against this background, Russia and the Horde (their relationship problems reached their peak) changed roles: Russia united and strengthened, and the Horde weakened. </p>

    <p>  The Mongol rulers also had problems with the Crimean Khanate: the situation was difficult for them.  It was this moment in history that Ivan III used: in 1476 he refused to pay tribute to the Horde.  But the final liberation of Russia occurred only in 1480, when Khan Ahmed took another military campaign.  This company was a failure and brought another defeat to the Mongols.  So, relations between Russia and the Golden Horde gradually changed: there was a liberation from the yoke. </p><h2>  Problems of mutual influence </h2><p><strong></strong>  It is difficult to underestimate the changes that occur with people and society during such long historical events.  It is sad that it took almost three hundred years for the princes and the entire ruling elite to understand that strength is in unity.  Having survived the Mongol-Tatar yoke, the peoples of Russia united in a <span>centralized state.</span>  This was a plus at that time.  But it cannot be denied that the consequences were difficult for the development of both countries, which were Russia and the Horde.  The problems of mutual influence caused the Russian state to lag behind the overall European development: the country had to recover for a long time from the dire consequences of the yoke.  Destroyed cities, ruined principalities demanded a long recovery.  But Orthodoxy was preserved, which became a connecting link in the life of the people and the state. </p>
