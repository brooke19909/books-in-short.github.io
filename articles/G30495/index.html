Located an hour's drive from the capital of the autonomous region of Catalonia, <span>Lloret de Mar</span> has a centuries-old history, which locals will gladly tell about. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Initially, the territory was inhabited by ancient Iberian tribes, and later Roman soldiers settled here.  New residents turned the settlement into a shopping center, establishing links with other cities.  The first mention of the village dates back to 966 AD. </p><p>  The fishing village, which turned into a big city, flourished throughout its existence.  In the XVIII century, the first wealthy rebuild palaces, surprising a special luxury. </p><p>  The economic prosperity of Lloret de Mar (Spain) continued until the 20th century, and many years of stagnation ended in 1950 thanks to the tourism business.  The charming city, hosting hundreds of thousands of guests, creates all the conditions for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The most visited tourist center of the Costa Brava, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 48 square meters, boasts a mild climate.  The average air temperature is about 27 degrees in the summer and not more than 10 in the winter. The weather does not present any unpleasant surprises because the mountains protect the coast from the piercing wind.  Therefore, tourists rush to the resort all year round, although the official beach season begins in May and ends in October. </p><h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the guests, they are attracted to the well-maintained and incredibly picturesque beaches that <span>Lloret de Mar</span> is famous for <span>.</span>  <span>Lloret de Mar</span> (Spain) has its own specifics, which should be known to future travelers.  The colorful city is called the youth capital of the country, and a large number of young men and women among vacationers will be a confirmation of this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The popular Lloret beach is extremely crowded, and the inhabitants of the city bypass it, choosing more secluded places for their vacation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Holidays for every taste </h2><p>  Another favorite beach for tourists is La Caleta.  An unusually picturesque corner is suitable for those who dream of a quiet pastime.  The purest sand without a single stone, the complete absence of debris and strong waves will be enjoyed by couples with children and lovers. </p><p>  But lovers surrounded by cliffs, where there are no people at all, choose campers.  In the desert corners come not only tourists enjoying stunning sunsets and sunrises, but also Spaniards with large companies. </p><p>  It is not for nothing that they say that every vacationer will spend time in the resort with benefit, and there will be entertainment for every taste and budget. </p><h2>  Lloret de mar hotel </h2><p>  Another advantage of the sunny city is the large number of hotels located along the coast, so all guests are provided with a beautiful view from the windows.  Comfortable apartments will please wealthy tourists, and students choose cheap hostels with a good level of service. </p><p>  Perhaps one of the most famous hotels located in the heart of the city is the three-star Palm Beach.  Lloret de Mar (Spain) is proud that even budget institutions offer a wide range of services, and Palm Beach is no exception.  The hotel, which has 153 rooms, is famous for its chic pools, a jacuzzi, a Turkish bath, an excellent gym and much more.  Working on an all-inclusive system, it is in incredible demand, so tourists will book their holidays here in advance. </p>

    <p>  The cost of a ticket for one person at the box office is about $ 30, but if you order it via the Internet, you can save a lot of money and get a pass on the second day for free. </p><p>  The rides of one of the largest water parks in Europe are fascinating, and many are truly unique.  High-speed slides with whirlpools, descent in pitch darkness from a height of a 70-story building, pools with artificially created waves will cause a real adrenaline rush.  There is entertainment for those who are not keen on extreme sports, so Parc Aqu√†tic WaterWorld choose different age categories. </p><h2>  Unusual cemetery </h2><p>  The daily modernist cemetery will surprise you with a special atmosphere, where there is no place for despondency and grief.  Catalans bury their relatives in beautiful family crypts, which you can admire.  Real architectural monuments made in the Art Nouveau style that appeared in the 19th ‚Äì 20th centuries look unusual, and the necropolis with the absence of obvious signs of a cemetery is not in vain called an open-air museum. </p>

    <h2>  The symbol of the city </h2><p>  A bronze sculpture on a distant beach attracts thousands of visitors to Lloret de Mar.  Monument to his wife, accompanying her beloved husband, a sailor, appeared in 1966, but already overgrown with legends.  Tourists overcome the path to touch the foot of the statue and look in the direction in which the gaze of the iron maiden is directed.  According to legend, it is then that all the desired wishes come true. </p><h2>  Modern attraction </h2><p>  The castle on the beach, built to attract guests, will be a surprise for everyone who appreciates architectural works.  Castell d'en Plaja, which adorned the coast in 1940, will surprise with its monumentality.  It‚Äôs impossible to get into private ownership, but you can climb to the observation deck, from where a stunning picture of the calm sea and the busy city opens.  It is especially beautiful here at night, when a highlighted landmark stands out against a dark cliff. </p>
