A ball with a diameter of forty centimeters will need about three standard skeins of yarn. </li><li>  For gluing threads, many are advised to use special wallpaper glue or starch-based glue.  But how to make a lampshade of thread and a ball with your own hands, if these materials are not at hand?  The answer is simple - do not waste money, do not give up the idea and do not immediately run to the store.  Look into the child‚Äôs office, there is probably a large supply of ordinary <span>PVA</span> school <span>glue.</span>  It is great for sticking yarn to the surface of the ball. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Stock up on <span>rubber gloves</span> as well <span>.</span>  There is a lot of work with sticky glue. </li><li>  Capacity for glue. </li><li>  Brush for spreading glue. </li><li>  Lighting fixtures, wire for hanging the finished product to the ceiling and a light bulb (ordinary or energy-saving, not heating). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a lampshade from threads and a ball" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1614141.jpg" width="450"></div></li></ul><h2>  Inflate balloon </h2><p>  First, decide on the size.  You definitely need to understand how many balls you need and what the thread lampshade should be.  Gently inflate the ball to the desired shape.  Try to tie the ball, as they say, tightly.  If you tie the base of the ball too loosely, then while the glue dries, the ball will deflate.  As a result, you get a shapeless circle, not a circle that is completely inappropriate to decorate your home with. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Recall Elementary School </h2><p>  Remember how papier-m√¢ch√© animals were made in schools?  But if then we used ordinary sheets of paper, applying them to a form impregnated with glue, now the paper will be replaced by yarn. </p><p>  Pour glue into a specially prepared spacious tank in advance.  We put on rubber gloves in order to protect the manicure and skin of the hands from the effects of glue.  We begin to dip the yarn gradually into the glue.  You could even say that not just dipping, but soaking the threads.  They must be very well saturated with it. </p><p>  Some use glue in jars.  A hole is made there and a thread is passed there.  On the Internet there are a lot of options on how to wet threads and how to make a lampshade of threads with your own hands.  The master class that we offer recommends the use of a container for glue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thread and ball lampshade" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1614138.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <p>  According to the advice of experts, according to some reviews of hostesses who have already decorated their homes with thread lamps, this is a more convenient option.  In addition, soaking all the threads at once is much more convenient than sitting and passing three skeins through a jar of glue.  Saving time and effort is no small matter. </p><h2>  Attach a thread </h2><p>  When the thread is well saturated with glue, it can be attached to the ball.  To begin, we fix it at the base of the ball.  Knit tightly, make knots.  Do not be afraid that the thread will stand out from above or the ends will stick out noticeably.  After everything is dry, unnecessary parts will simply be cleaned with scissors. </p><p>  And now comes the most creative moment.  When the base of the thread and the ball are tightly interconnected, you can proceed to winding the thread on the ball itself.  You can do this in any order.  The appearance of the lampshade will depend on the size of the thread that you have chosen, on its color and on the option of winding. </p><p>  Tip: if you are making a lampshade from threads and a ball for a living room or children's room where there should be more light, then try to wind the threads not too close to each other.  So weaving will be chaotic, but not continuous.  If the lampshade is prepared to create a romantic atmosphere in the bedroom, then you can "darken", that is, wrap the threads more tightly to each other. </p><p>  When to stop?  We advise winding the thread until the ball is almost completely hidden from view.  As a rule, four to five layers of thread are enough for this.  Also try to ensure that the end of the winding falls on top of the ball.  There you will fasten the end of the thread. </p><p>  For a stronger fortress, you can walk along the wound threads with a layer of PVA glue, applying it with a brush already. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY lampshade" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1614140.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to dry a ball </h2><p>  It is recommended to suspend the ball so that it does not lose shape.  If this is not possible, then find bulk dishes and place the ball there.  It can be a round basin or a deep pan.  We wait a day until the product finally dries. </p><h2>  And the ball burst </h2><p>  After everything dries, you can burst the ball.  This should not cause any difficulties. </p><p>  Tip: before starting the process of winding yarn, grease the base with a thin layer of petroleum jelly or degrease the surface with an alcohol solution.  This will allow the threads to easily move away from the ball when you burst it. </p><h2>  Let there be light! </h2><p>  So, you already know how to make a lampshade from threads and a ball.  It remains a little - to fix our product on the ceiling.  To do this, take a light bulb, screw it into the lighting fixture.  Fasten the fixture with the brushes inside the lampshade.  Then it remains to adjust the length of the wire.  It is necessary that the lighting element is strictly in the center of your thread creation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class thread lampshade" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1614137.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We fix the new lighting fixture to the ceiling hook.  Turn on the light and enjoy our work. </p><h2>  Additional recommendations </h2><ul><li>  Choose a quality glue that will not turn yellow after drying.  Otherwise, the color of the threads will change. </li><li>  It is not recommended to hang such lighting fixtures in bathrooms and saunas.  Humidity in the air can adversely affect the product.  The lampshade will simply get wet, the glue will not hold the thread, and the whole structure will fall apart. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thread lampshade" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1614139.jpg" width="400"></div></li><li>  Use additional decor elements, glue them to already dried threads.  Butterflies or stars, petals or flower buds will only add unusualness and style to your product. </li><li>  Instead of yarn, you can also use lace napkins, lace or light-transmitting fabrics. </li></ul>
