    <h2>  Side Alegria Hotel &amp; Spa: room description </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that almost all apartments in the hotel are standard.  Therefore, you will not find any serious differences between them.  Each room has air conditioning, cable TV and telephone.  Vacationers claim that the apartments in the hotel are small, but very comfortable and clean.  The bathrooms have a powerful hairdryer and a good selection of cosmetics.  All of them are poured into containers with dispensers. </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with safes, but for them guests will have to pay about two dollars per day of use.  It is nice that many rooms have sea views.  This is especially pleasing in the evenings when you can enjoy magnificent sunsets from the balcony. </p><h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  Hotel guests claim that the beach here is a real fairy tale.  It consists of a small sand, and the entrance to the water is safe even for kids.  The beach area is equipped with sun loungers and parasols, which can be used for free.  Nearby is a bar, open until half past four in the evening.  There you can refresh yourself with water and other soft drinks, as well as dine.  From twelve to three in the afternoon, fresh cakes with chocolate and cheese are baked on the beach.  Vacationers claim that they have a unique taste and are worth it to try this oriental delicacy. </p><p>  The only minus of the beach is the abundance of people on it.  The fact is that the coast in this place is quite narrow, so the influx of vacationers turns a pleasant and measured vacation into sea swims among a real crowd of the same tourists.  However, approximately five hundred meters from the hotel beach is a pretty cozy place where you can relax in a more secluded atmosphere.  Some guests of Side Alegria Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * prefer to go there. </p>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars and cafes of the hotel </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the hotel operates on an all inclusive system.  Side Alegria Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * has three restaurants, as well as several bars and cafes.  This will allow even the most fastidious guests not to stay hungry.  The main meals are the famous buffet and are held in the main restaurant.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, there is always a very fresh and tasty food.  Of course, do not forget that all dishes have a certain Turkish flavor, but among them you can always choose something suitable for yourself.  Every day on the table are present: </p><ul><li>  Fresh and stewed vegetables.  Dishes from them are always exhibited in abundance for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </li><li>  Steamed meat and fish dishes. </li><li>  Stewed fish, meat and chicken. </li><li>  Grilled dishes (they are prepared during dinner). </li><li>  Assorted fruits (plums, melons, watermelons, apricots and so on). </li></ul><p>  The restaurant has two rooms: open and closed.  Each is designed for three hundred people. </p><p>  In two additional establishments, you can have dinner for free once during the rest.  Dishes are selected on the menu, but according to the reviews of hotel guests they are still inferior to those prepared by the cook of the main restaurant. </p><p>  Bars and cafes are very skillfully distributed throughout the hotel.  In whatever part of the hotel complex the tourists relax, they will always see nearby some institution where you can satisfy your hunger. </p><h2>  Travel cost </h2><p>  Our compatriots claim that when choosing Side Alegria Hotel &amp; Spa the price of the tour will not be the lowest.  The hotel complex is quite popular and expensive, so be prepared to pay at least four and a half thousand rubles per day for living here.  Moreover, this amount does not include air travel and transfer. </p><p>  However, the reviews of those who spent their holidays at the hotel give an idea that it is here that you can quickly get rid of the accumulated fatigue and get a lot of new positive impressions. </p>
