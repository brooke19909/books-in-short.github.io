    <h2>  Sunset noble residence </h2><p>  The love of Messrs. Sheremetyevs for the clan nest was great.  Grandson of Peter Borisovich, Sergei Dmitrievich, the last owner of a chic residence, made considerable efforts to preserve the estate created by the ancestors. </p><p>  They escaped from the ruin of Kuskovo.  The Sheremetyevs estate with the cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãaccumulated in it was scrupulously described by Sergei Dmitrievich before the official transfer to the Soviet government.  He purposefully turned the estate into a museum. </p><p>  Thanks to Sergey Dmitrievich, the architectural and park ensemble with the richest collections collected by the owners, was destined to become a major center of Russian culture and enlightenment.  In 1918, the Sheremetyevs' estate was recognized as a historical monument and converted into a museum. </p><h2>  Moscow Region Versailles </h2><p>  Since the owners intended to hold lavish social receptions and grandiose celebrations here, the estate was ennobled by residential and hunting houses, park arbors, and menageries.  It even built a Kunstkamera and created a small fleet of ships on the ponds. </p><p>  The architectural and park complex managed to preserve over 20 unique monuments of Russian architecture, surrounded by magnificent elements of the garden landscape.  The estate museum includes a palace, houses with elements of Italian, Dutch and Swiss architecture, pavilions, greenhouses, churches and other buildings of the boyar and serf courtyards. </p><p>  Versailles near Moscow is called Kuskovo.  The Sheremetyevs estate, the photo of which demonstrates how beautiful it is, rightfully deserves such a high rank.  There is a museum of ceramics in the old estate.  It contains the world's largest collection of ceramic and glass products.  Expositions represent objects created by masters in different parts of the world, from antiquity to the present. </p>

    <h2>  Sheremetyevo Palace </h2><p>  The magnificent palace is the compositional center of the baroque rocky complex in Kuskovo.  The Sheremetyevs' estate is decorated with a huge French park, where ponds with graceful arbors and marble sculptures gleam with mirror saucers. </p><p>  In the two-story palace, the layout was fashionable in the 18th century.  It has a suite of rooms.  The doors of the rooms are on the same axis, the halls open sequentially, one after the other.  The palace halls were intended for ceremonial receptions of guests.  Wine cellars and utility rooms found a place in the basement of the so-called Big House. </p>

    <h2>  Guest houses </h2><p>  The names of the houses are not accidental in Kuskovo.  The Sheremetyevs' estate combined the buildings of different styles invented by Dutch, Italian and Swiss architects.  At the latest building - a wooden Swiss house, decorated with elegant "wooden lace", the first floor is painted "brick".  This allows the original chalet to resonate with the Dutch pavilion. </p><p>  The two-story pavilion, built in 1749, is called the <span>Dutch House.</span>  The construction is the personification of the era of Peter I. Its functional purpose is clearly delineated.  The first floor is occupied by the kitchen, and the second is a beautiful living room. </p><p>  In the Italian house, which belongs to the number of federal architectural monuments, from 1755 they organized "small" receptions.  In the palace-pavilion, the parade of rooms deprived of a solemn suite is emphasized by a variety of architectural and decorative decoration. </p><p>  Halls for small receptions are decorated with oak panels, gilded carvings, typeset parquet and <span>decorative painting.</span>  Thanks to the exquisite luxury of the miniature decor, the interiors of the Italian house are charming. </p>

    <h2>  Pavilions </h2><p>  The owners of the residence and people close to them were resting in the Hermitage pavilion.  The grotto is recognized as a unique pavilion.  Its interior, decorated with shells, is amazing.  It is made of stone in the style of luxurious baroque. </p><p>  Having become a museum, the estate of Count Sheremetev continues to live.  Kuskovo keeps the ancient traditions of Russian estates.  Here they still receive guests, organize concerts, exhibitions, excursions, festivities and festivities for them. </p>
