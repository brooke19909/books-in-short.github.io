    <p>  The tax return on the transport tax contains data on the number of years of use of the vehicle (line 100).  If a differentiated rate and an <span>increasing coefficient are</span> simultaneously set for a car <span>,</span> then this line must be filled.  If the tax is calculated only on the basis of the coefficients, then information on the number of years of use of the vehicle is not necessary. </p><p>  Line 110 displays the number of months a vehicle has been owned in the current year.  That is, if the vehicle was purchased in December, the number should be put in this article 1. The month of registration and deregistration is considered separately.  Line 130 indicates the utilization rate of the vehicle.  It is calculated by dividing the number of months of ownership by 12. The decimal fraction should appear in the report.  If several legal entities own the car at once, then line 120 should indicate the share of a specific taxpayer (1/3, 1/4, etc.).  The number "1" in this article means that the car is recorded on one owner.  Let us consider in more detail how a tax return is filled out (an example of rounding off the coefficients). </p><p>  On August 8, the organization acquired a truck.  This year the number of full months of using the vehicle is 5. Ownership ratio is: 5/12 = 0.416666.  The report should display a figure taking into account the rounding of 0.4167. </p><p>  Line 140 indicates the tax rate.

    <p>  A sample declaration is presented below. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The Law on Transport Tax stipulates that the calculated amount is adjusted for the available benefits.  Data about them is reflected in the declaration.  The total result is indicated in line 250. If advance payments for transport tax were transferred during the year, the total amount is calculated taking into account these payments.  All cash flows are displayed in section 1 of the declaration. </p><h2>  More about the odds </h2><p>  Calculation of tax on an expensive car has its own nuances.  Since 2015, increasing coefficients have been applied to such vehicles, and advance payments for transport tax are calculated in the usual manner.  That is, the multiplication of engine power, expressed in liters.  s., on the bet and on ¼.  After entering the coefficients, the form of the form was updated. </p><p>  The list of luxury cars is approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and is displayed on the agency’s website.  If there is no specific vehicle in the list, then the tax is calculated in the usual manner.  If the car is listed, then you must first determine two indicators: age and average cost of a car.  The size of the coefficient depends on them. </p>

    <p>  The age of the vehicle corresponds to the year of manufacture.  According to Art.  361 of the Tax Code, the number of full years is determined as of January 1 of the current year.  In this case, the calculation starts from the period following the release of the car.  That is, if the tax amount is calculated in 2016 for 2015, the number of years is determined as of 01.01.2016.  It is very important to correctly fill out the declaration at this point.  Even if the car is old, but is listed, there may not be a coefficient on it.  Then the tax will not increase. </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  We calculate the age of the car that was released in 2012 to determine the amount of tax payable in 2015.  The basis for the calculation as of 01.01.2015 are two calendar periods: 2013 and 2014. The year of issue is excluded from the calculation. </p><h2>  Average car price </h2><p>  This indicator is calculated in the order approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade No. 316. The document has two formulas.  In both cases, identical indicators are used: the purchase price of the car and the current value at the time of release.  The calculations are strongly influenced by the price of a new TS analogue that is in effect during the billing period. </p><p>  The first formula is used when the vehicle manufacturer or its authorized person has a representative in the Russian Federation.  In this case, the calculation is based on retail prices.  Manufacturers provide these data to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, they are available on the Ministry’s website.  The average cost of the vehicle is calculated by adding up the retail prices valid on July 1 and December 1 of the reporting period.  The result is divided by 2. </p>

    <p>  The second formula is used when the manufacturer and his authorized person do not have their representative offices on the territory of the Russian Federation, or when data on the machine is not provided to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  In this case, for the purposes of tax calculation, retail prices for new vehicles with the appropriate characteristics (model name and year of manufacture) indicated on December 31 of the reporting period in Russian or foreign catalogs (FSUE NAMI, Audatex, KelleyBlue Book, DAT, Mitchel, Canadien are used) Black Book, Motor, Schwacke).  The same data must be used for vehicles older than 5 years. </p><p>  To determine the average price for Russian catalogs, it is necessary to sum the maximum and minimum cost of a car for the reporting period at the prices indicated in the catalogs, and then divide the result by 2. </p><p>  Prices from foreign catalogs are calculated in two stages.  First, the cost of the vehicle is determined by the formula used for Russian catalogs.  Then, the obtained value is adjusted by two coefficients: conversion of prices into rubles and utilization fee. </p><p>  Average cost = value obtained by the formula for Russian catalogs * price conversion ratio + amount of utilization fee and import duty </p><p>  Price conversion ratio = (foreign exchange rate as of 01.01 of a car + foreign currency rate as of 31.12 of a car) / 2 </p><h2>  Example </h2><p>  We determine the average cost of a car based on recommended prices.  The LLC owns a vehicle, which is included in the list of cars with an average cost of 3,000,000 rubles.  The relevant data are available on the website of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  The recommended price of the model as of 01.07 is 3400 thousand rubles, and as of 01.12 - 3380 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The average cost of a car = [(3.4 + 3.38) / 2] = 3.39 million rubles. </p><h2>  Individuals </h2><p>  Citizens of Russia who have cars must also pay the transport tax.  The return of the declaration is carried out online.  To do this, you need to log in (enter the TIN and password) on the <span>tax service</span> website <span>.</span>  Then go to the section "Objects of taxation" and enter data about the car.  If the user cannot get into the personal account on the site, then he needs to gain access: contact the tax office with a passport, code and register in the system. </p><p>  There are situations when a car is listed on the property list, but a tax notice is not received.  In such cases, you need to submit an application in your personal account with a request to calculate the amount of the fee on the vehicle.  A scan copy of the registration certificate, Title, sales contract is attached to the letter. </p><p>  Since 2017, fines are introduced.  In case of failure to provide information on the availability of vehicles, an individual will have to additionally pay 20% of the tax amount to the budget. </p><p>  Some citizens still receive notice by mail.  The document is sent at least 30 days before the payment date.  Each region of Russia has its own deadlines, but in general, the payment date should not be earlier than 30.11.  That is, citizens can pay the tax for 2014 after 11/30/2015. </p><p>  Information on the availability of debt can be found in the Bank of enforcement proceedings.  The FSSP has developed special applications for the social networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.  There are also applications of the same name for smartphones, through which you can find out the amount of tax calculated and receive the latest news. </p>
