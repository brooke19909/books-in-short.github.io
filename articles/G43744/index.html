Brave, smart, able to make decisions and lead.  Of course, to a large extent, these dreams were stimulated by the way the press and literature described the military.  In those days, every student knew the names of the marshals of the <span>Soviet Union</span> !  It is worth remembering that these people did this, which many sought to imitate! </p><h2>  How many marshals were there in the USSR? </h2><p>  In fact - a lot.  Yes, this is not surprising when you consider that the title was introduced back in 1935, and was abolished only in 1991.  But at the same time, the significance of this designation is completely obvious: for all years, 41 people became marshals of the Country of Soviets.  Indeed, many of them have become legends and role models during life.  True, not everyone remained so in the future. </p>

    <h2>  Surnames of marshals of the Soviet Union, who know almost everything </h2><p>  The greatest admiration for those military leaders who earned the title of Marshal not in peacetime, but in those years when the country was in danger. </p><p>  Georgy Zhukov is a man who just became a living legend.  This native of a peasant family has fought for Russia since 1915.  Note that he was clearly not only smart, but also very brave.  In Tsarist Russia, St. George's Crosses weren‚Äôt just given out, and Georgy Konstantinovich had two of them!  Injuries and concussions did not prevent Zhukov from building a career.  By the beginning of <span>World War II,</span> he was already an established professional.  It is not surprising that this person became one of the members <span>of the General</span> Headquarters and replaced the <span>Supreme Commander-in-Chief.</span>  He became Marshal Zhukov in 1943.  Until the end of his days, this man was the Marshal of Victory.  Such names of marshals of the Soviet Union are known even to those who have never opened a history textbook! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Rodion Malinovsky is one of the heroes that the country knew in person!  He was born in Odessa, but did not become a sailor.  From a young age, he fought for his state.  So, already in 1915, Malinovsky received the St. George Cross.  And a year later he proved himself in France - there he was also awarded a military cross.  When Russia became part of the Land of Soviets, Rodion Yakovlevich joined the Red Army.  During the Second World War, he fought with the Germans in many areas.  In particular, he took part in the <span>battle for Stalingrad,</span> expelled enemies from Ukraine (by the way, from his native Odessa too).  Note that Malinovsky clearly did not sit in the rear, commanding operations.  This is evidenced by the fact that he was injured.  This man became a marshal in 1944. </p>

    <p>  When listing the names of the marshals of the Soviet Union, it is necessary to mention Konstantin Rokossovsky, who also did a lot to defeat the armies of the Nazis.  By the way, by nationality he is a Pole.  But, again, all his life he fought for Russia!  His military career began in 1914.  The St. George Cross and two medals were definitely obtained for a reason!  He was always ahead, not afraid of anything.  By the way, Rokossovsky was not always in mercy - from 1937 to 1940 he was imprisoned.  But, nevertheless, in 1941 he again went into battle for his country!  A severe wound near Sukhinichi (not the first in his life) did not incapacitate Rokossovsky.  And in 1944 he became a marshal. </p><h2>  But would it be worth taking an example from all marshals? </h2><p>  Not all the names of the marshals of the Soviet Union today are fanned with a halo of glory and nobility.  For example, Lavrenty Beria is a figure so odious that very few people will want to imitate him.  Well, and Leonid Brezhnev, who also had the rank of marshal, by definition was not a hero who went into battle and defended his homeland, shedding blood. </p><h2>  Marshals of the Soviet Union: are there any living among them? </h2><p>  To date, only <span>Dmitry Yazov,</span> who received the title of Marshal in 1990, is still alive.  He is already 90 years old.  The same marshals of the Soviet Union, photos of which are published in the article, unfortunately, are no longer with us. </p>
