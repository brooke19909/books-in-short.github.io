  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyprus, Larnaca - hotels for every wallet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Larnaca All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/315703.jpg" width="594"></div></h3><p>  Simplified visa rules for Russians, a short flight and European <span>standards of service,</span> plus the sea, <span>subtropical climate</span> and lots of historical sights - these are the things that conquer the hearts of our tourists in Cyprus.  Larnaca, whose hotels are considered the most affordable, has its own airport.  This is a huge advantage in choosing a place to stay.  The sea here is gradually gaining depth, the bottom is sandy, which makes Larnaca a favorite destination for tourists with small children.  The following is a brief overview of local hotels.  We make a reservation in advance that ‚Äústar rating‚Äù in this resort has a purely nominal value, and often a 4 * hotel can be better than a ‚Äúfive‚Äù, and a family apartment will provide more comfort than a cramped hotel room. </p><h2>  <span>Cyprus, Larnaca:</span> hotels for discerning customers </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this resort is called the most democratic on the whole island, there is no shortage of hotels for moneybags.  "Golden Tulip Golden Bay Beach 5 *" is one of those.  This is not even a hotel, but a resort town.  An exotic park is located on its territory, four restaurants serve guests.  It offers a truly huge swimming pool, solarium, sauna, gym, massage room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Larnaca Hotels" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/315706.jpg" width="480"></div></h3><h2>  Cyprus, Larnaca: 4 star hotels </h2><p>  They are immeasurably more than "fives."  The pompous entrance to Achilleos City 4 * immediately catches the eye.  But most of the "fours" are concentrated east of the central promenade of Finikoudes.  Here guests are offered a wider choice.  Are you hated by high-rise buildings?  In the ‚ÄúPali Beach Hotel and Bungalows‚Äù at the settlement you can order a nice house in the Indonesian style in the back of the garden. </p><p>  The resort resort ‚ÄúLouis Princess Beach‚Äù is also built on the motives of the village, but the Mediterranean: houses here with balconies, under tiled roofs.  Guests have the opportunity to use the jacuzzi and sauna for free - a service that Cyprus, Larnaca rarely provides.  All-inclusive hotels here are also quite rare.  In most hotels, guests are given a choice: breakfast, half board or full board (drinks during lunch and dinner are not included in the price).  Louis Princess Beach and Palm Beach are among the few hotels operating in <span>all inclusive</span> policies <span>.</span> </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus Larnaca 3 star hotels" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/315719.jpg" width="465"></div></h3><h2>  Cyprus, Larnaca: 3 star hotels </h2><p>  The vast majority of them are here.  Therefore, a truly widest choice of accommodation options is opened for visitors in buildings, apartments, family hotels with six rooms, villas ready to accommodate from five to ten people.  Not all of them are located on the front page, but five minutes to go to the sea from the force.  ‚ÄúBew Rivage 3 *‚Äù is good for those who do not speak foreign languages.  90% of the guests are Russian, and the staff knows this language and used to not be surprised at anything.  But the first line and the sea are at hand.  It is possible to place both in the buildings and in the bungalow, and all-inclusive meals, half and <span>full board.</span> </p><h2>  Cyprus, Larnaca: 2 * hotels </h2><p>  This is mainly an inexpensive apartment with a fully equipped kitchen.  So you can save money not only on accommodation, but also on food, buying products in the nearest supermarket.  But there are hotels in this category that operate on an all-inclusive basis.  For example, a small (56 rooms) hotel "Cactus".  It is located a quarter-hour walk from the Finikoudes promenade and literally a few steps from the sea.  Umbrellas and sun loungers are provided on the beach for free.  For entertainment, there is a massage parlor and a sauna. </p>
