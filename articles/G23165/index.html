Manufacturers understand that consumer demand for them is not very high, so in the lines represent a limited number of copies.  Unfortunately, not a single protected smartphone has become a sales leader, but this does not mean that there are no buyers at all for such devices.  The target audience is those people who lead a fairly active lifestyle or work in extreme conditions. </p><p>  In 2017, the Chinese company introduced the ‚Äúarmored car‚Äù smartphone Blackview BV7000 Pro, continuing the line of protected devices.  Its predecessor is the BV6000.  For the price, these devices practically do not differ.  Their cost varies between 10,000 and <span>10,500</span> rubles.  Could the manufacturer exceed the results achieved?  What innovative technologies did the developers use in the new product?  In order to answer these questions, we studied the technical characteristics of the smartphone, announced by the manufacturer, as well as reviews of experts and owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview bv7000 pro reviews" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2024226.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  As a package for this phone model, a square cardboard box was chosen.  Designers designed it in a modern style.  White neutral color acts as the basis.  The model name is printed in the lower right corner.  In order to focus on him, he was allocated a frame in the form of a triangle with a blue background.  Blackview inscribes brand affiliation.  It is located in the middle with a slight offset to the left side face. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to open the box, just remove the top cover.  Under it there is a special panel with a hole for the phone.  It is decorated in black.  Thanks to the contrast, the packaging looks quite presentable.  Under the panel, the buyer will see the accessories laid out in compartments.  We are talking about headphones with a control button, OTG and USB cables, power supplies and a key clip, which is designed to remove the tray.  The latter installs SIM cards and external drives. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the manufacturer has provided two screen protectors in the factory equipment.  One is already glued to the device, the second is attached separately. </p><h2>  Buyers share first impressions </h2><p>  If you study the reviews about <span>the Blackview</span> BV7000 Pro <span>phone</span> , you will notice one feature.  She touches the SIM card tray.  In order to open it, you will need to make a lot of effort.  The process itself consists of three stages: </p><ul><li>  First, you need to open the plug that covers the tray itself. </li><li>  The second - using the long end of the paper clip, you must press on the top surface of the slot. </li><li>  Third - you need to turn the key and pry the tray, after which it can be removed from the phone. </li></ul><p>  According to many users, opening a tray is a time-consuming process.  The only thing that calms you down is to do it infrequently.  And this design complexity is explained by the high protective level of the case, thanks to which water will not be able to penetrate into the device. </p><p>  There is another point that buyers have noticed, but this time it can be attributed to the merits.  This is a protective film.  The manufacturer was pleasantly surprised, who, in addition to the main one, provided for an additional one.  It is inexpensive.  But this brand is still not considered popular enough, therefore, such accessories are not sold in all retail outlets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And what impression did the design and hardware have on users?  Consider this point in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blackview bv7000 pro 4 reviews" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2024211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Definitely, the Blackview BV7000 Pro Black receives positive reviews about the design, even though the specificity of the phone introduces some limitations.  It makes no sense to compare it with ordinary gadgets, since protected devices have distinctive features. </p><p>  Externally, the smartphone is not much different from simple phones.  The case has pronounced angles that look pretty rough.  The frames are very wide and there are 12 bolts on the back.  Not without metal inserts.  They pass along the side faces, performing a protective function.  Also, using pads made of this material, the camera is decorated. </p><p>  The smartphone not only looks powerful in appearance, but also has a fairly large size.  With dimensions of 153x78.9x12.6 mm, its weight reaches as much as 222 g. It feels good in the hands, bag, pocket, but it is unnecessary to talk about convenience, since a lot of weight causes some discomfort.  Will have to manage only two hands. </p><p>  Most elements of the case are not designed for aesthetics, but to protect the device from dust and water.  For this reason, all connectors are equipped with special plugs.  This looks, of course, a little rude, but according to users in the BV7000 Pro model, designers have maximally refined the appearance (at least as much as possible). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The owners of the buttons have comments.  First of all, they play.  Also, the disadvantages include the ease of pressing, because of which the phone, being in your pocket, begins to "live its own life." </p><p>  In the role of screen protection, the manufacturer used <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. For such devices, this, of course, is very small.  As a rule, in protected gadgets there are special frames that do not allow the screen to break during a fall.  But users believe that in this model they are not high enough to perform their functions flawlessly. </p><p>  But the touch control panel received a lot of praise.  It has backlight and excellent response.  The owners of the smartphone and the presence of a fingerprint scanner noted.  There are no comments on his work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone reviews blackview bv7000 pro" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2024210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Blackview BV7000 Pro:</span> display <span>reviews</span> </h2><p>  The device has a 5-inch screen.  It goes well with the overall case.  The frame framing the display is black.  She's pretty fat.  The screen has good features.  For example, users highlight Full HD.  The picture is displayed efficiently, due to its high resolution.  The density is 440 ppi.  This is currently a decent indicator.  IPS technology has provided owners with a good level of color and wide viewing angles.  The sensor is sensitive, and even very. </p><p>  It is because of this that it is easy to accidentally unlock a smartphone.  It is impossible to adjust the sensor, because the developers did not provide the appropriate settings.  In addition to this drawback, some owners have paid attention to the color temperature.  She's a bit chilly.  Unfortunately, you cannot change it.  The weakness also applies to the light sensor.  It works slowly.  On the street, the screen fades, the brightness is not enough for comfortable work in the sun. </p>

    <h2>  Degree of protection </h2><p>  About the protective properties of the Blackview BV7000 Pro, reviews get good.  The manufacturer has created a device that meets the IP68 standard.  According to these standards, the phone can not only be immersed in water, but even arrange photography in water.  Advanced users conducted their independent testing.  Yes, the device works after getting wet, but moisture remains in the dynamics and near the plugs.  Before using the phone, it is recommended to wipe it well. </p><p>  For some reason, the manufacturer did not indicate anything about shock resistance.  It is worth noting that in this model there are no rubberized inserts on the side faces.  The developers replaced them with metal plates.  Owners say that they withstand shock, but, unlike rubber, they do not have cushioning. </p><h2>  Hardware "stuffing" </h2><p>  Positive <span>reviews Blackview BV7000</span> Pro (4 GB - RAM) receives address performance.  It is based on the chipset of the Chinese company MediaTek MT6750T.  The main processor with 8 cores is paired with a Mali-T860 graphics card.  Such hardware is commendable. </p><p>  Many users were delighted to learn that the developers implemented as many as 4 GB of RAM in the device.  Native memory is more than enough even for advanced users.  The gadget has a storage capacity of 64 GB.  In their comments, the owners focus on the capabilities of this model.  For her, even labor-intensive tasks will not become a problem. </p>

    <h2>  Interface </h2><p>  On the seventh "Android" is a protected smartphone Blackview BV7000 Pro.  Reviews about this version of the operating system are positive.  However, some comments were made to the proprietary shell.  The changes affected the appearance of the interface, which not everyone liked.  Owners have to get used to the new icons.  Also, when you first turn on the device does not offer to register with Google or synchronize data.  As for functionality, the manufacturer left all standard options unchanged. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  As for the autonomy, the Blackview BV7000 Pro mobile phone receives only laudatory reviews.  The manufacturer chose not the most powerful, but quite productive 3,500 mAh battery.  It provides the smartphone with a high load of at least 1-2 days.  There is a power saving mode.  You can charge the battery from 0 to 100% in 2.5 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone blackview bv7000 pro reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2024213.jpg" width="473"></div>

    <h2>  Let's talk about camera features </h2><p>  The cameras also received mostly positive reviews.  Blackview BV7000 Pro is equipped with modules of 13 megapixels (main) and 8 megapixels (front).  Although the quality of the pictures and can not compete with professional cameras, but it is quite worthy.  The only thing that customers need to understand is that this model is an ‚Äúarmored car‚Äù resistant to water and shock, not a camera phone.  But even such optics is enough to capture a memorable picture, for example, somewhere on top of a mountain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone blackview bv7000 pro armored car" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2024212.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  It's time to take stock.  Positive reviews about the Blackview BV7000 Pro are dedicated to: </p><ul><li>  high standard of protection; </li><li>  decent level of performance; </li><li>  good design (if you compare only gadgets in this category); </li><li>  large amount of memory; </li><li>  decent battery life. </li></ul><p>  But not without a fly in the ointment.  You can also find negative comments from the owners.  They mainly discuss the interface of the proprietary shell, inconvenience during operation and sound quality. </p>
