  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coriolis Strength</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In pseudoscientific forums, with surprising frequency, serious debate erupts about what is the Coriolis force and what are its visible manifestations.  Despite the venerable age of discovery - the phenomenon was described back in 1833 - some people sometimes get confused in the conclusions.  For example, since the Coriolis force is most often associated with phenomena in the oceans and the atmosphere, one can find the statement on the Internet, according to which the washing of the rivers of the <span>Northern Hemisphere</span> occurs on the right side, and in the South the erosive effect of water is mainly on the left banks.  Some argue that this phenomenon creates the Coriolis force.  Their opponents explain everything differently: due to the rotation of the planet, a solid surface shifts a little faster (less inertia) than the mass of water and because of this difference we wash out.  Although in some part of the processes taking place in the ocean, the Coriolis force is really ‚Äúguilty‚Äù.  The difficulty is in determining it from a complex of other influences.  The Coriolis manifestation, like the <span>force of gravitational</span> interaction, is potentially. </p><p>  Let's decide what kind of power it is and why it is of such interest.  Since our planet can be considered a non-inertial system (moves and rotates), then any process considered with respect to it must take into account inertia.  Usually, a special pendulum with a length of over 50 m and a mass of tens of kilograms is used to explain this.  In addition, with respect to a stationary observer standing on the floor, the plane in which the pendulum swings rotates around a circle.  If the value of the planet‚Äôs rotation speed is higher than <span>the oscillation period of the</span> pendulum, then its conditional plane will shift towards the Northern Hemisphere, rotating in the opposite direction to the clock.  The converse is also true: an increase in the period higher than the Earth's rotation speed will lead to a shift in the direction of the clock hands.  This is due to the fact that the rotation of the planet creates a rotational acceleration in the pendulum system, the vector of which displaces the rolling plane. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To explain, you can use an example from life.  Surely, everyone, as a child, rode a carousel, which is a large disk rotating at some <span>angular speed</span> .  Imagine two points on such a disk: one near the central axis (A), and the second at the radius (B) near the edge.  If a person located at point A decides to move to point B, then, at first glance, the most optimal <span>path</span> will be a straight line AB, which is actually the radius of the disk.  But with each step of the person, point B shifts, as the disk continues to rotate.  As a result, if you continue to move along the intended radius line, then when you reach the radius of point B, it will no longer be there due to the displacement.  If a person adjusts his path in accordance with the actual position B, then the trajectory will be a curved line, a wave whose vertex will be directed against the direction of rotation.  However, there is a way to go from A to B in a straight line: for this you need to increase the speed of movement by informing the body (person) of the acceleration.  With increasing distance AB, an ever-increasing velocity impulse is needed to maintain <span>rectilinear motion</span> .  The difference between the described force and the centrifugal one is that the direction of the latter coincides with the radius on the rotating circle. </p><p>  So, the Coriolis force acts on the movement of a rotating object.  Its formula is as follows: </p><p>  F = 2 * v * m * cosFi, </p><p>  where m is the mass of a moving body;  v is the speed of movement;  cosFi - a value that takes into account the angle between the direction of motion and the axis of rotation. </p><p>  Or, in a vector representation: </p><p>  F = - m * a, </p><p>  where a is the acceleration of coriolis.  The sign ‚Äú-‚Äù arises because the force from the side of the moving body is opposite to the direction. </p>
