Due to the almost annual increase in tariffs for natural gas, the sums in payments are very impressive.  It is not surprising that with the beginning of spring, people begin to think about the device for effective thermal insulation of their own homes, as well as the replacement and modernization of the heating system, about that set of measures that will reduce heating costs.  One of his key points is the replacement of the boiler with a more economical model. </p>

    <h2>  Existing varieties </h2><p>  Depending on the design and efficiency, the market for heating appliances offers customers several options for boilers.  Among them, the most famous are the classic gas ones that do not require anything other than supplying blue fuel for their work.  Such solutions are characterized by relatively low cost, but in terms of efficiency, they are inferior to other modifications.  Thus, wall-mounted heating boilers have a number of advantages and are currently at the peak of popularity, displacing the classics.  In their design, a special pump is used, forcing the circulation of the coolant.  In addition, the electronic control board allows you to control the operation of the gas burner, adjusting the intensity of the fire and completely turning it off if necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/684305.jpg" title="" width="600"></div>  All this allows to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of natural gas.  Despite the fact that the cost of a wall-mounted heating boiler is higher than a conventional floor-standing boiler, the difference is literally covered in one to two years.  Of course, depending on the intensity of its use.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Important feature </h2><p>  Since such solutions use not only gas, but also electricity, in its absence the operation of a wall-mounted boiler is impossible.  Not only the circulation pump is switched off, but also all internal boards.  The result is simple - the boiler does not work.  Even if there is gas in the system.  Here is such an unpleasant feature.  And if the owner of such a modern water heater does not take care in advance to purchase a suitable uninterruptible power supply for the boiler, then if there are problems with the power supply, you will have to freeze in your own house.  We strongly recommend that you do not rely on the stability of the power supply, since very often the causes of malfunctions are weather conditions that can damage any, even the most reliable electricity distribution system.  Here he is - a wall-mounted gas boiler.  <span>An uninterruptible power supply</span> makes it possible to provide it with energy for the time necessary to restore centralized power supply. </p><h2>  Give me two buckets of current ... </h2><p>  For people familiar with electrical engineering, it is not difficult to choose the right UPS for the boiler.  With some reservations, this can also be said for computer specialists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/683803.jpg" title="" width="360"></div>  Others, only remotely imagining what a sinusoid is, <span>electrical voltage</span> and <span>direct current,</span> can not choose the right uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  As a result, using the advice of "experts", many acquire incompatible UPS for gas boilers, which in the best case leads to errors in the operation of control electronics.  Indirectly, this means a decrease in efficiency.  In the worst case scenario, the use of improperly selected UPSs for gas boilers causes the failure of some expensive logic units and the need to replace them.  Our recommendation is as follows: before buying a backup power source for a wall-mounted boiler, you need to carefully read the information on this issue and understand the basic principles of such a system.  The extra hour spent later can save an impressive amount.  Moreover, there is nothing complicated about this.  Choosing an uninterruptible power supply for the boiler, you can consider only some key points.

To understand the magnitude of the complication, we can cite the fact that some boilers allow the owner to configure work using mobile communications.  It is quite clear that the characteristics of the electricity supplied to the device must be within acceptable limits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/683804.jpg" title="" width="356"></div>  So, if it is indicated that the boiler requires 230 V for its operation, then the voltage should be just that (+ -10%, which is provided for by the standard).  In addition, although many people know that in home electrical outlets, the current is alternating, not everyone understands what this means in practice.  In fact, the term "variable" indicates a feature of this type of current - the presence of a sinusoid.  That is, the direction of motion of the charged particles flowing along the conductor is periodically replaced by the opposite.  Household appliances are designed to operate in this mode.  Obviously, if this is not observed, then there may be malfunctions in the functioning of sensitive elements - the very electronics.  In addition, the mismatch of the network parameters causes increased heating of the constantly running pump motor.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The conclusion is simple: when buying <span>an uninterruptible power supply for the boiler,</span> you should definitely study the specification for it and make sure that the selected backup unit gives the device a pure sine wave.  Otherwise, it is better to refrain from buying this particular UPS and look for alternative models. </p><h2>  Sine wave </h2><p>  Motorists know that all existing batteries produce direct current.  In order to turn it into a variable, you must use a special electronic circuit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="batteries for boilers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/683805.jpg" width="398"></div>

    <p>  All uninterruptible power supplies cope with this task, but if you connect an oscilloscope and look at the sine wave created by low-cost models, then instead of a parabola, a <span>step pyramid will be</span> displayed on the screen <span>.</span>  For consumers, undemanding to this characteristic of the power grid, this fact is completely unprincipled.  For example, light sources, computers with their own converters and much more equipment work fine.  However, if instead of a sinusoid at the output there is a "pyramid", then no one guarantees the stable functioning of electronic boards of heating boilers. </p><h2>  Types of batteries </h2><p>  One of two types of batteries can be connected to the UPS: sealed maintenance-free and lead-acid.  The first externally are small plastic boxes with two leads.  They are installed in backup power systems for computers.  The advantage of such batteries is that during operation no by-product gaseous products are released into the air - they are sealed and can be installed even in the bedroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="    " class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/684304.jpg" title="" width="280"></div>  The disadvantage is the high cost, short service life (official data were taken from ideal systems) and, most importantly, low capacity, which requires the collection of entire blocks of such batteries, unless, of course, the owner does not want to be limited to just a few tens of minutes of the boiler.

    <p>  From the point of view of expediency, car batteries are more preferable.  The appearance of maintenance-free models allows you not to deal with the preparation of acid solutions and controlling the residual capacity of the electrolyte liquid.  In terms of cost per capacity, such batteries are just perfect.  Their disadvantage is that in the process of charging a small amount of hydrogen is released into the air, so it is recommended that they be placed outside of residential premises. </p><h2>  Restoring charge </h2><p>  The battery connected to the UPS is gradually discharged.  Even if not used.  To restore the charge lost during operation, you need a special charger. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4237/683807.jpg" title="" width="589"></div>  It can be a separate device, and also be part of a backup source.  Obviously, the second is more preferable.  It is important that the charge current is sufficient to replenish the battery capacity.

    <h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  All such sources are divided into two classes: ordinary and double conversion.  When the power disappears in the network, devices of the first type switch to battery power, take 12 (24) V of direct voltage from them, which rises to 220 V and becomes variable (we mentioned a sinusoid earlier).  Much more expensive solutions of the second type.  In them, the converter works not only when working on batteries, but also in normal mode.  The alternating current of the network is rectified and supplied to the sine wave generator.  That is, all the time the UPS operates on the principle of "alternating current - direct - alternating current".  This allows you to guarantee an ideal sine wave at the output, regardless of the variation in the parameters of the external network.  Name - double conversion uninterruptible power supply unit, or inverter UPS (online). </p><h2>  Ratings and lineup </h2><p>  According to official data, UPSs with the usual conversion, but with an ideal sine wave of alternating current, are most in demand.  The most famous sources of the Ukrainian company, sold under the brand name "Leoton".  The internal electrical circuit in them is simply perfect - everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  However, the assembly itself is often so bad that the question arises: "How does it generally work?"  Perhaps in the new models this sad fact will be eliminated. </p><p>  Among foreign analogues, new solutions from APC are distinguished, which are characterized by a sinusoidal signal.  This is, for example, the Smart-UPS SUA1000I model with a capacity of 1000 Volt * Ampere (about 700 Watt).  When connected to a computer, control via USB or serial interface is possible.  Its weight is about 20 kg.  The pre-installed battery lasts 3 hours.  Duration of operation is impossible to indicate, since it depends on the consumed electric power. </p><p>  Double conversion solutions, as we indicated, are quite expensive, so it is advisable to use them either for large disruptions in the operation of the power grid, or in the presence of "extra" funds.  In the ranking of these devices, APC Smart-UPS On-Line SURT1000RMXLI leads.  Its weight is almost 30 kg.  It produces 700 watts of power.  In this mode, it can work for 10 minutes.  The charge lasts 3 hours.  When operating from the mains, it can adjust the voltage in the range from 100 to 280 volts. </p><p>  Here is a list of requirements that a good UPS for a boiler must meet: </p><p>  - The output is a pure sine wave. </p><p>  - The output electric power corresponds to the consumption of the boiler.  Usually the excess should be at least 30%.  That is, if the water heater of the heating system consumes 100 W, as indicated in the instructions, then the uninterruptible power supply for the boiler should be able to produce at least 150 W, or better, more. </p><p>  - The design provides for automatic switching of operating modes depending on the state of the main network. </p><p>  - The batteries for the UPS for boilers must be recharged with the charger of the backup source to the desired value without human intervention.  Moreover, regardless of their type. </p><p>  - Good <span>UPSs for heating boilers</span> must include a system of protection against frequent switching.  When restoring the supply of electricity along the main line, the "transition" to it should be delayed. </p><p>  - The current value of the built-in charger must be sufficient to restore the electrical capacity of the connected battery. </p><p>  - The build quality should not be artisanal than some models of one well-known company sin. </p><p>  Thus, if you take into account all the above nuances when buying, then solving the question of how to choose a UPS for the boiler will not present any difficulties.  Within the framework of this article, it is not possible to cover all the nuances, therefore, additional information must be sought on the connection rules and subsequent operation. </p>
