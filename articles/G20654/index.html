Many of our contemporaries devote a lot of time to self-improvement and strive to maximize their own potential.  Many experts in this field recommend starting a change in their own lives with the acquisition of a daily planner and instilling in themselves the habit of really filling it every day.  An original replacement for a boring business option is a creative notebook.  Let's try to figure out what it is and how to make a similar book for recordings with your own hands. </p><h2>  Art book, notepad for creative people, anti-notepad - what is it? </h2>

Such publications quickly gained incredible popularity among people of various ages and professions.  Conventionally, all such notebooks can be divided into several types. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The first variety is diaries for recording, each of the pages of which has a unique colored background.  Of course, writing in such a bright book is much more pleasant than writing on a white sheet of paper. </p><p>  The second type of creative notebooks is diaries, on each page of which some kind of wise quotation or useful advice is printed.  In this case, the book may contain information from the most diverse spheres of life or be devoted to some narrow topic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The third category is a creative <span>motivator notebook.</span>  <span>This is a</span> book for daily assignment notes.  Thematic diaries of this category are most popular - for artists (respectively, it is suggested to leave a picture on each page) or for writers, with a list of topics for mini-stories and interesting ideas.  Another category of notebooks for creative people combines all the previous ones. </p><p>  Universal diaries for unlocking creative potential offer you to immediately perform unusual tasks in real life (and write short reports on the pages of the book), do simple psychological exercises, draw and write about yourself.  If you wish, you can even find such a notebook for collective filling. </p><h2>  Buy or do it yourself? </h2>

The cost of such a book for notes is usually from 300 to 1000 rubles.  "Why so expensive?"  - you ask.  A creative notebook usually has a high-quality binding and cover, is not inferior to a real book in the quality of paper and printing, and also do not forget about its ideological content.  The only minus of such an acquisition is that, even buying a diary for yourself, you can not be sure that you will like it until you start filling it out.  So why not save money and try to make a creative notebook with do-it-yourself tasks?

Of course, you can simply buy a high-quality notebook or book for notes and then simply fill out the pages.  But this option is not interesting enough, it‚Äôs much more pleasant to make your own unique notebook from and to.  Prepare the required number of sheets.  Cut them to the selected size, if desired, color, decorate with stamps, small drawings, figure the edge.  The most difficult part of the job is making a binding.  The pages of a notebook can be stitched together, glued or fastened using accessories - rings, a spring.  As soon as the block for recordings is ready, you can begin to design the cover.

    <h2>  Individual design </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter for whom you make a creative notebook - for yourself or as a gift.  Such a diary should be beautifully designed and cause only pleasant emotions.  Take the time to devote enough time and attention to working on the cover.  It can be covered with fabric, decorated with a beautiful postcard or painting, or glued your favorite photo.  Be sure to glue the flyleafs from the inside, thanks to them your work will look much more neat.  Glue the cover to the recording unit and put the book under the press.  Once your notebook is dry, you can begin the most interesting part of the work. </p><h2>  Filling in a creative diary </h2>

Believe me, signing any diary is a special ritual.  Even in the business version, filling out general information about yourself and leaving your phone number in case you lose your notebook, you thereby claim ownership of this item.  In a creative book for recording, you can place your own photo on one of the first pages, only the most positive and beloved one.  Now you can fill in all the other pages.  If you are afraid that you accidentally start to group similar tasks, write them especially randomly.  Suppose you have just finished the design of the 5th page, flip to the 10th and feel free to start writing any assignment or idea.  In addition to the tasks, you can write simple parting words for yourself, your favorite quotes or positive short motivators.

But do not be shy of your own thoughts.  Write everything that comes to mind.  Even if a specific task does not teach you anything and turns out to be useless, it will brighten up the day and please you with something pleasant.  For example, in almost any ready-made creative diary you can find the following tips and tricks: write a letter to a friend with whom you have not been communicating for a long time;  try something new;  write down what was remembered today;  draw a picture;  Describe what bothered you most today.

    <p>  For people living in an active rhythm, a creative notebook for two will be much more interesting.  Such a diary is filled immediately by two close people or a whole company of friends.  Accordingly, the tasks in it are designed for collective creativity.  These may be questions about spending time together, suggestions to describe each other, or even draw a caricature.  Do not be afraid to include the most unexpected tasks in your notebook, and you will surely get the maximum pleasure from ‚Äútalking‚Äù with the finished book. </p>
