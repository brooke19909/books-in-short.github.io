Over the years, she managed to become the darling of millions, and without the help of intrusive advertising.  Her secret lies in elegant simplicity, thanks to which everyone who knows how to hold a needle is able to create their own doll of this kind.  However, when it comes to tailoring dresses for tildes, minor difficulties may arise.  Due to the peculiarities of the figure of the doll, patterns of outfits for her, and the creation process itself, it differs from the traditional ones.  Let's find out about the features of making clothes for such a toy.  And also consider how to knit and how to sew a dress for the tilda, which will be at her time. </p><h2>  Graceful favorite of needlewomen </h2><p>  Fabric toys were sewn in all cultures.  Moreover, each nation had its own methods and traditions of making textile dolls.  However, with the development of industry and the development of plastic, products from it pretty soon replaced homemade toys.  That was until 1999, when the Norwegian designer Tone Finnager decided to return to the roots and created a tilde doll. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yvonnewdesigns.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for tilda" class="if uuid-3107215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107215.jpg"></div><p>  According to Tone, coming up with the design of a new toy, she dreamed of creating something homely and cozy, at the same time simple and cheap to manufacture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first tilde was sewn from scraps of various natural fabrics.  Despite the unpretentious appearance quickly won the hearts of not only children but also adults.  And although the designer has registered her own brand with the name "Tilda", most fans of such toys prefer not to buy, namely to sew them with their own hands.  Especially for them, magazines with patterns are published, and also ready-made sets are sold, in which there is everything to create your own interior toy. </p><p>  In addition, many other variations of textile beauties appeared on the basis of the Finnager doll.  By tradition, they continue to be called the "tilde", although they have only a distant resemblance to the Norwegian original.  This aspect is important to consider when planning to sew or knit a tilda dress.  The fact is that classic dolls have small oval heads, while modern dolls have large and spherical ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda dress" class="if uuid-3107759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107759.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, an outfit sewn according to the classical pattern of a dress for a tilde doll simply cannot be removed from the modern tilde or worn on it. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  The popularity of this type of interior toys has led to the fact that not only human dolls, but also animals were sewn in the tilde style.  And the most diverse, from the beloved cats, dogs and bunnies to snails, chickens and horses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today it is generally accepted that tilde is not only dolls, but also decorative interior items in this style.  Despite this, dolls (people and erect animals) still enjoy special love. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  What is the difference between Finnager toys and other textile dolls?  Although today there are many variations of such products made of fabric, the tilde can not be confused with them because of the specific features: </p><ul><li>  This doll has no mouth.  Only bead eyes and cheeks.  Sometimes a nose (for example, at a tilda hare). <div class="photo" data-original="www.beautifulskills.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet tilda bunny dress" class="if uuid-3107375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107375.jpg"></div></li><li>  The body is completely sewn from fabric (or knitted from threads). </li><li>  As a rule, the figure of a toy resembles a triangle with a small outstretched head (traditional model), a long neck and a wide basin.  More modern tildes have round large heads, otherwise retaining traditional parameters. </li><li>  Often these toys have mobile legs and arms.  However, this is not necessary. </li><li>  Such a doll should create a hand made feel.  Therefore, traditional tildes are made from "rural" fabrics: in small polka dots, a flower, geometric patterns.  The colors should be pastel, even faded.  All knitted details (sweaters, snoods, hats, berets, leggings) must necessarily create the feeling of handmade with a slight touch of decorative negligence.  But not sloppy! </li><li>  To decorate the outfits, ribbons, lace lace (best natural), wooden beads or buttons are widely used. </li><li>  Due to the pronounced loin, the traditional tilda dress has a full skirt.  Most often this is achieved due to multilayer petticoats or decoration with ruffles.  Modern dolls (especially ballerinas) wear skirts because of several layers of tulle. </li><li>  Toy hair was originally made from thread or loose satin ribbons.  Today, more often for this purpose, take doll wigs or individual strands (tresses). </li><li>  Traditionally, tildes hold something in their hands.  These are bouquets, boxes, books, soft toys, vintage cages, etc. </li></ul><h2>  "It's all in the hands ..." </h2><p>  When sewing a dress for a tilde doll, the main difficulty lies in the upper limbs of the toy.  The fact is that the traditional outfit is worn even before the hands are sewn to the toy.  If the dress for the tilda has sleeves, they are first put on her hands and only then sewn to the body with them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="billowfabrics.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for tilda white" class="if uuid-3107742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107742.jpg"></div><p>  When the doll‚Äôs outfit is supplemented with a jacket or jacket, a dress for her can be sewn without this detail. </p><p>  All of the above applies to cases where the toilet is not supposed to be removed at all.  If there are more than one outfit in the doll‚Äôs wardrobe, they should be supplemented with a fastener or have a style that does not include sleeves. </p><p>  That is why, deciding to sew or knit a dress for a tilda, you should first decide whether it will be removed or not, and whether the outfit will have sleeves.  Thus, we can distinguish the following types of models: </p><ul><li>  Fixed outfit without sleeves, the absence of which is masked by a jacket or jacket. </li><li>  Fixed outfit with sleeves that are sewn along with the hands. </li><li>  Detachable sleeveless outfit. </li><li>  Detachable tilda dress with sleeves. </li></ul><p>  On the basis of these four basic varieties, all outfits for interior dolls of this kind are also sewn.  Moreover, it does not play a role, whether it be a girl, a bunny, a bear or a dog. </p><h2>  How to sew the simplest dress </h2><p>  The most elementary in the manufacture of a fixed outfit for a tilde, partially sewn into her body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blog.handmadehome.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda style dresses" class="if uuid-3107232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107232.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, when the doll is cut, a part below the neckline is made of fabric for the dress.  And the line of transition from ‚Äúskin‚Äù to ‚Äúalongside‚Äù is masked with lace, as in this example. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.blog.handmadehome.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern for tilda" class="if uuid-3107236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107236.jpg"></div><p>  The next stage is the creation of the lower part of the toilet, namely the skirt.  To do this, a rectangle is cut from the selected fabric. </p><p>  Its length is determined according to the taste of the craftswoman - from the waist of the doll, but not longer than the shoes.  If the dress will cover the legs of the toy, it will not look very beautiful.  The optimal length options are: </p><ul><li>  up to the knees; </li><li>  just below the knees; </li><li>  middle of the game; </li><li>  to the ankles. </li></ul><p>  To the selected length, 1-2 cm is added to the hem for the elastic at the waist.  It is also worth taking into account lace along the edge of the dress, depending on its width, it will slightly add length along. </p><p>  It is worth taking into account the presence of a petticoat.  It is sewn to the skirt before it is assembled.  It can be either the same length or peek out from under the dress. </p><p>  The width of the skirt and the petticoat depends on the expected splendor.  The wider the rectangle, the more folds.  Naturally within reason. </p><p>  So, after the future skirt is cut out and its edges are finished (for fabrics with loose edges), lace is sewn to the bottom and the rectangle is sewn.  The same is done with the petticoat. </p><p>  Both parts are turned out and put on one another (in the turned inside out condition the outside is the petticoat, inside the skirt itself).  Further, fabric is tucked up and wrapped up from above - a place for elastic is formed.  It is inserted at the next stage and the place of its entry is carefully sewn by hand with a hidden seam. </p><p>  The resulting skirt is put on a doll.  If desired, it can be carefully sewn. </p><p>  To give along a more harmonious look, you can sew a flower made of the same material as the skirt to the top.  And voila - the dress is ready. </p><h2>  Sleeveless outfit </h2><p>  A dress pattern for a trilde doll is not required in the manufacture of such a variety as this one.  But for such an outfit there must be a jacket or jacket.  They create the illusion that the dress has sleeves, they are simply hidden under a cloak. </p><p>  This model of a fixed dress has two subspecies. </p><p>  In the first of them, the outfit for the toy does not have a separate bodice.  As in the previous case, the rectangle is hidden.  However, its length should not reach the waist, but the armpits or even the neck of the tilde. </p><p>  Such a model with a rubber assembly will look rude.  Therefore, it is better to make a small number of deep folds yourself.  The easiest way to put a dress on the doll for this purpose is to fix the fabric with pins where it seems appropriate, and sew on the markings. </p><p>  In the second case, the length of the skirt remains the same, but the bodice must be sewn to it.  To do this, a smaller rectangle is cut, which is collected in folds near the neck (or shoulder line) and the waist of the toy.  In these places, lace decoration is appropriate. </p><p>  After the bodice is worn and sewn, a skirt is neatly swept to it, by analogy with the very first model. </p><p>  The toilet is ready.  The next step is to make a jacket (jacket).  Like a dress for a tilda-hare, a bear, etc., it is cut without sleeves.  As a rule, this part is a cone with a trimmed top, 2-4 cm larger than the details of the doll's body. </p><p>  But the sleeves are cut separately and sewn to the hands (the seams are hidden in the armpits and the inside), and then are attached to the body with them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": Tilda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for tilda doll" class="if uuid-3109155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3109155.jpg"></div><p>  Above is an example of a branded tilde cardigan pattern.  Please note that there are slots for the sleeves.  However, you can use this scheme without cutting out the armholes, since not everyone will be able to do everything carefully the first time.  In addition, many original textile dolls of this kind provide for the presence of wings, straps from which the seams are hidden for the sleeves. </p><p>  Quite often, along with such a doll, snood is put on the neck.  It can be not only knitted, but also sewn from a long rectangle of fabric. </p><h2>  Fixed outfit with sleeves </h2><p>  As in the previous case, such a tilda dress does not need a pattern. </p><p>  The technique of tailoring the model is almost the same as the previous two.  Except that instead of a jacket, hands with sleeves are sewn to the dress. </p><p>  Cutting them out is not difficult - these are rectangles that are sewn into tubes and worn on hand parts.  The edges can be decorated with lace or tucked up and sealed with an iron and a spider line.  In this case, it will be difficult to make it due to the tiny size of the part. </p><h2>  Sleeveless dress </h2><p>  Not all tilda outfits must have sleeves.  Therefore, you can easily sew a removable sundress for such a doll. </p><p>  This model is a variation of a dress based on a rectangle.  In this case, it must be on an elastic band.  The length of it reach the armpits of the doll. </p><p>  As straps, it is better to sew openwork elastic bands or strips of the same fabric, previously stitched with a rubber band. </p><p>  All this is necessary so that the outfit fits snugly against the figure of the doll, but at the same time can be removed from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varrogato.blogspot.com" data-author=": Tilda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for bunny tilda" class="if uuid-3109152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3109152.jpg"></div><p>  Another popular model is with bare shoulders.  Below is a branded dress pattern for hares-tilde.  This is a very simple and elegant option.  It is debatable whether strips of fabric on the shoulders can be considered full sleeves that they look like. </p><p>  Dress sewing order: </p><ul><li>  cut and process the edges of parts; </li><li>  sew on strips of sleeves to the front and back of the dress; </li><li>  sew a frill at the bottom; </li><li>  sew on the sides; </li><li>  insert gum on top and armpits; </li><li>  decorate the outfit with a rose or other accessories. </li></ul><p>  The advantages of such a toilet are the ability to remove and put it on a doll, ease of sewing and the illusion of having sleeves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="varrogato.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="for bunny tilda" class="if uuid-3107588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107588.jpg"></div><p>  Please note: any cardigan, jacket or bolero worn over this dress will not look the best.  Therefore, if you want to dress your pet more warmly, you should give preference to another model. </p><h2>  Detachable dress with sleeves </h2><p>  This outfit is the hardest to sew.  However, if you have mastered all the previous ones, deal with this! </p><p>  Since this doll was conceived as simple to manufacture at home, as a rule, all such dresses for her are based on a common detail with sleeves - a sort of analogue of the Soviet nightie.  By the way, the color is the same. </p><p>  Below is the most simple dress pattern for a tilde with a smell.  On its basis, you can easily sew different toilets, including cardigans.  Pay special attention that the dress consists of three parts: two identical front ones for smell and back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amarnaartesanatoeimagens.blogspot.com" data-author=": Tilda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for tilda" class="if uuid-3109164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3109164.jpg"></div><p>  The fastener is two ribbons sewn to the ends of the front parts.  You can replace them with a fastener on small buttons or a Euro-Velcro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amarnaartesanatoeimagens.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern for tilda" class="if uuid-3107472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107472.jpg"></div><p>  The advantage of the model with such a cut of sleeves is the absence of the need to sew them separately.  Moreover, the dress will have to be removed / worn more than once. </p><p>  When sewing outfits based on this pattern, the seams must be done very carefully so that wrinkles do not form under the armpits.  And if they do appear, you need to cover them with wings (life hack from the creators of the tilda). </p><p>  If you wish, complicate the model: make the skirt a separate part and add folds to it for splendor.  In addition, the clasp can be moved back and reduce the smell. </p><h2>  Dress for tilde knitting and crochet </h2><p>  In conclusion, let's talk about knitting.  Like the doll itself, outfits for it can be created in this way.  However, the toy itself is often crocheted.  But the toilets for it can be made using both tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit dress for tilda" class="if uuid-3107389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107389.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, any of the aforementioned methods and any dress pattern for a tilde doll are applicable. </p><p>  Before starting work, a probe is knitted to determine the required number of loops or pattern reports for the manufacture of a square centimeter of the fabric of the dress.  Based on these data, the calculation of the length and width of knitting is carried out when it is necessary to add or reduce loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crazypatterns.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for bunny tilda" class="if uuid-3107404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107404.jpg"></div><p>  For finished bonded parts, wet-heat treatment is carried out, and after drying, they are sewn together like textile ones. </p><p>  Having decided to <span>crochet</span> or knit a dress for a <span>tilde</span> , it is better to take thin wool, as well as small tools.  Otherwise, the outfits will seem rude. </p><p>  Also take into account the fact that the knitted outfits are well draped, but an excessive amount of folds will look heavy.  Do not overdo it! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for tilde knitting" class="if uuid-3107423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40429/3107423.jpg"></div><p>  Remember that, unlike a fabric sewn, knitted or crocheted dress for a tilde bunny, girls, bears or dogs can always be dissolved and remade if you find a flaw.  So do not be lazy - and then your tilda doll will look like a real home fairy.  Success in creative work! </p>
