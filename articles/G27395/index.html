    <p>  For example, the Turkish president, as a rule, appoints the secretary of the winning political party as the head of the executive branch, i.e.  Prime Minister, and on his recommendation, a cabinet is being formed. </p><p>  <strong>First President of Turkey</strong> </p><p>  The first president of the Republic of Turkey was <span>Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk.</span>  He is the founder of the modern state of Turkey.  During the First World War, he led the revolutionary movement, founded the Republican People's Party of Turkey, contributed to the liquidation of the government of the Sultan and the proclamation of the republic. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="First President of Turkey" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/225704.jpg" width="369"></div>  This happened in 1923.  An ardent nationalist, he was intolerant of national minorities: Armenians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Yezidis, Assyrians, etc. It was under his leadership that the greatest atrocity of the 20th century was committed - the genocide of Armenians in 1915, as well as reprisal against other peoples living in the <span>Ottoman Empire.</span>  He called these anti-human acts ethnic cleansing.  As for the Turkish people, Kemal Pasha, as the president of Turkey and as a true patriot, contributed in every way to his development: he introduced secular education in the country, carried out clothing reform, separated the state from religion, and adopted a new civil and criminal code corresponding to the European model. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="President of Turkey 2013" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/225724.jpg" width="407"></div>  In addition, he granted suffrage to women, contributed to the Latinization of the alphabet, the creation of banks and industry, and much more.  Prominent politician, reformer and military leader Kemal Pasha is one of the most famous historical figures in the world.
