    <h2>  What for </h2><p>  The first step is to figure out why you need to control the income and expenses of the family.  Maybe this business is not worth hammering your head in?  Especially if with finances, in principle, everything is more than good. </p><p>  In fact, controlling money is a must in the life of any modern person.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a deficit or not.  As they say, money loves an account.  So <span>financial control</span> is a great way to be confident in the future.  And as soon as the question relates directly to the family, then certain needs arise.  And they need to be covered as needed.  Only an accurate calculation of the funds will help not to get into the financial hole, as well as correctly distribute the available money.  Incomes and expenses of the family, which are under strict control, as a rule, even with a small amount of funds can give huge profits and efficiency.  But you need to be able to carry out calculations and calculations.  What will help in this?  What secrets are there? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Posts </h2><p>  In general, everyone recommends collecting checks and then saving them until the end of the month.  This is a normal phenomenon that can really help with the distribution of the family budget.  But only here not at all and it is not always possible to collect receipts for payment.  The thing is that a person who has not previously been involved in this business is unlikely to begin to get accustomed to ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù checks so quickly.  It's not so easy, to be honest. </p><p>  Therefore, there is one trick that will definitely help you maintain a <span>family budget</span> (income and expenses of the family).  Table!  That is, a corresponding record that reflects all your expenses during the month.  It can be both electronic and paper.  You don‚Äôt have to save your checks at the same time, just know how much and what you spent or received in a given month.  This kind of summary perfectly helps to look at your income and expenses every month.  In addition, such a discipline will certainly help to find a way to save. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family income and expenses table" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249090.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Primitive </h2><p>  Well, let‚Äôs use this option.  The thing is that the income and expenses of the family - the table is very ambiguous.  It may include a variety of items that are useful for certain situations.  True, you can use the most primitive model.  It is perfect for those who do not like specifics and paperwork. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What is required?  In order to keep track of income and expenses, you must create an appropriate table for the month.  The minimum should be 4 columns.  It: </p><ul><li>  income; </li><li>  costs; </li><li>  total profit; </li><li>  total consumption. </li></ul><p>  As a matter of fact, every day it will be necessary to enter the necessary changes into the appropriate fields.  During the month, only "income" and "expenses" are actively used.  But in the end you will have to calculate both columns and their difference.  This is the easiest option that you can meet.  Income and expenses of a family - a table that is not unambiguous.  But it is advisable to expand it.  How exactly? </p><h2>  Specifics </h2><p>  The thing is that everything depends on your self-discipline and organization.  But remember: the more you put effort into the preparation and maintenance of such a thing as the family budget ("Family Income and Expenses" - the table), the more efficiency will be from your activities at the end of the month.  We have considered the most primitive option.  But this, as a rule, does not end the calculation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family budget income and expenses family table" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249095.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most often, it is more profitable to keep a complete and thorough budget account.  That is, make a table that will contain at least the following columns: </p><ul><li>  income; </li><li>  consumption; </li><li>  a comment; </li><li>  total income; </li><li>  total expenses. </li></ul><p>  At the same time, add to the indicated items also small items that will help establish the specifics.  It is advisable to write them separately, but include the costs without fail.  We are talking about such things as basic spending, those without which you can not live in principle.  It would also be nice to keep a separate column of savings.  All this is very convenient to do on a computer.  Yes, managing a complete table is not easy.  Especially when it comes to comments.  They will have to paint what and why you bought.  But this will ultimately give you maximum effect.  You can easily look at all the income and expenses of the family, and then see from the side what exactly you spent on.  And, accordingly, eliminate unnecessary expenses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Accumulation </h2><p>  What else is worth a look?  To be honest, the line of savings will be an important point.  Moreover, it is desirable to exhibit it in several ways.  The first is the current state of your budget (or rather, the "extra" money).  Let this column show how much money has been deferred at the moment.  You can even keep this record with comments.  For example, if you put it off for something specific. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family budget income expenses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249094.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The second view is the amount of money that will be set aside per month.  It is with this approach that the family budget is formed.  Revenues, expenses, expenses and receipts of funds - this is important.  But if you are faced with the task of savings, as well as savings, then try to include the relevant items in your table.  Let, depending on the savings, you immediately, at the beginning of the month, save 10% of the profit (wages, for example), and then distribute the remaining funds for a month.  Therefore, the second item in the ‚Äúdeferred money‚Äù section is a fixed amount, reflecting, as a rule, 1/10 of the total profit.  A good way to save up money. </p><h2>  Income </h2><p>  Well, it‚Äôs very convenient now to use such a thing as a computer.  It will help to quickly and easily control the income and expenses of the family.  The table in Excel is what we need.  In general, the above paragraphs and columns are sufficient.  But if you want a detailed specificity, then special attention should be paid to the point of income. </p><p>  What can be included here?  For starters, <span>this</span> is <span>an advance.</span>  He is issued at work very often.  Then be sure to write down <span>salaries</span> and bonuses.  They will help to generate more accurate data.  And, of course, at any time you will be able to exclude one or another source of funds. </p><p>  In addition, pay attention to the proceeds from gifts (let there be a separate column for this feature), interest on deposits, other sources of profit (such as scholarships, income from property, and so on).  All this is signed in extremely detail so as not to miss anything important.  In principle, usually such a table is already more than enough. </p><h2>  Costs </h2><p>  Now pay attention to the costs.  They also play a very important role.  Comments are good.  But it‚Äôs only better to thoroughly record where exactly and what you are spending money on.  The Family Budget: Income and Expense table, which describes your expenses in detail, is a storehouse of savings and control. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="table family budget income and expenses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249096.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  What is better to include here?  In the separate paragraph, select the section "General".  Let it be utility bills.  Sub points will also have to be done.  What are you talking about?  Separate columns should be allocated for each account.  In other words, write down in the table separately the amount of funds for common utility (house) needs, cold and hot water, heating, electricity, major repairs. </p><p>  Among other things, family income and expenses usually involve allocating the budget for food, clothing, gifts, and transportation.  Let at least these moments be reflected in your table.  Have you bought something?  Listed with a comment in the appropriate field.  Did you go by transport?  Recorded.  Yes, at first it will be difficult, but then you will learn how to quickly make calculations, and also remember to make notes on expenses. </p><h2>  The remainder </h2><p>  Another very interesting trick is the inclusion in the table of the so-called balance at the end of the month.  It is advisable to put it off for your needs.  Let it be a nice bonus to 10% of your salary. </p><p>  The balance at the end of the month is the difference between revenues and expenses.  It is necessary to calculate the income and expenses of the family, and then subtract from the first paragraph of the second.  And you will get how much money you have left.  This technique helps very well when you need to learn how to accumulate funds.  Perfectly visible difference at the end of each month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="family income and expenses table in excel" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249093.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Calculations </h2><p>  How to calculate the income and expenses of a family?  To be honest, the <span>formulas</span> built <span>into Excel are a</span> great help here <span>.</span>  They will quickly and accurately bring you the results, moreover, automatically.  And then you will have to analyze the budget yourself. </p><p>  To calculate the amount of expenses and income at the end of the month, in the corresponding final column you will have to insert the formula "Amounts".  Then simply select all the fields that relate to the receipts of funds, as well as their spending, respectively, and press Enter.  The result is displayed.  Nothing difficult.  It is very convenient, especially when you consider that Excel will play the role of both a notebook and a calculator. </p><p>  Interest from savings is calculated a little differently.  It is necessary to write = in the formula bar, then indicate the total income (the amount from which we will take 10%), then print "* 0.1".  This algorithm will help you quickly calculate how much you need to defer from your salary at the beginning of the month.  In principle, no more formulas are needed.  It is enough only to constantly add, subtract and compare. </p><h2>  Secrets </h2><p>  Now a little about the secrets of saving money.  Of course, given the maintenance of our today's table.  Without it, it‚Äôs difficult to navigate the spending. </p><p>  The main income and expenses of the family are mandatory items.  These usually include salaries, spending on utility bills and transportation.  Fill in these columns first.  It is usually impossible to exclude something from them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculate family income and expenses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1249091.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Pay special attention to your purchases.  In particular, when you make large gifts or just buy products.  Often you can take a lot of excess.  All items in the check should be mentioned in the corresponding comments.  At the end of the month, you can summarize and see what you could do without.  A good welcome, but it requires careful analysis. </p><p>  Be sure to save what is left at the end of the month from the cash.  You can record this money in a separate paragraph.  A very good way to save money and an additional source of profit "on a rainy day."  Over time, you will learn how to quickly increase this indicator using analysis.  This means that the income and expenses of the family (the table will help to control them) will be in safe hands. </p><p>  Do you want to draw tables yourself and make reports in Excel?  Then download and install ready-made templates for yourself.  They, as a rule, help to summarize both monthly and annual totals.  This option is in great demand among users. </p>
