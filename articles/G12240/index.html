What is the best place to turn to open it?  This will help the rating of banks for entrepreneurs.  Each institution offers its own terms of cooperation. </p><h2>  Why do I need an account for IE? </h2><p>  With an open current account, there is a right to several operations: </p><ul><li>  execution of civil documents; </li><li>  large-scale operations; </li><li>  the ability to send funds to legal entities; </li><li>  conclusion of contracts with employees and their payment. </li></ul>

    <p>  An account is required if the entrepreneur takes at least 100 thousand rubles.  In its absence, you need to conclude a contract for each delivery.  As a result, it will be more expensive and longer in time.  Moreover, with the help of the bank, the conclusion of documents is more convenient.  The organization provides a personal manager who at any time will answer questions about the use of the account. </p><h2>  Account opening </h2><p>  The procedure does not require much time.  You just need to contact the bank.  During this process, you must follow all the rules, as it is legally significant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Whether or not to open an account, all entrepreneurs decide on their own.  The law of the Russian Federation allows an individual to establish an IP without it.  But then many procedures will be inaccessible, as large children and other children function only by bank transfer. </p><h2>  Bank selection </h2><p>  The rating of banks for IP services will allow you to choose a profitable program.  Experts advise to focus on: </p><ul><li>  convenience; </li><li>  profitability; </li><li>  high customer focus. </li></ul><p>  Convenience involves the use of modern technology in work.  This means that the credit institution makes payments through verified channels.  Often, to speed up the process, large settlement agreements are concluded between large companies.  Customers are invited to use online programs to manage their accounts.  You do not need to visit the bank office. </p>
