But this does not mean that you must change the mobile device, it is enough to upgrade it to the latest version.  In the article, we will consider how to update iPhone-6 and what problems the user may encounter. </p><h2>  Need update </h2><p>  Owners of modern phone models know that for the improved operation of any gadget from time to time it is necessary to do an update.  At the last World Conference, Apple introduced the latest software development for its mobile phones - iOS 12. Despite the fact that more attention was paid to the flexibility of the operating system and speed, it is able to combine a lot of new functions and applications, moreover, it is available for previous iPhone versions starting with 5S models. </p><p>  After several months of testing public versions, the release of iOS 12 has been completed and is ready for download.  The latest iPhone models will be available for sale already with this operating system, but owners of older versions, including 6 models, are wondering whether to update iPhone 6 and how this will affect the device’s performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appletoolbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="update iPhone 6 via computer" class="if uuid-3127161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127161.jpg"></div><h2>  Check compatibility.  The easiest way to update </h2><p>  First you need to make sure that your device supports the latest generation operating system, and then decide whether to upgrade iPhone-6.  Like the version released before iOS 12, they are only compatible with 64-bit mobile phones.  Which means that 32-bit, for example, iPhone-5, by technical specifications, will not launch this update.  For 5S models, the iOS 12 platform is available, but it does not work in the best way.  But starting with the iPhone 6 generation, installing the latest version is quite possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="appsgames.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to update iphone 6" class="if uuid-3127099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127099.jpg"></div><p>  There are many ways to download and install software.  The simplest of them allows you to save your data and does not require much effort.  To do this, find and open the “Settings” tab in the device’s applications, then click on “General” and select “Software Update”.  If the phone is available to download the new version, it will appear as iOS 12. Just start the process using the on-screen prompts and the program will download and install on your mobile device.  At this time, the user just needs to wait and not turn off the device, do not interrupt the installation.  The user also has the option of delayed updates.  A person can choose at what time the system will automatically install the firmware. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="updated version of iphone 6" class="if uuid-3127145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127145.jpg"></div><h2>  Computer Update </h2><p>  You can update iPhone 6 through a program installed on your computer.  To do this, follow the steps: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The device is connected to the PC with a Lighting or USB-C cable. </li><li>  The offer “Unlock iPhone for using accessories” appears on the screen. </li><li>  The action is performed with a touch identifier or an access code is entered. </li><li>  If the device is connecting to this computer for the first time, you must allow access to your data and follow the instructions on the phone and computer to complete the update. </li><li>  Sync with iTunes and change the firmware. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.any-data-recovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="whether to update iPhone 6" class="if uuid-3127106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127106.jpg"></div><h2>  Download IPSW File </h2><p>  If the easiest way to upgrade your phone to iOS 12 is to run the software through the settings, there is another effective method - upload the IPSW file.  You can install the file to your phone through iTunes, it is classified as Golden Master.  To answer the question of whether it is possible to update iPhone 6 in this way, it’s worth understanding what Golden Master is. </p><p>  Golden Master (GM) is a beta developed for iOS devices.  It enables users to report problems that disrupt the latest version of the operating system.  Allows developers to identify and fix bugs, correct it before the final release. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Initially, it turned out that the Golden Master assembly is no different from the final version, which comes out later.  Therefore, installing the update on "iPhone-6" in this way does not affect the quality of the device. </p><p>  You must download the IPSW file, depending on your phone model.  It is worth recalling that it is most secure to download files directly from Apple servers.  Only in this way can the safety and preservation of the operability of the device be guaranteed.  After downloading the file to the computer, the mobile device is connected to iTunes and using the downloaded IPSW update the firmware to version iOS 12. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.findclip.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it worth updating iphone 6" class="if uuid-3127114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127114.jpg"></div><h2>  Backup through icloud </h2><p>  Before updating iPhone 6, experts advise making a backup.  Iklaud will help with this. </p><p>  When connected to iTunes, the iPhone icon pops up, you need to click it and make sure the Summary mode is open.  Copying data can be done using iCloud.  To save activity and health data, it is recommended to use the encrypted option. </p><p>  Before updating a mobile device, 6 models without fail create a backup copy through Iclaud.  This is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  The mobile device is connected to an available Wi-Fi network. </li><li>  The “Settings” tab opens, then select a name and click on the “Aiklaud” line.  If using iOS10 or an older version, the menus scroll down and select the appropriate icon. </li><li>  Activate iCloud or Backup. </li><li>  Then come back. </li></ol><p>  To make sure that the backup check is completed, open the Settings icon, select your name and go to “Aiklaud”, then select “Mobile Storage” in the list in “Storage Management”. </p><div class="photo" data-original="observer.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to update iPhone 6" class="if uuid-3127137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127137.jpg"></div><h2>  ITunes sync and update </h2><p>  How to update iOS on iPhone 6 through the program?  Let us consider in more detail the sequence of actions: </p><ol><li>  When connecting an iPhone to a computer, iTunes should start automatically, if this does not happen, it is activated manually. </li><li>  First of all, it is important to make sure that the latest version of software is loaded in iTunes.  To do this, check the "Update" tab on Mac computers or "Check for updates" in the iTunes menu for Windows. </li><li>  If there are no such features, you need to check for updates in the Microsoft Store application.  Then you need to log in or create your account with Apple. </li><li>  To continue the upgrade, hold <span>down the Option key on a Mac</span> or Shift on Windows. </li><li>  After that, the “Update” or “Check for update” function will appear on the iTunes screen. </li><li>  Select the downloaded IPSW image and click Open. </li><li>  After the update is completed, the program will automatically restart the iPhone. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lumpics.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="upgrade iPhone 6 to ios 12" class="if uuid-3127121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3127121.jpg"></div><h2>  Update using Recovery Mode and DFU </h2><p>  Using these methods is almost the same way as working with iTunes.  However, it requires a longer period of time, because first of all you need to enter the device into one of these modes.  How to update iPhone 6 in this case?  This is done as follows: </p><ol><li>  The phone is entered into Recovery Mode or DFU. </li><li>  Connect the device to a laptop or computer using a USB cable. </li><li>  Launch iTunes, which will automatically detect the iPhone in recovery mode. </li><li>  Open the firmware file. </li><li>  They are waiting for the process to complete.  Then the program itself will automatically do everything. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="8oaGvEC2E2Y" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oaGvEC2E2Y" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/2/7/5/15275.jpg"></div><h2>  Wi-Fi Update </h2><p>  The use of this method is primarily convenient because it does not require a connection to a computer.  To update iPhone-6, you must adhere to the following instructions: </p><ol><li>  Enter the “Settings” tab on the mobile device and click on the “Update” line. </li><li>  Select "Download" and "Install", if the program prompts you to accept the system conditions, you must agree and wait for the update process to complete. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that with a low signal level, the operation will either be delayed for a long time, or it will give a boot failure.  After this method of updating, all information in the phone will be saved and not a single file will be affected.  At the same time, for blocked phones, such an update is highly not recommended. </p><h2>  Problems and bug 53 </h2><p>  In most cases, flashing mobile devices is easy, and the updated version of iPhone 6 works flawlessly.  But sometimes users of iPhone-6 and 6S phone models encounter problems and errors in working after installing version iOS 12. Most often, complaints are related to fast battery loss, poor sound quality, problems in connecting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a sensor and level 1 and 3 applications.  If the problems persist after rebooting the device, experts advise returning the previous version of the operating system. </p><p>  Many are also wondering if iOS can be updated to iOS6, unfortunately, at the moment this is not possible.  Even in iPhone 6 models, the platform is supported from version 8.0. </p><p>  In some cases, when updating iPhone 6, an error 53 pops up, which leads to a breakdown of the device.  Error code - Error 53 occurs when restoring or updating a smartphone via iTunes, on which the Touch ID module is detected during the download process.  Failure is accompanied by a brief message and a denial of work.  Most often, iPhone-6 and iPhone-6S are affected. </p><p>  Apple officials claim that Error 53 occurs in devices with a sensor or other components related to the ability to recognize a fingerprint if they have been replaced.  That is, the module is not an element of the factory assembly and is not recognized by the official iPhone programs. </p><p>  If the sensor has been replaced and does not match other components, when checking the gadget, the operating system detects a mismatch and gives an error.  For example, improperly changing the screen will cause a crash.  When the smartphone starts, the built-in control sensor checks the authenticity and correct operation of the device, in case of mismatch of spare parts, the device is blocked. </p><p>  If you didn’t repair the device at an official service center or if spare parts were not purchased from the manufacturer and are wondering whether to upgrade iPhone-6 to iOS 12, then be aware that it is not recommended to upgrade the operating system.  In the official Apple store, there is hardware available to restore the connection between the sensor and the protective controller.  After the occurrence of error 53, it is difficult to restore the mobile device.  Parts must be replaced with original parts and flashing. </p>
