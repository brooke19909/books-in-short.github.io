    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  The very concept of “mass registration address” applies to legal addresses at which 10 or more legal entities are officially registered.  There is also a term and the opposite of this - "non-mass address" - one that was used for registration by less than ten companies.  Since modern business life is developing quite rapidly, there are also addresses with a large number of organizations "a dime a dozen" registered there.  For example, it can be a variety of office complexes and business centers. </p><p>  In fact, it might seem that this is not a big deal.  However, in practice, everything does not look so harmless at all.  Today, on the Internet, you can find a huge number of various offers regarding the sale of yuradres.  The options are offered a wide variety - from the actual rental of one square meter of a real existing office with the obligation to promptly transmit to you all the correspondence in your name, to the frank offer of fake documents.  This is where the problems begin.  The latter method is most often used by one-day firms, cooperation with which is extremely dangerous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mass registration address of individuals" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/883054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  Before the Unified State Register of Legal Entities was created in Russia, or rather, until July 2002, the registration of legal entities was carried out by a variety of bodies.  At the same time, in some regions of the country they required to provide information on the so-called “legal address” for registration, although such a requirement was not legally confirmed, and such a term was not enshrined at all by any normative acts.  To prove the actual location in certain regions, it was also required to provide documents confirming the organization’s right to be at a specific address: a lease agreement, a certificate of ownership, and so on.  Despite the fact that such requirements were not substantiated in any way, such a practice was firmly established and has been preserved to this day. </p><p>  Over time, it has become a vicious practice when, during state registration of a company, applicants who do not want to show the actual location of their company or simply do not need to maintain an office simply enter in the documents the address provided by the intermediary registrar. </p><p>  As a result of such actions, a large list of enterprises having the same registration address appeared in the field of view of the tax inspectorate.  Thus, the concept of “mass registration address” entered our life.  As a result, at the beginning of 2006, the Moscow Federal Tax Service sent a “black list” to banks and credit organizations with recommendations to exercise caution when opening accounts with such enterprises.  This was done as part of the fight against one-day firms, but such a "black list" exists today, however, changes are constantly being made to it. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mass registration address check" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/883053.jpg" width="430"></div>

The Federal Tax Service offers to do this openly, right on its website.  You can immediately say that this list does not include addresses at which business centers, large office complexes or large administrative buildings are officially located.  It is clear that few enterprises simply cannot be registered at such addresses, because the very purpose of their existence is to lease premises for the offices of various companies. </p><h2>  Where to check the address for "mass" </h2><p>  So, you want to track a company that, in your opinion, has a mass registration address.  Checking this is very simple: go to the site https://service.nalog.ru/addrfind.do and in the window that opens, select the parameters we need: </p><ul><li>  region - select the desired one from the drop-down list; </li><li>  area; </li><li>  town; </li><li>  locality; </li><li>  Street; </li><li>  house. </li></ul><p>  Next, we solve a simple digital captcha and click the "Find" button.  In the next window you will see the number of organizations registered at your chosen address. </p><p>  The service is absolutely free and available to anyone.  Importantly, the information there is updated quite regularly, this guarantees the receipt of more or less relevant information. </p><h2>  Signs of Inaccuracy </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Is it so scary to find a mass registration address?  By itself - no, it is much more important when choosing a business partner to detect signs of unreliability of his legal address.  This can be done based on the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  the location of the company is listed not only as the address of mass registration of individuals (IP), as well as enterprises of other forms of ownership, but it is also impossible to communicate with most of them;  for example, correspondence sent to such an address is returned with the words “the addressee has left” or “beyond the expiration of the storage period”; </li><li>  such an address does not exist in reality or the building previously located there is destroyed; </li><li>  in fact, the address is conditional, for example, it is assigned to an unfinished building project; </li><li>  at the specified address are state authorities, military units, consulates, diplomatic missions, etc .; </li><li>  There is an official statement of the owner, where he prohibits the registration of legal entities at the address of the specified property. </li></ul><p>  If at least one of the above circumstances is clarified, and the applicant has not submitted to the registration authorities any other documents confirming the possibility of contacting him at such an address, then he will be deemed unreliable.  In this case, the court may decide to liquidate such an enterprise. </p><h2>  Risk of using purchased address </h2><p>  What could threaten the company that bought the address of mass registration.  The consequences can be diverse, it all depends on the honesty of the intentions of the parties to the transaction. </p><p>  The negative consequences include the following: </p><ul><li>  a package of documents for renting an office or other real estate property may turn out to be fake, and the room itself does not exist at all; </li><li>  you can be refused registration if it is proved that the location of the company is the address of mass registration and is on the "black list" of the tax service;  True, the legitimacy of such a refusal is highly doubtful, but in such cases there is no particular argument; </li><li>  sometimes it may be difficult to open a current account, although there are no legal grounds for this, but who wants to have a conflict with the bank where it is going to be served; </li><li>  difficulties with receiving correspondence;  if the letter from the Federal Tax Service does not reach the recipient registered at such an address, but returns back - this may become an unofficial basis for a personal visit by the tax office of the company with a sudden check;  and if this is not possible, the company may be liquidated by a court at the initiative of the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  if, at the address indicated during registration, the employees of the tax or internal affairs bodies (on the instructions of the Federal Tax Service) do not actually find the enterprise, this may serve as a basis for enrolling the company in the rank of one-day firms;  after this, the refusal of VAT deduction and other unpleasant “surprises” for its counterparts will come in time. </li></ul>

    <p>  So, although the definition of yuradres, as well as the concept, in fact, “mass” is not legally fixed, if you received the address of mass registration, the tax one will most likely have several questions for you. </p><h2>  FTS blacklist </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the consequences of getting the registration address of the company in the disgrace of the Federal Tax Service can be very different.  Although this behavior of the tax authorities is not supported by any laws, in practice, all those whose registered address is registered as mass and blacklisted are at risk of encountering it. </p><p>  How to deal with it?  Honestly - no way.  You’ll either have to negotiate with the tax office and try to prove to the inspector that your company is really located where it is registered or just change the address to non-mass. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mass registration address consequences" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/883057.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the fact that there is still some cause for concern, it is not worth writing down to the “mass” addresses where a large number of enterprises are registered.  In fact, it’s better to just check everything carefully and try to avoid addresses where, with a fairly small area, a myriad of organizations are registered. </p>
