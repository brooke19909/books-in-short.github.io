Of course, there remain people who think: "What have we not seen there? Everything is the same as ours."  We hasten to upset them.  Each country in Western Europe is unique, and uniqueness is manifested in everything: culture, mentality, architecture of buildings, language.  That is why it is necessary to visit many countries in order to get the feel of their atmosphere. </p><p>  Today we will talk about Estonia.  Say right away, this is not the most budgetary country, so it‚Äôs difficult, but possible to find a hotel for reasonable money.  Toila Spa Hotel - this is the very option.  Here, for a relatively small amount of money, you will get everything you need and need. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building Toila Spa Hotel" class="if uuid-2621146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85188/2621146.jpg"></div><p>  Toila Spa Hotel is located <span>in Estonia.</span>  <span>Estonia</span> is a country in Northern Europe, located on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, washed by the waters of the Gulf of Finland and Riga.  More specifically, Toila Spa Hotel (Estonia) is located in Toila.  Toila is a small village located on the southern shore of the bay.  It is a state seaside resort. </p><p>  The holiday season here is relatively short.  It begins in mid-June and ends in mid-August.  Despite the low temperatures, the plant world is rich, a lot of greenery.  That is why there is where to walk and enjoy nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel itself is located in the center of the village, 300 meters from the main attraction.  This attraction, of course, is the shore of the Gulf of Finland.  The coast is steep, rises 30 meters above sea level.  The hotel is located at: Ranna 12, 41702, Toila, Estonia.  Many people wonder how to get from Narva to Toila Spa Hotel?  Just by bus number 106 or taxi. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the Toila Spa Hotel rooms.

It can be various cereals, vegetables, fruits, desserts, yogurts, cereals, omelettes and cheesecakes, as well as various freshly squeezed juices, teas and coffee. </li><li>  Breakfast and dinner included.

When you look at it, it‚Äôs hard to imagine what nature did.  This place is a picturesque cape, located high above the sea.  From its top offers a very beautiful view of the bay and the surrounding area.  From our hotel it is only 12 km. </li><li>  Meie Grocery Store. <div class="photo" data-original="www.bloomberg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meie Grocery Store" class="if uuid-2621150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85188/2621150.jpg"></div>  A large supermarket where you can buy absolutely everything.  Huge selection of meat and fish, vegetables and fruits. </li><li>  Toila Oru Park.  This park was built in 1897-1899 by the St. Petersburg merchant Grigory Eliseev.  Previously, the park was located near the merchant's palace, but during the Second World War it was completely destroyed.  Now more than 250 species of plants grow in the park, not only European, but also exotic.  Alleys, fountains, arbors and pavilions, that is what you can see here. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Well, it's time to discuss the reviews of Toila Spa Hotel (Estonia).  It is worth saying right away that there are both positive and negative assessments. </p><ul><li>  Positive reviews.  Toila Spa Hotel reviews say that the hotel is always very friendly and friendly staff.  A stunning location is also noted, next to the pine forest.  Many enjoyed the breakfast, in particular the freshness of the ingredients and the large selection.  In addition, guests really liked the spa, especially hydromassages. </li><li>  Negative feedback.  Vacationers have no strong complaints, there are only small flaws.  Many tourists really lacked a kettle and drinking water in the room.  The modesty of the rooms and the lack of direct access to the sea were also noted. </li></ul>
