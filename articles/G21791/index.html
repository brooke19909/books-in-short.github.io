Sights of the Novosibirsk region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Umrevinsky prison was erected in 1703 by Russian Cossacks.  The prerequisites for this were the tense military-political situation in Novosibirsk Ob.  At that time, the Russian population could migrate very limitedly.  This continued until, in 1695, Alexei Stepanov, the son of Kruglik, received a special document.  It had a confirmed right to use this land.  This paper was issued by the Tomsk Regional Office. </p><h2>  Location of the prison </h2><p>  In the place where the Umreva River flows into the Ob, a jail was located on the left bank.  Today it is the Novosibirsk region.  The building is located 3 km northwest of the village of Umreva. </p><p>  The construction of Russian prison was begun in 1590.  Thus, moving from the city of Tobolsk along <span>the Ob River, the</span> eastern defensive line of the Russian kingdom was built. </p>

    <h2>  Russian prison </h2><p>  Since then, many such structures were erected on the vast Russian expanses: </p><ul><li>  Achinsky - 1641; </li><li>  Berdsky - 1716; </li><li>  Ketsky - 1596; </li><li>  Kuznetsk - in 1618 was erected near the confluence of the Kondoma <span>River</span> in <span>the Tom River,</span> and in 1620 was relocated to the right bank of the river.  Tom; </li><li>  Meless - 1621; </li><li>  Narymsky - 1595; </li><li>  Semiluzhny - built in 1609 as a notch-outpost, and after 53 years it was rebuilt as a full-fledged prison (fortress); </li><li>  Surgut - 1594; </li><li>  Tomsky - 1604; </li><li>  Umrevinsky - 1703; </li><li>  Urtamsky - 1684; </li><li>  Chausky - 1713. </li></ul><p>  Future prison towns were built on the Yenisei River, except for Surgut, which belongs to Tomsk Uyezd. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Built Umrevinsky prison was the first on the Novosibirsk land and laid the foundation for the construction of the following.  This happened due to well-established circumstances - the Kyrgyz were defeated in 1701 by Ivan Tikhonov and Alexei Kruglikov.  As a result, warlike nomadic Yenisei tribes were driven into the khanate (northwestern China) by the Jungars in 1703. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Umrevinsky jail how to get there" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41255/1321498.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What did the prison look like? </h2><p>  In 1702, A. Kruglikov, together with a detachment consisting of service people, boarded the Ob River to the Oyash and Umreva rivers in order to determine the place for the construction of a new prison. </p><p>  Umrevinsky prison was located on a flat platform, having the following dimensions: </p><ul><li>  along the coastline 700 meters; </li><li>  from the water inland 250 - 300 meters. </li></ul><p>  Around the prison there was a forest consisting of birches, poplars and pines. </p><p>  In the XVII century, the prison was quadrangular, and along its perimeter there was a moat, a shaft and a wooden picket fence with three observation towers.  The Umrevinsky prison was superior in size to its neighbors - other Siberian wooden defenses.  Its sizes exceeded even Kazymsky and Lyapinsky, which were located on the middle Ob.  However, this prison was not the largest - in its parameters, it sought to Sayansky, built on the Middle Yenisei. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to the chronicles, the clerk‚Äôs house was located behind high wooden walls and a place was allocated on which granaries (‚Äúbarns of the sovereign‚Äù) and the Church of the Three Saints stood.  Other household and residential buildings were located outside the walls of the prison - in the settlement, whose number in 1727 reached a record high - almost 50 yards. </p>

    <h2>  Umrevinsky prison: how to get there? </h2><p>  From <span>the Novosibirsk-</span> Glavny station, you need to get to the Moshkovo station by train (Moshkovsky district).  From this settlement by regular bus you can reach the village of Umreva or the village of Tashara.  Getting on the bus, it is best to inform the driver of his intention to visit the prison, then he will tell you where it is better to get out.  After all, you can get to the prison in several ways: </p><ul><li>  From Umreva it will be necessary to walk about three kilometers, examining the surroundings and breathing fresh air.  If there is no such desire, then you can hire a car in the village and drive to the prison. </li><li>  From Novosibirsk you can get to Tashara by regular bus, but it is best to choose a flight that arrives at 17:00, as the route is specially extended to the prison. </li><li>  You can also hire a taxi from Novosibirsk - the price for the train will be 600 - 700 rubles. </li><li>  There is another option: to go from the side of Bolotnoy (from the village of Oyash) through the village of Rainbow and the village of Voronovo.  But there are quite big problems with transport, so it is better not to choose this path, although it is considered the shortest. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Ostrog as an archaeological site </h2><p>  Umrevinsky prison (Novosibirsk region, Moshkovsky district) is an archaeological monument, which had a rather complex structure. </p><p>  The structure of the prison included the following defenses: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúGarlic‚Äù - was a star-shaped steel pins that were scattered on the ground, not allowing infantry and cavalry to pass. </li><li>  Nadolba - several rows of logs that were buried in the ground vertically or with a bias towards the enemy.  They protruded above the surface by 0.5-1.2 meters. </li><li>  The earthen rampart was a high embankment, as a rule, having a ditch with water nearby.  He served as an obstacle to the enemy and covered the internal fortifications located nearby. </li><li>  Slingshot is one of the most ancient field barriers, which was used to stop infantry. </li></ul>

    <p>  The buildings inside the prison were mainly for domestic purposes: </p><ul><li>  granaries; </li><li>  house of the clerk. </li></ul><p>  Other buildings were not numerous: </p><ul><li>  Necropolis, which appeared in the prison at the end of the XVIII century. </li><li>  Church of the Three Saints.  Unfortunately, she was not found, but was listed in the annals. </li><li>  Posad is a territory outside the prison, to which city buildings were subsequently attached, and where craft settlements were originally located and tenders were held. </li><li>  Clutches of artillery cores. </li></ul><p>  Ultimately, the construction of the prison was positively reflected in the trade relations between the local population and Russian settlers.  The raids came to naught because the warlike tribes had tempered their fervor. </p><p>  Ostrog gradually disappeared from the map of Siberia, but his memory is still alive.  Excavations in Novosibirsk archeology have uncovered the remains of pillars from the walls, ancient burial sites, as well as fragments of the foundation of one of the buildings.  It restored the two-story tower with loopholes.  Looking into the future, we can assume that one day on the steep bank of the Ob River, an old prison will be reborn. </p>
