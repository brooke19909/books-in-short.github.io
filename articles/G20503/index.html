Among them, the most unusual and interesting for the sophisticated tourist are Kuago waterfalls, or, as they are also called, Shirokopshadsky waterfalls.  They are called so because they are located on the Kuago River, near the village of Shirokaya Pshadskaya Slit, Pshadsky rural district.  The village is located near the city of Gelendzhik, one of the main resorts of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  What you should know about Quago Falls before heading there? </h2><p>  Many waterfalls, which are located in the valley of the Quago River, often reach a height of 10-15 meters.  The exotic beauty of Shirokopshad Falls, and their local residents number about three hundred, cannot but attract the attention of many tourists who came to rest in Gelendzhik.  The only problem is how to get to the waterfalls - it‚Äôs not without reason that the name of the Quago river is translated as ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù, the river constantly winds, often a jeep will run straight through it.  The road, in general, is not an easy one. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to Quago waterfalls? </h2><p>  Since Quago Falls is the goal for any experienced tourist, there are already several ways to get to them.

    <h2>  Highway </h2><p>  So, to get to the waterfalls you will have to go first to the village of Shirokaya Pshadskaya Slit.  You need to go further about seven kilometers along the river along a <span>dirt road.</span>  She often winds and crosses the river, so we recommend using local carriers with all-wheel drive technology.  The road itself is not in the best condition, so we advise you to immediately be patient.  By car, you can either get to the beginning of the waterfalls, or to the middle route of the proposed excursion.  Nevertheless, we advise you to go to the beginning and go by the morning - usually the excursions are designed for the whole day, from 9 in the morning and in the late evening.  Having finished the road, you can have a bite to eat in the cafe. </p><h2>  Quago Falls: tour description </h2><p>  Further - a barrier and a pedestrian road.  Immediately you can see the first waterfall.  Along the pedestrian road, accordingly, many waterfalls will appear, from very small to those that reach 15 meters in height. </p><p>  The middle of the road - near Mount Otrez, it has access to a descending jipper road and a pedestrian trail, while it is located between two huge waterfalls ten meters high.  The lower part of the Shirokopshad slit, the gorge, by the name of which the village is also named, has special staircases, since the path runs particularly difficult and you can even fall in some places.  The upper part of the gorge is cut by a bad, inconspicuous and uncleared path. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you are not stingy and went on a full-fledged tour, you will have three stops.  The first is near the monument to the Sailors of the Revolution, the second is near the Natasha spring.  Both stops are decorated with sculptural works, have different legends, which an experienced guide will tell you about.  By the way, you can get the purest water at the spring, and have a bite to eat next to it in the counters nearby.  The path is still not easy and will take you all day, so we recommend that you stock up on food properly.  The last stop of the tour route is near the dolmens.  Here you will receive special brochures, and the guide will devote you to the details of the ancient history of these parts.  In total, on the territory of the last point of the excursion there are four dolmens, near the largest time after allotting time for a walk, you can listen to the lecture of the guide.  Interestingly, dolmens in this territory were built as much as seven thousand years ago! </p>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Near the dolmens there is an apiary where you can buy honey, and tea with pancakes to eat, and mead.  The excursion will cost you 500 rubles, you will have to pay separately for entering the territory to the dolmens, you can also drive a car to the dining rooms for an additional fee.  True, the trip, just 20 minutes on terrible terrain, will cost you 350 rubles, and unless the rich can eat there normally, you will have to pay 120 rubles for a small portion of borsch. </p><p>  In total, the path is approximately nine kilometers, and if you count only the pedestrian road, then it takes about three hours. </p><p>  Thus, having paid the price of one excursion and having spent the energy to get to this area, you can witness one of the most wonderful landscapes of the Krasnodar Territory, which will give you Quago waterfalls.  Photos, reviews that are often laid out by travelers who have been here, by themselves, attract the attention of not only nature lovers, then imagine what will happen if you see these beautiful waterfalls with your own eyes. </p>
