On instruments of high volatility with high volumes, the rules of technical analysis work, since the market axiom reads: ‚ÄúEverything is already included in the price‚Äù.  Everything is politics, wars, negotiations, accidents, crop failures, OPEC, the Fed and meteorites. </p><h2>  Graphic Analysis Tasks </h2><p>  The dynamics of the value of <span>stock market</span> instruments <span>is</span> displayed on the charts.  The player decides to become an investor or a speculator based on the results of processing information about a market instrument.  Investors are included in the stock exchange asset for a long time with a vague prospect of price increases.  Speculators trade at short time intervals and act according to the rule "Better a small profit than a big loss." </p>

    <p>  Japanese candles of a graphical analysis of financial markets originated in the days of writing in black ink on white rice paper.  Therefore, the terms "white candle", "black candle".  Until now, analysts and forecasters write about white and black.  But traders work on computer technology with customizable parameters of graphic tasks.  Analysts use the color on the charts of exchange programs, for example, green and red. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The green color of the candle indicates the excess of the closing price over the opening price in the time interval.  Green shapes are called bullish candles. </p><p>  Red indicates that the closing price is less than the opening price.  Red shapes are called "bear candles." </p><p>  Thin sticks - the upper and lower shadows - indicate the maximum and minimum prices, respectively. </p><p>  The advantage of Japanese graphical analysis over other types is the formation of combinations - signal sources for a trend change.  Combinations are usually formed of two or three candles. </p><h2>  Candle poem </h2><p>  Long candles without shadows are called "maribose."  The absence of a lower and upper shadow when coinciding with the current trend indicates the preservation of the trend.  A long green bullish candle without shadows with an upward trend confirms further growth.  A long red bearish candle with no lower or upper shadow signals the continuation of the fall. </p>

    <p>  If a long candle in the direction does not coincide with the main course of the price, this is a signal for a near reversal. </p><p>  Candles without a body are called a dodge, or cross.  The market is in limbo.  The body of the candle is the price fluctuations in the time interval.  Lack of body with small shadows - lack of vibrations, balance between bulls and bears.  Bulls outweigh if the top shadow is longer than the bottom.  Bears push if the lower shadow exceeds the upper one in length. </p><p>  A graphical analysis of Japanese candle markets is based on dozens of types of candle combinations. </p><h2>  Mountains and valleys </h2><p>  Price may rise, fall and remain sideways.  The monetary parameter of the traded asset varies depending on the predominance of sellers or buyers. </p><p>  On the graph, changes in the direction of movement of the price look like peaks and depths.  Each peak and each depth is a manifestation of the superiority of sellers or buyers. </p><p>  The words ‚Äúgraphic analysis‚Äù also denote the search for the limits of price changes by constructing auxiliary elements to the cost figure. </p><p>  A straight line drawn along two peaks is called a resistance line - the price breaks up, but sellers are stronger than buyers.  In this situation, a downward correction is inevitable. </p><p>  The line between the two depths is called the support line - it does not give the cost to fail.  Buyers here are stronger than sellers, so the monetary parameters of the asset will rush up. </p>

    <h2>  Trend Evaluation Parameters </h2><p>  A graphical analysis of market trade data involves looking for a trend, or trend - a series of peaks and dips.  A direct trend on the chart gives the trader a concept of the duration of the price movement at the current rate. </p><p>  The trend is determined by the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  extent; </li><li>  tilt angle; </li><li>  the number of points of contact of the vertices (depths) with a direct course. </li></ul><p>  The inertia of the direction of motion is directly proportional to the length.  The probability of a trend change is inversely proportional to the number of touch points. </p><p>  There are short, medium, long-term trend. </p><p>  A short-term trend corresponds to a duration of up to three weeks, that is, less than a month. </p><p>  The medium-term trend lasts about three months. </p><p>  A long-term trend is a period from three months to five years.  Recently, the long-term investment period is calculated under the Constitutional Article on Elections. </p><p>  A forecast of new peaks and depths behind the chart sheet and, accordingly, signals about changes in price trends is possible based on the law of self-preservation: a developing trend seeks to maintain the direction of movement. </p><h2>  Steepness </h2><p>  The parameter ‚Äúangle of inclination‚Äù is constant at a particular stage of development of the trend.  A breakdown at the price of a trend line indicates a change in course. </p><p>  A trader should observe the volume of trading operations.  The situation when at small trading volumes the price changes in the direction of the trend should be alarming. </p><p>  Normally, in an uptrend, along with an increase in the value of an asset, an increase in volumes is recorded, and a falling price is accompanied by a decrease in volumes. </p><p>  The norm for a downtrend is: an increase in volume with a decrease in the monetary value of an asset, and a rising price is adjacent to a decrease in volumes. </p><h2>  Graphical Analysis Models </h2><p>  Exchange game contains many subtleties.  One of them is a short-term price movement in the opposite direction in order to give the opportunity to purchase new or sell existing securities.  This movement is called adjustment. </p><p>  To determine the state of the trend - a fracture or correction - price models were invented. </p><p>  Since the trend can either continue or change polarity, 2 types of models are accepted: </p><p>  Continuation model - in order to confirm the continuation of the direction.  Fracture model - in order to diagnose a change in direction. </p>

    <h2>  Course change </h2><p>  Consider the head-shoulders model.  A relatively flat plot appears on the graph, sharply turning into a growing rounded line.  At the end of this line, the price shows a sharp slowdown in growth, and then begins to fall, followed by the creation of another flat line.  The graph on this site resembles a goal on the shoulders, hence the name. </p><p>  Inverted ‚Äúhead - shoulders‚Äù, double top, triple top, double base - these types of fracture models are derived from the primary head ‚Äì shoulders model. </p><h2>  The same way </h2><p>  Figures of the model of continuation of the trend in the initial direction: </p><ul><li>  Triangle. </li><li>  Flag. </li><li>  Rectangle. </li></ul><p>  The triangle is formed by lines of resistance and support, as well as a vertical line to the left. </p><p>  The descending triangle has a hypotenuse line of resistance, and the support line and the vertical line serve as legs.  This element signals a continued decline in the exchange rate. </p><p>  An ascending triangle is formed by the hypotenuse from the support line, and the resistance line becomes a leg.  This detail gives a signal of continued growth in value. </p><p>  Symmetrical triangle warns of consolidation.  Neither buyers nor sellers are able to overcome the resistance of the opposite side.  Highs are getting smaller, lows are getting bigger, but breakdown of boundary lines does not occur.  Trade is in the triangle. </p><p>  Two more figures of graphical analysis formed by restrictive lines: </p><ul><li>  Descending wedge. </li><li>  Ascending wedge. </li></ul>

None - the search is in vain. </li><li>  A flat geometric figure is characterized by a height equal to adding a price at a maximum, or falling when a minimum is reached. </li><li>  The size of the model is a signal for the size of the changes in the market.  The greater the width and height, the greater the expected changes. </li><li>  Compare the volumes at the beginning of the formation of the model and in the final stage.  The volume of operations increases by the end of the formation of the model. </li><li>  As soon as the graph breaks the base of the model, the formation is completed. </li></ol>
