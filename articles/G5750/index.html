But, despite this, it is amazing, respectable and every year is in demand both for youth recreation and for families. </p><h2>  Briefly about the resort </h2><p>  Before traveling to this picturesque island, tourists have an important task - to find a place where the rest will go on glory, and not that there is a risk of never falling in love with Phuket.  For example, cuticles and revelers will recommend Patong.  The beaches here are not very, but there‚Äôs more than enough entertainment.  The complete opposite is Kamala, a place where a person is left alone with nature and finds peace far from the hustle and bustle of cities. </p><p>  For youth and outdoor activities it is better to go to Karon Beach: you can master surfing, and the parties here are at the highest level. </p><p>  Phuket has many beaches.  They all have their own character, but the best, of course, on the west bank.  And to make your own opinion about the island, rent a scooter and visit each of them. </p><h2>  Naithon Beach <span>(Phuket):</span> beach <span>photos</span> , advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  The sandy and cozy shore is located in the north of the island.  A distinctive feature is a large number of tourists, regardless of the season.  The difference is even greater when compared to Karon Beach or Patong beaches. </p><p>  Naithon Beach is not wild: you can rent a sun lounger and an umbrella in a Thai cafe.  The services do not end there: across the road there are massage parlors, hotels, restaurants where you can escape from the scorching sun on the veranda of the establishment while having a cool cocktail.  There are no cafes on the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main advantage of Knighton is its incredible beauty, the absence of noisy discos that prevent us from spending thoughtful and slow rest on the sand in the company of a refreshing Mojito, poured in half a coconut. </p>

    <p>  The only negative is that as soon as the season ends and many tourists leave the island, Naithon beach turns into a landfill.  And the matter is not in people, but in the sea.  The waves carry all their ‚Äúgifts‚Äù ashore: from algae to the wreckage of old boats. </p><p>  In general, tourists who come with children have turned this disadvantage into a plus.  Thanks to a young fantasy, little vacationers who love playing sea robbers build a pirate ship from the wreckage, put notes with a "treasure map" in empty bottles and send them back to the sea. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to Naithon Beach (Phuket) as follows: drive 4 km south along the road called Thep Krasat Tri Nai Yang.  Then at the intersection, turn right.  Then, following the signs, after 3.5 km to be in the right place. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there is no fee for a sunbed at the entrance, you will have to pay 100 THB per day for using an umbrella. </p><p>  Naithon Beach (photo below) is a pale yellow hue, and the depth of the water begins 20 meters from the coast.  In the rainy season, Nai Thon may close for several days.  The sea at this time becomes troubled, so it is advisable to postpone the visit to the beach until the high season. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  On the territory are located mainly expensive hotels.  Knighton is the actual end of the southern beach strip, and the main infrastructure is concentrated here.  Almost in this place, a series of northern beaches begins: wild and deserted. </p><p>  The most popular hotels on Knighton Beach among holidaymakers: </p><ul><li>  Pullman Phuket Arcadia Naithon Beach - famous for its friendly staff and a warm atmosphere; </li><li>  Naithon Beach Mansion - popular for its spacious rooms; </li><li>  Pearl of Naithon. </li></ul><h2>  Naithon Beach Mansion </h2><p>  The hotel offers a budget accommodation option near the beach.  In the high season (November-April) the room rate reaches 1,200 baht, in the low - half as much. </p><p>  Knighton Beach Mason is a four-story white building with 11 rooms.  It is located two minutes from the beach, on the road that leads to the main highway of Phuket.  Despite the proximity to the carriageway, there are few cars here, and at night there are none.  Therefore, it is not noisy here. </p>

    <p>  Tourists, above all, appreciate the calm atmosphere and convenient location.  A few minutes walk is the beach "Naithon" (Phuket).  Guest reviews recommend the hotel, as it has a high level of service and is one of the best on the whole island. </p><h2>  Ideal time to visit </h2><p>  An ideal period for a vacation in Phuket is considered the time from the end of October to mid-April.  During these months, the sea is calm and the temperature is not so high (at night +20, during the day +26). </p><p>  The optimal period for outdoor activities is considered to be the beginning of May and the end of October.  The southwestern monsoons cause tropical downpours and turbulent sea waves. </p><p>  Despite this, the distribution of precipitation for the island of Phuket is the same as for the marine subtropical regions.  For example, it began to rain in the evening without a break, but after a day everything is dry.  This weather lasts 2-3 days, until the next showers.  Therefore, making predictions for Phuket is quite difficult. </p><h2>  The beaches of Naithon, Nye Young and Layan </h2><p>  Perhaps the most beautiful beach in Phuket is Bang Tao, where Layan is located in the north.  The area is considered a nature reserve, so the construction of buildings is under strict control.  Layan is ideal for day trips: the beach is secluded and very calm.  Tourists recommend it to couples with children and elderly people who want to stay away from noisy parties and resort entertainment. </p>

    <p>  In the northern part of Phuket, near the airport, Nai Yang is located.  The beach is considered part of the <span>Sirinat National Park.</span>  In the period from November to February for several centuries turtles sailed for laying eggs to the shore of the Nai Yang.  But, despite the good security of the territory, in recent years, marine inhabitants appear here less and less. </p><p>  Tourism infrastructure is poorly developed.  On the beach there is only one restaurant, several hotels and guest houses for rent. </p>

    <p>  Nai Yang is suitable for a relaxing holiday.  A big plus is the proximity to the airport (5 minutes by car), which is very convenient for families with children. </p><h2>  How not to spoil your vacation in Thailand: 10 rules from experienced travelers </h2><p>  Like it or not, tourism is a delicate matter.  Arriving in a particular country, you need to know the basic rules of conduct and etiquette of the visited place.  Especially when it comes to Asia. </p><p>  Thailand is considered to be a country of smiles, sweet bananas and a warm sea.  At first glance, everything seems simple: I paid a ticket, arrived and went to rest.  But even here, in order not to get into trouble, you need to follow the principles of behavior.  Here is a list of rules that will help not spoil your planned vacation: </p><ol><li>  Always carry a copy of the insurance policy and identification document. </li><li>  Respect the royal family. </li><li>  Be attentive to the national religion. </li><li>  Take care of your health in advance and buy all the necessary medicines. </li><li>  In no case do not take out the image of the Buddha from the country - it is forbidden. </li><li>  Be vigilant and pay attention to the safety of documents. </li><li>  Left-hand traffic.  Therefore, crossing the road, you need to look first to the right, then to the left. </li><li>  Be careful with strangers. </li><li>  When purchasing tourist goods (excursions), check the quality certificate. </li><li>  Be as knowledgeable as possible.
