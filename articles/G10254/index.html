This fact explains the multi-million flow of tourists flocking to the Greek coast in any season of the year. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SKG Airport" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1575618.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Greece - Ancient Treasury </h2><p>  Is everything in Greece?  Well, of course, absolutely everything.  Such a variety of entertainment and attractions, as in Greece, is not found in any other country in the world.  Divers can enjoy diving into the coastal waters of the Mediterranean or Aegean in search of sunken ships, whose holds are filled to capacity with treasures from around the world.  Beach lovers will appreciate the numerous small Greek islands, each of which is distinguished by its bright personality, as well as stunningly delicious dishes of national cuisine.  In addition, almost any <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Greece</span> is a monument of ancient culture with the ruins of temples and the richest museum collections. </p><h2>  Thessaloniki is the capital of cultural life in Europe </h2><p>  Along with Athens and the well-known island of Santorini, Thessaloniki can be considered the center of the cultural and Christian life of Europe.  This tourist route includes a lot of activities that will make the rest in Greek Thessaloniki truly unforgettable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Few people know, but this city is considered the birthplace of Cyril and Methodius, the ancestors of Slavic writing.  For a long time between Thessaloniki and Constantinople there was an unspoken rivalry for the title of the world center of the Christian religion. </p><p>  Now Thessaloniki can offer travelers not only its past, but also the present, filled with holidays, carnivals and annual festivals. </p><h2>  SKG Airport: unknown name </h2><p>  For many years, Thessaloniki has attracted millions of tourists.  Many of them, when buying a ticket, are worried about the final destination indicated by SKG encoding.  The name of the airport in this case raises questions.  Beginners who fly outside their home country for the first time or have never been involved in buying tickets on their own are particularly prone to such unrest. </p>

    <p>  We hasten to reassure all travelers.  There are no errors in your <span>itinerary receipts</span> if you see the mysterious combination of SKG.  The destination airport, according to this encoding, is called "Macedonia" and is located in Thessaloniki, Greece.  All Russian tourists who dream of spending their vacation in one of the most beautiful cities in Greece get here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  International code: where does it come from? </h2><p>  Experienced travelers know that each international airport has its own designation with three letters of the Latin alphabet.  These letters can be found on airline tickets, itinerary receipts, or even road signs.  Where do they come from? </p><p>  The fact is that before opening every international airport must pass certification.  As a result of this audit, he receives admission to service of foreign companies and an individual code.  In the case of Thessaloniki, <span>the airport code is</span> SKG. </p><p>  An individual three-letter code is assigned by the International Air Transport Association, which certifies all airports.  Also, this organization is a checking and controlling body that monitors the quality of services provided at each airport in the world. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SKG Airport Greece" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1575613.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What hides the SKG encoding?  An airport </h2><p>  Greece has always been a very hospitable country, therefore, despite its small size, it has two international airports.  The second most important passenger traffic in the country is located in Thessaloniki. </p><p>  SKG Airport is a fairly large air hub; not only tourists who want to relax in Thessaloniki pass through it, but also those who are sent to the popular island resorts of the Aegean Sea.  Now the airport is located almost in the center of the city, the main attractions can be reached by breaking only thirteen kilometers. </p><h2>  International Airport: A Brief History </h2><p>  SKG Airport dates back to the thirties of the last century, then it was called Thessaloniki Mikra Airport and was located in the suburbs of Thessaloniki.  An airfield was built for military purposes and only in the middle of the last century began to serve civilian aircraft.  Every year, its passenger flow increased, and the Greek authorities were forced several times to rebuild and modernize such an important air hub. </p><p>  In the sixties of the twentieth century, the airport was moved to a new place and completely rebuilt.  At the same time, it received a modern name and its international code, which is still in use today. </p><h2>  Thessaloniki Air Gate today </h2><p>  Currently, the airport serves more than four million passengers a year; military aircraft and civilian aircraft are based on its territory.  A flying club, popular in the city, and private parking lots are also located there. </p>

    <p>  The last modernization of the Macedonia airport was carried out about ten years ago, but a new reconstruction is already planned, which would allow receiving up to ten million passengers a year.  Inside the building there are two terminals, cafes, restaurants and currency exchange points.  Those who wish can take a walk in duty free shops or rent a car.  The entire infrastructure of the terminal operates twenty-four hours a day. </p><p>  Resorts in Greece have always been a welcome holiday destination for tourists, because almost everyone wants to join the culture and history of this country, dating back several millennia.  It is not surprising that the SKG Airport, located in Thessaloniki, receives more and more travelers from around the world every year.  If you plan to visit Greece, then, most likely, acquaintance with it will begin for you from the Macedonia airport. </p>
