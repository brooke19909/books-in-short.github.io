    <h2>  Guests on service </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Louis Ledra Beach 4 * <span>(Cyprus, Paphos)</span> has its own restaurant and several bars.  There is not much official information about these institutions, but guests are told in detail about them. </p><p>  Many people pay special attention to cooks.  They not only prepare delicious and varied dishes, but also are very pleasant in communication - they are happy to talk about Paphos and local attractions.  The manager of the main restaurant is also happy.  As the guests say, it is immediately clear that the person is in place.  He finds an individual approach to each client, remembers who prefers what, and always smiles affably. </p><p>  In general, tourists say that at the Louis Ledra Beach 4 * hotel (Cyprus) they feed from seven in the morning until midnight, without stopping.  For breakfast (they are from 7:00 to 10:00) served omelettes, fried bacon and sausages, <span>Viennese waffles</span> with a variety of jams, chocolate, honey and jam, oatmeal, fruits.  Huge selection of teas and juices.  Of course, coffee is also served. </p><p>  For lunch (from 12:30 to 14:30) you can have a meal of traditional local cuisine, enjoy wine or beer.  And for dinner (from 18:30 to 21:30) treats of various cuisines are served.  Between meals, you can enjoy a drink in the lobby or have a snack in the snack bar near the pool and on the beach.  Varieties - more than enough. </p><p>  True, people who came to rest with children were not satisfied with something.  They say that little is suitable for the child, since everything is mostly fried.  However, it is difficult to attribute to the disadvantages, as there are shops where you can buy anything. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Many pleasant words are also addressed to guests working at Paphos Louis Ledra Beach 4 *.  Animation is especially praised (mainly those tourists who came to rest with children). </p><p>  And upon check-in, guests from the Russian Federation are given a work schedule for those hotel employees who speak Russian.  This is so that they know when to ask for help.  It should be noted that Russian-speaking workers respond immediately and promptly to any questions and problems. </p><p>  The rooms serve well, in good conscience.  Cleaning is carried out daily, old towels are regularly taken and new, fresh ones are put.  Lingerie is also changing. </p><p>  By the way, many more people go to Cyprus to have a wedding in a city like Paphos.  Paphos Louis Ledra Beach 4 * is one of those places where celebrations of this nature are held.  And at the highest level.  It is worth knowing about this not only to future newlyweds who are interested in this service, but also to other potential guests.  Since all such events are accompanied by noise, music, funny laughter.  Many attribute this to minuses, since the above greatly interferes with quiet rest and sleep.  But there is a way out - either close the balcony door for the night and turn on the air conditioning (so that no noise can be heard and coolness is present), or look for another hotel. </p><p>  Many note this plus: when guests go to the lobby with bags, the doorman helps to get them to the bus or taxi. </p><h2>  Who should go here? </h2><p>  As the reviews left about Louis Ledra Beach 4 * show, pensioners from England are very fond of staying at this hotel.  In principle, they prefer not only this hotel, but also Paphos itself.  After all, this city is located in Cyprus, which until 1960 was a British colony.  As a matter of fact, that‚Äôs why most people speak English fluently here.  In general, as the <span>reviews</span> left about Louis Ledra <span>Beach 4 * (Cyprus)</span> say, people who are counting on youth active recreation and the delights of a modern vacation should not go here. </p><p>  But then there is the sea, and this is a huge plus for everyone.  Moreover, you can reach it in just one minute.  Some do not like stones, but if you go to the left side of the main beach, you can go to areas with clean sand.  In general, finding a convenient place for sunbathing and sea bathing is not a problem.  Many tourists even rent a car, and then go to travel on different beaches.  In Cyprus, this is one of the main attractions along with architecture. </p><p>  And you should not go to the described island to people who want to relax from their compatriots.  Russian speech is very often heard here.  In almost every local store or cafe, a person who speaks Russian as a native works.  And most people from the staff, by the way, are really from the Russian Federation.  Even in buses and taxis, our songs often sound on the radio.  But for many this, on the contrary, is at hand. </p>

    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  The hotel has many rooms, but all of them are very quickly picked up by tourists.  Therefore, it is better to apply for a reservation in advance, at least a couple of months before the trip.  When applying for it, you will need to provide your credit card details.  It accepts the hotel "Master Card", "Maestro", "Visa" and "American Express".  By the way, the administration can block on the account the amount for which the reservation was ordered.  This is a guarantee that guests really intend to come, and not just reserve an apartment just in case.  Arrival, by the way, starts at 14:00, and departure continues until midnight. </p><p>  After the tourists have made a reservation request, they will be sent a form to register their arrival. </p><p>  In general, this hotel is perfect for those people who want to spend their holidays in a comfortable environment, with delicious food and cozy rooms.  This hotel is not without reason rated four stars.  It really has everything that modern tourists need for a good rest. </p>
