    <p>  Bulgaria is rightfully proud of its largest tourist center Varna and the resort of Golden Sands.  SOK Kamchia is very close to these attractions.  Varna is about 30 kilometers from there, and another 18 kilometers to Golden Sands. The abbreviation SOK with a fruit drink is not connected in any way and is deciphered as follows: a health resort complex.  Kamchia is the name of a rivulet flowing near the resort and flowing into the sea.  You can reach the place of confluence in 15 minutes by boat or walk on foot.  The water there has a significant temperature difference (+10 <sup></sup>  river and +22 <sup></sup>  sea).  This property can be used as an exotic thermal massage for legs.  Kamchia is a narrow and shallow river with very beautiful banks.  Nearby is a nature reserve.  An interesting fact - in Bulgaria there is the village of Kamchia, which lies far from the sea and has nothing to do with the described JUICE. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort facilities "Kamchia" </h2><p>  Back in Soviet times, Bulgaria paid a lot of attention to the rest of children.
