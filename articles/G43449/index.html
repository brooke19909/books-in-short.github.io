This is perch bay in Triozerye, or, as it is commonly called, Okunevo.  The recreation center on its sunny beach, of course, is not alone, there are a huge number of them.  It is an ecologically clean and the most beautiful place on the coast.  The people who find themselves here have the full impression that they are in an expensive resort in Spain.  A snow-white beach is the limit of our winter dreams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="okunevo recreation center" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1110224.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Short description of the bay </h2><p>  The places here are simply fabulous, as if you were on distant, uncharted islands.  Stunning cliffs give a special charm to coastal landscapes.  Transparent to the bottom, the sea shines in the sun, like a huge diamond, and the white sands emphasize its delicate blue.  And if you get tired of relaxing on the beach, you can go hiking.  The road to the bay itself is very attractive, and the fresh air is simply intoxicating.  If you do not plan to spend the night in a tent and are looking for a place for a comfortable stay, then we suggest paying attention to the eponymous holiday home called Okunevo.  The recreation center is located next to two equally beautiful bays called "Priozerye" and the bay "Calm". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center okunevo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1110221.jpg" width="600"></div>
