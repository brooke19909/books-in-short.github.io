    <h2>  Reason for occurrence </h2><p>  Everyone knows that the treasure alone in the earth will not be taken.  Someone put it there.  But who and why did he do it? </p><p>  In the old days, banks did not exist.  In order to preserve their property, the rich hid it.  That's when people learned what a treasure is.  But in our time, some people hide money, and this is not a joke.  Here are a few reasons why this happens: </p><ul><li>  people do not trust others, banks, their spouses; </li><li>  volatility of the economy or stock market; </li><li>  many people hide money to feel safe. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, wealth is hidden in order to pass it on to their descendants.  But, unfortunately, no one is eternal.  People are dying, and no one finds the money that the deceased has hidden.  So <span>this wealth</span> can lie for centuries waiting for the lucky. </p>

    <h2>  Where to find treasure in old houses? </h2><p>  Any person at least once in his life asked himself the question: "What is a treasure?".  Is it possible to find it today?  In fact, it is real to find treasures in the most unexpected place.  Some specifically seek treasures in historical places.  But they can be stumbled upon by accident, for example, during earthworks.  Such works include building houses, plowing fields, and <span>drilling wells,</span> and digging wells, and many others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to find a treasure?  In modern society, knowledge of the area can help find treasures.  So, one of the most common places are old houses.  Of course, ideally, these should be estates of nobles or palaces.  This is due to the fact that in the old days often only wealthy people hid their wealth under the ground.  Therefore, the chance to dig up old coins or other valuable things increases significantly. </p>

    <p>  But if you are lucky, and you find a place where to look for treasures?  And here intuition should already work.  Indeed, in the old days there were also not stupid people, and they did not hide their acquired good anywhere and in a prominent place.  Therefore, treasure seekers should carefully examine the house and look: </p><ul><li>  for window and door frames; </li><li>  under the floors; </li><li>  beyond the walls; </li><li>  for the pictures; </li><li>  in the cellars; </li><li>  under the trees. </li></ul><p>  As for the garden, here you have to dig the whole area.  It’s not a fact that all the trees have been preserved.  Perhaps the old treasures are not at all under them? </p><h2>  In the treasure hunt </h2><p>  Any old house can hide many interesting things.  Nevertheless, if you want to achieve the goal, you must be armed with a shovel and be prepared for the fact that you will have to dig a lot.  Any debris is often found under the first layer of earth: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  old clay pots; </li><li>  bottles; </li><li>  knives </li><li>  dishes and many other household items. </li></ul><p>  If the roof of the house was not blocked, then it is worth looking into the attic.  You should carefully dig in the corners, the pipe, and also check the beams.  It was in these places of the attic that people hid valuables. </p><p>  But it should be remembered that such excavations necessarily require special permission.  And if, nevertheless, a treasure is found, then it is necessary to deal with it as required by law. </p>

    <h2>  Treasure at the bottom of the sea: how to look? </h2><p>  What is a treasure?  Can it really be found only on land?  No, the sea is also a great place to find treasures.  A couple of centuries ago, ships were considered the main means of transporting goods to other countries or continents.  Very often they were shipwrecked due to a storm or a ship breakdown associated with hostilities.  Therefore, to this day at the bottom lurks many treasures that sank with the ship.  Many seekers dive to the bottom in the hope of finding a treasure.  Some lucky ones succeeded. </p><p>  The basic rule of such searches is to have a scuba gear and a water metal detector with you.  During such searches, you need to work in tandem with someone.  This is for safety, as unforeseen situations may occur at the bottom in which help will be needed. </p>

    <h2>  What equipment is used for searching? </h2><p>  <span>How to find a treasure?</span>  Few people were not interested in this question.  The appearance of an underwater metal detector greatly simplifies the life of researchers, historians, archaeologists looking for treasures at the bottom.  Using this device is much easier to find coins, amphorae, jewelry.  Since the middle of the last century, the search for <span>sunken ships</span> and traces of ancient settlements in most cases ends successfully. </p><p>  Modern metal detectors give an <span>audio signal</span> as soon as they find the necessary elements.  In such newest devices, you can set a search target, for example, gold.  In this case, the equipment will not respond to different iron debris, and will only look for gold.  Therefore, before diving to the bottom, it is important to program it in advance to detect a specific precious metal. </p><p>  On land, everything is much simpler.  You only need a metal detector and a shovel. <br>  The main thing is to have faith, desire and excitement.  We wish you many valuable finds! </p>
