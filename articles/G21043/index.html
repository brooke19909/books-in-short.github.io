  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is Copernicus? Nikolai Copernicus: biography, discoveries</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is impossible to say unequivocally who Copernicus is.  It is believed that this is a theorist, astronomer, mathematician, mechanic, economist, canon, humanist, who lived from 1473 to 1543.  He is the alleged creator of the modern theory of the planetary device, according to which the Sun is in the center.  However, information about his life and work is very contradictory, which does not allow us to unequivocally answer the question: "Who is Copernicus?"  There is a high probability that it was a figurehead.  The name Copernicus, in addition, could indicate a whole group of innovators in the field of astronomy who were hiding from the persecution.  However, we will present an official biography of this scientist.  You will find out who Copernicus is, according to the most common version.  Sometimes there are several popular versions, and then we will give them all. </p><h2>  Date of birth, origin of Copernicus </h2><p>  Nikolai Copernicus, according to Polish historians of the 19th century, was born in 1473, February 2.  This event took place in the Prussian city of Thorne (present-day Torun, Poland).  According to astrological calculations of the teacher Galileo and Kepler (M. Mastlin), he was born at 4 hours 48 minutes.  in the afternoon of February 19, 1473. It is precisely this date that most scientific sources of our time repeat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996802" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996802.jpg?1573501818"></div><p>  The father of the future scientist is his namesake.  There are many versions of who Copernicus Sr. is and what he did.  He was either a merchant, or a peasant, or a doctor, or a brewer, or a baker.  This man came from Krakow to Torun around 1460.  In Torun, Nikolai's father became a respected man.  He served as an elected city judge for many years.  In addition, he was a holder of the honorary title of the <span>Dominican Order</span> "brother of the tertiary" (a worldly assistant to the monks belonging to this order). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the name Copernicus mean? </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt say exactly what the name Copernicus means, but historians believe that in the family of Nicholas, distant ancestors were traders of copper (in Latin, copper is "cuprum").  Another version - the name comes from the name of villages in Silesia that have the same name.  Presumably they got their name from dill, which grew in the vicinity (in Polish, dill - "koper").  However, the exact location of these villages is unknown.  Polish historians first discovered this name in Krakow documents dating back to 1367.  It is known that later its bearers were artisans of various professions, among them - a brazier, stonecutter, gunsmith, bathman, watchman. </p><h2>  The fate of the relatives of Nicholas </h2><p>  Nikolai Copernicus Sr. in Torun married Barbara Watzenrode, daughter of the president of the court.  It is believed that the wedding took place before 1463. Four children were born in the family.  Nikolai was the youngest of them. </p><p>  In Poland, today they indicate the house where Nikolai Copernicus was allegedly born, whose biography interests us.  This building, presented in the photo below, at the end of the 18th century became the object of pilgrimage for many Poles.  The plaster and bricks from it are national relics that are stored in museums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996811" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996811.jpg?1573501818"></div><p>  Children in the Copernicus family studied in their hometown, where they received a good education.  Andrei, an older brother born around 1464, accompanied Nikolai everywhere almost until his death (he died in 1518 or 1519).  He helped him with his studies and religious career.  In 1512, Andrei fell ill with leprosy, and A. Copernicus died a few years later.  Briefly tell about the fate of the sisters of our hero.  The first, Barbara, was tonsured a monk in Kulm.  She died around 1517. And Catherine left for Krakow with her husband, the merchant Bartholomew Gertner.  After that, her traces are lost.  And what about our hero, Nikolai Copernicus?  The biography and its discoveries are worthy of detailed study.  First, we will talk about the life path of Nicholas Copernicus, and then about his achievements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Parents' death, uncle's care </h2><p>  In 1483, Nikolai's father died from a transient disease (presumably the plague).  Mother died in 1489.  After her death, Luca Watzenrode, the mother's brother (in the photo below), took care of the family.  He was a canon of the local diocese, and after a while he became its bishop.  This man was educated at that time.  He was a master of Cracow <span>Jagiellonian University,</span> and also a doctor of <span>canon law</span> at another university - Bologna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996820" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996820.jpg?1573501818"></div><h2>  Training brothers Nicholas and Andrew </h2><p>  Soon, Andrei and Nikolai Copernicus followed in the footsteps of their uncle.  The biography of our hero continues with a long period of training.  After graduating from a city school (circa 1491), the brothers went to Jagiellonian University.  Nikolai and Andrey chose the faculty of liberal arts.  In this educational institution, they joined the humanism that prevailed at that time.  The university allegedly even preserved a certificate attesting to the tuition fee (for 1491) by Nikolaus Copernicus.  After studying for 3 years in Latin, astronomy, mathematics and other sciences, the brothers decided to leave Krakow without receiving a diploma.  Perhaps they made this decision due to the fact that in 1494 the university won the scholastic party, whose representatives belonged to the Hungarian community. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Brothers choose canons in place </h2><p>  Andrei and Nikolai intended to continue their studies in Italy.  However, the uncle, who by that time had become Bishop of Ermeland, did not have extra money for this.  He advised his nephews to take the place of the canons (members of the government chapter) in the diocese subordinate to him in order to receive the salary necessary for a long journey and study abroad.  However, this plan was not immediately implemented - he was hindered by the lack of diplomas from his brothers.  Even strong protection did not help.  Nevertheless, the brothers in 1496 nevertheless went to study at the University of Bologna as lawyers.  They were chosen in absentia to the places of canons in 1487, with the provision of salaries, as well as 3-year leave to continue their education. </p><h2>  Continuing studies at the University of Bologna </h2><p>  <span>At the University of Bologna,</span> he studied not only law, but also astronomy, the scientist Nikolai Copernicus.  His biography of this time is marked by an acquaintance with Dominic Maria di Navar.  This is a teacher at the University of Bologna, a famous astrologer of the time.  Copernicus, whose biography can be recreated only on the basis of indirect sources, allegedly in his future book mentions astronomical observations that he jointly conducted with his teacher.  At the University of Bologna, Nikolai also learned Greek, which was quite popular among humanists, but aroused suspicion of heresy from Catholic scholastics.  In addition, he fell in love with painting - a painting was preserved, which is considered a copy of the self-portrait made by Copernicus. </p><h2>  Lecturing in Rome, studying medicine </h2><p>  The brothers studied in Bologna for 3 years, again without receiving a diploma.  According to historians, Nikolai worked for a short time as a mathematics teacher in Rome, at the same time giving astronomical lectures to Alexander VI Borgia, the pope, and also Italian scientists.  However, evidence for this opinion does not exist. </p><p>  The brothers in 1501 returned for a short time to Frauenburg, to the place of service.  They wanted to ask for a respite to continue their studies.  Having received it, the brothers went to study medicine at the University of Padua.  They remained here until 1506 and again did not receive a diploma.  However, in 1503, the brothers passed exams externally at the University of Ferrara and became doctors of law. </p><h2>  Homecoming, service at the bishop </h2><p>  Copernicans in 1506 returned to their homeland after graduation.  Nikolai was already 33 years old by this time, and Andrei was 42. At that time, it was considered normal to receive diplomas at this age.  Moreover, many scientists recognized in the scientific community (for example, G. Gallilei) did not have diplomas.  This did not stop all of them from getting professorships. </p><p>  After a year of serving as a canon in Frombork, Nikolai Copernicus became an adviser to the bishop (his uncle), and then chancellor of the diocese.  He helped his relative fight the Teutonic Order, which was headed by Albrecht von Hohenzollern, his future renegade, in 1511.  Nicholas also helped in negotiating with Sigismund I, the Polish king, who was Albrecht's uncle.  It is believed that Luca Watzelrode wanted to make Nikolai his successor.  However, he did not possess sufficient activity and ambition for this kind of activity. </p><h2>  Moving to Fraenburg </h2><p>  Copernicus at this time began to create an astronomical theory.  In February 1512, Bishop Luca Watzelrode died.  From this time, the Copernicus sinecure ends.  The bishop‚Äôs chair is occupied by Fabian Losainen, a fellow student of the University of Bologna.  Nikolai has to leave Lidzburg.  N. Copernicus returns to Frauenburg, where he becomes the canon of the cathedral.  Tideman Guise, his supporter and friend, becomes chancellor of the diocese.  However, Nicholas‚Äôs duties do not burden him very much.  He was in charge of business affairs and tax collection.  Around this time, his brother Andrei fell ill with leprosy and decided to leave for Italy. </p><h2>  Copernicus becomes famous </h2><p>  Continues classes in astronomy Copernicus.  The scientist is gaining fame in this field, as if at the end of the 15th century.  His lectures are becoming very popular, they are visited by Alexander VI Borgia, as well as Nikolai da Vinci.  Historians say that Pope Leo X in 1514 asked the scientist what he thinks of calendar reform.  Nikolai Copernicus expressed his opinion in a letter to Pavel Middelburg, papal curator of this issue.  He advised to postpone this venture for a while, until he completed the creation of his theory (over which, incidentally, Copernicus worked for 30 years).  However, written evidence to prove this was not found. </p><p>  In the autumn of 1516, Nicolaus Copernicus was elected to the place of Tidemann Giza.  He becomes the manager of the southern estates belonging to the diocese of Warmia.  And Giza from this time occupies the post of Kulm bishop.  Copernicus is moving to Olsztyn for 4 years due to a new appointment.  Here he is forced to engage in military craft - the troops of the Teutonic Order attack Warmia and capture part of it.  And once they even besiege the residence of Copernicus itself.  Nicholas returns to Frombork in 1521, after peace was concluded with the Teutonic Order. </p><h2>  First treatise, proposals for monetary reform </h2><p>  It is believed that it was then that he created his first treatise under the title Small Commentary.  This composition made his theory famous in a narrow circle.  Copernicus's proposals for monetary reform in Prussia date back to 1528.  It was then that he set them out at the Elblg Seim. </p><h2>  Copernicus accused </h2><p>  After the death of Ferber in 1537, Johannes Dantisk, a former humanist and epicurean, becomes the Warmian bishop.  Subsequently, he became a hypocrite and a retrograde, and it was thanks to this that he made a religious career.  Many upsets and troubles brought Copernicus his reign.  Dantisk allegedly accused Nikolai of immoral cohabitation with Anna Schilling, a married housekeeper.  The woman was allegedly banned from appearing in Frombork by a special decree of the bishop, since this dangerous person seduced the "venerable astronomer." </p><h2>  The last years of life, death </h2><p>  I. Retik came to Copernicus in 1539 to study his theory.  After a while, he published a book where a new theory was presented, and then published a book by his teacher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996836" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996836.jpg?1573501818"></div><p>  Copernicus died on May 24, 1543. Death occurred after a stroke and paralysis of the right half of the body caused by it.  In 1655, Pierre Gassendi wrote a biography according to which his friends put the original of his book in the chilling hands of Copernicus.  Nicholas, according to modern historians, was buried in Frombork Cathedral (his photo is presented above).  In 1581, a <span>memorial plaque</span> with a portrait <span>was erected</span> opposite his grave, and a monument to Nikolai is located near the cathedral. </p><h2>  Acts of Nicholas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996826" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996826.jpg?1573501818"></div><p>  N. Copernicus is known primarily as the creator of the heliocentric theory.  However, he is credited with many other occupations inherent in the gifted and highly educated humanists of that time.  We will describe the main discoveries of Copernicus briefly. </p><h2>  Greek translation </h2><p>  In 1509, Nicholas, fluent in the Greek language, translated the Latin work of the 6th or 7th century.  BC  e.  "The moral, rural and love letters of Theophylact Simocatta, the scholastic."  It is believed that the creator of this work was the last historian who belongs to the ancient tradition.  Unfortunately, it is not known whether this translation was published, but its text is known.  It is interesting that historians report that this correspondence with historical and mythical faces is filled with anachronisms and does not constitute anything outstanding.  However, <span>this "naive"</span> and "boring" "rubbish" for some reason delighted Copernicus, inspired Nicholas to translate.  He dedicated his work to his uncle.  In addition, the heirs of the case of Nicholas published other works of Theophylact Scholastic. </p><h2>  Cartography </h2><p>  And in this area, Copernicus left his mark.  He created a map of Prussia, which, unfortunately, was not preserved.  Using his own made parallactic ruler of fir cones, Nikolai determined the Frauenburg latitude with an accuracy of 3 '.  These sticks, dubbed the "tricvetre", are now located at the University of Cracow.  According to historians, at the end of the 16th century.  this precious relic, John of Ganowy, bishop of Warmia, passed Tycho Brahe through Elias Olai Zimber, the disciple of the latter. </p><h2>  Other activities Copernicus </h2><p>  During the management of the land of Warmia (from 1516 to 1520), Nicolaus Copernicus mastered the craft of commander, military engineer and administrator.  His occupations in public finance date back to the end of the 1520s.  In addition, they write that Nicholas was a renowned doctor, he treated artisans and peasants for free.  The discoveries of Copernicus allegedly even include his invention of a sandwich. </p><h2>  "Small comment" </h2><p>  Three works set forth the astronomical works of Nicholas Copernicus.  Two of them were published only in the 19th century.  The first essay is The Small Commentary, which summarizes Nikolai‚Äôs theory.  A copy of this manuscript was found in the Vienna Court Library in 1877 or 1878. And a few years later, in 1881, the same copybook was discovered with the records of Copernicus himself.  It consists of 16 sheets and was found at Uppsala University, in its library.  However, it is sometimes reported that she was found in Stockholm. </p><h2>  "The Epistle of Copernicus against Werner" and "On the conversions of the heavenly spheres" </h2><p>  The Epistle of Copernicus against Werner is Nicholas‚Äôs second-largest work on astronomy.  This is his letter to Bernard Wapowski, rector of the Krakow Cathedral.  The work is doubly interesting, since it presents the author‚Äôs chronological reasoning, which is based on an analysis of the precession of stars in accordance with medieval and ancient sources.  In 1543, the main book of Copernicus "On the appeals of the celestial spheres" was printed.  The place of publication of this work is indicated either by Regensburg or Nuremberg.  It contains the results of the author's observations, as well as a catalog of 1025 stars, compiled by him personally. </p><h2>  Copernicus Theory </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996843" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996843.jpg?1573501818"></div><p> The ideas of this scientist were very bold for their time.  The world of Copernicus radically differed from the generally accepted views of its predecessors and contemporaries.  Nicholas rejected the geocentric <span>system of the world</span> that Ptolemy created.  At that time, it was a bold move, since this model was rarely questioned.  She was supported by the very influential Catholic Church at that time.  According to her, the center of the universe is the Earth, and the Sun, the sphere of fixed stars and all the planets revolve around it.  The Copernican heliocentric system radically diverged from these ideas.  The scientist believed that the Earth, like other planets, moves around the Sun.  Nikolai noted that the movement of the heavenly vault, which we observe during the day, is a consequence of the movement of our planet around the axis.  Copernicus' discoveries are set forth in his work "On the Reversals of the Celestial Spheres", which was published the year of his death.  The book was banned by the Catholic Church in 1616.  Nevertheless, new ideas have steadily made their way.  The discovery made by Nicholas gave a powerful impetus to natural science.  Many scientists subsequently turned to him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-996839" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25681/996839.jpg?1573501818"></div><p>  So, we have set out the biography and discoveries of Nicholas Copernicus briefly.  As you know, there is only a certain degree of probability that certain facts from his life are true.  To recreate the biography of people who lived long before us is always difficult.  However, we tried to present the most probable information about such a person as Copernicus.  Biography and its discoveries are still the subject of study by historians.  Perhaps after some time they will be able to obtain more accurate information. </p>
