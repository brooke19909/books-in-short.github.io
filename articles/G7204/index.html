From the land side it is located in the foothills of the southern slope of the Main Caucasian Range.  This is a small town where about 63 thousand people live.  The climate is characterized as humid subtropical, average annual temperature + 14 degrees.  There are many attractions and entertainments in Tuapse, which is why there are many tourists, since Tuapse is not only a port city, but also a climatic balneological resort of the country. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.106518" data-lng="39.08064539999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/0/8/9/2089.png"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first written mention of Tuapse is in Greek treatises of the period of the VI-II centuries BC.  In the Greek version, the city was called "Topsida."  At that time, these territories were inhabited by the ancestors of modern Circassians, who were one of the largest traders in slaves. </p><p>  Only in 1829 the coast departs to Russia.  The settlement is being rebuilt, fortifications are being built.  However, in 1853, Russian troops retreat under the onslaught of Turkish troops, having previously destroyed all the fortifications.  After the victory, the resettlement of objectionable Circassians and the settlement of the territory by Cossack families begins.  Later, Armenians, Georgians and other peoples appeared here who inhabited the territory of the Russian Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the city was badly damaged, 309 buildings were completely destroyed, and about 700 required major repairs.  By 1943, restoration work began.  After the end of the war and the restoration of infrastructure, the city again began to take tourists. </p><h2>  Sea port </h2><p>  The main attraction of Tuapse and the entire Caucasus coast is the seaport.  The first hydraulic structure was built in 1989.  It was a guard pier, which formed a small water area.  The first ship entered the port in December 1898.  By 1951, the port was fully prepared for operation and entered in the list of ports open to foreign ships. </p><p>  To date, the Tuapse port is one of the largest on the territory of the Black Sea coast. </p><p>  The near-shore waters are deep, therefore they do not freeze even in the most severe frost. </p><h2>  Tuapse Tower of Rosmorport </h2><p>  Another attraction of the city of Tuapse, which the city guests are trying to see, is the Rosmorport tower.  This is a real symbol of the city and it is located in its most central part.  It is a 60-meter hexagonal tower, at the top of which a huge blue ball flaunts.  Upstairs there is an electronic clock displaying local time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sdelanounas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuapse Tower of Rosmorport" class="if uuid-2381136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2381136.jpg"></div><h2>  Dolmen in Dzhubga </h2><p>  This Tuapse attraction is a real archaeological site, which is about 5 thousand years old.  Dolmen is located on the territory of a former sanatorium in the village of Dzhugbe, at a distance of 1 kilometer from the sea coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tiled dolmen is one of the most ambitious in the whole Caucasus.  In shape resembles an ellipse with a small courtyard, has three tiers.  All slabs are made of sandstone, which are sized to fit in a jewelry workshop.  Only the third tier fell a little into the ground, but in any case it is amazing that such an ancient structure stood for 5 thousand years.  It was built around the 3rd millennium BC. </p><p>  To this day, it is not clear why it was built, but it is reliably known that there is a special similarity between the Caucasian structure and Stonehenge.  Not so long ago (2006), ancient drawings were discovered on the inside of the front block.  Visiting this Tuapse attraction is absolutely free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="raion-tuapse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuapse Dolmen" class="if uuid-2381139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2381139.jpg"></div><h2>  33 meter waterfall </h2><p>  There are many beautiful places in the city district, there are waterfalls, and the largest in the area is 33 meters high.

There are many climbers and divers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The peculiarity of the rocks is that over several millennia, the sea breeze formed small caves in them, in which crabs now live. </p><p>  They get here, usually by boat, but only in good weather, since the seabed is dotted with rocky reefs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourprom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mouse holes" class="if uuid-2381176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2381176.jpg"></div><h2>  Nudist beach </h2><p>  Many unique places and attractions in Tuapse.

The coastline is 50 meters. </p><p>  Not only nudists come here, but also creative personalities and scuba diving enthusiasts and fishermen. </p><p>  There is a beach between <span>Cape Kadosh</span> and the place where the Spider River flows into the Black Sea.

On this street you can buy a guided tour and ride on a swing.  From here you can go on a pleasure boat along the coast of Tuapse. </p><h2>  Rock Kiseleva </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting sights of the city of Tuapse (photo below).

These two attractions are assigned to the Kadosh forest park, which is a protected area.  The total forest park area is 300 hectares. </p><p>  On the slopes of the cliffs, terraces and at the top of the cliff, pizunda and Crimean pines, shrubs, exotic trees and orchids grow. </p><p>  The rock was named after the artist A.
