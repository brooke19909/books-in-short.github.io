    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted that Ukrainian embroidery has a rather long history.  Modern researchers find evidence that it existed as far back as the sixth century: people's clothes were embroidered.  Today, this decoration is also inherent in things from a modern wardrobe.  An interesting fact for many will be the fact that at all times embroidery on men's shirts and women's dresses differed depending on the area where the person lived.  So, in Polesie, for example, simple compositions were predominantly embroidered, in which lines and triangles prevailed.  As for the Kiev region, it was mainly vegetal-geometric pattern that was inherent here, and in the Chernihiv region white embroideries were held in high esteem.  Southern Ukrainian embroidery is very interesting, the pattern there is often filled with half-crosses, so that the patterns are almost perfect.  Ternopil embroidery is also very unusual.  There, the craftswomen love oblong stitches, which is why the pattern turns out to be voluminous and convex.  It will also be interesting that the Carpathian Ukrainian embroidery looks richest.  The scheme in this version will be full of different colors, and the drawings themselves vary not only regionally, but even from village to village.  Transcarpathian regions are characterized by the use of the so-called ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù, zigzag.  As for the flowers, here the embroidery can be made as white thread, and to show off with all the colors of the rainbow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukrainian cross-stitch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/441118.jpg" width="461"></div></h2><h2>  Embroidery as a talisman </h2><p>  It will be very important that Ukrainian embroidery is not just a decoration of clothes.  Each ornament in it means something and carries a certain sacred meaning.  In general, we can say that for Ukrainians the embroidered pattern often became a talisman: girls decorated shawls to their loved ones, protecting them, women embroidered towels that were supposed to protect the house from <span>evil spirits,</span> etc. As for the towels themselves, they occupied the central place in many ceremonies - at the wedding, during the birth and baptism of the baby.  With towels even people were sent to another world. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukrainian embroidery pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/442737.jpg" width="323"></div></h2><h2>  Ornament Elements </h2><p>  So, what are the main elements in its arsenal of Ukrainian cross-stitch? </p><ol><li>  Water and the Sun.  Important will be the fact that all Ukrainian embroidery is permeated with these elements.  The celestial luminary is most often depicted in the form of an octagonal flower, while the water often resembles a curled snake or a modern dollar sign.  These characters are often embroidered in pairs. </li><li>  Maternal symbol.  A very important element in each embroidery is a sign that looks like an eight-pointed star. </li><li>  Rose flower.  Earlier in Ukraine they spoke not of a rose, but of a gun, which is based on the ancient name of the sun - Ra.  This flower is also a solar <span>symbol, a symbol of</span> life, death and rebirth. </li><li>  Viburnum.  This is a very important element of Ukrainian embroidery.  The word "viburnum" comes from the word "colo", that is, a circle, a sun circle.  In addition, the <span>berries of viburnum</span> are a symbol of blood and immortality of the genus. </li><li>  Oak.  This is a masculine symbol, mainly adorned men's clothing, giving guys strength and energy. </li><li>  Poppy.  This plant was also the main one in Ukrainian embroidery, because Ukrainians always believed that it was poppy that protects from evil and evil spirits. </li><li>  Stars.  This is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe people of the universe. </li><li>  Rhombuses and <span>geometric shapes.</span>  Security symbols that prevent evil from entering a person (in the case of embroidery on clothing) or into a house (security towels, tablecloths, paths, etc.). </li></ol><h2>  Colors </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning that Ukrainian embroidery can be created in various colors.  However, each of them has its own specific meaning and interpretation. </p><ol><li>  White color.  This is an attribute of the sun god, is a guard against evil spirits. </li><li>  Red color.  The color of love, consanguinity.  It attracts positive energy, protects against evil. </li><li>  <span>Black color.</span>  Do not think that this is the color of death.  In Ukrainian embroidery, it symbolizes wealth, wealth.  It is also the color of wisdom.  And all because the Ukrainian people have long appreciated and revered the land (in this case, black is the color of the earth, black soil). </li></ol><p>  Other colors are also present in embroidery, widespread in Ukraine, but they are less significant and are not so often used. </p><h2>  clothing </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukrainian dresses with embroidery" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/442747.jpg" width="351"></div></h2><p>  It will also be interesting that embroidery at all times decorated not only women's, but also men's and children's clothes.  So, in men shirts were always beautifully embroidered, in young children - shirts.  However, they especially loved to decorate themselves with various ornaments of the lady.  So, it could be Ukrainian dresses with embroidery: for daily wear and festive, various shirts, scarves, aprons, etc. In addition, towels, fireworks (curtains on windows), paths, bedding, various napkins and scarves were also embroidered . </p>
