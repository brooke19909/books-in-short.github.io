Lovers from all over the globe come to the most beautiful resort in the world to hold a memorable wedding ceremony. </p><h2>  Heavenly place </h2><p>  Mauritius is the largest island of the state, on which the capital of Port Louis is located.  Surrounded on all sides by a warm ocean, it is famous for its incredibly picturesque landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius Attractions" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The island, which was once owned by the Portuguese, French and British, in 1992 became a free republic.  The most prosperous country in the region is famous for its developed textile industry and the production of sugar from cane.  But the main source of revenue for the treasury is the constantly improving tourism business. </p><p>  Travelers who come to relax celebrate a pleasant climate without the sweltering heat.  Many are afraid of the rainy season, which lasts several months, from February to May, but guests of the island should not worry: heavy rains do not happen every year. </p><h2>  Mauritius on a world map </h2><p>  An attractive tourist island in the Indian Ocean is located east of Madagascar.  Belonging to the Mascarene Archipelago, Mauritius is equidistant from two continents - Africa and Asia, and many have a question about which one it belongs to.  It is officially accepted that the paradise is ranked among the hottest continent on the globe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius on a map" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239403.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is only a tiny point, lost in the ocean and located away from all tourist routes. </p><h2>  Artificial containment of tourist flow by authorities </h2><p>  The exotic island of Mauritius, whose attractions deserve a detailed story, does not exceed the territory of Moscow in size. </p><p>  Tourists celebrate the magical atmosphere of a colorful resort, whose ancient culture has absorbed all the best and most interesting for its guests.  However, getting here recently is not so simple: the island‚Äôs authorities, worried about the crazy flow of foreigners, began to restrain human influx in order to maintain a reputation as one of the most elite corners of the world. </p><h2>  Mauritius Airport </h2><p>  The first attraction that a traveler who comes to mysterious land will encounter is an airport located a few kilometers from the island's capital.  The resort‚Äôs only air harbor is equipped with modern Duty Free terminals where you can buy souvenirs and spirits, perfumes and the most famous brands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius Airport" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1239481.jpg" width="600"></div>

The airport, receiving aircraft from more than 70 countries, is gaining popularity every year.  Beautiful spacious rooms are conveniently located, so the risk of getting lost is minimal. </p><h2>  Favorite island of all celebrities </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that the rich tropical oasis was chosen by the rich stars of Hollywood, influential members of the royal families and the billionaires who scatter money.  Therefore, the guests of the paradise are deprived of all the inconvenience associated with mass tourism, and all vacationers on the island with such a beautiful name - Mauritius have long forgotten about the reports of criminal incidents. </p><p>  Its sights are primarily associated with the unique nature and magnificent multi-kilometer beaches where world celebrities rest. </p><h2>  Deer island </h2><p>  You can not ignore the Deer Island, located in the east of Mauritius.  Without exaggeration, we can say that this is the most popular vacation spot for everyone who wants to be alone with nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius Attractions" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1239487.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  Once upon a time it was known for huge deer populations and complete desertedness.  Over time, cute animals disappeared, and the picturesque corner turned into a tourist Mecca with excellent service.  Conveniently located comfortable hotels, luxurious restaurants and golden beaches offering all kinds of water activities are just a small part of what attracts wealthy travelers here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Chamarel Colored Dunes </h2><p>  Fantastically beautiful Mauritius, whose attractions are unique, is famous for the unrealistic landscapes of the village of Chamarel.  The colorful dunes created by nature itself will surprise even the most demanding guests of the island.  Sands for many centuries have been subjected to erosion and various temperatures, as a result of which they have developed into bizarre lands of the most unusual shades, which the locals call seven-colored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chamarel mauritius" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Although in fact, the sand palette of Chamarel (Mauritius) is much richer.  Walking along the colorful dunes is strictly forbidden, but for tourists have built comfortable viewing platforms from which you can admire stunning views.  It is interesting to visit the village after heavy rains to make sure the unreality of what is happening.  Sands of different colors do not mix even after severe hurricanes and heavy rainfall, which is an amazing sight. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden Pamplus </h2><p>  One of the oldest and most beautiful botanical gardens is located near the capital of the island.  Its incredible popularity is explained by the fact that the amazing flora of Mauritius is represented here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pamplemus Botanical Garden" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239375.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists will be delighted with a beautiful rose with leaves of more than three meters, a sacred <span>lotus flower</span> blooming once every hundred years, a palm tree, huge <span>water lilies ...</span> </p><p>  On the vast territory of the garden with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 37 hectares, the oldest species of turtles from the <span>Seychelles,</span> which were imported to replace the extinct Mauritius, lives on. </p><h2>  Underwater Ghost </h2><p>  Unique waterfalls scattered throughout the territory are not in vain recognized as the main natural wonders.  But the most, perhaps, the most magnificent cascade is located on the Le Morne-Braban peninsula, which creates a deceptive impression of a picture of an extraterrestrial landscape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius waterfall" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239374.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It seems that powerful streams of water continuously flow into the blue abyss of the ocean.  The view of continuously flowing jets from above resembles an impressive funnel that greedily sucks everything around.  Only from a bird's eye view you can appreciate the scale and beauty of an unprecedented hitherto spectacle. </p><p>  It‚Äôs all the more surprising to learn that the famous waterfall (Mauritius is rich in various miracles, and one of them is in the photo above) is just a ‚Äúghost‚Äù, but in reality the cascades are blurred sand flowing under the transparent surface of the ocean.  Layer by layer silty deposits create a holographic image, which is mistaken for the rapid flow of water. </p><h2>  <span>Hindu temple</span> and deity statue </h2><p>  Representatives of various religions peacefully coexist on the island, but most of the locals profess Hinduism. </p><p>  The temple complex, located near Lake Grand Bassin, is the most significant place for Hindu adherents, hosting thousands of pilgrims.  All guests are greeted by the third-largest statue of Shiva on the entire globe, surprising with special realism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shiva statue" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The supreme deity, which is unusually revered on the island, symbolizes two principles - destructive and creative, life and death.  The sculpture is considered to be unique, because this is the only image of Shiva standing, not sitting, as required by local traditions. </p><p>  On the greatest night dedicated to the deity, 100 thousand believers come to <span>the temple</span> located high in the <span>mountains</span> , who come for the festival from different continents.  To appease Shiva, generous gifts are brought to the shore of the lake, which are later pulled away by monkeys. </p><h2>  Sacred lake </h2><p>  And the Lake Gran Basin itself, surrounded by temples, causes considerable interest of travelers.  <span>Native people</span> have long worshiped him, considering the reservoir formed in the crater of the volcano sacred. </p><p>  Surrounded by sacrificial places, the lake in the morning and in the evening presents a very interesting sight: the light fog hiding the Gran Basen gives it, according to tourists, a mystical look. </p><h2>  Gastronomic establishments </h2><p>  Experienced travelers celebrate a well-developed restaurant service, surprising with spectacular evening shows and live music.  The establishments located in tropical gardens offer visitors to enjoy traditional and European dishes.  Local cuisine includes seafood, fresh herbs and gourmet spices, which Mauritius is famous for.  Restaurants can help you catch memorable private events in a pleasant, contemporary setting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mauritius Airport" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1239397.jpg" width="600"></div>
