    <h2>  National Dendrological Park </h2><p>  Arboretum Sofiyivka in the city of Uman is the largest in Europe.  Here you can admire the huge variety of plants that are constantly carefully looked after, maintaining the beauty of their appearance.  Therefore, floral families look according to the canons of the art of landscape design.  Beautiful fountains, waterfalls, underground rivers - all this is originally combined with each other and fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding the park belongs to the Polish magnate Stanislav Polotsky.  Its foundation dates back to 1796.  It was named after the wife of tycoon Sofia Witt-Polotsk.  The author of the project and the construction manager was the Polish military engineer Ludwig Metel.  The construction of the park territory was carried out by the forces of serfs. </p><p>  The area for the construction of the park is divided by the Kamenka river, there is practically no forest zone on it.  And the author of the project successfully used this relief.  The construction, by the way, was carried out without developing a preliminary plan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of work, trees and shrubs were planted in all parts of the park territory.  And also erected architectural objects, structures and sculptures decorating it and made in an antique manner. </p><p>  The park itself and its components are the most beautiful places in Ukraine that are worth visiting, <strong> </strong>  going to this country. </p><p>  The main compositional dominant here is a number of pools and ponds.  The upper area is 8 hectares, and the lower one is about 1.5 hectares.  In addition to these reservoirs, there are waterfalls on the territory (one of which has a height of 14 m), cascades, transition locks.  An interesting element is the <span>underground river,</span> which is called Acheron.  Its total length is 224 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful places in Ukraine" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1385763.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is impossible not to mention it, naming the most beautiful places in western Ukraine.  The lake is located at an altitude of 1000 m above sea level, and its depth is 22 meters.  In the very center of the surface of the water there is a small island called the "Seabed".  The lake is surrounded by the Synevyr National Park, which you can visit to enjoy the picturesque scenery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The existence of the named reservoir is associated with one legend.  She talks about the daughter of the count - Sina.  The girl's eyes were bluer than the sky.  She had a beloved shepherd Vire.  The young man played the flute not far from the place where the beauty was picking flowers.  Once young people met, fell in love with each other.  Upon learning of this, the rich count ordered the death of Vir.  And his people threw the guy on stones from a high rock.  When Sina heard about the death of her beloved, she ran to this place and cried.  From her tears a lake was formed, in the central part of which the tip of that stone sticks out.  And the water in the lake is as blue and clear as the eyes of a beautiful girl. </p><p>  You can visit Lake Synevyr using various roads.  So, from the south to the lake there is a route from Mizhhirya, towards the village of Sloboda.  Once a day, a bus runs here from Mezhyhirya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most beautiful places in western Ukraine" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1385778.jpg" width="600"></div>
