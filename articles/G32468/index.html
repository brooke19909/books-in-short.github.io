Such intermediary services are required to transfer taxes and fees to budgets.  This article will discuss the main aspects that govern their activities. </p><p>  A tax agent may be represented by an organization that performs duties on settlements and deductions from taxpayers, and also transfers these amounts to the budget.  Moreover, she has the same rights as an ordinary taxpayer. </p><p>  The main task of the tax agent is to timely and reliably withhold taxes with subsequent transfer to the Russian budget.  He must keep an address (for each specific taxpayer) account of income, expenses and taxes that should go to the budgets. </p><p>  The entire workflow should also be conducted by this business entity.  He needs, in addition to providing documents to the tax authorities, at any time confirming the correct calculation and payment of taxation, also ensure the safety of the above materials for four years. </p><p>  A tax agent is an organization that can, like any payer, be on any <span>tax system.</span>  Such a company performs its functions for specific taxes.  We will try to consider them in more detail. </p><p>  VAT tax agents - the procedure for determining them has some features.  In the case when foreign companies or ordinary foreign citizens who are not registered with the tax are engaged in the sale of goods in Russia, the amount of income from their sale is determined as a tax base and the tax calculated from it is payable to the budget.  Moreover, the main function of tax agents lies in the calculation of each individual transaction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Both a regular legal entity and an individual entrepreneur can act as a tax agent.  A prerequisite is that these business entities must be registered with the tax authorities and purchase goods in Russia from the above foreign individuals. </p><p>  In the case when property is rented out by state bodies in the Russian territory, the <span>tax base</span> should be determined at the level of the amount of rent calculated for each leased property.  In this case, the tenant acts as a tax agent, which is required to accrue and withhold taxes from the proceeds transferred to the lessor and pay the amount received to the budget. </p><p>  When goods are sold on the Russian territory that belong to foreigners who are not registered in the Russian tax accounting, agents are recognized as companies that conduct business activities as enshrined in contracts of commission, commissions, and agency contracts. </p><p>  These documents should contain information about foreign individuals and legal entities involved in entrepreneurship.  In this case, the tax base is determined by the value of goods <span>minus tax.</span>  <span>A tax</span> agent having <span>separate divisions is</span> required to transfer tax at the location of both its structural divisions and its main enterprise. </p><p>  Any Russian organization, a notary and an individual entrepreneur, a lawyer can be tax agents on personal income tax.  This can only happen if the taxpayer receives income from them.  The calculated and withheld tax is paid regarding the entire income of the payers, the source of which is the tax agent. </p><p>  Personal income tax is calculated monthly from the beginning of each <span>tax period on an</span> accrual basis based on the results of operations. </p>
