However, in winter, even more so, if snow falls, it appears before the eyes of tourists in a completely new guise.  Gothic buildings under a thin layer of snow, fairs and exhibitions with many lights, and a huge number of skating rinks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are a fan of outdoor activities, then feel free to go to the central part of the city, to the skating rink. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  location </p></td><td><p>  operating mode </p></td><td><p>  a brief description of </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  on Fruit Square </p></td><td><p>  10:00 - 20:00 </p></td><td><p>  own skating is allowed </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  harp gallery </p></td><td><p>  Weekdays </p><p>  15:00 - 18:30; </p><p>  weekends </p><p>  13:00 - 18:30 and </p><p>  19:30 - 22:00 </p></td><td><p>  there is a platform on the roof of the building, entrance to the skating rink is free </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  na frantisku </p></td><td><p>  Weekdays </p><p>  08:00 - 17:30; </p><p>  weekends </p><p>  10:00 - 21:00 </p></td><td><p>  huge ice rink area, 40X20 meters, entrance is paid, discounts are provided for children </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  at the stadium KOBRA </p></td><td><p>  weekends </p><p>  13:00 - 15:00 </p></td><td><p>  located in Branik, entrance is paid </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Naturally, these are not the only places where you can go ice skating.  Many locals and tourists prefer to go to the park for this.  The most popular are Stromovka and Letna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.praguest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague ice rink" class="if uuid-2350627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350627.jpg"></div><h2>  Park Stromovka </h2><p>  According to tourists, this Prague park is very beautiful in winter and summer.  Even in ancient times, there were royal hunting grounds.  It was founded in the 13th century.  In the park area there is a pond, which turns into a skating rink in winter.  It is here that you can enjoy an active holiday surrounded by snow-white trees. </p><p>  It should be noted that on the east side the park is adjacent to the exhibition center in Holesovice.  The total area of ​​this complex is 32 hectares.  On its territory fairs and exhibitions, sporting events are held.  The main attraction is the "Industrial Palace", built in 1891. </p><p>  In the center you can visit the archaeological museum and the exhibition of stone sculptures.  There is also an exposition of a dramatization of the battle of Lipan called “Maroldova Panorama” and the aquarium “Sea World”.  The complex includes an amusement park, the home stadium of the Sparta hockey team and a swimming pool. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the southern part of the park, at the highest point is the Viceroy’s Summer Palace, dating from the 13th century.  It was rebuilt many times, and in 1744 the palace was burned down by the Prussian troops, but later completely restored.  The famous film "The Phantom of Morrisville Castle" was shot in the Summer Palace. </p><h2>  Letna Park </h2><p>  It is rather not even a park, but a hilly tract on the left bank of the Vltva River, with a total area of ​​3 hectares.  The nearest bridge is Stefanika.  The Letensky tunnel runs under the tract.  In ancient times, hunting grounds were also located here.  Turning this zone into a park began only in the 19th century. </p><p>  This is not the first year that an artificial ice rink of enormous size has been flooded - 40 x 20 m. Entertainment is free, and all experienced tourists recommend it.  There are often performances for children at this skiing venue.  In the park near the rink you can rent all the necessary equipment. </p><p>  In winter, in Prague, in Letna Park, you can admire the Vltava River and its bridges, it is from here that a magnificent view of its channel opens.  Among the attractions of the park, it is worth noting the Hanavian Pavilion and the carousel, which is the oldest in Europe and is in working condition to this day. </p><p>  A huge metronome is installed on the observation deck.  Earlier in this place was a monument to Stalin.  They installed it in 1955, but in 1962 they blew it up and in 1991 installed a metronome instead of a sculpture.  You can get here by tram and metro to the Maloctranska station. </p><h2>  The historical part of the city </h2><p>  It is clear that the skating rink is an interesting entertainment, but a trip to Prague in winter or summer cannot do without sightseeing of the city, because it is one of the oldest settlements in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are several options for sightseeing: on foot, by tram or by sightseeing bus.  The last option, according to reviews, is most acceptable for winter excursions.  In 4 hours you will be able to explore all the most beautiful places in the city.  You will see Old Town and Wenceslas Square, town halls, ancient streets, many of which are shrouded in legends and mystical stories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mapsofworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The historical part of the city" class="if uuid-2350648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350648.jpg"></div><h2>  The Charles Bridge </h2><p>  This crossing existed at a time when the knights rode horses.  In the XIV century, the astrologer of the royal court, the warlock Bezalel calculated the exact date when it is necessary to lay the bridge so that it stands for a long time.  The bridge was laid on July 9, 1357 at 05:31.  It seems that the Kabbalist was not mistaken, the bridge has existed for 700 years and has not suffered from the Swedes, nor from the Germans, nor from the floods. </p><p>  By the way, in the medieval period the buildings were erected using eggs, milk and butter.  And during the construction of the Charles Bridge, the king ordered to bring not only raw eggs, but also boiled eggs to the construction site of the crossing, so that they would not deteriorate during transportation.  That is, the bridge was built using a kind of medieval know-how - using boiled eggs. </p><p>  This landmark of Prague is decorated with a Gothic arch, and on the western side there are two security towers.  But the most important decoration of the bridge is 30 baroque sculptures mounted on parapets. </p><h2>  Old city </h2><p>  This is a must stop for all city tours.  The Royal Road passed through the square: from the Powder Tower to Charles Bridge, then to Prague Castle. </p><p>  The Jewish Quarter is located on the square, where the remains of the Jewish ghetto that existed in the 10th century are preserved. </p><p>  In the central part of the street there are astronomical clocks and the Tyn Church - the main attractions of Prague.  Gothic-style buildings and baroque cathedrals can also be admired in the square.  In the center of the square there is a monument to Jan Hus.  Here you can sit on one of the many shops and listen to street musicians. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trekearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old city" class="if uuid-2350633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350633.jpg"></div><h2>  Wenceslas Square </h2><p>  This, according to tourists, is a must stop on any excursion in Prague, in winter and summer.  This is the central square of the city, where celebrations, public gatherings and demonstrations are held.  Even in 1945, it was here that the end of the war was announced. </p><p>  The square is very well designed - it is connected to most of the central and busiest streets of Prague.  They opened it in 1348 and located several markets.  It received its modern name only after 500 years.  The main attraction of the square is the equestrian sculpture of St. Wenceslas, the patron saint of the city and country.  The sculpture was installed only in 1912. </p><p>  The length of the area is 1 kilometer.  It houses the magnificent building of the National Museum (1890) and the Lucerne shopping gallery.  It is here, in the Yabloneks store, that girls try to get in, because you can buy famous Czech jewelry in it.  There are also music and bookstores here. </p><h2>  Prague Castle: Description </h2><p>  Prague is fascinating in winter, especially its ancient architecture.  Prague Castle is the largest royal residence in the whole world.  Even today, this fortress is the residence of the current president of the country. </p><p>  The castle complex is a symbol of the Czech Republic and is listed on the UNESCO List and the Guinness Book of Records.  The total occupying area is 70 thousand square meters.  The complex has three main courtyards, an extensive ensemble of temples and palaces.  All of them are made in different styles, as they were built in different periods. </p><p>  They come to the castle to see how the changing of the guard takes place.  The residence is guarded by 600 guards from an elite military unit.  Changing of the guard takes place every hour, and if you arrive in time by 12:00, you can see the action, which is accompanied by the orchestra. </p><p>  Until the end of the 20th century, the territory of the fortress was completely closed to the public.  With the advent of Vaclav Havel, the doors of each of the rooms of the palace complex began to open for visiting.  The fence around the Presidential Villa was removed, the Royal Garden and other palaces were opened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Castle" class="if uuid-2350640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350640.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Winter holidays</span> in Prague </h2><p>  If you have the opportunity to get to Prague on New Year's Eve or on the eve of Christmas - do not refuse to travel.  At this time, the city opens with many seasonal events.  These are fun fairs, unforgettable fireworks and a tasting of Catholic holiday dishes.  Probably not for nothing that the American publication awarded the Czech capital the honorable first place in the category "Best Christmas Destination". </p><p>  The city opened several fairs in November: </p><ul><li>  on Peace Square; </li><li>  on the Satromest and Wenceslas squares; </li><li>  on the rear area; </li><li>  on the area of ​​the Republic; </li><li>  in Prague Castle. </li></ul><p>  At all, without exception, Christmas markets are held bright holiday events.  Performing art groups, choristers and musicians.  For children, master classes are held.  Naturally, in every market you can see a Christmas nativity scene with lambs and donkeys. </p><p>  On holidays, the appearance of winter Prague changes almost beyond recognition - everywhere lights and a lot of people are burning.  Tourists can buy unique products from Bohemian glass, dolls in national costumes, jewelry and try local delicacies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas in Prague" class="if uuid-2350682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350682.jpg"></div><h2>  Prague Zoo </h2><p>  On the advice of tourists, no matter what the winter in Prague - cold, snowy or warm - is worth a visit to the zoo.  It was founded in the XVII century and occupies 60 hectares.  The park is one of the ten best zoos in the world. </p><p>  Here you can chat with animals, stroke them, which is especially interesting for kids.  The park area is located on two levels connected by a cable car.  The zoo has many small paths and thousands of animals. </p><p>  In winter, the park, which is located in the Troy district, is open from 9:00 to 16:00.  Free public transport goes here - a bus that has the inscription ZOO and one that follows route 112. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Zoo" class="if uuid-2350643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2350643.jpg"></div><h2>  What else to do </h2><p>  If you couldn’t get to <span>Prague</span> at Christmas <span>, what to do</span> in the winter in the Czech capital?  Reviews are advised to go shopping.  In the city, regular sales are held with the most fashionable collections, for this you need to go out on Przkop Street.  There are large shopping complexes and small cozy shops with cute and unobtrusive sellers.  You can walk along the street all day. </p><p>  By the way, despite the declared Christmas discounts, a real reduction in prices is noticeable at the end of the New Year holidays, from January 5-6 until the end of February.  Discounts can reach 70%, but Czech quality is known far beyond the borders of the country. </p><h2>  Entertainment for extreme sports </h2><p>  A new direction of winter mountaineering has appeared in the world - ice climbing.  In the Czech Republic there are a huge number of waterfalls of various sizes, which come together not only in the summer to admire, but also in winter to climb a frozen waterfall.  However, in order to have fun, you will have to go to the suburbs - to Marzhenka, Vrana or Barrandov.  Lately, judging by the reviews, Czech Switzerland is especially popular among ice climbers. </p><h2>  Behind a mug of mulled wine </h2><p>  Of course, winter vacations in Prague are also associated with mulled wine (in Czech the drink is called svarak).  You can taste it in any restaurant and cafe, of which there are a huge number in the city.  The drink quickly warms and invigorates, which is very important after walking around the winter city or ice skating.  Although, you can order a signature Prague beer, the quality of which is famous all over the world. </p><p>  In cafes and restaurants you can enjoy traditional dishes of the country, as well as Italian and French cuisine.  The average price for a dinner for 2 people is 200 kroons.  Menus in Russian can be found in almost every institution. </p><p>  Experienced travelers say that, despite the “mild” winter, it is still better to dress warmer and take shoes with thick soles, especially if you plan long walks.  It’s not bad to have rubber boots.  And everyone who has visited Prague, tourists promise beginners a lot of unforgettable experiences and a desire to return here again. </p>
