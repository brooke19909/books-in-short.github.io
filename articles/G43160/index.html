This question is actually asked of each of us.  It‚Äôs great if the vacation falls on the summer period, when all directions are open, including Russian resorts.  But what about those tourists who can get out on vacation only in winter?  Agree, in the cold season, as never before, I want to be in a paradise, surrounded by majestic palm trees, gorgeous sandy beaches and a lot of entertainment.  And Thailand fits this description perfectly.  In fact, this tourist destination has a huge number of admirers, as well as those who under no circumstances dare to spend 9 hours on the plane. </p><p>  Of course, Thailand is only embarking on the path of its economic development, the standard of living of the local population is not as high as we would like, but if we talk about tourism, it is well developed.  The clear and undeniable advantage of Thailand, which should be noted by all vacationers, is its stunning nature, endless sandy beaches and crystal clear, clear sea water.  The resort is great for a beach holiday.  Moreover, there are really a lot of beautiful and interesting places, so Thailand will be a great opportunity to get acquainted with the exotic of Asian countries, to delve into their culture and customs.  If you want to stay away from civilization, enjoy a full beach holiday, pay attention to the city of Phuket.  The ships fly a little longer, but the quality of rest will satisfy even the most demanding taste.  This place is most often chosen by lovers of a more relaxed and secluded holiday; here you can meet newlyweds, couples in love who want to enjoy each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Asian hotels tend to lack a huge surrounding area, swimming pools.  Most of them are remote from the coast, which, however, does not affect the quality of rest.  Thais are quite friendly, attentive, therefore they will create the most comfortable conditions for tourists, will please with excellent service and maintenance.  The only negative is that not all hotels correspond to their description.  So, just in order not to be disappointed and not spoil your vacation, you need to get acquainted with a potential option in advance, read reviews about it by real tourists and vacationers.  Only in this case will your vacation really turn out to be unforgettable in every way.  We bring to your attention a modest budget hotel The Color Kata 2 *.  Reviews of tourists will help to evaluate it from all sides. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Of course, all potential vacationers should know as much as possible about the place where they intend to spend 12-14 days of their vacation.  So, The Color Kata 2 * hotel (Phuket) boasts a favorable location.  This is a great option for those tourists who can not stand the long road and want to use the days of their vacation to the maximum.  Phuket, the capital of the island, is just 20 minutes from the hotel.  The international airport is approximately 40-45 minutes.  The hotel is small - only 22 comfortable rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Check-in is quick enough.  If you read the reviews of vacationers, in almost every one of them you can find laudatory odes to staff: employees really work quickly and efficiently.  Guests do not wait more than 10 minutes for room keys.  Moreover, the reception is open around the clock, therefore, at the slightest difficulty, tourists can always turn to friendly staff.  When checking in, vacationers will have to pay a deposit of $ 100, it is a kind of protection for the hotel administration.  Upon the expiration of your stay at the hotel, the amount will be refunded in full if you do not use the minibar and do not cause material damage.  That is why before checking into a room in the presence of hotel employees, it is necessary to inspect the rooms and make sure that the equipment and plumbing are working properly. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  There are very few rooms at The Color Kata 2 * hotel, but all of them are quite bright and spacious, equipped with everything necessary for a good rest.  Each has a private bathroom with a hairdryer, which will make the reception of water procedures as pleasant and comfortable as possible.  Tai is a tropical resort, in season the air temperature rises even above 30 degrees Celsius, so there‚Äôs definitely no way to do without air conditioning.  So, in each room there is a powerful air conditioning, just providing a pleasant coolness and freshness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Moreover, all vacationers can use the refrigerator to maintain freshness and coolness of drinks and a minibar.  A safe is responsible for protecting money, valuables and documents of vacationers.  By the way, tourists consider the availability of a safe in each room one of the most important and valuable advantages of The Color Kata 2 * hotel.  Standard rooms are not at all similar to those offered by hotels of the same price category.  The designer really tried his best, brought a highlight to the modest budget hotel.  You can‚Äôt name new furniture, it is worn out in order, but this did not cease to be comfortable. </p><p>  The technique is working.  A sufficiently large and roomy refrigerator is available.  I would like to pay special attention to the air conditioner - it is excellent here.  It is possible to configure the unit in such a way as not to experience its negative influence, which not all hotels of even a higher category can boast of.  The Color Kata 2 * cannot offer rooms with a balcony, but due to the panoramic windows in the rooms there is enough light.  Tourists note a good sound insulation, vacationers can hardly hear what is happening in the neighboring rooms. </p>

    <p>  The furniture in the room is dark, and the same highlight is added by colored chairs, which are bright accents and a rather bold design decision.  By the way, with regard to the beds: they are high enough, and sleep on them is a pleasure.  All furniture is simple in appearance, but necessary on vacation. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Tourists who managed to visit The Color Kata 2 * <span>(Phuket, Thailand)</span> celebrate its excellent service.  It is really nice to relax here.  Wireless internet is available on site for free.  All vacationers will receive a password upon check-in.  The 24-hour front desk is a loyal tourist assistant.

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  For an additional fee, you can order a shuttle to the airport, as well as buy a ticket for any excursion you like, and there are really many beautiful and interesting places in Phuket.  The kind staff of the hotel will tidy up your things: wash and take a look at them, again for an additional fee.  And, of course, all vacationers of The Color Kata 2 * (Thailand, Kata, Phuket) can count on a luggage storage room working around the clock. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  So, in a small hotel restaurant, all vacationers can have breakfast.  Breakfast is not as varied as we would like, but no one will remain hungry.  Typically, breakfast serves traditional Thai rice, eggs, sausages, sliced, toast with jam, as well as coffee, tea and freshly squeezed juices.  If you are planning an early excursion, be sure to notify the hotel staff about this - they will prepare a delicious lunch with you, which you can eat on the road.  You can have lunch and dinner at local restaurants and cafes - they serve traditional Asian dishes, and you can also easily find a cafe with European and even Russian cuisine.  And all this in close proximity to The Color Kata 2 *.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that in Phuket you can also have a snack in the street quite calmly: seafood, chicken are sold in makashniki, you can also eat and enjoy delicious banana pancakes.  Literally at every step there are chain stores, convenience stores, where you can buy the necessary products, in shopping stalls you can buy, and quite inexpensively, ripe and juicy tropical fruits. </p>

    <h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The city of Phuket, of course, allows you to get acquainted with the exotic in all its glory, but it is difficult to overestimate the local beach holiday.  Only 500 meters from the hotel to the sea, free shuttles go every hour.  The beach here is excellent even in season, when a lot of vacationers are recruited.  Majestic palm trees, white sand, crystal clear sea water - what else is needed for a luxurious beach holiday?  Here, lovers of waves and diving will also like it - this is a great place for those who want to engage in water sports, for example, for the first time to stand on the board.  On the beach you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas to protect from the scorching sun.  Of course, do not neglect sunscreens with a high protection factor - this is the only way to protect your skin from burns.  On the beach, locals sell juicy tropical fruits, Asian sweets and, most importantly, all kinds of seafood. </p>
