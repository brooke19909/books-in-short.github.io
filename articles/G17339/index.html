Those who come here to relax, in addition to the sea and the beach, tend to visit at least a few excursions.  And since the choice is large, sometimes it will be difficult to dwell on something specific.  Let's try to figure out which excursions are more in demand among vacationers at the Larissa Holiday Beach Club hotel. </p><p>  1. Demre - Peace - Kekova </p><p>  Quite a long, but very interesting excursion, which includes a visit to three significant places. </p><p>  First, tourists go to the city of Finike, there they transfer to a yacht and sail to the place of the city of Kekova that sunk after the earthquake.  Not far from this place parking and swimming in the sea is organized. </p><p>  Further, the tour includes visits to the ruins of the ancient World, rock burials and an amphitheater.  Then lunch is organized and a visit to the church of St. Nicholas.  In the temple there is a sarcophagus, where Nikolai the Wonderworker was originally buried. </p><p>  The tour lasts all day.  The approximate cost is 40-70 dollars. </p><p>  2. Cappadocia </p><p>  A two-day excursion to the central part of Turkey.  As a result of the volcanic eruption and evolution in Cappadocia, natural phenomena arose - lunar valleys, rocks of incredible colors and shapes, bizarre mountains.  In addition, there are entire cave cities, monasteries and churches, which are listed by UNESCO.  The tour is very informative and fascinating. </p><p>  3. Pamukkale </p><p>  A natural object, which many call the eighth wonder of the world.  Located in the southwestern part of Turkey. </p><div class="photo" data-original="livingnomads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pamukkale (Turkey)" class="if uuid-2325873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46724/2325873.jpg"></div><p>  It included seventeen geothermal springs and snow-white travertines resulting from salt deposits.  Tourists arriving in Pamukkale are given the opportunity to swim in these springs, as well as visit the nearby Cleopatra pool.  The tour is long, there are options with an overnight stay.  Travelers who visited this tour note that Pamukkale will be remembered by them for life. </p><p>  4. Boat trip </p><p>  Very popular excursion.  It includes traveling along the coast, swimming in scenic spots and lunch. </p><p>  The cost of the tour is about $ 15. </p><p>  5. Safari </p><p>  A short program, which involves riding around the resort on ATVs.  It costs an average of $ 20. </p><p>  6. Jeep safari </p><p>  A longer trip.  Tourists carry in jeeps along mountain roads and introduce them to the sights and interesting places.  Some excursions include lunch.  Tour price - 15-20 dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jeep safari in Turkey" class="if uuid-2325947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46724/2325947.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the guided tours of excursions, from Konakli you can take a minibus or taxi to Alanya and Antalya. </p><p>  7. Alanya Fortress </p><p>  Business card of the city.  The fortress was built in the 13th century and currently has the status of a museum.  You can get to it from Konakli on your own by public transport.  Entrance to the fortress costs a little less than $ 3. </p><p>  8. Dolphinarium </p><p>  It will be interesting to tourists who come to Konakli with children.  The program is good, it includes performances of dolphins, sea lions and seals.  Tickets cost from 15 to 18 euros. </p><p>  If you go to Antalya, then the choice of places of entertainment will become even more diverse.  For children, Aqualand, Aktur Park, and Aquarium are perfect. </p><p>  In principle, the excursion programs that are organized from the Larissa Holiday hotel in Konakli do not differ much from those offered from other hotels and resort areas in Turkey. </p><h2>  What do its guests say about the hotel </h2><p>  Reviews of Larissa Holiday Beach Club are quite controversial.  There are guests who would gladly return here again, and there are tourists who do not advise to relax in this hotel.  If you objectively look at all the nuances and aspects of the hotel, relying on the reviews left by travelers on the Internet, we get the following. </p><p>  Pros.  First of all, I would like to note that the hotel is a budget hotel, designed for people choosing a place of rest on the principle of economy.  So if you are trying to save money and do not consider yourself a demanding tourist, then Larisa may well suit you. </p><p>  The main advantage of the complex is its close proximity to the sea, walking to it in calm steps for no more than five minutes.  The beach itself is clean, equipped, there is a bar. </p><p>  The territory of the complex is small, but, according to the guests, is clean and well-groomed, with an abundance of flowers and greenery.  There is a spacious pool with clean water and one water slide. </p><p>  Accommodation at the hotel also practically does not cause any complaints from vacationers. </p><p>  Many put in the positive qualities of the hotel silence and the absence of insects. </p><p>  Opinions are different about food, but the majority of vacationers note that they were not hungry.  As in many four-star hotels in Turkey, the food is standard: a lot of greens, soy semi-finished products, cheese, eggs, sweets.  From meat is chicken, but in limited quantities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelocity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Larisa Holiday&quot; food" class="if uuid-2319482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46724/2319482.jpg"></div><p>  After the restaurant closes, you can have a meal on the beach with french fries and hamburgers.  A nice plus of the hotel is that you can take food away, and in the bar you can give unlimited drinks in one hand.  You can immediately take 5-8 glasses and carry to sunbeds. </p><p>  The staff, especially in the bar and in the dining room, are very pleasant and diligent, they perform their work well. </p><p>  Now about the shortcomings.  Many guests who have chosen the Larissa Holiday Beach Club 4 * hotel for their holidays note the poor condition of its room stock.  People complain about untidy, old furniture and bedding, poor plumbing.  Cleaning, according to almost all tourists, is either done terribly or not at all.  Many guests did not like the fact that salt water flows from the taps in the rooms. </p><p>  Sunset at sea also seemed uncomfortable to some vacationers.  There are many plates near the shore, stones, dirty sand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Konakli beach" class="if uuid-2319454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46724/2319454.jpg"></div><p>  Free internet is only at the reception, and it works very poorly. </p><p>  The road from the airport to the hotel is quite exhausting, it takes about three hours. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize, we can say that the hotel is aimed at thrifty tourists and people who come to rest with children.  It is quiet, calm and comfortable. </p><p>  For those who love an inexpensive beach holiday, Larisa will be a good option.  The price of the hotel is fully consistent with the quality. </p>
