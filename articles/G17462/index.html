    <h2>  Hotels by the sea </h2><p>  5 star Baku hotels: Crescent Beach &amp; Leisure Resort, AF Hotel &amp; Aqua Park, Ramada <span>Baku Beach</span> Hotel - deserve the best reviews.  So, ‚ÄúRamada‚Äù is located on an elevated area just a few steps from the beach.  It is an ideal place for conferences, business meetings, business forums.  A marina, a private beach, outdoor and indoor pools, a fitness center is the Ramada Baku Beach Hotel, located in Ganja, AZ1023. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to tourists, the service is top notch.  The staff speak 3-4 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand are always friendly, ready to fulfill any request.  As for the cuisine, breakfast is so satisfying that there is no need for lunch.  A well-equipped gym, volleyball court, <span>tennis court,</span> small hammam, bar, hammocks, sandy beach with umbrellas and sunbeds will satisfy even the most demanding tourist. </p><p>  Hotels in Baku attract with luxurious beaches and increased comfort.  Crescent Beach &amp; Leisure Resort has its own 400 meters long beach.  There are comfortable sun loungers and bars where you can order a drink for every taste. </p><h2>  Budget AF Hotel &amp; Aqua Park </h2><p>  AF Hotel &amp; Aqua Park is an ideal place to relax with your family.  Here you can breathe plenty of clean air and enjoy the sea.  No wonder this place is considered protected in the Caucasus.  The hotel is located in Novkhany, AZ0119. </p><p>  The hotel is an ideal place for a budget holiday.  Water park, play areas for children, disco in the evening, clear sea - what else is needed for relaxation! </p><h2>  Budget hotels in Baku </h2><p>  Not all hotels are deluxe.  Baku hotels can please holidaymakers with different incomes, but if you have a limited budget, then cheap options can become a solution.  This will help to find a balance between service and cost.  Baku hotels can offer both a luxury option and an economy class with acceptable living conditions.  Guest House Inn, Avand, Like Home, Altstadt are fairly inexpensive hotels in Azerbaijan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku hotels" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40779/1307111.jpg" width="324"></div>

    <p>  What is worth paying attention to when choosing an economic option?  It all depends on the purpose of the trip.  If you are traveling as a tourist, then you should pay attention to the area where the hotel is located.  Hotels in Baku can be located in the business center, in the cultural and historical district or somewhere on the outskirts of the capital, away from the bustle of the city.  Remoteness from the city center is most likely a plus, because you can just enjoy the local flavor, and not visit another megalopolis. </p><p>  Avand Hotel is located just a 5-minute walk from the metro station, which is called May 28, located in the very center of the capital.  Agree that this is not such a bad option.  In general, we can say that Baku hotels will be able to satisfy the needs of any tourist. </p><h2>  Comfortable Guest House Inn </h2><p>  Guest House Inn is located just 500 meters from the most famous beaches of the Black Sea.  This economy class hotel is suitable for tourists who like to spend most of their holidays on the beach and sunbathe. </p>

    <p>  Inexpensive hotels in Baku are inferior to the more prestigious in quality of service or maintenance.
