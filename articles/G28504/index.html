    <p>  I want to say a few words about the <span>layouts</span> themselves <span>.</span>  <span>One-room apartments</span> with an area of ​​45 square meters are represented by classic insulation of the kitchen and bedroom, as well as studios.  In two-room apartments with an area of ​​74 square meters or more, planning solutions with a combined kitchen and living room are also provided - these are the apartments that are most in demand today.  The average three-room apartment is represented by 110 square meters, on which each family member will feel as comfortable as possible.  And here, the developer managed to come to a unified concept: more than 30 meters were reserved for the kitchen-living room, which represents a single space, the rest of the space is divided into two separate bedrooms, each of which is provided with a separate bathroom - an excellent solution for a large and friendly family. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The cost of apartments in Moscow has not surprised anyone for a long time, not everyone can afford to live inside the Moscow Ring Road, especially in a business class complex.  But if you have already paid attention to the residential complex "White Park 2", then you have the necessary amount. The cost per square meter of area starts from 160,000. On this basis, a one-room apartment without finishing can be purchased for 7.2 million rubles. The developer spends shares that provide an opportunity to save, and cooperation with major banks allows you to get a mortgage on favorable terms. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  LCD "White Park 2" was an improved continuation of the first-name project of the same name.  If you can afford an apartment inside the Moscow Ring Road, take a closer look at the project.  For the price that is quite affordable for metropolitan housing, you can purchase a spacious apartment in an ecologically clean area and within walking distance from the necessary infrastructure. </p>
