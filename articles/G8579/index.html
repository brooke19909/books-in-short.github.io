What a bliss it is to cook tiny little things for your beloved little one!  A variety of shawls, overalls, caps and blouses - all this is so cute, so charming! </p><p>  But you can even knit shoes for a baby.  For example, crocheting booties will take very little time, and the little thing can turn out so wonderful that your baby will simply turn into a real princess in homemade knitted boots.  Well, or in the prince - the boys are also pleased to put soft slippers on their legs. </p><p>  To <span>crochet booties</span> brought pleasure not only to the little girl, but also to the craftswoman herself, you should definitely use during their manufacture a detailed description of <span>crocheting booties</span> .  Ways to find out about this mass.  There are a lot of articles in which step-by-step knitting of booties by crocheting is presented for beginner craftswomen on the Internet today, you just have to choose the model that will most interest the needlewoman. </p><p>  It is easiest for a beginner knitter to choose the method where crocheting the booties is done in detail, that is, the sole in the shape of an oval is knitted separately, then the rise is a strip 2 cm wide and the length corresponding to the circumference of the sole, and the upper part of the boot is semi-oval. </p><p>  After all the details are completed, they need to be joined together using a regular thread and needle, or crocheted using a yarn of a different color.  If you use a hook at the connection points not only for practical purposes, but also make lace flounces in these places, this connection method will significantly refresh the model and give it originality. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But you can knit booties according to the same pattern, but with one thread, from the sole immediately proceeding to the lifting stand, and then tie the semi-semi-front end. </p><p>  The second, also quite simple way, suggests starting crocheting booties round the neck with a toe.  To do this, you need to enclose a chain of five air loops in a circle, and in the first and second row from each column, knit two.  In the third row, addition is done in every second column, in the fourth - in every third, and starting from the fifth one should be knitted without additions. </p><p>  You should get half of the knitted oval - it will be worn on the toe of the foot.  When this part begins to cover the entire front of the foot, it will be necessary to replace circular knitting with knitting with a flip of the row on the wrong side.  After the entire size of the booties is only 2 cm in size that does not correspond to the baby‚Äôs leg, it will be possible to finish knitting by reducing the width of the row.  Reduce the number of columns in the middle of the row, knitting one out of three columns. </p><p>  When the bootie is tied, you need to start tying the neck of the slipper, but not round, but so that the incision of the booties collar falls in front.  The neck of the booties can be knitted with a lace using crochets knitted together of three columns and air loops. </p><p>  After the knitting of the booties collar is finished, the edges of the knitted shoe should be highlighted.  It is best to use yarn of a different color for this.  The strapping is done with half columns.  First tie the edging that separates the sole, then separate the upper part of the front. </p><p>  Then you should tie the tie and stretch it through the holes in the openwork collar.  The ties can be made from yarn pompons.  Instead, you can use a satin ribbon or a ribbon of kapron. </p><p>  Imitation of cubs of animals of animals looks beautiful and original.  To do this, on the front of the slippers you need to place eyes - buttons, tie the ears and embroider a smiling mouth.  Eyes can also be bought in special stores where everything is sold for needlework.  Usually they are used to make soft toys. </p>
