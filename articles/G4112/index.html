Sample complaint and form</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Becoming a client of the bank, most of us expect to receive an unsurpassed service inspired by advertising.  However, instead of a smiling young lady offering coffee and a magazine with news, many often receive arrogant and frivolous student managers with a dubious reputation.  Even more often you can hear unflattering reviews addressed to you by employees of the call center, credit and even the operations department.  Although, it would seem, everyone is obliged to ‚Äúcircle‚Äù the client and give him appropriate compliments.  And this concerns not only small financial organizations, but also banks with experience.  A striking example is Sberbank.  What to do in such a situation?  Who to contact?  And where to complain about Sberbank? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about sberbank" class="if uuid-1573623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573623.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúDo you have a plan, Mr. Fix?‚Äù </h2><p>  Before you do anything, remember that a complaint is a very significant tool in the fight for your rights.  That's just to act with its presentation and design is very prudent and skillful.  Therefore, to the question from the famous Australian animated series "80 Days Around the World" you should already have a clear action plan. </p><p>  To begin with, weigh the pros and cons, think about whether it is worth complaining at all.  Are you sure you didn‚Äôt act emotionally?  Have your rights really been violated, or were you the initiator of the conflict?  Do not forget that even in court they listen to both participants in the incident.  Therefore, mentally answer these questions and scroll the whole situation back.  If your rights were really violated, you need to find out where to complain about Sberbank employees.  So what are the options in this case? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about the Savings Bank of Russia" class="if uuid-1573618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573618.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  Where to go: options </h2><p>  There are several instances where you can really ask for help.  One of them is Sberbank itself.  Representatives of this organization still understand their dependence on customer loyalty. </p><p>  After all, it is precisely the positive reviews about the work of a financial institution that shape its reputation.  Moreover, in this situation it does not matter at all what kind of client this is - an individual or a representative of a large corporation.  Therefore, the bank has a whole service responsible for monitoring the opinions of customers, and employees to quickly respond to problems and conflicts. </p><p>  If you are not satisfied with the service, you can contact the bank in one of the following ways. </p><p>  1. Call the contact center: </p><p>  - <noindex>  to 900 - free of charge from a mobile phone in Russia </noindex>  ; </p><p>  - <noindex>  to the number +7 495 500-55-50 - from anywhere in the world, the cost of the call - at the rate of your service provider </noindex>  ; </p><p>  - <noindex>  from the Sberbank Online mobile application - an internet call is free if your phone is connected to Wi-Fi, a call via mobile Internet is charged at the operator‚Äôs rate. </noindex></p><p><noindex>  2. Write on the feedback page on the bank's website. </noindex></p><p><noindex>  3. Write in the ‚ÄúDialogs‚Äù service in the Sberbank Online mobile application </noindex>  : </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  4. Contact the bank office convenient for you. </p><p><noindex>  An appeal can also be submitted through the Central Bank, as well as other instances.  However, sending an application directly to Sberbank has several advantages: </noindex></p><ul><li>  The answer will be prepared faster. </li><li>  The principles of decision-making do not change depending on the channel of circulation: even when applying through the Central Bank, the same uniform established procedures will still apply as when applying directly to a financial institution. </li><li>  You can send the necessary documents and track the status of the application on the Sberbank website or through your Sberbank Online account.  You do not have to go to the bank office or other organizations. </li><li>  If you disagree with the answer, you can contact the Ombudsman‚Äôs service, which reports directly to the president of the bank and double-checks the legality of the previous decision. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about the employees of Sberbank" class="if uuid-1573636" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573636.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  How to complain through the official website of the bank? </h2><p>  In order to tell the bank representatives about the problem, you must perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  go to the official website of the bank, in the "Feedback" section; </li><li>  indicate the purpose and reason for contacting; </li><li>  describe the situation in detail; </li><li>  specify contact information. </li></ul><p>  This is where you can complain about Sberbank of Russia without leaving your home.  The main advantage of this treatment is that you do not need to go anywhere.  And the answer to your complaint will come in the way you specified. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to fill out an application form? </h2><p>  When filling out this form, the following data should be indicated: </p><ul><li>  whether you are a private or <span>corporate client</span> ; </li><li>  purpose of the appeal (for example, a complaint about incorrect behavior of employees of the branch ‚Ññ8 of Moscow); </li><li>  reason for contact (here you can select "service" or "other"); </li><li>  describe the essence of the problem as concisely and accurately as possible; </li><li>  Contact details. </li></ul><p>  At the end of the form, you can <span>attach a file</span> with evidence of your innocence.  For example, if negligence or mistreatment occurred during correspondence with a representative of the bank's online support.  This appeal will certainly go to the customer service quality service, where it is not only possible, but necessary, to complain about the work of Sberbank. </p><h2>  Important Points to Remember When Handling </h2><p>  Leaving your complaint with the help of feedback, you can always control at what stage it is being considered.  This can be done thanks to the individual number that is assigned to your appeal.  If there is no reaction from the bank, you can also repeat the appeal, indicating the number of the complaint and the fact of its repeated sending. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about Sberbank in Moscow" class="if uuid-1573616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573616.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  Contacting branch management directly </h2><p>  Each client who contacted the bank should know where to complain about Sberbank employees.  For example, their superior management is an excellent lever of influence on negligent employees.  It can be addressed to him.  Additionally, it makes sense to make an entry in the complaint book, which is available in each branch. </p><p>  By analogy, you can always send a registered version of the complaint with a registered letter to the address: Moscow, 117997, st.  Vavilova, d.19 (central office of Sberbank).  Moreover, the letter must be written in the name of the president and <span>chairman of the board</span> Gref German Oskarovich.  It is in his competence to encourage or bring to disciplinary and material liability employees of a credit institution.  The appeal itself must be written in the generally accepted form, valid for all claims.  An example can be seen below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about the employees of Sberbank" class="if uuid-1573617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573617.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  How to report a problem to the hotline? </h2><p>  Sometimes leaders themselves take part in a problem with <span>incorrect behavior</span> or treatment.  In this case, you should complain about them.  You can do this, for example, by calling the bank‚Äôs hotline: +7 (495) 500-55-50 (you should dial ‚Äú900‚Äù from your mobile phone). </p><h2>  We are writing a complaint review about the work of the bank </h2><p>  Have not decided yet where to complain about <span>Sberbank in Moscow?</span>  Want to focus on the negative aspects in the work of a financial organization?  Alternatively, write a negative review with a concise description of the problem and post it on otzovik sites, credit forums, or portals.  For example, one of the largest such sites is banki.ru.  But remember that when writing a complaint, you can not insult the bank.  Otherwise, your review will be deleted.  What will it give you? </p><p>  First, these resources are often reviewed by the banks themselves.  As a result, they quickly respond to outrage and help resolve the situation or ignore it altogether.  Secondly, there are many users on such sites.  They are looking for information about loans and other products.  Based on the results of your recall, they may decide not to contact this branch at all.  Or you can find like-minded people who also faced a similar problem.  And this is a collective complaint.  Consequently, there is a greater chance that representatives of a financial institution will react to it. </p><h2>  When no methods help </h2><p>  But where to complain about Sberbank, if the situation with your claims has not been resolved for a long time, and the appeals were ignored?  In this case, you can contact the Central Bank directly.  In this case, the complaint should be written in two copies, one of which will be sent to the bank, and the second to the regulator.  The main purpose of this appeal is to attract the attention of the Central Bank to the problem.  And also you will show Sberbank the seriousness of its intentions to bring the claim to its logical resolution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="where to complain about the work of Sberbank" class="if uuid-1573626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/1573626.jpg?1562753015"></div><h2>  Where to complain about Sberbank: go to extreme measures </h2><p>  And when no measures help, at the last stage, enlist the support of a professional lawyer and feel free to sue.  But remember that for this action: </p><ul><li>  the situation really needs to be serious; </li><li>  You must be sure that you are right; </li><li>  You have real evidence of a violation of your rights (photos, screenshots of correspondence, audio recording of calls, etc.). </li></ul><p>  And of course, do not forget that the losing party pays the legal costs.  Yes, and the trial itself may drag on for a long time, which is fraught with additional financial costs. </p>
