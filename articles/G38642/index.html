Their kinship is due to historical origin and certain stages of territorial settlement.  In other words, the Slavic peoples are considered fraternal, because this fact is a historical reality.  Today, there are many archaeological finds confirming the theory of kinship of all Slavic peoples.  But there are multinational states that propagate the ideology of ‚Äúone-people‚Äù of completely different in essence communities. </p><p>  As we know, Russians have their historical kinship from the Eastern Slavs, but all other peoples living in the territory of modern Russia, along with Russian, are considered fraternal.  In the article we will try to find out why the peoples of Russia are fraternal. </p><h2>  Empire Times </h2><p>  In 1721, Tsar <span>Peter the Great</span> became the All-Russian Emperor.  From this moment begins a completely new chapter in the history of the country. </p>

    <p>  By the indicated historical moment, many small states in their size were part of the Russian Empire.  As its combat power grew, many peoples submitted to the Empire.  Thus, by the end of the 19th century, Russia had a colossal number of communities that were not Slavs.  It should be noted that many nations have remained part of Russia today.  Ethnic minorities brought much to the Empire‚Äôs culture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was clear that combat power depended on the number of soldiers, so the Russian Empire tried to conquer as many territories as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fraternal peoples of Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/729861.jpg" width="507"></div>  This indicates that the fraternal peoples of Russia, as they are commonly called today, have been coexisting for many years.  They not only contacted each other, but also collaborated as they participated in the life of the state.  This explains why all the peoples of Russia are called fraternal.

    <h2>  Ideological consolidation </h2><p>  The kinship of completely different in essence peoples was significantly entrenched in the ideology of Soviet power of the 20th century.  In the days of the <span>USSR, the slogan</span> that ‚Äúfraternal peoples are united‚Äù was chanted everywhere.  Thus, the top of the Soviet regime wanted to strengthen internal stability and create a completely new social formation - the Soviet people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fraternal Slavic peoples" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/728416.jpg" width="600"></div>  At the same time, ethnic characteristics were not taken into account.  All were considered equal to each other.  Such a policy in many respects paid off, because during the times of the USSR, questions of ethnic and <span>racial discrimination were</span> practically not raised <span>,</span> there were no clashes between different communities.  All citizens really considered themselves "Soviet brothers."

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The problem was that the USSR was a <span>totalitarian state,</span> so all <span>political activity was</span> carried out with <span>human rights violations.</span>  In fact, people could not freely learn the traditions and culture of their people, because the country was ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù.  However, this fact does not help answer the question of why all the peoples of Russia are called fraternal. </p><h2>  Modern ethnic state policy </h2><p>  Today, the political course of the Russian government is directed towards the democratization of ethnic issues.  In modern Russia, freedom is given for self-knowledge of one‚Äôs ethnic origin, culture and traditions of the native people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fraternal peoples are one" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26556/728411.jpg" width="550"></div>  Nevertheless, the Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to maintain the unity of all peoples.  This is done to maintain social stability within the state.  Certain territorial, economic and political interests make it possible to understand why all the peoples of Russia are called fraternal. <strong> </strong>  It all comes down to the presence of state interest and to ensure a long stay within the territory of one country.

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, in the article we found out why all the peoples of Russia are called fraternal.  The reason for this is economic, political and territorial factors.  In this case, the time during which the Russian peoples were part of one territorial unit plays a role.  Thus, the fraternal Slavic peoples have a historical relationship, and the Russian - territorial and political. </p>
