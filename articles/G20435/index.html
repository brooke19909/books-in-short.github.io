Make it at home easier than ever, with minimal sewing skills, a set of materials and tools, and a little patience.  There are several types of dressings: crocheted or knitted, with fixing elastic and satin ribbons.  Each of them is interesting in its own way and performs different functions. </p><h2>  How to make a headband with your own hands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headband child" class="if uuid-2281315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281315.jpg"></div><p>  A knitted accessory not only holds the hair, but also warms in cool weather, and also protects the ears from the wind.  To make a headband with your own hands, you will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  skein; </li><li>  knitting needles or hook; </li><li>  large sewing needle. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ready-made headband" class="if uuid-2281314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281314.jpg"></div><p>  You can knit with any pattern that you like: dense or loose, openwork, use only one color of yarn or take several different ones.  Measure the volume of the head.  Subtract a couple of centimeters from the resulting figure, it is necessary that the finished dressing fits snugly and does not fall off the head.  Tie a strip with a width of 5-10 cm: for a little girl, five will be enough, and for an adult it is better to make it wider - 10 or even 12 cm. It remains to sew the edges from the wrong side and the headband with your own hands is ready! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Woolen headband" class="if uuid-2281311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281311.jpg"></div><h2>  How to decorate a bandage </h2><p>  You can wear it this way, but it‚Äôs better to add some decorative elements to make the accessory look more interesting and individual.  Intercept the central part with a thread, pull and securely fix the ends from the wrong side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself headband: manufacturing steps" class="if uuid-2281312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281312.jpg"></div><p>  Sew a beautiful button, bead, bow on the front side, rhinestones can also be glued.  Choose a jewelry that will be in harmony with other clothes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Handmade wool headband" class="if uuid-2281316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281316.jpg"></div><p>  Please note, if you do a bandage on your head with your own hands for a girl, all elements must be securely fixed so as not to harm the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Elastic Bandage </h2><p>  Another variety of knitted headbands with their own hands is intended more for beauty than for heat.  To work, you will need: </p><ul><li>  yarn; </li><li>  knitting needles or hook; </li><li>  sewing needle and thread; </li><li>  flat elastic 2-3 cm wide. </li></ul><p>  First, measure the circumference of the head and subtract 7 centimeters from the resulting figure.  Tie a strip 2-4 cm wide in any way convenient for you: knitting or crocheting.  The pattern on the bandage can also be anything you like, it all depends on your taste, imagination and knitting skills.  Then cut a small piece of gum 5 cm long, gently burn the edges with a lighter so that they do not open.  Sew the edges of the gum and knitted fabric firmly so that the visible seam remains on the wrong side.  For reliability, several parallel joints can be laid.  Now fasten the thread from the inside, cut the tip and twist the bandage on the front side.  New accessory is ready! </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Making a headband" class="if uuid-2281319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281319.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not like to knit, you can make a satin bandage on your head from a ribbon with your own hands.  To do this, just cut the tape of the desired length, singe the edges so that the threads do not fall apart, and then tuck inward 1 cm and sew manually or on a machine.  Sew the elastic as described above. </p><h2>  Flower decoration </h2><p>  To decorate the bandage, you can use artificial flowers bought in the store, made independently of multi-colored felt or ribbons, but the decor associated with the same method as the bandage‚Äôs cloth looks the most harmonious.  To make knitted flowers and leaflets, you will need yarn of several colors and a drop of inspiration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorative elements" class="if uuid-2281317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281317.jpg"></div><p>  Tie 4-5 or more flowers of different sizes, as well as several green leaves.  Think over the composition in advance and lay out the trial version on a knitted fabric.  Lightly fasten the decorative elements with a thread or a pin and put a bandage on your head: in this position, it is best to evaluate how beautiful the composition looks and whether it is comfortable to wear.  If necessary, make changes and try again.  Now securely sew the flowers with matching threads and you can put on a new thing! </p><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Girl in a bandage with flowers" class="if uuid-2281318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281318.jpg"></div><h2>  Elastic bandage </h2><p>  If the bandage is needed not for decoration, but for comfort, just to remove hair from the face, you can make an accessory from an ordinary flat elastic band.  To do this, measure the volume of the head and subtract 3 cm from the resulting amount. Cut off the desired piece of elastic, singe the edges, and then sew with threads in tone.  Instead of thread with a needle, you can use hot glue.  It quickly hardens, has a transparent texture, holds firmly and reliably.  Choose the color of the elastic tape at your discretion: white, black, to match the hair or brighter, for example, red, raspberry, orange. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fabric headband" class="if uuid-2281333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281333.jpg"></div><p>  This accessory can be worn at home while cleaning, put on in the bathroom or while applying makeup.  To make the elastic rim look more interesting, you can fix a bow on it, an artificial flower made of ribbons or felt, add beads, rhinestones and other decorations. </p><h2>  Bandage with ribbons </h2><p>  A simple elastic bandage made of wide elastic can be decorated and worn as a stylish accessory.  To do this, take a tape 2 cm wide. Using hot-melt adhesive, attach the edge of the tape to the elastic from the wrong side next to the seam.  Wrap the tape around the gum, glueing each revolution from the inside out.  Made from scratch with your own hands, headbands made of ribbons look unusual, hold hair securely and last a very long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself headband made of ribbon" class="if uuid-2281340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64598/2281340.jpg"></div><p>  To make a beautiful decoration at home requires very little: thread with a needle, knitting needles or crochet hook, a piece of elastic, as well as a little patience and inspiration.  A do-it-yourself hair band can become not only a beautiful accessory, but also a wonderful gift for a friend, mother, or other woman dear to you.  A simple accessory in which you have enclosed a piece of soul will please them much more than banal cards. </p>
