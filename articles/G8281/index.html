    <p>  A.P. was born  Maresyev May 7, 1916 in the small town of Kamyshin, Kamyshin district in the Russian Empire.  His father's name was Pyotr Avdeevich Maresyev, and his mother was Ekaterina Nikitichna.  Little information has been preserved about Alexei‚Äôs father.  It is only known that he died when the future hero was only three years old.  Mother had to raise her three sons.  Of course, it was difficult for a young widow to feed, dress, and have to raise children, however, judging by the results of her labors, she did a great job of it.  There was usually not enough money in the family, so they lived modestly.  Ekaterina Nikitichna worked as a cleaner at a woodworking factory.  When the sons, Peter, Alexei and Nikolai, grew up, they helped the mother with the housework and tried their best to support her. </p><h2>  Study </h2>

    <p>  Upon reaching the age of seven, Alexei Petrovich Maresyev, whose biography teaches courage and <span>fortitude,</span> went to a comprehensive school in his native town.  After her graduation, he entered the school, where he studied metal turning and went to work at the same factory where his mother worked. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, young Alexei did not have a soul in the turning business.  In his thoughts, he always painted for himself an incomprehensible sky and dreamed of flying like a bird.  From childhood, the future pilot Maresyev was very stubborn and purposeful.  Inspired by dreams of heaven, he sent his documents to the flight school twice, but for the first and second time he was refused.  The reason for the refusal was severe malaria suffered by Alexei in childhood.  Because of this disease, the young man developed rheumatism at a young age, and his immunity was pretty much undermined. </p><p>  In 1934, at the age of 18, the guy was sent to the construction of the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur.  There, a young man, in addition to his main job, begins to engage in an aero club.  Dreams of heaven never left him.  In 1937, he was able to face the height of blue skies.  This year A.P.  Maresyev was drafted into the Red Army.  First, he served on Sakhalin in an aviation border detachment, and then enrolled in an aviation school.  From that moment began the path to the dream that Alexey Petrovich Maresyev had cherished for so long.  His biography has changed dramatically. </p><h2>  War </h2>

    <p>  Unfortunately, clouds are also found on a cloudless sky.  So, in 1939, a young pilot, being an instructor in Bataisk, met the Second World War in an aviation school.  Already in the summer of 1941 he was sent to the military fighter regiment.  For the first time, Maresyev‚Äôs plane flew into battle in August 1941.  During the fighting, the pilot Maresyev heroically rushed into an air attack and fearlessly rushed at the enemy, showing miracles of courage.  In less than six months, Aleksey shot down 4 enemy fighters, but once an enemy machine gun caught up and shot down Maresyev‚Äôs plane.  This happened in early April 1942.  Being conscious, but being badly wounded, the pilot was forced to urgently land the car.  With mutilated legs, the hero was alone on an unfamiliar land.  However, despite the pain and fear, Maresyev Alexei Petrovich, whose biography is an example for every defender of the Motherland, was not going to give up death.  Eating bark of trees, plants, berries and cones, the wounded pilot crawled, bleeding, bleeding for 18 days to the front line.  When he had completely lost hope of salvation, two children found him, bloodied and exhausted, not far from the village.  The boys called for help from the elders.  Maresyev was taken to the village and settled in one of the houses.  Kind people did their best to help the soldier and save his life.  He was soon taken to a hospital in critical condition.  The damage was very serious.  Maresyev began gangrene and sepsis.  None of the doctors undertook to operate it.  The surgeon Terebinsky saved the pilot from death.  Maresyev had to amputate two legs to his knees, but his life was saved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Despite his disability, Alexei Petrovich did not give up, but decided to fight to the end.  It is hard to imagine, but this pilot, being a cripple, achieved a return to the front.  After being wounded, he continued to fly and shoot down enemy planes.  After returning to duty, he shot down seven German fighters.  In this he was helped by prostheses, on which Maresyev not only learned to walk and fly, but also to dance a waltz!  For his courage and valor, he received many awards, as well as the title ‚ÄúHero of the Soviet Union‚Äù.  Maresyev A.P.  - This is an example of incredible courage and amazing striving for victory. </p><h2>  Post-war time </h2><p>  After the war, the hero of our article worked as an instructor at the school of the Air Force.  He always kept fit.  Swim, skate, ski, bike.  He set a personal swimming record and swam the Volga near Kuibyshev (2.2 km) in 55 minutes. </p><p>  Such willpower and zeal for life can only be envied.  Alexei Maresyev became the idol of his students, many pilots and just civilians.  Biography and his feat formed the basis of B. Polevoy's book "The Tale of a Real Man."  He was invited to many events and was known in almost every house.  They told about it to children at school and set an example for the younger generation. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Maresyev A.P. was married.  Wife Galina gave birth to two sons: Victor and Alexei.  Victor became a motoring engineer, but Alexei, unfortunately, was disabled since childhood.  The family lived quite peacefully and happily. </p><h2>  Awards </h2>
