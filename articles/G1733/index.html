Most are for downhill skiing, but cross-country skiers will not be disappointed either.  Jumps are made for jumping.  In addition to skiing and snowboarding, tourists will be offered many other winter activities. </li><li>  <em>Wanlun.</em>  This is a young resort, but quite popular.

    <p>  Be sure to sign up for guided tours of Hainan Island in January.  China is rich in attractions.  You can see: </p><ul><li>  monkey island; </li><li>  a fleet of butterflies brought from all over the world; </li><li>  deer nursery "Luhuitou", which translates as "deer turned his head"; </li><li>  <span>Nanshan Center for Buddhism,</span> over which stands a statue of the goddess of mercy 108 meters high; </li><li>  the ethnographic village of the indigenous peoples of the skeleton - and Miao; </li><li>  Hainan Museum with a unique ancient exposition; </li><li>  Dongshan Natural Park, where you can see lions, tigers, ostriches, black swans, monkeys, crocodiles and other animals in their natural environment; </li><li>  Thermal pools "Pearl River Nantian". </li></ul><p>  In fact, this is not a complete list.  As you can see, you definitely won’t be bored. </p><h2>  Exploring Attractions </h2><p>  However, you can see a lot of interesting things in other parts of the country.  Holidays in China in January are great for visiting local attractions.  Entrance tickets are cheaper, fewer tourists.  True, national parks can open later than in the main season, and buses do not go so often, but you can adapt to this. </p>

    <p>  It is better to choose big cities and those parts of the country where the climate is quite mild.  Tibet, for example, is not suitable for a winter pilgrimage due to low temperatures and unheated hotels.  It will be much more comfortable to travel to: </p><ul><li>  Beijing, where you can admire the snow-covered Chinese wall, enter the Forbidden City, see many parks, temples, museums. </li><li>  Hong Kong, where in January you can shop with big discounts, as well as enjoy the views of the modern metropolis, bow to the Big Buddha and personally count all 10,000 Buddhas in the monastery of the same name. </li><li>  Guangzhou, where you can see 123 historical sights, as well as feel the special Chinese flavor of an industrial city. </li></ul><h2>  Festivals and Holidays </h2><p>  If you travel to China in January, then keep in mind: January 1 is not customary to celebrate here on a grand scale, as in European countries.  Of course, you can enjoy an amazingly beautiful salute against the background of the Lost City in Beijing at exactly 24:00, but it is much more interesting to be in the country for the Chinese New Year.  It is celebrated on the first day of the new moon.  It can occur in late January or early February.  This is a noisy holiday when thousands of firecrackers and fireworks soar into the sky, and traditional red lanterns are lit everywhere.  On the squares you can see theatrical performances, concerts.  Fun lasts for 15 days. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  What do travelers who have already visited China in January say?  First of all, you should not rely on good weather and beach holidays.  Those who prefer to splash around in the sea and bask in the hot sun should choose a different region.  Even in Hainan, a windbreaker will be required in the evening, and in the central and northern provinces, a waterproof jacket, hat and scarf are indispensable. </p><p>  But the cost of rest is pleasantly pleasing.  At this time, you can see numerous attractions at very affordable prices.  Experienced travelers are advised to visit the southern provinces, where winters are quite mild, as well as large cities, where you can always warm up in a cafe or shopping center.  A lot of excitement is caused by the <span>Chinese baths,</span> visiting thermal springs.  And of course, ski enthusiasts praise steep slopes and mountain peaks. </p><p>  If you are looking for vivid emotions, colorful landscapes, exotic traditions - go to China.  In January, it receives the most seasoned and hardy tourists.  Those who are not afraid of dampness and cold winds.  Those who are always open to the new and ready to go on a journey towards the unknown. </p>
