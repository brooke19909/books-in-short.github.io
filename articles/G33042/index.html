    <h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  The lake changes its external characteristics depending on the weather.  So, on a rainy, gloomy day, Lake Jack London (photo of the reservoir shown above) becomes gloomy and gray.  But if the sun comes out, it turns into a real blue pearl, and it seems that this is the most delightful place in the Far East.  Now this territory is a natural park, which is supervised by the <span>Magadan Reserve.</span> </p><p>  The lake itself stretched for 10 km in a northwest direction.  This cold pool has a maximum depth of 50 meters.  The majestic lake is fed by the Purga River and several streams, two of them are called Studeny and Unknown.  The latter, flowing many mountain kilometers, connects the lake with the Kolyma River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Natural surroundings </h2><p>  Jack of London Lake is surrounded by many smaller lakes.  Among them there are very remarkable.  These are the lakes Gray Seagull, Dream, Invisible, Anemone, Neighboring and Kudinovskoe.  This entire group of reservoirs is located in a mountain depression, and therefore a fascinating landscape from mountain ranges looms around them. </p>

    <p>  But still, among this wealth there is another lake, which in its beauty and depth resembles lake.  Jack London.  This is Dancing Grayling.  These two pools are interconnected by a duct of Options. </p><p>  In this mountainous area, near Lake Jack of London, there is Aboriginal Peak.  This is the highest point in the area, reaching 2586 m. </p><p>  The mountain slopes are covered with lichen glades, cedar dwarf forests and rare-standing larch forests.  Such beauty in places reaches a height of 1100 meters, and mountain tundra has grown above the forest borders.  There are also gravelly deserts outside the forest land. </p><h2>  Weather </h2>

    <p>  The area has a cold, <span>sharply continental climate.</span>  Winter is long and summer is too short.  Warm days only come for a couple of weeks.  The real winter begins here in October, by January frosts drop to -33 <sup> </sup>  ° C.  Strong snowstorms periodically occur.  Precipitation falls unevenly, and huge caps of snow appear on the eastern slopes, so an avalanche can come off here at any moment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Lake Jack of London is covered with ice in October, and the crust can hold out until the end of June.  Winter lasts until the May days, until it starts to snow.  At the same time, even in summer, the air remains cool.  In July, the average temperature is only 12 degrees, and the hottest days can show a mark of 20 on the thermometer <sup> </sup>  ° C.  Sometimes it rains and floods begin.  Already at the end of summer, frost begins and snow breaks. </p><h2>  Is it possible to relax on the lake </h2><p>  Since Jack London Lake in the Magadan Region is incredibly beautiful, the Yagodninsky authorities are thinking about how to make these lands more civilized so that tourists can come here.  But while only the bravest ones come here, who want to touch the wild, harsh nature, which Jack London wrote about in books.  In winter, you can ski here, and so the rest is more likely passive. </p>

    <p>  On the neighboring lake of Dancing Grayling there is a “Fighting” camp, it is intended for vacationers.  For guests, the director of the base can melt the bath.  In addition, on the lake.  Jack London has the island of Vera, where the weather station is located.  You can also go there for a visit.  Employees are very happy to take vacationers to their yards, because, apart from the radio, they have no other connection with the world. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Most often, people come to Jack London Lake not to relax, but to go fishing.  As a rule, these are residents of the area and nearby mines.  Siberian char and East Siberian grayling are found in these reservoirs.  Especially large fish lives in Lake.  Jack London, ten-year-olds gain a kilogram of weight.  Interestingly, for spawning, these fish choose not only streams, but also a sand and pebble bottom near the shores of the lake. </p><h2>  How did the name of the lake </h2><p>  The lake with an unusual name raises the same question for guests and tourists: "Where does he get such a beautiful name?"  The answer will depend on who is given it.  Old-timers say that the discoverers of this reservoir on the shore found the book "Martin Eden," written by Jack London. </p>

    <p>  But geologists tell a completely different version of the appearance of such a name.  Almost all scholars in these parts liked to read the works of J. London.  The first geological expedition to Kolyma thought that they call one of the natural objects the name of their beloved writer.  So, P.I. Skornyakov, who worked in 1932 near this picturesque lake, named him Jack London. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Since Lake Jack of London (Russia) is located near the village of Yagodnoye, the first thing to do is make the way to this settlement.  You need to go along the Kolyma highway.  But, unfortunately, she is in a broken state.  This road was built by prisoners in the late 30s.  It was necessary to connect the two "sleeves" of the Kolyma highway and shorten the path from the mine.  Until the 60s, the highway was actively operated, but as soon as vehicles began to drive along it less often, no one was repairing it. </p><p>  In addition, reaching the village, you have to drive another 70 km to the lake.  There is a broken track left from this road.  That is why there are not so many tourists in these parts, because you can only go by your own transport.  But few people sacrifice their car, because after the trip they will definitely need repairs.  It also happens that in rainy weather cars break down into a cliff.  If the weather has turned bad on the street, you can spend the whole daylight on the road from Yagodnoye to the lake.  Only a four-wheel drive car can handle such a trip, but on condition that it is dry on the street. </p>
