    <p>  Phone "Lenovo S660" is a fairly compact device.  The size of the device is slightly smaller than usual due to the screen of 4.7 inches.  A slight decrease in the diagonal made it possible to make a gadget comfortable to use.  The user can work with the device even with one hand. </p><p>  The material of the case has undergone drastic changes.  In Lenovo S660, aluminum replaced plastic.  This solution significantly increased the smartphone's resistance to scratches and dents.  Of course, if you want to damage the device, it will not be difficult, but the metal saves from accidental injuries. </p><p>  In such an interesting case material there are also disadvantages.  The surface of the smartphone incredibly quickly collects fingerprints.  Naturally, wiping the phone is not difficult, but it is unpleasant. </p><p>  Due to the metal, the device looks solid and pretty stylish.  Although there are no special changes in appearance, the highlight in the device is definitely present. </p><p>  The front side placed a display, sensors, camera, speaker, touch buttons and logo on it.  On the right side is the volume control and the power button.  The back side got a logo, a main camera, a speaker, a flash and a microphone.  The top end has become a haven for the headphone jack, and the bottom is reserved for USB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, the device has an interesting appearance.  The build quality is not satisfactory, and the durability of the device at altitude.  It is a suitable design for an entertaining smartphone. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Equipped with "C660" screen only 4.7 inches.  Quite a strange solution for a company that equips even budget devices with a large size.  An unpleasant fact will be the low resolution.  Smartphone "Lenovo S660" has a total of 960 by 540 pixels.  This is an incredibly low feature and is more suitable for phones with four inches.  Accordingly, pixels are visible even with the naked eye. </p><p>  The IPS matrix of the smartphone brightens the situation somewhat.  The screen on the Lenovo S660 is quite bright, which ensures high-quality work in the sun.  There is also a manual and automatic adjustment of the display.  In addition to brightness, the device boasts a high viewing angle. </p><p>  Despite the entertaining direction of the series, this representative received not the best screen settings.  According to the characteristics, even budget representatives of the ‚ÄúA‚Äù category win the C660. </p><p>  That's what the manufacturer took care of protecting the display.  The apparatus was equipped with <span>Gorilla Glass.</span>  You can not be afraid of scratches and damage to the screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  I got "Lenovo S660" familiar to low-cost models of 8 megapixels.  An acceptable camera for a budget employee looks rather strange in a more expensive series.  The resolution 3264 by 2448 also worsens the impression. All the characteristics speak of the average quality of the images, but things are much worse. </p><p>  In fact, the device takes photos that are expected more from a five-megapixel camera.  The device lacks sharpness, but the noise is in excess.  The "Lenovo S660" setting will not solve the problem either.  The user will have to forget about night photos, because the pictures are incredibly bad. </p><p>  A similar situation happened with video recording.  The shooting takes place in HD-quality, but the result is disappointing.  The camcorder has the same problems as the photo. </p><p>  Poor implementation of the main camera does not give hope for a front camera.  The phone has a peephole of only 0.3 megapixels and is suitable only for video calls.  You should not expect more from the front-end. </p><h2>  Filling </h2>

    <p>  The strongest side of Lenovo S660 is the hardware.  The company equipped the phone with a MTK processor commonplace for the Chinese.  Naturally, the Snapdragon would be the best choice for an advanced model, but the Chinese have taken the path of saving.  The processor has four cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  Although there are no doubts about the performance of the filling, similar parameters are present in many state employees of the company.  There is a feeling that the "C660" is not in its series. </p><p>  The smartphone has a gigabyte of RAM.  This amount of memory is enough to maximize the potential of the device.  The combined efforts of the RAM and the processor allow the "C660" to easily solve a lot of problems. </p><p>  Another parameter will not especially please the owners of Lenovo "S660".  We are talking about 8 GB of native memory.  Unfortunately, the user will be able to use only 6 GB.  The remaining memory is allocated for Android.  You can increase the memory with a 32 GB card. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Since the device belongs to the entertainment series ‚ÄúS‚Äù, the appropriate battery is installed.  The battery capacity is 3000 maH, which is enough for long-term operation. </p><p>  Active use of the gadget will drain the charge in about 6-7 hours.  Not bad for a functional <span>Lenovo S660.</span>  Adjusting the screen brightness and turning off unnecessary processes will significantly increase the duration of the work. </p><p>  The smartphone does not suffer from a lack of battery capacity, this contributes to the economical filling.  Most of the charge will be spent solely on the display. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The device works under the guidance of the already obsolete Android 4.2.2.  The system is designed by Vibe UI with installed applications.  Some programs will come in handy.  If the question arises, how to take a screenshot on the Lenovo S660, additional applications will help. </p><p>  For "C660" there are more modern versions of the system.  Updating Android can be done either with FOTA or with <span>custom firmware.</span> </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  You don‚Äôt have to wait for special frills from the speaker.  The sound for the device running on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is quite acceptable and does not cause a negative.  The headset that comes with the kit does not suit almost anything.  The user will be forced to change headphones to get high-quality sound. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device works with 2G and 3G, and the quality of communication is quite high.  Also, the device supports 2 SIM cards.  Unfortunately, when making calls, one of the cards is turned off, since there is only one radio module in the smartphone. </p><p>  The phone supports Wi-Fi, bluetooth and GPS.  Unfortunately, the phone does not have OTG. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  You can become the owner of "C660" for about 9 thousand rubles.  Given the characteristics of the device, the price is definitely overpriced.  Some representatives from the ‚ÄúA‚Äù series have brighter parameters and lower cost. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The most painful place of the device is its display, and this is noted by many.  Visible pixels definitely don't cheer up the user.  Despite the IPS matrix and <span>protective glass,</span> more important characteristics are not encouraging. </p><p>  A weak camera is another drawback of the phone that buyers point to.  Even under ideal conditions and the great efforts of the owner, the picture may turn out bad.  The reason for this, of course, is the small resolution and 8 megapixel camera.  Such decisions as tuning the Lenovo S660 will not bring any special results. </p><p>  An irrelevant version of the system is also not a pleasant thing.  The need for updates baffles a ton of users.  Without experience in firmware, it will be difficult to update the device. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The advantage of "C660" is the productive filling.  The phone is really powerful and will cope even with demanding games, gamers appreciated it.  The hitch will arise in 3D applications, but a decrease in quality will solve the problem. </p><p>  It is worth paying tribute to the amazing appearance.  In addition to the fact that the phone is well assembled, the device has a stylish design, which was appreciated by the owners. </p><p>  Autonomy of the device is the main feature of the series.  The capacitive battery allows you not to worry about the state of charge. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The smartphone was not the most successful.  The device "C660" with a detailed comparison is inferior even to some state employees "Lenovo" in characteristics and cost.  A lot of shortcomings, as well as overpriced, do not create much attractiveness. </p>
