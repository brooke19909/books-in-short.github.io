This place is a dream of poets and romantics.  Granada is built on three hills - Sabica, Albayzin and Sancromonte.  The city is located on the slopes of the mountains with the magnificent name of Sierra Nevada.  In this village, residents lead a quiet, leisurely and measured life.  Even today, when the 21st century stands outside the windows, on the stone-paved streets of Granada you can meet pack donkeys, which are accompanied by drovers.  For eight consecutive centuries, the city was influenced by Arabs.  That is why Granada (the sights are evidence of this) owes its architectural and cultural heritage to this people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granada sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/560261.jpg" width="600"></div>

These are traditional instruments that sound during the performance of flamenco.  The most stunning dance carnivals can be seen in the caves of Sacromonte.  This is the name of the district, which is located on the hill of the same name.  It is known for its whitewashed houses on narrow winding streets and caves that were dug several centuries ago.  <span>Granada,</span> whose <span>sights</span> are mainly made up of ancient buildings and structures, is a traditional habitat for gypsies.  They have been living here since the 16th century and are mainly located in Sacromonte.  Among the caves there are those in which you can live in peace, enjoying all the achievements of modern civilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Granada always hosts a huge number of cultural events - these are festivals of dance and music, film and jazz, theater and tango.

    <h2>  Main attraction </h2><p>  The most famous place in Granada is the Alhambra Palace, or Red Castle.  This masterpiece owes its existence to the Spanish Muslims.  In the XIV century, when the Cordoban caliphate had already sunk into oblivion, and the Moors were kicked out into the mountains on the badlands, this masterpiece of architecture appeared.  Many art historians attribute the Alhambra to the most perfect sights of Muslim culture. </p><p>  The Alhambra is considered the best personification of the proverb ‚ÄúMeet by clothes, but escorted by the mind.‚Äù  Indeed, from the outside, this structure does not represent anything special.  But Granada is rightly proud of it.  Sightseeing (the Red Castle is the best of them) to see is worth starting from here. </p><p>  Here you can see a severe pile of battlements, walls and towers of red color.  This whole bunch is small and became the palace of the Alhambra.  But do not rush to leave: the interior of the object completely compensates for the lack of external beauty and charm.  Inside, every centimeter on the wall is decorated with ceramics and lace carvings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Alhambra is located on one of the Granada hills.  At the very beginning of its existence, <span>this building</span> was an ordinary fortress, but during the XIV-XV centuries, Nasrida turned it into a magnificent palace.  It's quite easy to get lost here, because the Alhambra is a kind of intricate labyrinth, consisting of courtyards, rooms and gardens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granada sights red castle" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/560263.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Castle tour </h2><p>  Visitors are given a wonderful tour of this object of <span>Granada (Spain).</span>  Sights (the Alhambra - the first of them) begin to inspect from the room in which the ministers of the Sultan met.  It is called mehuar.  Next comes the room where the Sultan privately talked with his and foreign ministers.  From here there is access to the courtyard with a pool and shrubs on the sides.  The courtyard is named Mirtovy Dvor.  The Hall of Ambassadors adjoins it - two decades have been working on the creation of this room.  The cedar dome deserves attention.  Only the Lion's yard can compete with the beauty of the Myrtle Yard.  Most tourists come to the Alhambra just to see this room.  In the center of the courtyard is a fountain that frames a dozen marble lions.  This design has become a symbol of the clock and zodiac signs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Granada Attractions Falla" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/560264.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other prominent places </h2><p>  Granada, the sights of which can be seen for whole days, is known for another place that is worthy of the attention of millions of tourists.  This is the Museum of Manuel de Falla.  He is in the house where the world <span>famous composer</span> lived and worked <span>.</span>  The score ‚ÄúMystery of Maese Pedro‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnchanting Love‚Äù was presented to the audience.  Also in this building you can hear how the old house is whispering quietly.  It was this whisper that became for the composer the temptation that made him spend his life in Granada. </p><h2>  Other Falla </h2><p>  Granada welcomes everyone!  Attractions Falla is not only the house-museum of the famous composer, but also the Bolshoi Theater.  These are two different establishments, but they deserve the same respect.  The theater is located on the square of Frahel.  It began to be built in 1884, and completed in 1905.  The theater building was erected from red bricks.  The foundation in its form resembles a horseshoe, and each of the floors is surrounded by a gallery.  The Falla Auditorium can accommodate 1214 people.  The scene of the institution is 18 meters long and 25.5 meters deep.  The Bolshoi Theater Falla always hosts the Cadiz Carnival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="granada spain sights of the alhambra" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/560265.jpg" width="600"></div>
