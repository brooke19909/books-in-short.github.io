World War II, like a hurricane, swept over Europe.  Literally in a matter of months, Hitler subjugated a significant number of countries, but then he crossed the borders of the Soviet Union and found out what a real battle was.  Where others surrendered, Soviet soldiers did not even think about running away.  They fought for every meter of their native land, the cities were in blockades for months, but did not raise white flags.  This put a lot of pressure on the invaders.  After the victory in the Great Patriotic War, the government decided to award the title “Hero City” with places whose residents showed themselves excellently in fighting with the military.  Hero cities of the USSR - a powerful bastion defending their country. </p><h2>  About regulations </h2><p>  In May of the 45th year, a decree was issued on granting the status of “Hero City” to the locality, which distinguished itself in the battle with the fascist invaders.  According to this order, the first hero cities of the USSR were: </p><ul><li>  Stalingrad; </li><li>  Odessa; </li><li>  Sevastopol </li><li>  Leningrad. </li></ul><p>  In 1961, this title was awarded to Kiev.  1965 The Presidency certifies the status of the “Hero City” status.  Almost immediately, 7 orders were issued.  According to regulatory documents, all the hero cities of the USSR received the Golden Star medal.  In addition to this medal, Odessa, Stalingrad and Sevastopol were additionally awarded the Order of Lenin.  Also, according to the issued order, the immortal title of "Heroes" was awarded to Moscow and the Brest Fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1980, the status of the “Hero City” status was slightly corrected; now it is not a simple title, but the highest degree of recognition.  As a memory of the heroism of the past, a series of badges with a local emblem were made in these cities.  In the postwar years, traveling places that received the highest award, no one returned home without the badge "Hero City" of the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Brest Fortress </h2><p>  It was Brest that became the first city to face the enemy army face to face.  On the morning of June 22, the Brest Fortress was under enemy fire, where at that time there were about 7,000 Soviet soldiers.  The fascist invaders planned to take control of the fortress in a few hours, but were stuck for a whole month.  The German army suffered significant losses, control of the fortress was taken a week later, but another month the Nazis suppressed individual centers of resistance.  The time won by Brest made it possible to mobilize the military forces of the Union and prepare to repel the attack. </p><h2>  Moscow and Kiev </h2><p>  Distinguished themselves in the battle with the enemy and the capital of the two great powers.  The outbreak of war was marked for Kiev by an air strike.  The city came under fire from the invaders in the first hours of the outbreak of war, but two weeks later a committee was set up to protect the city.  A 72-day defensive operation began.  33 thousand people of Kiev joined the ranks of the Soviet troops.  They were part of the fighter battalions and fought a worthy battle to the enemy. </p>

    <p>  The enemy attack was stopped on the first line of the city fortification.  The enemy failed to capture Kiev on the move, but on July 30, 1941, another attempt was made to assault.  After 10 days, the enemies managed to break up the defense in the southwest, but the defenders were able to counteract this.  After 5 days, the invaders retreated to their previous positions.  By direct assault, Kiev was no longer taken.  17 fascist divisions took part in battles near Kiev for a long time.  Therefore, the enemy was forced to withdraw part of the offensive forces that went to Moscow, and send them in the direction of Kiev.  Because of this, Soviet troops retreated on September 19. </p><p>  As for Moscow, the battle for it consisted of two types of operations: defensive and offensive.  The fascist command decided to go towards Moscow.  Its capture would be a devastating blow to the allied army, so the main combat power was thrown at the capital.  In turn, the Soviet army was not going to give up so easily.  On December 5, the Germans were pushed back from Moscow, and its defenders from defense switched to a counterattack, this event was the climax of the war. </p>

    <h2>  Climax </h2><p>  Due respect must be given to Kerch, Tula, Novorossiysk, Murmansk, Smolensk, who made a worthy contribution to the battle against the Nazis.  The Soviet army fought to the last, and local residents fought along with them.  In defense and attack battles all human resources were involved.  Murmansk, Novorossiysk, Leningrad, Stalingrad - thanks to the titanic efforts they were able to stop the advance of the enemy, and were not captured.  A severe siege in the Kerch quarries allowed to delay the advance of the Nazis, but the inhabitants suffered terrible losses.  It was on the Kerch peninsula that the Soviet commission began to investigate the crimes of the Nazis. </p><p>  Twelve, that's how many hero cities were in the USSR.  They were that unbending spirit that remains after the walls of the fortress fall. </p>
