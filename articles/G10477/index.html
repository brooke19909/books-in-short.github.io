This is entertainment for all ages: from adults to toddlers.  That is why the demand for karaoke systems for the home is growing every year.  In addition, the novelties of this technique for raising the mood appear quite often, so you can get a little confused when choosing.  What to look for and how to choose karaoke for the house - we will consider further. </p><h2>  Vehicle Class </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetdj.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karaoke system" class="if uuid-2313521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313521.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a karaoke installation for the home, each person starts from their financial capabilities.  There are three classes of equipment depending on the price: budget options, mid-priced models, and expensive or luxury goods. </p><p>  Before choosing a <span>karaoke system for the home,</span> it is worth deciding on the price category of equipment and familiarize yourself with its characteristics. </p><p>  The cheapest options will not provide good sound.  As a rule, they include a set-top box with a karaoke function and a microphone of low cost.  In specialized stores there are many budget options, but experts recommend making a choice from the category with an average cost.  Sometimes this difference is very small. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to consumer reviews, they advise initially to opt for a budget option player with the karaoke option, which is convenient to use.  For example, the Karafun player, which has established itself well.  The only downside is that, as users note, you have to translate the backing tracks into the player format, although this is done easily even for a beginner. </p><p>  Models of average cost are high-quality professional players that are perfect for both home and karaoke club.  They are easy to use, have significant functionality and provide high-quality sound. </p><p>  Experienced users indicate that the most important thing is that for a <span>dynamic microphone to work, you</span> need an amplifier or an active speaker.  The active speaker is where the amplifier is already built.  They are professional and custom.  You can connect a microphone, laptop and sing karaoke at home to it. </p><p>  Expensive or luxury home installations are not suitable.  This is a fairly complex and multifunctional system, which is more needed by a large institution.  In addition, their prices are very high. </p><h2>  Features of choice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.karaokemachinecritics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karaoke installation with screen" class="if uuid-2313523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313523.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the preferences of a particular user of a particular brand, the question about how to choose karaoke for <span>home, the reviews are</span> mixed.  It is nevertheless worth relying on the budget, functionality and characteristics, as well as taking into account what a person wants to get by buying such a technique. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Conventionally, equipment can be divided into three types: </p><ul><li>  A DVD player with karaoke features (this is the cheapest option, but the sound quality depends on the microphone).  Users write that they can no longer buy normal devices with CD disks for karaoke.  There is a picture in high resolution, real-time assessment of singing.  But singing karaoke at home is simply impossible.  Low-cost digital sound processing provides strong voice distortion and time lag. </li><li>  Karaoke player (a convenient and functional system that has various sound settings, so it is ideal for both home and bar). </li><li>  Component systems (these are professional installations having a mixer, high-quality soundtracks and a professional microphone). </li></ul><p>  Before choosing karaoke for home, you should familiarize yourself with the switching capabilities of the equipment, and also whether there is such a function as a search by composition, which will only simplify the process of using the system. </p><p>  So, some users note the positive characteristics and highlight the prefix for karaoke BEHRINGER MIX 800 MINIMIX.  The cost is low, and the Voice Canceller option will effectively remove vocals from any stereo source, while the quality of the soundtrack will remain at its best. </p><p>  Additionally, it is worth checking the number of connectors for the microphone.  If he is alone, then you won‚Äôt be able to sing a duet. </p><h2>  The main components of a karaoke system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Models karaoke system" class="if uuid-2313533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313533.jpg"></div><p>  An indispensable component of a karaoke installation is a microphone with high sensitivity, a wide range.  Appearance is selected depending on personal preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition to the microphone, <span>speakers</span> with high sound power can be included.  It is worth remembering that the better the speaker system is selected, the more ‚Äúsound‚Äù the sound will be, without interference. </p><p>  But before choosing karaoke for home, you should make sure that there is a mixer in the system.  This will allow you to use all the settings, modify them at your discretion.  In the latest models, they are already built into the system, but if necessary, the mixer can be purchased separately. </p><h2>  Microphone Selection Criteria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Always having a good time with friends" class="if uuid-2313564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313564.jpg"></div><p>  A microphone is an integral part of any karaoke system.  How to choose a karaoke microphone for home? </p><p>  Here are some universal tips: </p><ul><li>  choose wireless microphones rather than wired analogs (they are in a higher category, but give more freedom of movement); </li><li>  If you stopped on a budget wired version, then pay attention to the sound reproduction quality (Shure PG48 XLR or Shure SV200-A belong to such models), as well as the length of the wire itself; </li><li>  do not save money on the microphone, as the sound depends on it, it should not distort the sound or sound; </li><li>  Check the installation immediately before purchase. </li></ul><p>  Advice from experienced users: High-quality microphones should support a frequency range of 50 to 150,000 Hz.  The direction of sound perception determines the sensitivity of the device.  The cordioid diagram is the best option for equipment when used at home.  The capture angle is 270 ¬∞. </p><h2>  How to choose a karaoke player for home? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="brisound.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Player with karaoke option" class="if uuid-2313536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313536.jpg"></div><p>  A DVD player with the option of karaoke, with the right selection of a microphone and an additional speaker system, can be an excellent solution for the home, in addition, it is in a low price category. </p><p>  When choosing a player, one must rely on simplicity and ease of operation, support for most recording formats, tone adjustment function, vibration protection and a mixer. </p><p>  Review of the karaoke mini-system X-Boom LG OM6540: there is a Usb input, two microphone inputs, 500 watts.  There is no need for a laptop and no need to buy a speaker, but the price is high.  The sound is high-quality, pleasant, clear.  They will make great friends with phones and a laptop.  There is a bluetooth that automatically turns on at startup.  But this mini-system is closer to professional equipment than to amateur or karaoke for home use.  Great idea for outdoor parties, but indoors is best not to use. </p><p>  As a rule, kits with a player have several components, which requires a lot of space for installation.  Therefore, before choosing all the components separately, it is worthwhile to think over the space in the room where the installation will stand. </p><h2>  additional characteristics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="allaboutkaraoke.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect to Gadgets" class="if uuid-2313526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313526.jpg"></div><p>  Before choosing a karaoke installation for home, you should pay attention to the additional functionality of the system.  The volume of both the phonogram and the microphone should be regulated.  For ease of use, the system should have a Russian interface.  Additional functions also include changing the playback speed if necessary, adjusting the rhythm and tonality, as well as evaluating the sound quality.  The ability to connect multiple microphones at once is an excellent feature for those who like to sing a duet. </p><p>  Additionally, the system, depending on the selected model, can be connected to a TV and have a recording function.  Unlimited possibilities for choosing a repertoire are provided by the built-in mixers in the karaoke system.  Thus, the playlist can be synchronized with a phone, smartphone, computer or TV. </p><p>  How to choose karaoke for home with points?  In this case, you need karaoke with a mixing system, which is easy to control, provides the finest sound tuning, small in size and costs in a low price category.  Such a device is suitable not just for a party at home, but for real vocal battles in the home. </p><h2>  Rating karaoke systems </h2><div class="photo" data-original="isingtec.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Professional karaoke system" class="if uuid-2313529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/2313529.jpg"></div><p>  In order to practice singing or just sing in pleasure, it is not necessary to go to a karaoke club.
