After the peninsula returned to the Russian Federation, the number of people wishing to spend their holidays there increased sharply.  That is why many are interested in information about <span>hotels in Yalta,</span> Sevastopol, Yevpatoriya, Sudak and other Crimean resorts.  At the moment, active construction of new sanatoriums and rest houses has begun there.  At the same time, tourist facilities that were built during the Soviet period continue to be popular.  Among them is the hotel "Crimea" (Sevastopol).  It is considered the best accommodation option among economy class hotels and has an extremely convenient location. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel "Crimea" Sevastopol: reviews </h2><p>  Those who have already stayed at this hotel note that in general they were satisfied with the level of service.  At the same time, the reviews indicate that this hotel is suitable for those who come to Sevastopol to explore local attractions and want to use it as a starting point for excursions to other cities of the peninsula located nearby.  This opinion is based on the fact that the hotel is quite far from the nearest beach and belongs to the category of ‚Äúurban‚Äù.  As for the service, there are no complaints about the work of the maintenance staff in the reviews.  At the same time, some tourists were dissatisfied with the food and noted the uniformity of the menu and the lack of choice.  Some guests did not like the fact that Sevastopol was busy in the summer.  Hotel "Crimea" (photo below) is a quiet place, in the lobby and corridors during some hours it is quite noisy.  However, it would be strange to expect something else in the holiday season. </p><h2>  Nearby Attractions </h2><p>  As already mentioned, most tourists believe that the best place to stay for lovers of interesting excursions is the Crimea Hotel.  Sevastopol is famous for its attractions, and some of them are within walking distance or a short drive from the hotel.  In particular, not far from the "Crimea" is the Kommunarov Park.  It is a reminder of the turbulent revolutionary past of Sevastopol.  The famous lieutenant P. Schmidt, many famous Soviet admirals and scientists are buried there.  Monuments to the crew of the Kursk, the defenders of Sevastopol, etc. </p><p>  From the hotel you can easily reach the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, built in the early 20th century. </p>
