    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Transylvania is" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1064899.jpg"></div>  Transylvania gained worldwide fame thanks to Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula".  The main character of this work lived in this region and was a bloodthirsty vampire.  The novel is considered a classic of its genre, and thanks to it, Romania became famous throughout the world as a place in which the first blood-sucking monsters appeared.  What is Transylvania, every child knows today, at least once interested in vampire stories.  However, in fact, there are no real facts confirming the existence of evil in Romania.  In the fifteenth century Count Vlad Tepes really lived here, famous for his cruelty and militancy.  However, the real prince, most likely, was still a man, albeit not the most kind and peaceful.  And had nothing to do with real vampires.  True, thanks to him, Transylvania is incredibly popular among tourists interested in mysticism and ancient legends.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Transylvania Romania" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1064897.jpg"></div>  Transylvania is a historical zone of Romania located in the northwest of the country.  Often the region is also called Semigrad or Erdey.  But most often the first option is used.  Transylvania is the ‚ÄúLand beyond the forests‚Äù or ‚ÄúForestland‚Äù in the literal translation into Russian.  And indeed, this is the land of virgin forests and mountains.  This region is often called "Europe in miniature" or "Romanian Switzerland."  Local people preserve and honor their own traditions.  At the same time, Transylvania boasts a picturesque nature, a developed tourist infrastructure and an abundance of attractions of various periods.  At different times on the territory of Romania in general and this zone in particular, there were representatives of various nations, due to which you can see a rather strange combination of historical architectural objects of different eras.

In those days, Transylvania was the possession of the militant Dacian tribes.  Later, the lands of modern Romania were considered the Roman province, and then belonged to Hungary.  In the Middle Ages, Transylvania was considered an autonomous region, part of the Principality of Hungary.  In 1526, Romania became an independent state.  The further history of Transylvania can tell about the times of submission to the Turkish Sultan, and about the return of the lands of Hungary.

Transylvania is truly the birthplace of the prototype of Dracula - Prince Vlad Tepes.  Today, as his "main residence", tourists are offered to visit <span>the Bran Castle,</span> located near Brasov.  In fact, the prince spent only one night in this fortress.  However, the castle has been excellently preserved to this day and is regularly restored.  He is one of the ten most beautiful in the whole world, and during the tour tourists can explore the interior interiors and hear many interesting legends.  In total, more than 5 different castles are associated with the name of Count Tepes.  Some are in ruined condition, making them look even more sinister.

    <p>  In Brasov itself you can see the Black Church, ancient temples and the narrowest street in all of Europe - Strada Sforiy.  Fans of all German will certainly enjoy the city of Sibiu.  Its main attractions are the Brukenthal Palace, the Evangelical Cathedral and the "big-eyed" houses.  In addition, here you can visit a variety of museums, or maybe you can get to one of the local festivals. </p><p>  Transylvania (Romania) is rich in medieval castles made in various architectural styles and differing in the degree of preservation.  Tourist excursions are held to the fortresses and museums, which can boast of preserved or carefully restored interior decoration, and to the monumental ruins of ancient citadels.  Similar objects available for visiting can be found in any region of Romania.  Do not forget that the meaning of the word "Transylvania" is "Forest".  And this means that, while relaxing in this region, you should definitely take time to get acquainted with the local nature.  Protected forests, mountains, natural lakes, caves - all these are landscapes of the most mystical part of Romania. </p><h2>  Travel Transylvania: Travel Details </h2>
