Today, each of the companies providing mobile communications, in its package also offers an Internet connection to a mobile device or a stationary PC.  Thus, the subscriber can order the whole range of services in a single package.  So, firstly, it will be easier for him to choose a suitable tariff;  secondly, he will be able to get more favorable conditions (since the operator is loyal to subscribers using a comprehensive solution). </p><p>  The Internet provided by Beeline is no exception.  The customer review that we managed to find during the preparation of this article, successfully called this operator a “universal” solution for both those who need a home connection and for users with mobile access to the network. </p><p>  Read more about what Beeline can offer, as well as operator’s tariff plans, in our article. </p>

    <h2>  Tariff grid </h2><p>  We begin with a description of how the provider shares its services depending on the platform that the subscriber uses.  According to this criterion, all service packages can be divided into “mobile” and “home” Internet.  The differences between them are fundamental - the first allows you to provide access to the network on tablets and smartphones, while the latter is a more comprehensive solution for either all devices in the house or for a stationary PC.  This, in turn, leads to the fact that the cost of services for a computer is higher, and the data packet is larger in volume. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the Beeline home Internet (user reviews claim this), can serve as a kind of Internet access point for all the gadgets that are in your home: relatives' smartphones, a computer, a player and a TV can be online simultaneously.  While the mobile Beeline (the Internet, a review of which we are equally interested in, as well as a stationary one) can serve as an individual solution for those who are somewhere on the road and want, say, to check their route using a map. </p><p>  For each of the solutions described, Beeline has its own several tariffs, characterized by different conditions of use.  Read about them further. </p><h2>  Mobile Internet </h2>

    <p>  All service packages for mobile can be divided into two groups - the Internet, which is bundled with minutes and messages to communicate with other subscribers, as well as the “net” volume of traffic.  The latter option, by the way, is intended for owners of tablet computers, as well as for installation on a USB modem that distributes Beeline mobile Internet.  The reviews indicate that in total the operator has several tariff plans: the “All for” and “Highway” lines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  “All for” </h2><p>  This kit is designed for those who want to connect Internet access for their mobile phone while using communication services.  Thus, the subscriber pays for calls and messages, as well as for Internet traffic. </p><p>  There are several “all for” packages: their cost varies in the amount of 200, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2700 rubles.  For this money, the user receives 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 20 and 30 gigabytes per month.  At the same time, he is given a certain number of minutes for conversations and messages.  Their volume, in turn, depends on the cost of the connected package. </p>

    <h2>  Highway </h2><p>  The service, on the contrary, does not imply the availability of data for communication, since it is focused on tablet users (this is confirmed by reviews).  Beeline Highway Internet tariffs are offered at a price of 400 rubles for 4 GB of traffic, 600 for 8 GB, 700 for 12 GB and 1200 rubles for 20 gigabytes of data. </p><p>  Such mobile Beeline Internet (of which we were able to find only positive reviews) is available anywhere, as is mobile for smartphones.  But, given the large data package, any remote work can be performed from it without fear of exhausting its limit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  “Internet forever” </h2>

    <p>  Another interesting option, with the help of which the operator “attracts” users, is the service "Internet forever" ("Beeline").  User reviews note that this option is free, and is more likely an advertising one.  Its essence lies in the fact that the subscriber is provided (absolutely without any fee) in spending 200 megabytes of traffic monthly.  At the same time, you can spend them at your own discretion. </p><p>  Obviously, such a small amount of data is provided so that the subscriber can get acquainted with the services of the company, experience them on their own experience.  Thus, it is demonstrated what the Internet is capable of from Beeline.  The reviews (Moscow is the city where their authors are serviced) showed that with the help of such a free “test sample” one can really make sure how high the speed of the connection in the mobile network is. </p><h2>  Home Internet </h2><p>  Beeline company, in addition to working with a portable connection, also offers its subscribers the opportunity to order home Internet.  It is available in two options - with speeds up to 40 and up to 100 Mbps.  Also complete with access to online, the operator also offers television services. </p><p>  The cost of service varies depending on the number of connected channel packages and starts <span>from 400</span> rubles per month. </p><h2>  Devices </h2>

    <p>  The set of devices that can interact with the services of the operator, of course, is different.  Among mobile devices that accept a SIM card and are able to “catch” a 3G / LTE signal, we can distinguish smartphones and tablets, as well as a Beeline modem configured for Internet.  Reviews note that using the latter you can connect to a stationary PC. </p><p>  The home tariff is, in turn, a computer or laptop with a network card that can perceive the connection cord, as well as a TV for the full reception of the TV signal.  Beeline company also hosts a special offer, according to which the subscriber can rent a TV set-top box for an additional fee. </p><h2>  How to connect </h2>

    <p>  If you are serviced with another mobile operator, but would like to use Beeline services, or simply stay at a different tariff, you will be interested to know how to switch to the services described in this article.  The company’s website indicates several methods by which you can apply for a desire to start servicing in this company.  The first one is authorization in your personal account and further ordering of the service.  This is done using the subscriber's number (by going through the confirmation procedure).  After that, the user can manually connect the service he needs. </p><p>  The second way is to order an option using a short digital combination.  You can find it directly on the website page, which displays a brief description of the tariff.  The combination, as usual, begins with the symbol “*” and ends with “#”. </p><p>  Finally, in addition to all the options listed above, you can also simply contact the customer support service, where in communication with the operator you should indicate which service you want to connect. </p><h2>  Support </h2><p>  Regarding how Beeline can help you (the Internet), the subscriber’s recall notes that, again, there are several options.  This can be an appeal through an online form located on the official portal;  a call to the center on the hot line, where the operator will serve you at any time;  as well as contacting the branch office directly. </p><p>  In the latter case, you can completely connect and configure all the services that you ask for, completely free.  And since Beeline stores also sell all the necessary communication accessories, here you can also get, for example, a modem for transmitting a WiFi signal. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We managed to find various recommendations on the network regarding how the Beeline home Internet works.  Reviews can be divided into two groups: positive and negative.  And, frankly, it's hard to say which ones are more.  Although there are opinions according to which the Internet from the “yellow-black” provider is fast, inexpensive and reliable, we managed to find dozens of comments on different resources, where the authors complain about the instability of its work, low connection speed, incompetent support.  All this is illustrated by the real situations in which subscribers find themselves.  And Beeline is not always able to successfully resolve the conflict that has arisen, to solve the problem that has arisen. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  If you do not trust this provider, or have negative experience working with Beeline as a mobile operator, we recommend that you think twice.  If every review you see about Beeline (Internet) makes you doubt whether you should connect to its services or not, you may need to contact other providers.  Indeed, in the end, the Russian telecom services market is crowded with the largest operators, such as MTS, Megafon, Tele2 and others.  True, their data packages and the cost of tariffs is a topic for a separate article. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  What did we manage to find out in the process of compiling this review?  Firstly, that Beeline is preparing a comprehensive package of services for its subscribers, providing them not only communication services.  Secondly, everyone can get Internet at home from Beeline.  The reviews, however, are not so unanimous as to whether the Internet is reliable, whether its speed is sufficiently high, and whether company representatives help in case of problems or simply ignore the user.  Perhaps some dependence on this issue can be traced in the village where the subscriber lives. </p><p>  It is likely that in Moscow and St. Petersburg the quality of service is an order of magnitude higher than in Tomsk and Tver.  That is why the metropolitan user on the site with reviews will write that he likes the Internet from Beeline, and he enjoys using the services of the company;  while a resident of the regions may not be completely satisfied with the service.  As a result, a negative review will appear on the site. </p><p>  In any case, you can choose “Beeline” because of favorable tariffs and carefully look at what quality of service the company provides.  If you don’t like something, you can just change your mobile operator and order the Internet from another company. </p>
