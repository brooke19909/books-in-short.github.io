Overview of water parks in Moscow: visitor reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What could be better than a time filled with vivid impressions?  What pleasure compares with the joy of plunging into warm water, lying on the warm sand or going down a steep hill?  Especially if the weather outside doesn‚Äôt have such open-air entertainment at all.  Summer in the city is flying fast and is ending faster than we would like.  Here, water parks in Moscow come to the rescue, with their variety of slopes, slides and pools.  Even a few hours is enough to recharge with fun and health for a long time.  In the past eight years, <span>water parks in Moscow</span> have increased their numbers to five - this suggests that the popularity of such entertainment is growing rapidly.  All of them are ready to give a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãjoy and positive impressions to guests. </p><h2>  Water park in Moscow "Kva-Kva" </h2><p>  This modern indoor entertainment facility is located in Mytishchi.  Its area is 4500 square meters.  This is the largest water park in <strong> </strong>  Moscow, and even in Europe there is no similar in size.  He began his work in 2006, the first in the metropolis.  In any weather conditions, without leaving the city limits, you can spend time with the whole family with pleasure and pleasure. </p>

    <h2>  Rides </h2><p>  More than a dozen different attractions, 7 high slides, a large and spacious pool, incredible water slides up to 120 meters long with steep bends - all this is Kva-Kva water park.  The ‚Äúfamily‚Äù slide, which flows into the lagoon, and the Multislide are suitable for beginners.  The attraction "Tsunami" and "Black Hole" with a descent in pitch darkness will be appreciated by extreme people.  For lovers of the bath, a whole complex is offered with all existing types of steam rooms (Russian steam room, Finnish sauna, Turkish hammam, Japanese furaco font).  A separate children's town with water cannons, caves and a waterfall will attract the smallest visitors.  Every Saturday night discos for youth are arranged.  The price of tickets matches the services offered at the water park: exquisite cuisine, interesting atmosphere in the halls, wonderful attractions.  This is the best place to relax with the whole family, an original birthday or a party. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Many ongoing promotions will help you choose the best option for leisure.  Discounts on special offers can reach 50%. </p><p>  The only drawback that visitors to this amusement park respond to is the lack of room heating.  A temperature display is not available.  It is clear that it is difficult to heat a room of such a volume.  But the water park wins in that visitors are given an electronic bracelet, which also serves as the key to the closet.  In other institutions there are two of them, and this serves as some inconvenience. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Visitors are offered various attractions with slides up to 85 meters long.  The water park area is small, so only 5 runs operate, but they are almost all speed and extreme.  According to visitors' reviews, if you need adrenaline, then the Fantasy water park is exactly the place where you more than get it.  The name Kamikaze alone speaks for itself - a small and straight hill with steep slopes.  A flatter ‚ÄúFantasy‚Äù allows you to ride the whole family.  The Barracuda will plunge into the seething abyss for a while.  And you have to move out in complete darkness, not knowing what lies ahead.  "Taborgan" is the most extreme slide, allowing you to achieve a fairly high speed.  Artificial sea wave in the pool, many fountains for children and adults.  Around all the attractions is the Slow River.  Small visitors are offered paddling pools and children's slides. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Family cards with discounts up to 20%, various promotions and bonuses are among the constant offers.  There is a ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù tariff - visitors with a Muscovite card can spend time in the water park at an incredibly low price.  The highlight of Fantasy Park is a real marine ship, on the deck of which you can taste delicious dishes.  Less often than in Kva-Kva, but still parties and pool discos are held. </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  Water parks in Moscow usually do not allow independent photo and video shooting, but visitors will be able to use the services of professional photographers and, believe me, the pictures will turn out so that you want to review them again and again.  According to visitors' reviews, in order for the vacation to succeed, you should study the rules of behavior and visits posted on the sites or in front of the cash register in advance. </p>
