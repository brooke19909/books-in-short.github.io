And its name was received in memory of the founder of Ali Gural.  The hotel is located on the coast, on the first coastline.  The hotel's own sandy beach has a length of about 400 meters. </p><p>  Recent renovations to update the hotel fund were carried out recently, in 2014.

The local coast has become popular due to its beautiful beaches and beautiful nature.  The main direction of the resort is, of course, a beach holiday.  But tourists are also attracted by excursion tourism, since many ancient monuments of history have been preserved in Side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ali bey park turkey side" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2005599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Diving is very popular in the resort area due to the clear water off the coast.  The most interesting place for experienced divers is the sunken French ship of the Second World War.  And not far from Manavgat at the bottom lies a military plane.  The local underwater world is not inferior in beauty to the Red Sea.  Not far from Side there are even reefs, everyone is taken to them by boat to dive.  Here you can admire the cute flocks of bright fish, starfish and other inhabitants of the underwater world. </p><p>  In the east of the center of Side there is even a diving center that provides initial training services with the subsequent training in the basics of diving. </p><h2>  Ali Bey Park: 2017 reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the hotel, we pay attention to the reviews of tourists who visited it this year.  It is worth noting that the reviews on Ali Bey Park are quite controversial. </p><p>  According to tourists, the number of rooms in the complex has long been outdated and, of course, needs to be repaired and updated interiors.  The furniture in the apartments has significant scuffs, and televisions are far from modern standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ali bey park reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2005598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for cleaning, here the opinions of tourists are divided.  Some say that their quality suited them well, while others remain extremely unhappy.  Apparently, not all maids are conscientious in their duties.  The linen and towels in the rooms are of high quality and clean, they are replaced regularly.  It is customary to leave a tip at the hotel, however, their presence does not always guarantee high-quality cleaning.  In general, the number of rooms is not bad, but needs to be updated, since it does not correspond to the declared level. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  But with regard to food in Ali Bey Park (Turkey, Side), then vacationers are satisfied with its quality.  The main restaurant has a good selection of dishes.  Of course, not all of them are successful, but you can always choose something suitable.  The waiters work very promptly and quickly, remembering even your preferences.  Especially guests celebrate theme nights.  On such days, there is a special set of dishes at dinner, all kinds of seafood and delicious desserts appear. </p><p>  According to the current concept, almost all drinks are offered to guests free of charge.  The quality of alcohol produced locally is good, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Therefore, there is absolutely no need to spend money on the acquisition of something special.  In terms of food and quality of service in the restaurant, the hotel is good for families.  The complex has many bars that offer drinks, liquor and snacks. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Ali Bey Park Hotel has a fairly large territory, built up with small cottages, in which tourists actually live.  There are a lot of all kinds of trees and plants.  To the delight, children in the complex have a pretty good water park with water attractions.  There is also a kids club and amusement park.  According to tourists, animators occupy kids, but their level of work leaves much to be desired.  In the evenings, a mini disco is organized for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ali bey park manavgat 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2005597.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  For adult tourists, animators also conduct recreational activities.  In the daytime, guests of the institution have the opportunity to attend water aerobics in the main pool, yoga and sports classes.  In the evening, in the amphitheater of tourists, a daily show is organized by an activity team.  According to tourists, adult animation is not intrusive, but you can always find something to do if you wish. </p><p>  The hotel positions itself as a family establishment.  And indeed, a lot of couples with children of all ages are resting here, so the territory is always noisy.  For guests there are three swimming pools, recreation areas and a pond for kids. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has its own sandy beach, equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas.  Unfortunately, calling at sea cannot be called successful and gentle.  The bottom is covered with sharp pebbles, so vacationers recommend purchasing special shoes.  In addition, depth begins very quickly.  Therefore, tourists believe that children are not comfortable swimming here.  This drawback is very significant for an institution that positions itself as a family-type hotel. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth mentioning that the Ali Bay Park Hotel is a family-run establishment with developed infrastructure and a beautiful territory.  Despite the shortcomings in the work of the staff and the number of rooms, the complex can be recommended for recreation.  If you are going to spend a vacation with very young children, then it is worth remembering that the local beach is not very suitable for bathing the youngest guests.  Otherwise, the hotel is good for children, because there is a water park, a kids club, an amusement park and other attractions, as well as an animation team.  For those who are looking for peace and solitude, the hotel complex is unlikely to be suitable, since there are always a lot of kids here, so noise and screaming are simply guaranteed. </p>
