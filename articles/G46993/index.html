    <h2>  Material preparation </h2><p>  To get a basket of soap and <span>satin ribbons</span> , you should prepare everything you need in advance and decide what plan the product should be.  For manufacturing you will need: </p><ol><li>  Soap, preferably round or oval. </li><li>  Satin ribbons.  It is better to take material with a width of 5 millimeters.  It is worth remembering that wide tapes allow you to completely cover the base and avoid the formation of gaps. </li><li>  Pins having beads at the ends. </li></ol><h2>  Foundation preparation </h2><p>  So, how to make a basket of soap and ribbons?  First you need to prepare the foundation.  On the edge of the soap, stick needles with beads.  This will allow you to gently pull the tape.  In this case, it is worth retreating a small distance from the edge itself, about ¬Ω centimeter.  The first step is to stick four pins on opposite edges of the soap.  And only then between them you can place the rest.  It is worthwhile to ensure that the distance between the pins is the same.  The result is a neat basket of soap and ribbons.  The master class continues. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the product will be further decorated with large flowers, then stick the pins deeply not worth it.  This will make the high sides of the basket.  Now you can proceed to the next step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basket of soap and satin ribbons" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/783813.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Tape fixing </h2><p>  In order for the baskets from soap and ribbons to turn out beautiful, it is necessary to fix the material correctly and tighten the base.  If this is done carelessly, gaps will appear.  So, you need to pull one needle from the base and, applying the edge of the tape, stick it back.  Now you can form a basket.  The tape should be wound from the bottom up, passing it between the pins.  In this case, the basis must be braided, performing the "eight".  That's all, the side part is ready. </p><h2>  Basket edge </h2><p>  After the base is ready, you can begin to manufacture the edges of the basket from soap and ribbons.  There is nothing to cut here.  When the side parts of the product are ready, you can start wrapping the pins with tape.  This should be done gradually and in a circle. </p><p>  To give a finished look to the basket, you need to braid the pins in several layers.  As a result, the needles will completely hide under the material and will not be evident.  If desired, the pins can be positioned in a wave.  As a result, the edges of the product will turn out to be more beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a basket of soap and ribbons master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/783814.jpg"></div>

The material should be bent in a small arc.  In this case, do not forget about the size of the basket.  If the product is small, then the handle should be small.  The wire should also be wrapped in satin ribbon.  This is best done with an overlap. </p><p>  To make the basket of soap and satin ribbons neat and beautiful, you must follow some rules.  The amount of tape for a pen can be calculated in advance.  This is nothing complicated.  Usually the length of the tape is 5, or even 6 times, greater than the length of the handle. </p><h2>  Decorating soap and ribbon baskets </h2><p>  Decorating the main part of the finished basket is permissible in completely different ways.  On top of the main ribbon, you can attach a decorative ribbon, braid it on the upper edge of the pins, and at the end tie a small bow.  You can put flowers and leaves in a basket.  They should also be made of tapes, secured with a <span>glue gun.</span> </p><h2>  How to make flowers </h2><p>  In school years, many made garlands.  In the manufacture of flowers uses the same principle.  One part is superimposed on another.  You need to take a piece of tape and carefully fold it in half a little diagonally.  After that, the left side should be shifted to the right, while covering the right side.  The second tip of the tape should be bent to the left from the outside. </p><p>  Similarly, it is necessary to fold the entire length of the tape.  After that, you need to take the product by two ends and pull one down.  The result should be a flower.  In the middle you can stick a colored pin with a bead or with sequins.  In addition, this will allow you to fasten the finished flower so that it does not fall apart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a basket of soap and ribbon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/783816.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Finished jewelry should be inserted in the middle of the basket, and then cut off all excess ends.  For the manufacture of decor, it is best to take satin ribbons that match the color of the product.  Flowers of contrasting colors will also look good. </p><p>  Around this decoration, you can place leaflets made of green tape.  Flowers surrounded by feathers look very unusual.  If desired, they can be painted in any color. </p><h2>  A basket of soap and ribbons: a master class </h2><p>  There is a more simplified option for creating original souvenirs.  The principle of operation remains the same.  To make it more convenient, you can use a template cut out of paper.  In size, it should be half a centimeter smaller than the base. </p><p>  The finished template should be folded four times, and at the same distance, make marks in those places where the needles will be stuck.  Small cuts should be made here.  The finished template can be deployed and fixed in the center with several pins.  Now you need to stick the needles around the perimeter of the product. </p><p>  The tip of the tape should be carefully folded and secured with a pin.  Now you can start braiding the soap as described above.  In this case, it is better to take a wide ribbon, and place the needles at a close distance from each other.  The result will be something like sides. </p><p>  Using the lower pin at the end of the braiding, you can fix the tip of the tape.  A basket of soap and satin ribbons is ready.  It remains to attach a pen and decorate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a basket of soap and satin ribbons" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/783817.jpg"></div>
