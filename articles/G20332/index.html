    <p>  To date, the complex continues to be built, a new microdistrict will appear here, but many houses have already been commissioned.  Most of the residents are satisfied with their purchase.  The nearest metro station is only 15 minutes, in the near future, the transport network, both terrestrial and underground, will only develop.  Car owners note that the road situation has already improved: the Warsaw highway has become an order of magnitude faster, some traffic jams will eliminate modern road junctions, bridges and overpasses.  Many gave their preference to this complex due to the affordable cost of apartments, as well as a real opportunity to apply for a mortgage on favorable terms.  Compared to other complexes located in Shcherbinka, apartments here are the most budget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is embarrassing </h2><p>  Some note that due to the protracted construction, they were afraid to get into the ‚Äúunfinished building‚Äù, but the houses are renting out, they correspond to all descriptions: warm and spacious apartments, landscaped area.  Yes, some infrastructure facilities are lacking, for example, schools, but according to the assurance of the developer in the near future this problem will be eliminated. </p>

    <p>  By the way, if you are interested in Scherbink, new buildings from the Morton developer in particular, you need to take into account one fundamental point.  More recently, Morton Group merged with PIK Group of Companies, offering its fans excellent co-production projects. </p><h2>  LCD "Calypso-2" </h2><p>  The company "Teribersky Bereg" offers no less attractive for life new buildings (Shcherbinka).  The first project was implemented and commissioned in 2011, now the developer, taking into account the mistakes and shortcomings of the past, decided to build a more modern complex.  A monolithic four-section house of varying number of storeys is how the project looks.  The house is almost finished, the finishing work is being completed, so very soon the happy owners of the apartments here will receive the keys and will be able to move in.  The developer did not have to worry about the infrastructure, because all the necessary facilities are already within walking distance.  Two steps from the house - a comprehensive school, and across the road - another.  Residents of the microdistrict have certain privileges in this regard: their children will be placed in schools in the first place, without any difficulties.  Pleased with the variety of planning decisions, due to which it was possible to choose an apartment that meets the preferences of customers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The developer is reliable, on his account dozens of successfully implemented projects in Moscow and the Moscow region.  Those who purchased real estate here were pleasantly surprised by the state of the environment: there are no harmful industries, there are a lot of greenery, parks, and the forest is literally at hand.  That is why we strongly recommend that you take a closer look at the complex, before renting the property you can buy an apartment here on favorable terms. </p><h2>  LCD "Prima Park" </h2><p>  Just 10 km from the Moscow Ring Road in the direction of the Warsaw highway, another rather large-scale project is being built - the Prima-Park residential complex.  So all those who bought apartments here are absolutely satisfied.  From the house to the metro station is only 10 minutes in a calm step.  Many were attracted by the Moscow residence permit, which provided the opportunity to enjoy all the advantages of the capital's inhabitants.  And all this combined with a fairly affordable cost of apartments. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Car owners complain about numerous traffic jams and congestion on the roads, sometimes it is simply impossible to leave the district on the Warsaw highway.  But this phenomenon is temporary, the Warsaw highway is currently in the process of reorganization, like other highways in Moscow and Moscow region.  To date, residents of the complex are dissatisfied with transport accessibility.  Namely, buses do not run between the district and the capital every 10-15 minutes, as the developer assured. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  In all other respects, the complex is excellent.  The apartments are bright and spacious, many planning decisions help to get a really comfortable home at a reasonable price.  The complex has its own underground parking, has a kindergarten, school, shopping and entertainment center - in a word, all the necessary infrastructure is presented.  There is also a house territory equipped: enough playgrounds and sports grounds. </p><h2>  LCD "White Star" </h2><p>  We try to offer the best new buildings Shcherbinka.  Reviews of customers and residents of the houses allow you to make the most objective review.  Of course, economy class new buildings are very popular, but for sure among our readers there are those who can afford housing in a comfort class house.  A bright representative of an excellent new building (Shcherbinka) was the White Star residential complex. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Many equity holders were disappointed by the protracted construction: the developer postponed the deadline several times.  Future residents complain about the insufficient number of parking spaces in the underground parking.  Given that almost every family has a car, and some have more than one, the developer needed to build on the number of apartments in each house. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Along with this, it is simply impossible to remain silent about the advantages that interest holders have noted for themselves.  First of all, this is a great location, perhaps the best in Shcherbinka.  Developed infrastructure, represented not only by shops and entertainment centers, but also by kindergartens, schools, bank branches.  The houses are built on monolithic technology, buyers can choose an apartment, both with black and with fine finish.  If you do not want to burden yourself with repairs, pay attention to the opportunity to purchase an apartment with a turnkey finish.  Today you can find enough reviews that the complex is far away in the not very quiet area of ‚Äã‚ÄãShcherbinka - this is where the aircraft begin to decline.  In fact, active interest holders, who are worried and interested in the progress of construction, visit the construction site annually, note that the plane does not bring any discomfort, moreover, they do not decrease so much as to interfere with a full life. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We presented to your attention the best new buildings of the city of Shcherbinki, only those complexes that are designed for the most comfortable life of the newly made Muscovites.  Shcherbinka really has become a more popular destination, because it is located quite close to the capital, provided with all the necessary infrastructure.  That is why, if you are at the stage of choosing real estate, pay special attention to the new buildings of Shcherbinka: for sure you will find here something really special for yourself.  We hope that our review will help you in choosing. </p>
