We still need to figure out how to pack the present.  Everyone knows that they are greeted by clothes, but for some reason many do not apply this proverb to gifts.  But a beautifully packaged present creates the necessary festive atmosphere.  This article will discuss how to create DIY gift wrapping. </p><h2>  Box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bodas.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gift wrap" class="if uuid-2427801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2427801.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way to pack a gift is to put it in a cardboard box.  But in order not to seem like a trivial person, you can make a wrapper yourself.  For its manufacture you will need a dense cardboard.  Print a gift box template.  With your own hands you will create an original box.  Cut the stencil out of paper and transfer it to cardboard.  Dense material should be taken, preferably decorated with a print.  If you are betting on plain material, choose something textured or embossed.  For example, there is an interesting velvet cardboard or thick matte sheets with a glossy pattern.  When you cut the box on the stencil, you need to bend it along the dotted lines.  DIY gift wrapping, assembled, ready.  If necessary, you can decorate it with accessories, buttons, threads or lace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Suitcase </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="packing a briefcase" class="if uuid-2427806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2427806.jpg"></div><p>  Do you want to pack something very small?  Then transform the matchbox.  You will need only that part of it in which matches were previously invested.  DIY gift wrapping is done according to the following principle.  You put a gift, such as earrings or a ring, in a miniature box.  Fill a box of confetti or cut paper, and then wrap it with colored paper.  You can choose something craft for this purpose.  But textured paper is better not to use.  She will look out of place.  When the packaging is ready, it needs to be transformed.  To do this, cut brown lining.  Make 6 circles, 2 long rectangles and one short.  Place the halves of the circles on the corners of the briefcase.  Tie the resulting packaging with long brown rectangles, and make a handle out of the short part. </p><h2>  House </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cookie house" class="if uuid-2427811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2427811.jpg"></div><p>  You can make such a gift wrapping with your own hands for any holiday.  You can fill a cardboard house with both cookies and sweets.  And it is not necessary to present a gift to friends for the <span>New Year.</span>  You can make such a gift to a person who has done you a favor or helped something.  The photo above shows a step-by-step master class.  DIY gift wrapping will be created using the template.  You need to print it, and then transfer it to thick paper.  If you want to make a dense box, then you can not translate the form on the stencil, but stick the paper blank on cardboard and cut everything out along the contour.  Now glue the house and put tracing paper or parchment paper in it.  The packaging is ready.  You can fill it with sweets and tie a beautiful bow. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Kulek </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bag packing" class="if uuid-2427819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2427819.jpg"></div><p>  Such packaging is perfect for a sweet gift.
