Caucasus in the fate and work of Lermontov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mikhail Yurievich Lermontov is a famous Russian poet.  Thanks to him, the world knows such classic works as ‚ÄúThe Hero of Our Time‚Äù and many poems.  Over the course of a short twenty-seven year life, many different changes took place in the poet's fate.  This can be explained both by coincidence, and by the romantic adventurous nature of this person.  In the life of Lermontov was the Caucasus, which influenced him and his work most significantly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov link to the Caucasus" class="if uuid-2166178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166178.jpg?1550936798"></div><p>  In the Caucasus, the writer found himself through links.  There were only two, but the reasons were different.  Let us consider below in the article why Mikhail Yuryevich was exiled and when, what were the most important events that influenced his work. </p><h2>  The first link to the Caucasus </h2><p>  Lermontov in 1837 was expecting a coup.  After the death of A. S. Pushkin, he wrote the poem "The Death of the Poet", in which he fiercely accused the authorities in what happened.  This poem brought glory to the young poet, they began to know about him in many circles of society.  But the ruling emperor Nicholas I at that time decided to send the writer to the Caucasus, where military operations took place in those years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov‚Äôs first reference to the Caucasus" class="if uuid-2166170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166170.jpg?1550936798"></div><p>  As you know, Lermontov stayed in exile for only a few months.  This can be explained by the efforts of the poet‚Äôs grandmother, who rescued him.  But during this time he still managed to gain some impressions, to bring something new to his old literary ideas.  It is also known that in 1837, Mikhail studied the Azerbaijani language. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In those very few months of exile in 1837, Lermontov was imbued as much as possible with the life of the peoples of the Caucasus.  He dressed in Circassian style, carried weapons, like them, spent the night on almost bare ground with his brothers in battle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov‚Äôs reference to the Caucasus reason" class="if uuid-2166200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166200.jpg?1550936798"></div><h2>  Impact on creativity </h2><p>  Despite the short time, Lermontov‚Äôs first reference to the Caucasus turned out to be very impressive for him.  He also admired nature, mountain, rivers.  Lermontov in this period wrote many of his poems on the beauty of these places. </p><p>  After the first link, the writer finally finished the world famous works ‚ÄúDemon‚Äù and ‚ÄúMtsyri‚Äù.  In addition, we can say that the first link left many more good memories.  It did not last long, but during this time the author of famous lines managed to visit many places in the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Caucasus in the fate and work of Lermontov" class="if uuid-2166202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166202.jpg?1550936798"></div><h2>  Reasons for the second link </h2><p>  At one of the balls held in the house of a noble woman, on February 16, 1840, the Frenchman Barant challenged Lermontov to a duel.  The reason for the quarrel between the two people is unknown, but there are some suggestions.  To Barant, perhaps someone showed an insulting verse that Lermontov wrote a long time ago about another person.  But the Frenchman took it personally.  It is also likely that they were just random victims of the love affairs of the ladies present at this ball.  Barant probably heard unflattering things about himself from the writer in female society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Dueling in those days, as you know, was banned.  At the battle itself (February 18, two days after the quarrel), both opponents fought with swords first.  Barant managed to scratch Lermontov, whose blade later broke.  Therefore, they switched to pistols.  The ambassador‚Äôs son missed, and the opponent decided to shoot to the side.  So they finished the duel and just broke up. </p><p>  After some time, higher-level people learned about the duel.  In April 1840, the court decided to send the writer into exile in the Caucasus.  It is known that this was influenced by the decision of Emperor Nicholas I. He also decided to join Lermontov to the Tenginsky Infantry Regiment, and he himself ordered that he always be involved in battles. </p><p>  Barant himself was not prosecuted for participating in a duel.  This is explained by the fact that he was the son of the French ambassador, so he easily avoided the fate of Lermontov himself, against whom he gave false information that he was aiming not at the air, but at him.  The writer himself denied this and spoke only the truth, but still it did not help him. </p><p>  The true version of the duel put Barant in a bad light, so he, thanks to his connections and kinship, did everything possible to prove his truth.  And unfortunately, even after writing the verse "Death of the Poet" by Mikhail, because of which he was sent to the first link, he did not like the poet.  That is why everything turned against the writer, who had to go to the places of military operations again. </p><h2>  Battle on the river Valerik </h2><p>  Mikhail Yuryevich became famous not only as a writer and artist, but also as a valiant fighter.  40 kilometers from the fortress of Grozny (now it is the city of Grozny - the capital of the Chechen Republic) on July 11, 1840, during the second exile of Lermontov to the Caucasus, the famous battle on the Valerik River took place.  In the official papers of those years he is described as a courageous soldier, firmly and boldly performing his duties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The writer in those days wrote the poem "Valerik" in which he does not say a word about his merits.  He also painted a picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov link to the Caucasus" class="if uuid-2171190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2171190.jpg?1550936798"></div><h2>  Courage during Lermontov‚Äôs second exile to the Caucasus </h2><p>  At the end of the summer of 1840, the poet fell into the cavalry of the Galafeev detachment.  This can be considered another significant event during the time of Lermontov‚Äôs exile to the Caucasus in 1840. </p><p>  Since August, there have been many battles with the Highlanders.  And during one of these battles, October 10, 1840 wounded R.I. Dorokhov, who led a team of Cossacks, demoted officers, and other volunteers.  Without thinking twice, he handed over control to Lermontov as a worthy, cold-blooded and brave man. </p><p>  Thanks to the courage of Mikhail Yuryevich and honor on the battlefields, they wanted to transfer him to the guard and present awards more than once, but all this was unsuccessful.  He did not receive a single order, because he was in good standing with Nicholas I. The memory of his exploits through numerous letters has reached us. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov reference to the Caucasus in 1840" class="if uuid-2166203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166203.jpg?1550936798"></div><h2>  Deadly duel </h2><p>  In January 1841, the writer was going to get a vacation ticket for two months in order to go to St. Petersburg and do only literature.  But the grandmother, who always had a very strong influence on Mikhail‚Äôs life, was against such grandson‚Äôs hobbies.  She saw him as a soldier.  Therefore, Lermontov went back to the Caucasus.  He rode, stopping in some cities, until he ended up in Pyatigorsk, where he rented a modest apartment.  And it was the subsequent turn of events that turned out to be decisive for the young talented person. </p><p>  In Pyatigorsk, Lermontov and Nikolai Martynov had a big fight.  They already knew each other: they studied together at the school of guards ensigns.  And then several times crossed in life.  <span>Nikolai Martynov,</span> as many people said about him, was handsome.  Now he was a retired major.  Lermontov, however, allowed himself taunts and rude mocking jokes about him.  And then the retired major lost their nerves, and he challenged the writer to a duel on July 15, 1841. </p><p>  Martynov himself confessed in his testimony that he could not stand Lermontov‚Äôs nit-picking to his every word and his ridicule.  And indeed: the writer only respectful for some, but arrogant to others, as A.I.  Vasilchikov, who was a second in a fatal duel. </p><p>  According to the main version, Lermontov shot into the air on the battlefield.  But Martynov aimed directly at the enemy, and killed him.  The writer at that time was only 26 years old.  He was buried on July 17 at the Pyatigorsk cemetery, where many of Mikhail's acquaintances and friends came. </p><h2>  The influence of the second link to creativity </h2><p>  In 1840, the novel Hero of Our Time was published.  The writer already had certain sketches, prototypes and ideas in his head even before the links.  Then he wrote separate chapters, and after all, the book became one complete work.  Since Lermontov was an officer in the Russian army and fought in the Caucasus, the writer transferred a lot of his life and personal experience to his creation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Caucasus in the life of Lermontov" class="if uuid-2171504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2171504.jpg?1550936798"></div><p>  For example, the author described very clearly the features of the life of Caucasians, their culture and traditions, as well as nature.  In the Bel chapter, he fully describes the life of Chechens.  Thanks to such a detailed narrative, the novel for the most part relates to realism. </p><h2>  Artist writer </h2><p>  Few people know, but the writer is known not only for his literary works, he was also engaged in art.  He painted with pencil, oil, watercolor.  The Caucasus played a big role in Lermontov‚Äôs life.  Among his works there are a lot of those that were written in the time of exile or in memory of them (for example, ‚ÄúRemembering the Caucasus‚Äù).  In the landscapes, the Caucasian lands are clearly visible: mountains, forests, fields.  Lermontov also painted people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Lermontov‚Äôs second reference to the Caucasus" class="if uuid-2166192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2166192.jpg?1550936798"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Caucasus had a great influence on the fate and work of Lermontov.  Both links to those parts were very fateful, but they were very different from each other.  The first was very favorable for the writer in terms of his work, but the second turned out to be, it can be said, crucial for life. </p><p>  The reasons for Lermontov‚Äôs references to the Caucasus were also different.  In 1837, Mikhail was exiled after he wrote the poem "On the Death of a Poet", where he blamed the authorities.  And in 1840 he was again sent into exile due to a duel with Barant, after which everything turned against the writer. </p><p>  But one thing is for sure: if it were not for the Caucasus, we would not have the pleasure of reading such great works as ‚ÄúThe Hero of Our Time‚Äù and many poems, in their final form, with vivid colorful descriptions of the life of the Caucasian peoples and the nature of those parts.  As well as many colorful vibrant landscapes.  The Caucasus in Lermontov‚Äôs life is one of the few places that really inspired the great writer, was his ‚Äúmuse‚Äù and outlet. </p>
