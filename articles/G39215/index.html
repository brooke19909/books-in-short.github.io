  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Falcon family: description, names and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The falcon family includes at least 60 species of predator birds.  They are common on different corners of the planets: from Eurasia to North America.  Small birds - dwarf falcons, also belong to this family.  More details about where it comes from, where it is distributed and what lifestyle birds of the falcon family lead will be considered in the article. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  For the first time several thousand years ago, hunting began along with birds of prey in the Far East.  And in the Middle Ages, the family of falcons began to be valued and protected even more, and those who decided to offend them somehow were surely severely punished. </p><p>  In the 17th century, the extermination of these birds by hunters and farmers began.  They were considered pests of agriculture.  The one who managed to get falcon eggs was awarded.  Stuffed animals were mainly made of birds. </p><p>  Today the family of falcons is protected by the state and most of them are in the Red Book.  However, their numbers suffer mainly due to the large number of chemicals that spread through air or land. </p><h2>  Spread </h2><div class="photo" data-original="leesbird.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="falcon bird" class="if uuid-3109894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109894.jpg"></div><p>  It is believed that the homeland of the falcon family is South America.  Modern species are probably relatives of the ancients, who first spread to dense forests.  Today, there are only grassy plains.  Photos of the falcon family can be seen below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Breeding </h2><div class="photo" data-original="creagrus.home.montereybay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small falcon bird" class="if uuid-3109897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109897.jpg"></div><p>  As you know, falcons acquire pairs in a long amount of time.  The male attracts the female by pursuing her in the air.  He performs various deadly stunts, which are breathtaking.  The male catches the prey, takes off above the female and throws it to her in such a way that she could catch it.  The female does this, turning in the air on her back, and then falling.  During the mating season, you can hear the characteristic sounds of representatives of the falcon family, similar to clucking. </p><p>  Usually birds do not build nests, but lay their eggs in a pre-observed and safe place on the rocks, in hollows or even eaves of houses.  The male and female hatch the offspring together, periodically replacing each other, and the mother sits longer, as the male must still go hunting to feed the family.  Chicks are born already covered with white plumage, which after a while changes color to gray.  Representatives of the falcon family take care of the offspring even after the chicks learn to fly, which they do in a few weeks. </p><h2>  Falcons </h2><div class="photo" data-original="animal.memozee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small bird of prey of the falcon family" class="if uuid-3109903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109903.jpg"></div><p>  The numerous genus of these birds of prey is widely known throughout the world.  Narrowly wedge-like wings allow them to deftly maneuver in the air.  Moreover, falcons can accelerate to an impressive high speed, which allows them to catch prey in a minimum amount of time.  Of all the representatives, the peregrine falcon is most famous, which is considered not only the fastest bird, but also the fastest animal in the world.  It can reach a flight speed of up to 90 m / s. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The diet of falcons depends on the species.  For example, a bird such as the kestrel usually preys on small rodents.  Other members of the genus can eat larger animals.  There is even such a kind of hunting as falconry.  People involved in this, specially train feathered predators in this craft. </p><p>  Scientist Louis Lefebvre from McGill University determined the IQ level of birds, which revealed that falcons are among the most intelligent. </p><p>  Species of the genus include kestrels, males, brown <span>falcons, saker falcons,</span> gyrfalcons and many other birds, widely distributed around the world. </p><h2>  Kobchik </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.treknature.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="falcon family" class="if uuid-3109905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109905.jpg"></div><p>  This is a small <span>bird of the falcon family,</span> which belongs to the species of predators.  Its appearance resembles a kestrel, but has a number of distinctive characteristics.  She has a short beak and wide wings.  The male is characterized by an almost black color, the female is gray with stripes. </p><p>  The diet of the bird includes large insects, rarely small rodents and lizards.  Maybe even catch a sparrow or dove.  Prefers to go hunting mainly during the day.  Offspring start in abandoned nests, hollows, holes. </p><p>  This migratory bird can be found in Eurasia, Africa, South America, on the coast of rivers and lakes. </p><h2>  Saker Falcon </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="large bird of the falcon family" class="if uuid-3109906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109906.jpg"></div><p>  Saker Falcon is a small bird of prey of the falcon family, the most common in Russia and Kazakhstan.  It can also be found in Siberia, Transbaikalia, Central and Central Asia, and some parts of Europe.  It is a nomadic bird with a small number, therefore in some places a reserve has been created for its breeding. </p><p>  Translated from the Siberian dialect, the word "Saker" is translated as "big hawk."  It is found in the Preobrazhensky dictionary.  Another meaning is also possible.  If you rely on the Turkic languages, it means "big, wrestler, strong man." </p><p>  The saker‚Äôs diet mainly includes small mammals, large lizards.  It can catch birds such as pigeons, partridges, grouse and others. </p><p>  Eggs are usually laid on rocks, hills, where they occupy other people's nests.  During the hatching of the offspring, the female sits on the eggs, and the male hunts and feeds the family.  Chicks make their first flight a month and a half after birth. </p><h2>  Gyrfalcon </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hbw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gyrfalcon" class="if uuid-3109909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107204/3109909.jpg"></div><p>  This is a fairly large bird of the falcon family.  The female is usually larger than the male.  The color of the bird can be from white to brownish-gray. </p><p>  Able to develop great speed in flight.  Flapping its wings, it quickly flies forward.  In appearance and screaming, the gyrfalcon is similar to a peregrine Falcon, except that it has a longer tail and a large physique. </p><p>  You can meet the gyrfalcon in various places.  It lives in some places in Europe, Asia, North America, Altai.  Isolated species can be found in other parts of the world. </p><p>  The diet of birds includes mammals, birds.  Usually the male, attacking with its paws, breaking her neck, catches prey, and the female in the nest plucks and freshens it. </p><p>  Gyrfalcons can look for a permanent pair after the second year of life.  They use abandoned nests located on rocks, hills, open slopes.  Usually the nests do not change, they can be covered with dry grass, moss. </p><p>  The number of birds is declining due to poaching.  Sometimes they fall into traps intended for arctic foxes, for example, in Taimyr.  Falling into a trap, gyrfalcons are unable to survive and die.  Over a year of such hunting, more than 12 representatives die.  Poaching of these birds, which are then transported abroad for sale, is popular in Russia.  The price of 1 bird is about 30 thousand dollars abroad. </p><p>  Hunting with the help of gyrfalcons, which were specially trained to catch large prey, was also common earlier.  They are divided into several types, depending on the value: white, Icelandic, ordinary (Norwegian) and red, which are valued in many countries.  Gyrfalcons kill prey, attacking it from above, and then carry it away in strong claws. </p>
