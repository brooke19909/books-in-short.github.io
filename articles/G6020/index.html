Recently, this plant is very fond of gardeners.  Eustoma is decorated with both private flower beds and city beds.  And some girls even grow a beautiful flower on the windowsill.  If you do not like to mess around in the earth, but want to have exotic at home, then there is a way out.  Make an eustoma from beads.  Read the master class with a step-by-step description. </p><h2>  What is eustoma </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eustoma bead" class="if uuid-2233322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233322.jpg"></div><p>  This exotic flower has a scientific name - lisianthus.  It is considered a perennial.  But in our Russian climate it is impossible to keep the roots of the flower in the cold.  Therefore, eustoma has to be planted every year. </p><p>  In appearance, the flower looks like a rose.  The lisianthus inflorescence is dense, there are many petals.  But their color is most often white with purple or lilac splashes.  The stems are dense, but, unlike a rose, they are smooth and non-spiky.  A very interesting shape in the leaves.  It is not just oval, but elongated and tiered.  Needlewomen are often inspired by the beauty of this flower.  Therefore, bead eustoma becomes a standard decoration of bouquets. </p><h2>  What will be required for the manufacture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded eustoma flowers" class="if uuid-2233329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233329.jpg"></div><p>  To create an eustoma from beads you will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Wire.  It is her best to use for the frame.  Petals of flowers will simply bend and give them any desired shape.  You can use fishing line.  But it will be relevant only if you plan to use a flower not for making a bouquet, but for decorating jewelry. </li><li>  Beads.  It is advisable to take not small beads, but those that are medium or large in size.  Then it will turn out to make a fairly large flower, which will bring the craft closer to the size of the prototype.  What color do you need to buy beads?  White, purple or lilac, yellow and two or three shades of green. </li><li>  Scissors or nippers.  If you plan to make flowers from thick wire, it is better to use small nippers.  Scissors are suitable for such work, but you will very quickly disable the tool.  If you use a fishing line, then you can use a clerical knife. </li><li>  Green threads.  They will need to wrap the stalk of the product. </li></ul><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beads eustoma master class" class="if uuid-2233314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233314.jpg"></div><p>  Collect eustoma from beads should be in parts.  To begin with, we will do all the workpieces.  The easiest flower to make is the creation of a core.  We take a wire 20-30 cm long and string 6 beads on it.  We fix them in the middle so that we get a small ring.  Now you need to dial 4 more beads on one of the ends of the wire.  Thread the working end through 4 beads.  You should get a circle with a filled middle.  How to do this, you can see in the picture above.  Thus, you need to create from 7 to 10 stamens.  Now you need to twist all the wires into a single whole so that you get a finished core. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Collect the petals </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="composition of eustoma flowers from beads" class="if uuid-2233320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233320.jpg"></div><p>  We continue our master class.  Beaded eustoma consists of 5-7 leaves.  How to make them?  They are made according to a drawing resembling a shell of a snail.  Eustoma flowers from beads can be made both in classic white and using bright beads.  Here everything will depend on your imagination and ideas. </p><p>  We take a wire 40 cm long. Now we need to create the core of the sheet.  It is made in the same way that we made stamens.  Only in size the base of the petal should be slightly larger, and, therefore, we make it not from 6, but from 15 small balls, and we supplement the 6th by passing through the center.  The whole process can be seen in the diagram above.  Now row by row we supplement the petal, putting on the working end of the wire, first 12, then 14, then 16 beads, etc. Each new row should cling to the center.  Thus, the petal will grow and keep its shape well.  There should be at least 7 rows on each side. </p><h2>  Make leaves </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how beautifully to assemble a branch of eustoma from beads" class="if uuid-2233326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2233326.jpg"></div><p>  The weaving pattern of all parts of the eustoma is very similar.  Therefore, we will produce leaves in the same way as petals or stamens.  Although the difference will still be.  First you need to make a core.  Naturally, it will be much larger than that of the petals.  The first oval should consist of 36 beads, an additional part of the ring - of 18. The core is ready. </p><p>  We stretch the end of the wire through the 5 lower beads and begin to build the sheet down.  The oval will consist of 14 small balls.  They are fixed in the middle, and an oval is made from the opposite side.  The number of beads in the next row should be twice as many as in each previous one.  Thus, we collect the sheet until its size satisfies you. </p><h2>  Collect a bouquet </h2><p>  When all parts of the future bead eustoma flower arrangement are ready, you can start assembling.  First you should make a bud.  To do this, gird the core with petals.  Moreover, they should not fit tightly against each other, but create an overlap.  We twist into the tourniquet all the ends of the wire that remain from the bud.  They should evenly place leaves. </p><p>  How to beautifully assemble a branch of eustoma from beads?  It should be remembered that an exotic flower looks like a bush rose.  Consequently, up to 5 buds can be on one branch.  Therefore, we attach one collected flower to another with a wire.  When the branch is ready, you need to wrap its stalk with green thread. </p><h2>  Where else can bead flowers be used? </h2><p>  With a bouquet of beaded eustoma, you can decorate a room, for example, a hall or a kitchen.  If you do not like simple decor, but prefer utilitarian things, then you can very well stick a small branch of eustoma to the hairpin and decorate it with her hair.  Also, flowers from beads can become part of the design of the gift composition.  For example, in a box with cupcakes you can put a sprig of eustoma to give the gift a non-trivial look. </p>
