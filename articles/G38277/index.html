    <p>  The main asset of the Lazarevskoye resort is the sea.  But not all beaches are clean and well maintained.  Near the DiCris Guesthouse, the beach area is just wonderful.  This is a great place to relax with children.  The hotel has its own kitchen.  You can make sure yourself that only fresh food is prepared here.  And it all costs quite inexpensively. </p><p>  The hotel itself is always very clean, both in the rooms and on the premises.  Especially pleased with the presence of a good pool, which is constantly cleaned.  There is a convenient entry for children.  For them, on the territory there is a playground with swings. </p><p>  The DiCris Hotel (Lazarevskoye, 32 Tormakhova St.) has a very favorable location.  Near the water park, shops, markets.  The beach is only 15 minutes away, but this walk can be exciting.  On the way to the sea, you can look into the local dining rooms, where it is very tasty and inexpensive. </p>
