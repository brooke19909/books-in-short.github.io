Many want to know where it is.  It is located between the metro stations "Vladykino" and "Bibirevo".  They, in turn, belong to the Serpukhov-Timiryazev branch. </p><h2>  How to get to the station </h2><p>  Every day, 77,000 passengers pass through this station.  It is important to know that Otradnoye does not have ground lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Otradnoe" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/405401.jpg" width="333"></div>  Therefore, you can get to the station only through underground passages, which are located on the streets of Sannikov, Khachaturian, Northern Boulevard and Decembrists.  Many tourists, unfortunately, do not know this.  What is remarkable for the northern section of Otradnoye?  There are revolving dead ends where trains stand at night.

    <h2>  What does the station look like </h2><p>  Otradnoe is a station of the so-called shallow laying.  In addition, it is single-vaulted.  The attention is drawn to the black marble walls of the station, as well as the floor, made of quite dark and beautiful granite.  The arch of Otradnoy is made of reinforced concrete, on it you can see partitions decorated with panels.  It depicts <span>the Decembrist uprising of</span> 1825.  Many sights are famous for <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>Metro</span> "Otradnoe" can be called one of them, at least for this interesting panel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Authors of the architectural project and panels </h2><p>  V.S. Volovich, as well as L.N. Popov, worked on the creation of the station's architectural design.  A panel was created by L. Yu. Annenkova together with I.V. Nikolaev.  It should be noted that it turned out great.  It invariably attracts attention. </p><h2>  What is remarkable is the Otradnoye metro area </h2><p>  This area is undoubtedly worthy of attention.  There are many interesting and beautiful places.  For example, on Khachaturian street there is a religious complex, which includes: the chapel of the holy martyr Panteleimon, a mosque called Yardem, the Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas of Myra, the synagogue.  It is also planned to build a Buddhist temple here.  In addition, there is an administrative and educational complex. </p><h2>  Yardam Mosque, Tatar store </h2><p>  The construction of the mosque started in 1996, in the fall.  The idea was put forward by the Muslim association "Yardem", the Tatar charity foundation "Hilal", as well as a number of interested people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro area Otradnoe" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/403651.jpg" width="600"></div>  The mosque was built with their money.  The building was ready in early autumn 1997.  It is built of red brick, there are also a couple of minarets, and this is what it looks like mosques located in Central Asia.  The result was a very impressive architectural structure.  "Yardem", its name, is translated from the Tatar language as "help."  Many Muslims liked the mosque; they regularly visit it.  Some travel from far to the Otradnoye metro station to get here.
