  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to open an account in a savings bank and a little history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank of Russia is the most reliable, stable, experienced bank.  The 171 year of its history is no longer just a figure.  This bank has become the benchmark for all others.  The rich experience in banking services has grown into something more.  Sberbank is developing literally before our eyes, and in recent years it has been pleasing to its customers. </p><p>  His commercials ‚Äútake it for granted‚Äù and make you think about your financial situation, about your awareness of savings, money transactions, savings and profits.  The bank's management really works for the benefit of the Russians, allowing them to join in the civilized ways of managing their own money. </p><p>  Let's not hide, not so long ago (10 years ago), to open an account with Sberbank was a problem.  Then, even the Russians did not receive bank cards, <span>salary projects</span> did not open <span>,</span> there were no terminals and ATMs.  And only pensioners and women who received child allowance (as well as other <span>social benefits)</span> were forced to open an account <span>.</span>  To conclude an agreement with the bank, it was necessary to stand a huge queue.  And God forbid, if you got to the bank with this on the day you accrue your pension or benefits - it‚Äôs your turn, to put it mildly, to condemn.  Moreover, the very <span>conclusion of the contract</span> lasted for ages, after which it was necessary to defend another same long line at another cash desk in order to deposit 10 rubles into your opened account (a prerequisite). </p><p>  Since then, much has been done in order to open an account with Sberbank was easier. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With the introduction of cards and the installation of terminals, the queues significantly decreased, though not immediately.  It took people a while to get used to it.  But the innovations at Sberbank did not end there.  Additional cash desks were opened so that the queue was distributed between them.  Then they put up convenient barriers so that people knew where the end is and where the beginning of the line is. </p><p>  The most pleasant move on the part of the bank's administration was a survey of citizens.  Everyone could indicate in the form which employee and why he did not like what exactly he would like to change in the bank for better service.  After that, the bank employees became more affable, administrators appeared in the hall, willingly directing each visitor to the desired window. </p><p>  And now, opening an account with Sberbank has become easier than ever.  Of course, it was not suddenly possible to conclude a contract (it is still not a matter of minutes, especially if you take into account the time for processing an individual plastic card).  However, the client can now wait for his agreement on a soft couch, without having to run up to the window nervously, because the bank has got a radio that calls the citizen when everything is ready.  In this case, all the efforts to open an account are undertaken by a bank employee.  The client can only sign in the contract. </p><p>  Another innovation, which was followed by other banks, were additional offers on deposits.  The transfer of salary to the card is a savings account, the storage of company assets is a current account, for additional income in the form of interest, an accumulative account.  That's what the bank pleases us today.  Opening a <span>current account,</span> like others today, became possible without visiting the bank via the Internet.  In Sberbank, this service is called SberbankOnline.  But only on condition that you are already a client of the bank. </p><p>  To open an account with Sberbank for the first time, you will need to visit a bank branch with a passport.  The consultant in the hall will direct you to a specialist who should tell you which account (for what purposes), for how long and in what currency you need.  The employee will talk about the nuances, and then provide you with a contract in two copies, one will remain with you.  You will also need a signature sample, which will be needed for further comparison of the signature, so you should remember how you signed in this sample.  If you wish, you can provide a bank employee with a phone number so that SMS messages about income and expenses on the account will come to him.  After that, you can deposit money into your personal account in the cash register.  You will leave the bank with an agreement, a <span>savings book,</span> and after 2 weeks you will be able to receive a personal plastic card for transactions through the terminal and the Internet. </p><p>  Having visited the bank, opening an account will bring you a lot of pleasant emotions (especially for a Soviet person): from quality service, lack of queues and the quickest possible preparation of documents. </p>
