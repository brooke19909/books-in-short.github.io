    <h2>  A bit about the cultural monument </h2><p>  So, it is worth considering in detail this attraction and its importance in the light of the world cultural heritage.  So, the Gomel Palace and Park Ensemble is a real historical complex, which includes several objects.  About them will be surely told later.  The complex is also a natural monument of republican significance.  The ensemble is located in Gomel, one of the largest cities in Belarus.  It is located on one of the banks <span>of the Sozh River,</span> unusually beautiful landscapes are spread around.  Its appearance dates back to the late XVIII - mid XIX centuries.  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to talk about why this palace and park ensemble in Gomel is a whole complex.  The answer to this question is absolutely simple - it includes many different objects, among which there are historical, cultural and architectural monuments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Gomel Palace and Park Ensemble - what does the complex include? </h2><p>  Now that we have a little acquainted with this object, it‚Äôs worth talking about what sights it includes in its composition.  If we talk about numbers, then there are at least 9 separate elements, among which there are: </p><ul><li>  An ancient settlement, Gomel used to be at this place (during the Middle Ages). </li><li>  The park, which was founded in the XIX century. </li><li>  <span>Palace of the Rumyantsevs</span> and Paskevichs. </li><li>  Ferris Tower, which is located in the old conservatory. </li><li>  Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, the date of its construction dates back to the XIX century. </li><li>  Various outbuildings of the time. </li><li>  Park zone, preserving the natural environment and landscape. </li><li>  Family tomb of the Paskevich family. </li></ul><h2>  What territory does the complex occupy? </h2><p>  Now that we have considered the main objects, which include the Gomel Palace and Park Ensemble, it is worth talking about the lands on which it is located.  The entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe historical complex occupies a rather large territory, it is about 34 hectares.  The nature in this area is truly unique, which is why the park has earned a special status.  Many amazing plants grow here, in total there are more than 5 thousand trees in the complex.  Among them you can see birch, linden, chestnut, maple, acacia.  Also rarer plants grow here, for example, Amur velvet, ginkgo biloba and others.  The center of the composition of the entire park is a wonderful palace, which is made in the style of classicism.  So, the local nature and the territory of the park were considered, and now it is worth telling about all the objects of the complex in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Palace of the Rumyantsevs and Paskevichs - general information </h2><p>  We have already said a few words about this palace, but it is worth considering separately.  Of course, it has already become clear that 2 families are connected with this palace: the Rumyantsevs and the Paskevichs.  The most interesting places for inspection are those located in the central part of the building on the ground floor.  Here were held festive receptions and other events.  Throughout the history of its existence, the palace building was destroyed several times, and it had to be restored.  The building was especially badly damaged, like many other objects of cultural heritage, during the years of World War II.  After it, the restoration of the palace was organized, which was completed already in the 1960s.  What can be seen in the palace now is a skillful reconstruction, in which all the rooms were close to their original appearance.  The most important of them is the columned hall.  This is the most extensive room in the entire building.  The hall consists of two floors, many events took place here, such as receptions, celebrations, etc. The space of this room is designed so that an unusually beautiful panorama of the hall opens through three large doorways. </p>

    <h2>  Observation tower </h2><p>  So, a description was given of the very center of the composition of the park - the Palace of the Rumyantsevs and Paskevichs.  However, this is far from all that the Gomel Palace and Park Ensemble boasts.  There is also another interesting structure, which is located on its territory, is the observation tower.  It is located on the territory of the complex, in the Winter Garden (it will be discussed later).  The building appeared in the XIX century, when the production building of the sugar factory was located here.  Then this tower was used as a pipe for the removal of smoke, which was obtained as a result of burning various materials.  However, after some time, in the 1880s, it was decided to organize a park here, as a result of which some factory buildings were converted to park facilities.  Where the main <span>sugar production</span> was concentrated <span>,</span> a greenhouse was located, which received a new name - the Winter Garden.  The tower now served as a park facility, was used as a survey.  During the Great Patriotic War, this building was severely damaged, on its walls were traces of fragments of shells and bullets.  Only in 2007 its reconstruction began and recently it opened to visitors. </p>

    <h2>  Winter Garden </h2><p>  Thus, the famous observation tower and the palace, in which the museum now operates, were considered.  Gomel Palace and Park Ensemble includes many more objects that need to be told.  A few words have already been said about the Winter Garden in the complex.  It is located in the premises of a former sugar factory.  Its area is about 245 square meters.  Over 25 species of various plants are exhibited here, in total there are more than 600 copies.  In the complex‚Äôs Winter Garden you can see truly rare plants, some of them grow only in a subtropical climate, for example, magnolia, coffee tree, figs, palm trees of different types, lemon, avocado and others.  Also in the Winter Garden you can see animals: rabbits, turtles and guinea pigs, which will be very entertaining for both adults and young visitors. </p><h2>  Tomb of the Paskevich family </h2><p>  Also on the territory of the complex is a family tomb and a chapel, which belonged to the family of famous princes Paskevich.  It was erected at the end of the 19th century.  This object is made in the "Russian style", here you can clearly trace the features of typical Moscow architecture, which was popular in the 17th century.  This is a really complicated building.  It is made of brick.  8 representatives of the Paskevich family are buried here.  This object is of great value as a monument of history and culture. </p>
