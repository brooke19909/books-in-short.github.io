We are often interested in the numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãof some parameters, as well as their comparison with other, but known to us quantities.  Very often, such questions come to the mind of children, and parents have to answer them. </p><p>  What is the volume of the earth?  It can be difficult to answer the question, because the brain is very reluctant to remember those quantities that it rarely has to apply in life.  If you heard the answer to this question a long time ago, today you are unlikely to remember it, since it has not been useful to you since then. </p><p>  Before giving an exact answer and comparing the volume of the Earth with the quantities known to us, we plunge into the history of geometry.  After all, this science was originally created to measure various characteristics of our planet. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Geometry originated in ancient Egypt.  People very often needed (as now) to find distances between cities, measure certain objects, measure the area of ‚Äã‚Äãland that belonged to them.  Thanks to all this, a special science appeared - geometry (from the words "geo" - Earth, and "metros" - to measure).  And initially it came down only to application.  But for some measurements more complex calculations were required.  Then such philosophers and scientists as Pythagoras and Euclid appeared at the dawn of the development of this science. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>During construction, even at first glance, simple structures must be able to measure how much material will be used for construction, to calculate the distance between points and the <span>angles between straight</span> planes.</span>  <span>You also need to know the properties of simple geometric shapes.</span>  <span>Thus, the Egyptian pyramids, built in the 2-3 century BC.</span>  <span>e., amazed by the accuracy of their spatial relationships, proving that their builders knew many geometric positions and had a large base for accurate mathematical calculations.</span> </p><p>  <span>Then, with the development of geometry, it lost its original purpose and expanded its fields of application.</span>  <span>Today it is impossible to imagine any production without calculations using geometric methods.</span> </p><p>  <span>In the next section, we will talk about <span>methods for measuring</span> various geometric characteristics for different bodies.</span> </p>

    <h2>  How to measure the volume of the earth? </h2><p>  <span><span>And if the body is too large, for example, a planet, how to accurately measure its volume and surface area?</span></span>  <span><span>We have to resort to more interesting and sophisticated methods.</span></span> </p><p>  <span><span>Let's start from afar.</span></span>  <span><span>As you know, if you imagine a ball in two-dimensional space, you get a circle.</span></span>  <span><span>Suppose that from some point on a ball two rays fall into two different places close to each other.</span></span>  <span><span>If you look carefully, it will be seen that they fall to the surface at different angles.</span></span>  <span><span>Using simple geometric constructions, you can notice that from the center of the ball you can draw lines connecting these two points.</span></span>  <span><span>Between themselves, these lines will form a certain angle, which will correspond to the previously measured distance between these points.</span></span>  <span><span>Thus, we know the length of the arc corresponding to any angle.</span></span>  <span><span>Since everything is 360 degrees in a circle, we can easily find the circumference of a circle.</span></span>  <span><span>And from the formula for <span>the circumference,</span> we find the radius from which the volume is calculated using the well-known formula.</span></span> </p><p>  <span><span>In this way, the volume of large bodies, including celestial ones, is found.</span></span>  <span><span>It was used by the Greeks in ancient times to learn more about the Earth.</span></span>  <span><span>So they calculated the volume of the Earth.</span></span>  <span><span>Although, of course, these data are approximate, because there are a lot of errors that turn out to be unaccounted for with this method of measurement.</span></span> </p><p>  <span><span>Before giving an answer to the main question, we‚Äôll understand how such complex quantities are measured today with the smallest possible error.</span></span> </p>
