The population in it is growing rapidly, so the city is considered a very attractive place among developers.  The residential complex Kalina Park is a vivid example of this. </p>

This is instrumentation, metalworking, production of construction, sewing, furniture, food and other products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, Krasnodar is one of the three leaders, along with Moscow and St. Petersburg, in the pace and volume of construction of residential real estate.  Such high rates are ensured, including by the developer of the residential complex Kalina-Park - StroyTrest. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Kalina Park is located in the Prikubansky urban district of the city of Krasnodar, one of the best areas in terms of environmental conditions.  The developer tried to create such a home for its customers that would please them with clean air, tranquility and a picturesque view from the window.  Speaking specifically about the address at which Kalina-Park is located, this is the Russian village in the northern part of Krasnodar.  In fact, this is the same city.  The complex is located on the streets of <span>General Petrov,</span> Izmail and Komarov. </p>

    <h2>  Description and characteristics of the complex </h2><p>  The Kalina Park complex, according to the project, consists of seven brick houses.  Only low-rise residential buildings are located around, so the complex’s houses will be visible even from afar.  All permits can be seen on the official website of the developer. </p><p>  LCD "Kalina-Park" (Krasnodar) surrenders in several stages.  The deadline for the delivery of the latter is set for the end of 2017.  The complex was designed in the comfort class.  Housing stock consists mainly of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.  There are three rooms, but in a very limited amount.  Due to the demand, one-room apartments prevail.  All apartments are designed with balconies or loggias.  On the landing there are an average of 7-9 apartments. </p>

    <p>  Each section of the residential building is equipped with a passenger-and-freight elevator.  The complex will be equipped with its own gas boiler room.  Apartments in Kalina Park are rented out by the builder in a clean finish.  This includes the following: double-glazed windows, an entrance metal door, radiators, electricity and water meters are installed.  The walls are plastered, screed is carried out on the floor, an electric cable is laid out around the apartment. </p><p>  The safety of the residents of the complex is guaranteed by a closed courtyard, which cannot be reached by car.  In addition, the local area is equipped with video surveillance cameras. </p><h2>  Infrastructure: internal and external </h2><p>  According to the project of the developer, Kalina-Park (Krasnodar) is located in one of the most favorable areas of the city - the Russian village.  From it you can quickly get to anywhere in the city, because there is a lot of public transport. </p><p>  The territory will be equipped with everything necessary for children's games and adult relaxation.  This includes the construction of children's playgrounds and sports grounds for children, walking alleys with comfortable benches along the route for parents.  For owners of their own vehicles will be built two outdoor parking lots and parking for 201 cars. </p><p>  As for the external infrastructure, since Kalina-Park is located in the city, it enjoys the full right to dispose of the entire developed social infrastructure of Krasnodar.  On foot you can walk to a comprehensive school, kindergarten, pharmacy, shops.  Also nearby are supermarkets and the only 24-hour fitness center in Krasnodar. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  "Kalina-Park" managed to collect reviews from residents in sufficient quantities.  In any new building, they are both positive and negative. </p><p>  The positive ones are more related to the excellent choice by the developer of the location of the complex away from industrial enterprises and from the polluted atmosphere of the city, near the lake and the forest.  Also pleasing to buyers of apartments is that the houses are not very densely located, which allows the sun to penetrate the windows of the apartments, and the residents can easily walk along the alleys. </p><p>  Negative reviews are related to construction delays.  Some equity holders even turn to the courts to recover a penalty under an equity agreement.  Some are not happy with the condition of the roads around the complex.  But, probably, this problem will be subsequently solved by the developer. </p><h2>  Apartments, their cost </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the complex offers mainly apartments for small families: one-room and two-room.  The area of ​​the first is approximately 44 square meters, the cost is up to 36 thousand rubles per square meter.  Two rooms start at 58 square meters and end at 72 square meters.  Their cost per square meter is approximately at the same level as that of one-room ones. </p><p>  You can purchase living space in various ways: both in cash and using credit funds (mortgages).  There is an installment plan of payments, maternity capital is accepted for payment. </p><p>  For those who want to live in the fresh air, but in urban conditions or within the city itself, there is no better option than Kalina Park.  It is both life in the village and the opportunity to use the entire developed infrastructure of the city.  For those who move to Krasnodar for permanent residence, this residential complex is just a godsend.  The cost of apartments in it is quite adequate, and the pleasure that the owner of the apartment will experience when he settles in it can only be compared with the pleasure of living in a country private house. </p>
