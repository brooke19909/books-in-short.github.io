    <h2>  Sunny Beach, Sunny Beach MPM Boomerang 3 *: negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, any hotel has its drawbacks.  MPM Boomerang 3 * (Bulgaria) was no exception.  It is worth noting such negative moments of relaxation in this institution: </p><ul><li>  the pool on the territory is too small, and therefore swimming in it is pleasant only in the off-season, when the hotel is almost empty; </li><li>  in the hot season, there is almost never the possibility of early settlement due to the absolute occupancy of the hotel; </li><li>  instead of a double bed, the rooms provide a pair of shifted ones (but, given their large size, sleeping on them is quite convenient); </li><li>  there is no heating in the pool, and therefore swimming in it before lunch is almost impossible; </li><li>  there are few sun loungers near the pool (no more than 50 are provided for more than 200 vacationers), and therefore you have to take up space before breakfast; </li><li>  the hotel has practically no territory, and when you exit the residential building, you immediately get on the roadway; </li><li>  the road to the beach can take up to 20 minutes; </li><li>  expensive sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach (rent will cost you about 20 leva per person); </li><li>  too small tv in the room; </li><li>  there is no curtain in the bathroom, which is why during showering water spills on the floor; </li><li>  very close bathroom, which will be uncomfortable for people with a large physique; </li><li>  a hygiene kit is issued only upon check-in, after which its supplies are not replenished; </li><li>  in spite of the fact that as a whole the sound insulation in the hotel is quite good, there are thin walls between some rooms, which makes it very audible; </li><li>  Wireless Internet in the rooms practically does not catch (except for those rooms that are closest to the lobby area); </li><li>  in the cereals that are served for breakfast, too much sugar (it would be better if it was served separately and everyone would add to their taste); </li><li>  there is no clothesline and clothespins on the balcony, and therefore you have to buy it yourself. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the MPM Boomerang 3 * Sunny Beach has only three stars, the quality of service here is at the highest level.  Guests will appreciate the friendly and courteous attitude of the staff, as well as perfect cleanliness in the rooms and throughout.  Given that the hotel is located almost in the very center of the resort, you will have access to numerous attractions, which are not enough in the territory. </p><p>  Special attention deserves food at the hotel.  Of course, there are no gourmet delicacies here, but all the dishes are very tasty and of high quality.  The atmosphere in the dining room is very comfortable.  Everything is thought out so that there are no queues for distribution.  In this regard, remoteness from the sea does not seem such a serious drawback, because a walk helps to burn extra calories. </p>
