    <p>  There are mounds of 7-6 centuries BC.  e., from the early Iron Age.  Hryvnias and Egyptian vessels were found in them.  In winter, in the vicinity of Orsk, you can snowboard and ski in the Ural Mountains.  There is even a ski resort located a hundred kilometers from Orsk. </p><h2>  Wonderful mountains </h2><p>  Each city has its own "highlight".  Orsk was no exception.  Sights of the city will not be fully explored, if you do not visit Mount Transfiguration.  Among its main advantages are the treasures of variegated and wax jasper, hidden in the bowels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This Orsk mineral is world famous.

    <p>  Another mountain, called the Colonel, is a natural monument.  It is located in the south-east of the city, on the left bank of the river Or.  The mountain is famous as one of the deposits of jasper. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  Albeit small, but there is one interesting town in Russia - Orsk.  Sights can be explored, starting with museums.  All information about the history of the city is in the Historical and Local Lore.  It is located on Lenin Avenue, 46. The museum contains magnificent collections of art, archaeological finds, coins and ancient household items. </p><p>  The exhibition devoted to the valley of the Amazons attracts attention.  All exhibits were found in Orsk.  For children there is a special excursion "Russian Chamber", created in the form of a game.  And in the vicinity was found a polished piece of jasper depicting Lenin.  Now this exhibit is also kept in the museum. </p><p>  There are architectural monuments in the city of Orsk.  The main attractions include the station building.  It is made in the spirit of German classicism, has a hipped roof and pointed spiers.  And on the platform stands a monument to the engine, which traveled from 1934 to 1964. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orsk city sights" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1469040.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is the first church that appeared in the city.  Noteworthy is the Temple of the Orsky Convent, which was founded in the late nineteenth century.  A stone church, a priest‚Äôs house and a bell tower have been preserved on its territory.  Orsk also has a Roman Catholic church, which is surprising since the city is small and is located almost on the outskirts of the country. </p><h2>  Parks </h2><p>  There are green spaces and squares in the city of Orsk.  The sights of the parks are enclosed in nature itself, in clear forest air.  There are three large squares in Orsk: Central them.  Polyanichko, Builders and the name of Malishevsky.  The winding alleys and paths, the silence and birdsong - all this will give nature lovers peace of mind.  In the parks there are secluded arbors. </p><p>  There is also a Memorial of Glory.  For the townspeople this is a holy place.  At the memorial is a bronze plaque lined with a green-black coil.  <span>Eternal flame</span> burns <span>.</span>  And on the stove are lists of the dead and the eternal memory of 10 residents of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orsk main attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1469037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Interesting in Orsk is the district of Sotsgorod.  It was conceived as a single system linking industrial and residential complexes.  Moreover, they should eventually become a garden city.  The author of the idea was Hans Schmidt. </p><h2>  Where to relax </h2><p>  Although not great, the city of Orsk is interesting.  Its sights are in the vicinity.  And when you examine them, there is no doubt that you will want to eat and relax.  This can be done in the cafe "Jasper", located on Lenin Ave. 24. This institution has been operating since 1965.  And in the modern version, the cafe has become the main thing for any meetings.  And next to "Jasper" is the Drama Theater.  Pushkin. </p>
