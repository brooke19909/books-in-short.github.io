A European country has long been compared with an open museum: in all its parts you can see ancient architectural buildings that have been erected for many centuries.  They are of particular value because they have been preserved almost in their original form.  Portugal is also the Azores, surrounded by greenery.  They are distinguished by amazing beauty.  Every year, thousands of tourists come to the islands of Portugal to enjoy the picturesque scenery.  It has a wonderful warm climate, which is very good for health. </p><h2>  Azores </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.interalex.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Madeira Archipelago" class="if uuid-2970401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2970401.jpg"></div><p>  They are an amazingly beautiful archipelago that occupies the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean.  The Azores in Portugal are located between Europe and North America and cover an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 2,300 square kilometers.  More than 240,000 people live here.  The country has its own government with a legislative assembly. </p><p>  The archipelago arose under the influence of volcanic processes.  Currently, there are 1,766 volcanoes on it, of which 9 are active. Azores consists of 9 islands, the largest of which is San Miguel.  The highest point of the archipelago is the volcano of the island of Pico, the highest point of which is located at an altitude of 2351 meters above sea level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the islands of Portugal is not easy, but worth it.  Tourists leave here with unforgettable impressions and emotions.  The islands got their name from the Italian azzurre and Spanish azul, meaning "blue" and "blue", respectively.  This is the most popular version of the origin of their unusual name. </p><p>  Many travelers come to the Azores.  This place is interesting for divers, lovers of fishing and sailing.  Tourism infrastructure is under development.

If desired, travelers can go down to the crater of an inactive volcano to see caves, an underground lake and thermal springs. </p><p>  The most important local entertainment, enthralling all visiting guests, is the observation in the immediate vicinity of whales, sperm whales, dolphins. </p><h2>  Madeira </h2><p>  This island is called "paradise on earth."

There is no real winter with snow and severe frosts.  The air temperature in winter does not fall below +14 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The climate of the islands is subtropical.  Thanks to him, the territory is simply buried in evergreen forests and shrubs.  The wildlife here is very beautiful. </p><p>  In summer, air masses warm up to +25 ¬∞ C.  Sea water in summer is comfortable for swimming.  It has the same temperature as the seas of tropical resorts: +23 ¬∞ .  In winter, the water temperature is around +17 ¬∞ C.  But travel agencies recommend travelers even in summer to take warm sweatshirts to Portugal.  At night, it is cool here under the influence of the ocean breeze. </p><p>  The rainy season on the islands of Portugal begins in the month of October and ends in April.  At this time, frequent fogs are observed on the archipelago.  Most rain falls in the western part of the Azores. </p><p>  Sunny weather reigns here from May to September.  This is the peak of the tourist season.  Tourists come to the islands who want to swim or dive in the clear sea waters. </p><h2>  San miguel </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldtravelguide.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="azores portugal" class="if uuid-2970405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2970405.jpg"></div><p>  This is the largest island of the archipelago located in the eastern part of Azores.  It extends 60 kilometers in length and 14 in width.  Locals call it the "green island" for its magnificent nature and rich vegetation. </p><p>  The main attractions of the islands of Portugal are volcanic lakes and extinct volcanoes.  There are several such lakes in San Miguel.  The most beautiful of them is the "lake of fire" called Lagoa do Fogo.  To see him, you need to go down to the crankcase of an inactive volcano. </p><p>  The island has the Terra Noshtra Natural Park.  Many tourists come here to visit the picturesque valley of Vale dash Furnas.  There is a blue lake and several thermal springs where you can swim. </p><p>  Some historical monuments have been preserved in San Miguel: temples, palaces of the 12th-19th centuries, the Monastery of Esparan√ß, a sculpture of Christ the Wonderworker.  The island has a museum of Carlos Mochadu.  It can be found in the monastery of St. Andrew. </p><p>  Another attraction of the island is the delightful fountains that adorn the streets of Ponta Delgada. </p><h2>  Santa maria </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldfortravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="holidays on the islands of portugal" class="if uuid-2970417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2970417.jpg"></div><p>  This is the southernmost part of the archipelago.  Scientists believe that it was discovered the first of all the islands.  It is the only village of Vila do Porto. </p><p>  Santa Maria is also famous for the fact that it was visited by the famous navigator H. Columbus. </p><p>  The island of Portugal is located in the Atlantic Ocean.  But the weather conditions on it are special, unlike other islands.  While one part of Santa Maria is illuminated by the sun, the other part does not stop raining. </p><p>  An ancient mill, the chapel Ermida de Nossa Senhora dos Anjos and several ancient houses of the 15th century have been preserved on the island. </p><h2>  Terceira and Pico </h2><p>  The name of the first island in translation means "third."  And all because Terceira became the third open island of Portugal in the Atlantic part of the country.  It is 140 kilometers away from San Miguel, and is called the "purple island". </p><p>  Terceira was formed as a result of volcanic eruptions.  Some of its volcanoes are currently active (Santa Barbara). </p><p>  On the island is Angra do Hero√≠smo - the historical capital of the archipelago.  Terceira is famous for its picturesque beaches.  And here is the festival of the Holy Spirit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portugal islands in atlantic" class="if uuid-2970390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18963/2970390.jpg"></div><p>  Pico Island has won a place of honor in the Guinness Book of Records.  And all because it is here that the highest point of Portugal is located - Mount Pico.  Its height is 2,351 meters, but the underwater part is 6,098 meters - this is the record.  The last volcano erupted on it not so long ago - in 1963.  This is evidenced by the lava flows preserved on its slopes. </p><p>  Previously, the inhabitants of the island were engaged in whaling.  This is now prohibited.  Modern Pico is covered in vineyards that are on the UNESCO list.  The island is famous for its unique mountain landscape. </p><p>  Also the Azores include: S√£o Jorge, Faial, Graciosa, Corvo, Floris.  An amazing world reigns on each of them, characterized by magnificent landscapes and interesting sights. </p>
