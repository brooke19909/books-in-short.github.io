"0 doubt" is a tariff that has recently attracted more and more customers.  In general, this tariff plan is called "anti-crisis".  But why exactly?  Should I switch to it?  What are the benefits of Beeline, "0 doubts" (tariff)?  We have to learn about all this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline 0 doubt tariff" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874753.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Overall picture </h2><p>  But first, you have to add up some general impression of today's product.  After all, the client always has to be interested in something, so that he begins to learn more about the tariff plan already.  And our today's mobile operator has succeeded.  How? </p><p>  The thing is that ‚Äú0 doubts‚Äù <span>(Beeline tariff plan)</span> allows us to communicate for free inside the home region with other subscribers of this operator.  In fact, this offer is very beneficial to those whose surroundings use mainly Beeline. </p><p>  Indeed, it is precisely this approach that is able to attract a new audience.  True, you will have to pay for the 1st minute of the conversation.  Only 1.3 rubles.  And then talk as much as you like.  Plus, this tariff plan has no monthly fee.  Very interesting and advantageous offer, right? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, <span>Beeline tariffs (St. Petersburg</span> is included in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis operator) allow practically no restriction of communication.  But let's try to figure out how good the cellular plan we have chosen today is.  This is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Russia tariffs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874754.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Inside the home region </h2><p>  So, let's start with you from the most important point worth discussing.  It is he who for the most part lets us understand how profitable the tariff plan is in front of us.  After all, we are talking about outgoing calls within your home region. </p><p>  <span>Beeline has ‚Äú0 doubts‚Äù (tariff), it</span> offers us free communication with other subscribers of this operator.  As already mentioned, starting from the 2nd minute.  For the first moments of the dialogue you will have to pay only 1.3 rubles.  This is not so much. </p><p>  True, with other subscribers and mobile operators, things are a little more complicated.  In a minute already have to pay 2.3 rubles.  That is, <span>Beeline tariffs (St. Petersburg</span> or any other city), as a rule, are aimed at those who use this particular operator.  And collectively.  The more acquaintances you have at Beeline, the more favorable the tariffs for you.  This also affected Zero Doubt. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In principle, for a home region, this plan is very good.  Of course, if you do not plan to communicate with other operators for days.  Otherwise, it is better to pick up something else.  But this is far from all that concerns our current topic.  Let's move on and learn from Beeline "0 doubts" (tariff). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline tariffs St. Petersburg" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Long distance calls </h2><p>  The thing is that modern customers very often call outside their city.  Therefore, for them, such an item as long-distance calls is important.  In fact, Moscow Beeline tariffs (and indeed, any given operator) offer their users very favorable conditions.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><p>  The thing is that the ‚Äú0 Doubt‚Äù tariff plan allows you to call Beeline all over Russia for only 2.5 rubles per minute.  And for other operators, this plan requires 5 rubles.  Calls to Crimea and Sevastopol (to Kyivstar numbers) will cost 12 rubles, and to other operators - 24. </p><p>  As you can see, Beeline tariffs for calls are quite suitable.  True, this is far from all the positive aspects that can only occur.  Let's see what else the current tariff plan and the mobile operator as a whole can offer us.  After all, we have forgotten a lot of crucial points regarding the benefits of a tariff.  But now we will fix it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff plan 0 doubts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874756.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  For travelers </h2><p>  Intercity has already been mentioned.  But Beeline (Russia) also allows tariffs to communicate with other countries.  And all this on quite favorable terms.  And for this reason, now we will try to deal with ‚ÄúZero doubts‚Äù regarding this issue. </p><p>  The thing is that in the CIS countries on Beeline calls will cost you 12 rudders per minute, and for other operators - 2 times more expensive.  Europe, the USA and Canada require 35 rubles per minute, North and Central America - 40 rubles each.  But with all other countries, dialogues will cost you 50 rubles per minute.  In principle, it is very beneficial. </p><p>  If you compare Beeline, ‚Äú0 doubts‚Äù (tariff) with other mobile operators, then the same ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù for calls in Europe already requires 55 rubles, and to all other countries - 97 rubles. The benefits can only be counted and counted.  Thus, as you see, our today's tariff is not only profitable calls within the network and home region.  It is also a real present for outgoing customers as well as travelers. </p><p>  But there are also a number of rather important components that we have not yet learned about.  What is it about?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Of course, now almost every subscriber uses mobile Internet.  After all, for us it is so important to always be in touch everywhere.  And therefore, you can not help but mention the Internet connection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="0 doubts Beeline tariff plan" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874757.jpg" width="500"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  For Beeline, ‚Äú0 doubts‚Äù (tariff) is not much different from all the other offers of mobile operators.  For 1 megabyte of downloaded data you will have to pay 9 rubles 95 kopecks.  In truth, if you are thinking about changing the tariff plan for using mobile Internet, then this option is not particularly suitable for you. </p><p>  For example, Megafon with the same tariff asks for 1 megabyte of data 9 rubles 90 kopecks.  It seems to be a small difference.  Nevertheless, if you plan to surf the Internet a lot from your phone, it will be more than tangible. </p><p>  Regarding the quality of communication, we can only say that customers are satisfied.  There are practically no interruptions and failures.  Sometimes they happen, but not for long.  And mostly in the evening. </p><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  Well, at Beeline (Russia) tariffs also allow you to communicate without the help of a voice.  It's about sending SMS and MMS.  These are quite important components of any modern communication.  And customers pay special attention to their value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Beeline tariffs" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874758.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What does Beeline offer us?  "0 doubts" (tariff) is what helps you to always stay in touch.  Even without any talk.  After all, the cost of messages is quite sparing. </p><p>  If you connect your My SMS package, you can send virtual letters to mobile phones for free.  True, only to local numbers.  In the absence of this SMS will cost you 2.5 rubles.  Long-distance "letters" cost 3.95 rubles.  Just like international ones.  In principle, quite humane and anti-crisis prices. </p><p>  Nevertheless, with MMS, things are a little worse.  Any such message will cost the client 9 rubles 95 kopecks.  Not quite expensive, nevertheless, there are also such tariffs that will allow sending MMS to 5 rubles each. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  But what do customers say about our current rate?  How good or bad is he?  Now we find out with you. </p><p>  The tariff plan ‚Äú0 doubts‚Äù is an excellent choice for those who prefer to use Beeline services and communicate a lot through voice communication.  This is precisely the strength of the tariff.  For this feature, customers try to choose "Zero Doubts".  Unfortunately, the pros can be over. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline tariffs for calls" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/874759.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that the cost of messages, MMS and Internet traffic pleases few.  For most operators (for example, Megafon), letters cost 1.5 rubles each, and multimedia messages cost 5 rubles each.  Regarding the Internet, we have already learned everything.  Thus, the tariff plan chosen by us today is a gift for those who buy a SIM card exclusively for calls. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned with you what the Beeline Zero Doubt tariff plan is.  In addition, we were able to see the opinions of customers about this plan. </p><p>  As you can see, the impressions are mixed.  On the one hand, this tariff is a profitable call within the network and beyond, and on the other hand, the cost of Internet and messages is quite high.  As already mentioned, if you want and plan to communicate with calls, you can safely choose this option. </p><p>  You can connect it now on your own or by calling the operator.  In addition, you can always visit your nearest cellular office and buy a SIM card with this tariff plan there.  That's all the problems are solved. </p>
