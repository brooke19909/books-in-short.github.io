However, novice masters do not risk taking this product.  The biggest difficulty for them is knitting a wedge of the thumb.  For this reason, the material presented below has been prepared.  It will tell you how to knit a finger on a mittens with knitting needles. </p><h2>  Determine the size of the palm </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the implementation of any planned product, it is necessary to calculate its size.  To do this, we prepare a centimeter tape, with which we will take measurements.  Notepad and pen to fix the parameters and not to lose during operation.  After that, measure the palm of the person who ordered the accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cordell.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thumb on mitt" class="if uuid-2995824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995824.jpg"></div><p>  Talking about how to knit a finger on a mittens with knitting needles, professional needlewomen note that we need to find out the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  girth of the wrist; </li><li>  cuff length; </li><li>  girth of the palm with the thumb pressed; </li><li>  thumb length; </li><li>  distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb; </li><li>  girth of the palm excluding the thumb; </li><li>  the distance from the cuff to the tip of the middle finger. </li></ul><h2>  We count loops and rows for knitting mittens </h2><p>  To greatly facilitate the creative process, it is necessary to convert centimeters to working units.  To do this, choose a pattern, yarn and knitting needles that will be used to make mittens.  Then tie a 10 x 10 cm sample. This is necessary to estimate the density of knitting.  After all, someone in one centimeter will fit only two loops, and someone - as many as ten.  It depends on the features of the knitter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a thumb on a mitt" class="if uuid-2995831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995831.jpg"></div><p>  So, having prepared the sample, we proceed to the next step of the instruction on how to knit a finger on a mittens with knitting needles: </p><ul><li>  First of all, we return to our standards and put a piece of paper with the treasured figures in front of us. </li><li>  Counting in the mind or using a calculator, divide each parameter by 10. </li><li>  Then the quotient of the horizontal measurements (girth of the wrist, girth of the palm with and without the thumb) is multiplied by the number of loops in the sample. </li><li>  Thus, we calculate how many loops the intended mittens will contain. </li><li>  Similarly, we find out the number of rows. </li><li>  We multiply the quotient of the vertical measurements (the length of the cuff and thumb, the distance from the wrist to the base of the thumb, the distance from the cuff to the tip of the middle finger) by the number of rows in the sample. </li></ul><h2>  A simple way to knit your thumb </h2><p>  The question of how to knit a finger on a mittens with knitting needles is asked not only by novice masters, but also by professionals.  And all because every time I want to make a more perfect product.  However, it is first necessary to disassemble the basic technology, and only then to adapt it to your knowledge and skills.  There are a huge number of ways to complete the studied part.  In this paragraph we will consider the simplest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="crazyhands.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thumb on mittens indian wedge" class="if uuid-2995852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995852.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs quite simple to knit a mitt of this model, then we will tell you how to do it: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we gain the number of loops equal to the girth of the wrist. </li><li>  And we knit the cuff of the desired length.  The pattern in this case is most often chosen the simplest - single or double elastic band. </li><li>  Then we add so many loops to get a girth of the palm with the thumb pressed down. </li><li>  We knit the distance from the cuff to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  We separate the loops, the number of which is equal to the girth of the palm without taking into account the thumb. </li><li>  The rest is secured with a pin.  We do not need them yet. </li><li>  We tie the product almost to the end and carefully reduce the loops. </li><li>  Then we proceed to the very essence of the instructions on how to knit the thumb of mittens with knitting needles.  We return to the loops left for this part. </li><li>  Moving in a circle, we raise the available number of loops to the desired height.  Do not forget to make a decrease! </li><li>  We turn the mitten inside out and carefully sew up the joints of the thumb and the main part of the mitten. </li></ol><h2>  The second way to design the studied part </h2><p>  Other instructions on how to knit a thumb involve the following: </p><ul><li>  We knit the cuff of the desired length. </li><li>  Add loops so that their number is equal to the girth of the palm without taking into account the thumb. </li><li>  Close seven loops. </li><li>  And we restore them in the next row. </li><li>  We tie the products to the end and return to the hole for the thumb. </li><li>  We transfer the available loops to the knitting needle and seven more we dial from the second half of the hole. </li><li>  Then we knit to the desired length. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="agenjilbabinstan.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit a thumb on a mitt" class="if uuid-2995836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995836.jpg"></div><h2>  Third Thumb Knitting Method </h2><p>  In this paragraph, we will talk about how to knit a thumb on wedge mittens.  It‚Äôs not difficult to do this.  The main thing is to follow each described step: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we knit the cuff of the desired length. </li><li>  Then we subtract from the number of loops equal to the girth of the palm, excluding the thumb, the current one. </li><li>  We divide the final value into the rows separating the cuffs from the base of the thumb. </li><li>  So we find out how many loops must be added in each row to reach the desired volume. </li><li>  Divide the current number of loops into two, dividing the back of the palm and the inside. </li><li>  On the inside - on the right on the left mitt or left on the right - we select three loops. </li><li>  Next, we knit mittens with needles with a wedge for a finger. </li><li>  We make the first increase. </li><li>  In the next row, add a loop through three initial and one increase, then two, three and further. </li><li>  After we follow the instructions described in the previous paragraph. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="description of a thumb on a mitt" class="if uuid-2995838" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995838.jpg"></div><h2>  The fourth way to perform a wedge of the thumb </h2><p>  A huge number of beginning masters are interested in how to knit mittens with an anatomical finger.  Experienced needlewomen say that this technology also does not involve complex actions.  Let's try to make sure of this: </p><ul><li>  To successfully cope with the task, it is necessary to measure the girth of the thumb in the widest part (through the bone). </li><li>  Add to this parameter the number of loops equal to the girth of the palm excluding the thumb. </li><li>  That is how many loops we have to get during the addition. </li><li>  Subtract the loops from them that remain from the cuff. </li><li>  The remaining ones are those that we must add. </li><li>  We divide them into rows from the cuff to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  Then we get to work. </li><li>  As in the previous master class, we retreat three loops and make the first increase. </li><li>  Then we continue to form a wedge, taking into account the three initial loops and increments of each row. </li><li>  Having expanded the mittens to the desired size, we separate the number of loops equal to the girth of the thumb. </li><li>  We tie each detail separately. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="xenoz.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a thumb on a mitt" class="if uuid-2995846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995846.jpg"></div><h2>  Fifth way to design a wedge of the thumb </h2><p>  Each person assimilates the material in his own way.  For those who better perceive information visually, we offer a detailed step-by-step video instruction.  In which an experienced craftsman talks about how to knit an Indian finger wedge with mittens.  We considered a similar technology earlier.  Therefore, the master class will be interesting for all readers. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="J4QTVkxCJB0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=971&amp;v=J4QTVkxCJB0" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/6/0/9/12609.jpg"></div><h2>  Sixth way of knitting a thumb </h2><p>  If you study many professional workshops, one more technology for knitting a finger on a mitt will become clear.  It is different from all previous ones.  Therefore, we will also consider it in the current article: </p><ol><li>  It starts the same way as everyone else.  We collect loops and knit the cuff of the desired length. </li><li>  Then we divide the total number of loops in half, separates the back of the palm and the inside. </li><li>  In the place where the thumb is located, select two loops.  On one part of a palm. </li><li>  We knit the base of the mittens with a pattern, and the finger with solid facial loops. </li><li>  We knit the first row and on each side of the selected loops we make one increase. </li><li>  The second row we knit the available number of loops. </li><li>  In the third and all subsequent rows, add new loops before and after the increase. </li><li>  When in the end it will be possible to dial 14 loops, we knit an even cloth to the base of the thumb. </li><li>  Then we separate the loops for the main part and are tied to the end. </li><li>  We return to the finger and, moving in a circle, finish the work. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="infinityquilter.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anatomical thumb on a mitt" class="if uuid-2995830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2995830.jpg"></div><p>  For beginning masters who decide to tie mittens with their own hands, a lot of questions arise.  How to choose a pattern, knitting needles and yarn, how to measure a palm and calculate the number of units needed, how to reduce loops at the end of the work.  We hope that our article on how to knit a finger on a mitt correctly, will help to deal with this problem and make the creative process simpler and more interesting. </p>
