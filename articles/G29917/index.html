After all, no one wants to live in uncomfortable conditions with poor service, having paid a considerable amount for this.  Therefore, modern travelers, when planning a trip abroad, try to collect as much information as possible about hotels.  So, they study the official description, recommendations of travel agents, and also get acquainted with the comments of real people who have already visited this or that hotel recently.  Thanks to this, you can learn not only about the advantages, but also about the disadvantages of the hotel of interest.  This will allow you to get a closer to reality idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will await you during your vacation.  To save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of tourists from Russia who have recently visited the Festival Riviera Hotel (Hurghada, Egypt).  Looking ahead a bit, we note that the vast majority of our compatriots in their choice were not disappointed.  According to them, this hotel is fully consistent with its category and is worth the money spent on accommodation.  But we learn about everything in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="festival riviera hotel" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039717.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, as some tourists note, in most cases by default you will not get apartments with sea views.  If you want such an option, you must inform the reception administrator at the check-in desk in advance.  As a rule, you will be given a room with a sea view for a fee in a very small amount - about ten dollars.  In general, our compatriots found the apartments in Festival Riviera Resorts 4 * spacious, stylishly decorated, bright and pleasant.  The furniture here is quite new, the technology is modern.  Everything works without interruption.  If something fails, then after a call to the reception the problem will be fixed as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="festival riviera resort egypt" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check-in, cleaning </h2><p>  As tourists note in their reviews, they have no particular complaints about the work of the maids at the hotel.  So, cleaning is done regularly and fairly high quality.  From time to time, maids make funny figures from towels and sheets.  Kids especially like this. </p><p>  As for the settlement, according to our compatriots, in most cases, newly arrived tourists have to wait for the checkout time.  The fact is that Festival Riviera Resorts 4 * is a fairly popular hotel, so sometimes it is almost 100% full.  So, new arrivals sometimes have to wait until the previous tenants have left and their maids have properly prepared their rooms.  But if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning and there will be free apartments of the category you have booked, the administrator will do everything possible to make you check in as early as possible.  If you still have to wait for the checkout time, then doing this is not necessary at the reception.  You can change clothes from the road and go to a restaurant, bar, take a swim in the pool or go straight to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hurghada festival riviera resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039719.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  In their comments, many travelers note their enthusiasm for the territory of Festival Riviera Hotel.  According to them, she is very well-groomed, here you can constantly see working gardeners and other employees involved in caring for the landscape.  The hotel area is green, there are lots of flowers, picturesque palm trees, shrubs, pretty bridges, etc. Here you can take a pleasant walk and find a lot of beautiful places for a great photo shoot as a keepsake.  By the way, some guests in their reviews mention the hotel‚Äôs photographers and do not recommend contacting them unless absolutely necessary.  The fact is that the photographer takes a lot of pictures and at the same time does not allow customers to select two or three.  You will have to buy an entire album, which will cost in the amount of one hundred dollars.  Such a price, many tourists consider overpriced. </p><p>  Tourists call the peculiarity of the territory of this hotel the fact that it is located immediately on the first and second coastlines.  Between themselves, these parts are connected by an underground passage.  Therefore, guests living in buildings on the second coastline will not have to cross the busy roadway on the way to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurghada hotels festival riviera resort" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1039718.jpg" width="600"></div>
