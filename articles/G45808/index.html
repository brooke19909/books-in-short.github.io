The main thing is that the knitting of the product on which embroidery will be carried out has a uniform structure.  Concerning the used threads - woolen, viscose, silk, metallized are allowed.  Depending on the selected pattern, they can be combined.  Separate embroidery elements to add special splendor to the product can be decorated with beads, glass beads, sequins, ribbons or beads.  You can apply an embroidery pattern to a knitted product in three ways: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The easiest and most affordable way is improvisation.  On the canvas, mark the boundaries of the planned drawing and, at your discretion, begin decorating, giving free rein to imagination. </li><li>  Make or copy the image on transparent paper as tracing paper, then sew it with simple stitches to the product along the outline of the pattern.  Next, the paper is removed, and the outline of the pattern that we will embroider should remain on the fabric. </li><li>  Use of non-woven fabric - on a non-woven sheet, a decoration pattern is made and cut out.  The blank can be made as one single image, and prepare separately all the details.  Such a scheme with the help of an iron is steamed to clothes.  Embroidery on it is usually done with double-sided stitching. </li></ol><h2>  Schemes and samples </h2><p>  Complex patterns of ornaments and patterns for embroidery on knitwear require patience, great desire and certain skills.  It is recommended to start with the simplest images and patterns.  It is necessary to study various types of seams, to master the technique of distributing stitches evenly, to understand the nuances of tensioning the fabric and thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huggalugs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="We decorate children's things" class="if uuid-2467648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2467648.jpg"></div><p>  What kind of knitting embroidery can interest your child and can be done by both a beginner craftswoman and an experienced needlewoman?  The main type of child‚Äôs activities is a game that can be reflected in embroidery on children's clothes.  The imagination of the kid perceives any image creatively.  This is for you the Little Mermaid on a T-shirt is only a cartoon character, and for a child it is almost a living creature and friend.  You can teach your baby to fold his clothes carefully so that a friend embroidered on it sleeps peacefully, then he will hurry to put on this thing again so that the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù does not feel insult.  Such clothing with embroidery is not just a wardrobe item - it is an element of creativity and a toy. </p><h2>  Types of embroidery stitches </h2><p>  How to make embroidery on a knitted product and what special types of stitches and techniques to choose?  Many needlewomen before starting work ask this question.  To make the selected pattern look appropriate, and the finished work pleased you, then select one of the following types of stitches for embroidery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lublurukodelie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of seams" class="if uuid-2467581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2467581.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cross - cross stitch on a knitted fabric is done as on ordinary fabric.  That is, pulling the thread diagonally. </li><li>  Attach loop <span>- thread in the center of the future pattern.</span>  <span>Several loops recede depending on the size of the element and are output.</span>  <span>The thread is twisted around the needle once, threaded through the canvas and displayed in the center of the picture.</span>  <span>Such manipulations are done with all the elements.</span>  <span>Usually this method embroiders flowers on a knitted product.</span> </li><li>  Merezhka <span>- this option of decoration is one of the simplest.</span>  <span>The thread is fixed at the top of the desired loop.</span>  <span>The needle is stretched under two and above two threads so that they twist together around the thread.</span> </li><li>  Openwork holes <span>- such needlework is created by processing the holes of the knitted product with double-sided stitches.</span>  <span>It looks very beautiful, especially if you take a contrasting thread for work.</span> </li><li>  Swiss embroidery <strong><span>is</span></strong> a loop embroidery on knitwear.  The pattern is very similar to the knitted one - and this is the peculiarity of this species.  Only with careful consideration can one distinguish that this is embroidery.  Almost any image can be done like this.  This method significantly compacts the finished knitted product and it is often used to further secure the elements of children's clothing.  For example, elbows in a sweater and knee-high pants. </li><li>  Nodule - for <span>this method, the thread is fixed in the appropriate place.</span>  <span>A needle is pushed onto the front side and two or three turns of thread are wound around it.</span>  <span>Then the needle returns to the wrong side at the point of its extension.</span> </li><li>  Rococo - this <span>decoration is performed on the front side.</span>  <span>The thread is fixed without a knot, it is pushed through the loop several times.</span>  <span>A needle stretches through the canvas.</span>  <span>Several turns of thread are thrown on it.</span>  <span>The needle is withdrawn through the spiral held by the finger.</span> </li><li>  <span>Honeycombs - this embroidery requires stretching the thread in two loops, which are located at a certain distance from each other.</span>  <span>Then wrap this area two or three times with thread and tighten it tightly.</span>  <span>We pass the needle up and down and repeat the manipulation.</span> </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lublurukodelie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery options and methods" class="if uuid-2467583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2467583.jpg"></div><h2>  Before starting work </h2><p>  Before you begin work on embroidery on a knitted product, pay attention to the following few rules: </p><ol><li>  Inspect the thing you plan to work with.  Determine the thickness of the yarn used in it.  When embroidering with too thin thread, a sloppy pattern may appear that will not hide the threads of the product.  A pattern embroidered with too thick yarn will look untidy. </li><li>  Choose the right needle.  It should not be very thin, blunt and with a large ear.  Such a needle will calmly pass through the product without damaging its structure and without clinging. </li><li>  Try not to tighten the loops of the product itself during operation, otherwise you will get a damaged shapeless and tightened thing. </li><li>  To prepare a thing for embroidery, it is recommended to moisten it with water, and then let it dry.  This technique will even out the loops and ensure good picture quality. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="anaagueroburmester.blogspot.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://anaagueroburmester.blogspot.com/2015/02/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful embroidery on children's clothes" class="if uuid-2467802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2467802.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Knitting and embroidery always complement each other perfectly.  Almost any embroidery pattern can be reproduced on a knitted product.  You can make such a decoration on things that were no longer worn, or on the new model.  Any clothes with embroidered finishes look unique and special. </p>
