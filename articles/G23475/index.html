    <h2>  Device types </h2><p>  By the method of action, models of temperature, voltage, and also current are distinguished.  Low-frequency devices are typically used in <span>transformer substations.</span>  The signal conductivity index for converters of this type averages no more than 34 microns.  Many models have two triggers.  The output sensitivity of devices depends on the voltage limit.  High frequency models are suitable for power plants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also important to note that the separation of the converters is carried out according to the number of channels.  This parameter depends on the type of triode.  The maximum model is capable of supporting no more than three channels.  Some modifications are able to work in the circuit only with alternating current.  The maximum overload rating for converters of this type is on average 4.5 A. There are also devices for working in direct current networks.  Quite often they can be found in high-voltage substations. </p><h2>  Single Channel Temperature Modifications </h2><p>  These measuring systems are actively used in hydropower plants.  The maximum passability parameter for them is about 70%.  The contacts of the models of the presented type are usually used from copper.  Thyristors are used with various flanges.  Valves are needed to maintain a stable pressure.  Relays in converters are used channel type.  In devices with regulators there is a selector.  This type of measuring transducers (market price) cost about 13 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Features of two-channel temperature models </h2><p>  Measuring systems of this type are often used in large hydropower plants.  For laboratory research, they are great.  Many modifications use a channel adapter.  In this case, the maximum permeability parameter, as a rule, does not exceed 80%. </p><p>  In size, the converters of this type are quite different.  Zener diodes in devices are designed for high pressure.  Controllers are often used with moving contacts.  On average, a temperature measuring transducer costs about 18 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Triggers in devices are used with multiple controllers.  Filters are installed channel type.  Their average cross-country ability is about 85%.  In our time, there is a high-quality three-channel temperature converter of about 25 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Description of single-channel voltage devices </h2><p>  Measuring <span>voltage converters are</span> produced with various structural elements.  First of all, it is important to note that the market has many modifications without triggers.  They work due to dampers.  To increase the permissible voltage, analog capacitors are used.  They are installed with a conductivity of 30 and 40 microns.  If we consider the first option, it is important to note that they have contact insulators. </p><p>  For powerful drive devices, the models are great.  Controllers for devices are quite rare.  The protection system is often used by the KI22 series.  If we consider modifications to 40 microns, then they have controllers.  The limit switching parameter, as a rule, does not exceed 80%.  Many models use two triggers.  For 20 kW drive units, models of this type are great.  On average, a single-channel measuring equipment costs about 28 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Characteristics of two-channel voltage models </h2><p>  Two-channel devices are great for <span>hydraulic presses.</span>  The permissible conductivity parameter in devices is about 22 microns.  On average, the limit voltage is about 300 V. Modifications to the protection system are very common.  Rectifiers are used on two plates. </p><p>  The selector conductivity in this case depends on the limiting frequency.  These devices can operate only in an alternating current circuit.  It is also important to note that modifications with throughput selectors are presented on the market.  A distinctive feature of converters of this type is considered a high switching rate. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews of experts, then for hydraulic devices at 20 kW these models fit perfectly.  Quite often, appliances are sold with one controller.  Regulators in this case are absent.  It costs an average of high-quality two-channel measuring equipment of about 20 thousand rubles. </p>
