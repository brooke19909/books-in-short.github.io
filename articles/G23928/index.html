In the late nineties, the mobile phone market was just beginning to develop, and what now seems unprepossessing and inconvenient was then fashionable and stylish.  Good old phone Nokia 3310 again reminds itself to millions of retro fans from around the world. </p>

No one can argue that this is very convenient and simplifies a person‚Äôs life.  This is especially true when it comes to modern mobile devices, because in one device an incredible number of functions are collected.  It would seem that, having received such opportunities, people have nothing to remember, but still there was a device that causes nostalgia.

    <h2>  Ah, this old and awesome phone </h2><p>  There is probably not a single person who does not remember the beginning of the 21st century and the Nokia 3310 mobile phone. The device, which entered the world market in 2000, captivated representatives of all walks of life, and its sales beat all possible records.  Almost every person used this phone, and everyone was very happy, because at that time he was the first instance that had ‚Äúsmart‚Äù functions.  Its compact size brought people the long-awaited convenience, because there was still no device that would fit in the palm of your hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3310 reviews" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/1043090.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The giant of the beginning of the century - functionality with a bang </h2><p>  The Nokia 3310 mobile phone is remembered by people because of its feature set.

    <p>  It was very convenient that, in addition to connecting the charger, it was possible to connect headphones to the mobile phone.  The Nokia 3310 display at that time was considered quite large, because its size was 84x48.  This parameter made it possible to play games freely. </p><h2>  Active device is always online </h2><p>  A clear advantage of this phone model was the ability to connect to virtually any mobile network.  On its display, the name of the network was always displayed, as well as a sound profile, clock, battery status and the presence of mobile operator coverage.  Everyone remembered his gray color.  Despite the rather compact dimensions of the Nokia 3310, the manufacturers of the mobile device managed to add 5 more at the top, except for buttons with numbers from 1 to 9, asterisks and bars.  These were buttons for entering the main menu, resetting and accepting calls, turning off the power and returning to the main screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The brick wasn‚Äôt so bad </h2><p>  Once this phone model was given a non-standard name due to its rather large weight of 133 grams.  But today, there is practically no such reliable device left.  The Nokia 3310 phone, whose battery could last more than two days in standby mode, is now able to give odds to the most modern smartphone.  True, over time, his charge lost a little, because it was about 3 hours.  The device withstood the same time in active communication mode.  The Nokia 3310 phone book contained 250 contacts, and that was enough. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 3310 display" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/1043088.jpg" width="465"></div></h2><h2>  There is something to remember and tell children </h2><p>  We should not omit the fact that now everyone remembers the Nokia 3310 phone well, reviews and positive comments every day testify to this.  People have nostalgia when they recall this pretty candy bar with a monochrome liquid crystal display measuring 133 x 48 x 22. After the release of this phone model, not a single option was able to repeat its success and popularity.  Now it‚Äôs quite difficult to find this rare model, and many want to remember their youth and play the game ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù, familiar to everyone from childhood. </p><p>  Included with the phone, the buyer received a box, instructions and a charger.  Nokia 3310, reviews of which are mostly the most positive, has become a true legend in the world of phones.  He worked with one sim-card, and nowadays it is a rarity, because now smartphones work with two.  Now Nokia produces smartphones and phones, which are called Microsoft Lumia and are equipped with Windows software.  These phones are known to the young generation, but they have not been able to repeat the popularity of their "grandfather." </p><p>  Remembering the history of this phone model, even for a moment I want to get into the past and hold in my hands the familiar "brick" that never breaks.  This mobile device can be called a true legend without a doubt.  Maybe someday he will return to our world and become in demand, because all our new is well forgotten old.  When people get tired of the high functionality of one device, they will remember this phone model and again return to it the popularity of the beginning of the twenty-first century. </p>
