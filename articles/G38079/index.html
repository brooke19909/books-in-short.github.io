    <p>  To date, over 350 thousand different plant species are known.  All of them have peculiar morphological and genetic features, delight us with splendor and multicolor, deliver real aesthetic pleasure.  Moreover, their life forms can be different, but always important, unique and beautiful.  And their existence is directly affected by the conditions necessary for plant life. </p><h2>  Life forms of plants </h2><p>  This classification can be given from the point of view of various sciences: systematics and ecology.  What interests us more is the systematic one, since it is based on the external characteristics of plants.  From this position, the whole kingdom of flora can be divided into groups that have formed evolutionarily, and which were influenced by the living conditions of plants. </p><ol><li>  <em>Trees</em> - the trunk is pronounced, at least two meters high. </li><li>  <em>Shrubs</em> - from 50 cm to 2 m tall, several trunks extending from the ground itself. </li><li>  <em>Shrubs</em> - formed from the previous form, but the size is up to 50 cm. </li><li>  Shrubs - formed from the forms of shrubs, however, the upper parts of multiple trunks are dead. </li><li>  <em>Grasses</em> are stunted plants that freeze their aerial shoots in the winter. </li><li>  <em>Creepers</em> - characterized by branching and creeping stems, equipped with hooks, antennae and other clinging devices. </li><li>  <em>Succulents</em> are plants that can store large amounts of water in the stem and leaves. </li></ol><p>  What conditions are necessary for the life of plants of each of these groups?  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Environmental factors as plant living conditions </h2><p>  These include the following. </p><p>  1. Abiotic: </p><ul><li>  sunlight; </li><li>  moisture (water); </li><li>  temperature condition; </li><li>  nutrition. </li></ul><p>  2.

Anthropogenic - the influence of man and his activities in various sectors of life and industry. </p><p>  What conditions are needed for plant life the most?  That is, which of the listed factors are determining?  It is difficult to answer such a question.  Only their combined competent combination allows plants to feel as comfortable, safe and fast as possible to grow, develop and multiply. </p>

    <h2>  Light effect </h2><p>  The most important difference between plant organisms and all others is the autotrophic method of nutrition.  That is, the ability to convert the energy of sunlight into the energy of chemical bonds contained in the formed organic compounds.  This whole complex biochemical process, built of two phases, is called photosynthesis.  The product of such transformations becomes starch as a reserve nutrient of plants and oxygen gas - as a source of life on our planet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It becomes obvious that without photosynthesis there would be no life.  And without sunlight there will be no such process.  This means that the energy of natural solar radiation and additional sources of illumination are the conditions necessary for the growth and <span>development of plants.</span>  The role of these factors is decisive. </p><p>  In relation to light, several groups of organisms can be distinguished. </p><ol><li>  <em>Shadow plants.</em>  Such representatives do not tolerate direct sunlight, it is enough for them to very diffuse low light.  For example, a significant part of forest grasses, hidden under the shade of trees - sorrel, minnie, lumbago, saxifrage, crested crest, snowdrop, goryanka, scilla, ivy, bracken, celandine and others. </li><li>  <em>Shade tolerant.</em>  These plants prefer moderate lighting and are quite tolerant even of prolonged dimming.  However, they still love sunlight and react positively to short exposure to direct sunlight.  This, for example, currants, lily of the valley, blueberries, elderberries, lingonberries, bought, cuff and others. </li><li>  <em>Photophilous</em> - plants that most need bright direct sunlight.  Only under such conditions does the process of photosynthesis occur in them as quickly and fully as possible.  Examples: coltsfoot, clover, lavender, immortelle, lemon balm, lotuses, water lilies, cereals, cacti, most of the trees and others.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div></li></ol><p>  So, what do plants need for life in the first place?  Sunlight, which is the source of the main plant process - photosynthesis. </p><h2>  Water value </h2><p>  Hydrogen dioxide is the most important substance in the life of not only plants, but also all living things on the planet.  It is known that life on Earth became possible due to the presence of liquid water.  Therefore, it is difficult to overestimate its value.  A universal solvent in which all biochemical reactions of a living organism take place, it is an integral structural part, a component of each cell. </p><p>  The importance of water for plant life is no less important than sunlight.  After all, water creates turgor pressure on the cell walls, it is in it that all compounds are transported, it is the medium for chemical reactions.  In a word, for plants water is a source of vitality. </p><p>  Not all representatives of the flora apply equally to water and its quantity.  So, there are three main <span>ecological groups of plants</span> with respect to hydrogen oxide. </p><ol><li>  <em>Xerophytes</em> are the inhabitants of the driest regions, which have managed to adapt to the lack of moisture.  Examples: desert and semi-desert plants, inhabitants of sea coasts.  Eschscholzia, cacti, wheatgrass, sand-lover, briofillum, <span>camel thorn</span> and so on. </li><li>  <em>Mesophytes</em> are inhabitants of places with moderate water content.  These are meadow plants, forest inhabitants.  Normally apply to moistened soil, but do not tolerate excessive moisture or drought.  Timothy grass, chamomile, cornflowers, blood chowder, petal, lilac, hazel, clover, medunica, goldenrod, all deciduous trees and shrubs. </li><li>  <em>Hydrophytes</em> .  Such plants feel best when they are partially in water (fresh, salty) or completely immersed in it.  Examples: algae, aquatic buttercups, hornwort, water lilies, sedonium, pestle, althema, mollusk and others.

    </li></ol><p>  So, what conditions are necessary for plant life?  Water is on their list. </p><h2>  Temperature role </h2><p>  Warm days for all living beings are a joy.  However, among plants there are also those that tolerate low temperatures quite easily.  All representatives of the flora in relation to this factor can be divided into three groups. </p><ol><li>  <em>Heat-loving</em> .  The conditions necessary for the life of plants of this group are a temperature indicator of at least +5 <sup>0</sup> . The optimal option for them is considered to be approximately + 25-26 <sup>0</sup> . Such plants do not tolerate sharp fluctuations in air temperature, do not withstand even light frosts.  Examples: rice, cotton, cocoa, palm, bananas, almost all tropical and subtropical inhabitants. </li><li>  <em>Cold resistant plants.</em>  They prefer moderate temperatures, but are able to tolerate quite low temperatures; they survive frosts without damage.  Examples: potatoes, all root vegetables, greens, many types of cruciferous, cereal crops and others. </li><li>  <em>Frost resistant</em> .  Able to winter under a snow cover, maintaining viability.  Examples of such garden plants are rhubarb, perennials onion, garlic, sorrel and others. </li></ol><p>  Conclusion: temperature conditions are an important condition for the normal growth and development of all plants on Earth. </p><h2>  Mineral nutrition </h2><p>  This factor is extremely important precisely for fruit, vegetable and fruit crops cultivated by humans.  Indeed, in natural conditions, plants inhabit such habitats to which they are able to adapt.  Including the content of mineral salts in soils. </p><p>  But cultural representatives need help.  Each owner knows what complex of mineral fertilizers should be applied for a certain plant in order to get the necessary crop. </p>

    <p>  In general, minerals are an important nutrient of all individuals, which is absorbed by plants from the soil by absorption along with water.  But for plants, an excess of fertilizers is fatal, and their lack leads to slow growth and poor harvest. </p><h2>  Air composition </h2><p>  What conditions are necessary for plant life other than those discussed above?  The composition of the air is also important.  Indeed, at night, plants, like other living creatures, breathe, consuming oxygen.  Therefore, it should be enough in the air for their normal development.  This means that in conditions of increased concentration of harmful gases, dust, fungi and microorganisms, plants will feel extremely bad. </p><h2>  Biotic factors and their influence </h2><p>  We examined all abiotic factors of plant life.  Heat, light, air, water are the main and inalienable conditions for their normal growth and development. </p>

    <p>  Biotic factors are the influence of the surrounding biomass on them, that is, other plants, animals, fungi, insects, and so on.  To consider all aspects of the impact of these conditions, the science of ecology was created.  It should only be noted that biotic factors are no less important than abiotic. </p><h2>  The main conditions for the life of indoor plants </h2><p>  The environmental conditions necessary for the life of indoor plants are no different from those that we considered for everyone in general.  They also need sunlight, heat, water, mineral nutrition, protection from harmful insects. </p><p>  In order for potted flowers to feel good and look beautiful, you should approach them individually, taking into account the characteristics of a particular genus and type of plant. </p>
