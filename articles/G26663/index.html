Therefore, it is not surprising that most breeders strive to surround them with warmth and love, buy only good food, equip a couch or a whole house, give a lot of interesting toys and much more that street animals cannot even dream of. </p><p>  A huge number of people are convinced that four-legged family members also need clothes.  But the assortment presented in the store is not affordable for many, and for others it is not to their taste.  However, this does not mean that the pet is doomed to walk "naked."  After all, any thing can be done with your own hands. </p><p>  About this article.  It has many ideas, step-by-step instructions, tips and tricks on the topic of "Knitting for dogs." </p><h2>  Which thread to choose? </h2><p>  In order for the product to turn out not only beautiful, but also practical, it is important to consider why it is necessary.  For example, for walks it is better to make a tight and warm jumpsuit.  It is possible with a hood, pompons and fur trim - a matter of taste.  In this case, it is better to acquire threads that are dense, dark, woolen, but better not prickly.  Especially if the pet is allergic.  If you want to make knitted clothes for dogs, designed to be worn at home, it is worth considering thin yarn, pastel and rich colors.  In this case, you can make a lace or hole blouse, even without sleeves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pictures.4ever.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted clothes for dogs with their hands" class="if uuid-3222943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3222943.jpg"></div><h2>  How to use knitting needles? </h2><p>  A similar question usually arises among novice masters.  However, in reality it is not a serious problem.  To carry out knitting for dogs, knitting needles should be selected, focusing on the intended pattern and thickness of the yarn.  So, for a patterned, openwork and patterned fabric, it is worth choosing a plain yarn and a tool whose diameter is equal to its thickness.  If the knitting is the easiest - garter or front, it is better to beat it with interesting threads, use knitting needles of equal thickness.  You can design a product with gradient yarn, plush or terry.  If a beginner wants to make clothes for a dog with knitting needles, you can purchase any knitting thread, and the tool is 3-5 times thicker.  Then you get the fashionable effect of large loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to take measurements from a pet? </h2><p>  Before studying various workshops on the implementation of interesting knitted clothes for dogs, you should pay attention to another important aspect.  After all, pets differ not only in breed, color, habits, but also in size.  And in our case, it is the last feature that is the main one. </p><p>  Finding ready-made walkthroughs is a rather tedious task.  After all, often the model you like is completely unsuitable for a particular animal.  And it is not always possible to adjust the specified parameters to the necessary ones independently. </p><p>  Therefore, we offer detailed instructions for taking measurements from your pet: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a centimeter tape. </li><li>  Call your pet. </li><li>  Using the picture below, take the measurements necessary for knitting on the dog's clothes. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="mirzam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dog measurements for clothes" class="if uuid-3221376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3221376.jpg"></div><h2>  How to work with the removed parameters? </h2><p>  Well, the last question, which also requires clarification.  Indeed, without it, it will be difficult to compare the number of loops and rows with parameters in centimeters.  Beginning needlewomen should not be scared - there are no overly complex tasks.  You only need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Decide on the pattern, prepare knitting needles and yarn. </li><li>  Knit a square of 10x10 cm. If there are several patterns in the planned thing, you will have to prepare a sample for each.  On them you will calculate the number of loops and rows in a particular area. </li><li>  So, in front of you lies a pattern sample (first or only).  Count how many rows and loops in it happened.  Then divide each value by 10. Round the result according to the rules of mathematics to the nearest whole. </li><li>  Next, simply multiply the number of loops of 1 cm by horizontal measures, and the number of rows, respectively, by vertical.  If you have several patterns, make a sketch of the intended thing.  Mark the areas with different patterns with your color.  So you will not get confused and determine the number of loops and rows, based on the correct pattern. </li></ol><h2>  Pet vest </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.elo7.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dog vest" class="if uuid-3221413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3221413.jpg"></div><p>  When the preparatory part is left behind, you can proceed to the study of master classes.  However, do not immediately try to knit the jumpsuit for the dog with knitting needles.  This thing requires some experience, because professional craftswomen are still advised to start with a simple product.  For example, from a vest. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To do it, you must: </p><ol><li>  Dial the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest (3 in the diagram above). </li><li>  Tie the distance from the puzik to the armpit (9). </li><li>  Close half the loops.  But not in one place, but on the sides, as in the photo. </li><li>  Tie the canvas so that in the end its length is equal to the distance from the puzik to the withers (1/3 of parameter 1 in the diagram above). </li><li>  Add the number of loops to get a value equal to the circumference of the neck. </li><li>  Knit 2-3 rows and close the loops. </li><li>  Sew on buttons, decorate the product as you wish.  If you want, you can tie and attach a leash to it.  The result is a harness vest. </li></ol><h2>  Simple blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dog clothes" class="if uuid-3222846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3222846.jpg"></div><p>  The following model will also be able to perform novice wizards.  Indeed, knitting for dogs of small breeds or large is carried out according to one principle.  Let's consider it step by step: </p><ol><li>  Measure your pet‚Äôs chest circumference (3 in the diagram above). </li><li>  Calculate the number of loops needed for 2/3 of this value.  Type them on the knitting needles. </li><li>  Tie a flat cloth of the desired length.  If you want to make a blouse, as in the main photo, focus on the length of the back. </li><li>  Now tie another fabric, the width of which is the distance between the legs (6 in the diagram above), and the length is 1/2 from the finished part. </li><li>  Sew the parts together, leaving holes for the paws. </li><li>  If desired, crochet loops and tie the sleeves.  You can also add a collar. </li><li>  After decorate the finished product at your discretion.  You can, as in the photo above, tie some animal or cut it out of felt. </li></ol><h2>  Sweater blouse </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a sweater to a dog" class="if uuid-3222848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3222848.jpg"></div><p>  Both small and large dogs look very funny in knitted clothes.  That is why we offer one more instruction: </p><ol><li>  Dial the number of loops for girth of the neck, transfer to the hosiery knitting needles and tie the collar with an elastic band. </li><li>  Calculate: (loops for chest circumference - their current number) / 5. So you will find out how many loops should be added in the next five rows to enlarge the canvas to the desired size. </li><li>  You knit 5 rows.  Now transfer the loops, the number of which is equal to the distance between the legs.  Knit the rest, focusing on the width of the paws.  After increase by the same number of rows the second part.  And reconnect them into a single canvas. </li><li>  If the pet is a girl, then tie the distance between the paws (5 on the diagram above).  If the boy is from the front paws to the belly (9).  However, the last few rows need to be done with an elastic band. </li><li>  Now it remains only to tie up the gloves.  In the photo above - a model with short, but you can add a few more rows. </li></ol><p>  That's the whole instruction on how to begin to knit a sweater for a dog. </p><h2>  Dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for dog" class="if uuid-3222913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3222913.jpg"></div><p>  If your pet is a girl, then you can not do without this item of dog wardrobe.  To fulfill it, you do not need to be a professional master.  It is enough to follow the instructions: </p><ol><li>  Gather the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest, tie a 2x2 collar with an elastic band.  In the photo, a collar with a lapel, but you can make a regular one. </li><li>  Next, tie the distance to the paws and make holes for them, as described in the previous instruction. </li><li>  Tie the distance to the belly, and then start adding loops.  However, it is important to do this in a special way: after 7-10 loops, increase, then a simple loop and again increase.  And so on until the end of the row. </li><li>  In the next row, the increase should also be done on the sides of the same simple loop.  The result is a beautiful wedge, as in the photo above. </li><li>  If desired, you can knit one skirt of the desired length.  Or do two to add splendor - the choice is yours. </li></ol><h2>  Overalls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="jumpsuit for dog" class="if uuid-3222857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3222857.jpg"></div><p>  Is your pet a boy?  Then he needs a jumpsuit!  To do this thing, you should take as a basis the instructions for knitting a blouse for dogs with knitting needles.  That is, the principle of work is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Start knitting with a collar.  You can also make the option with a lapel or simple. </li><li>  In the next five rows, add loops to reach the chest girth.  How to do this, you already know from the item "Blouse-sweater". </li><li>  Next, make holes for the front paws and tie the upper part of the overalls to the belly. </li><li>  Close the third part of the loops (on the stomach) and tie an even cloth.  So that the length of the entire product is equal to the length of the back. </li><li>  Measure the circumference of the hind legs at the base and get as many loops, tie 2 "pipes", adding elastic at the end.  Sew them to the main part. </li></ol><p>  The topic of "Knitting for dogs" can continue for a very long time.  After all, the creative process is limited only by fantasy. </p>
