And you can have a huge number of products.  In addition, larger beads and elements are also used.  The basis is a fishing line, thread or wire.  Various patterns and patterns of weaving become an excellent base for creating a real masterpiece. </p><h2>  What products can be made from beads by degree of difficulty </h2><p>  Unimaginable figures and sizes of products, which are formed by a diverse pattern of completely small beads, glisten beautifully in the sun and adorn the interior, body, clothes.  The question arises about the degree of complexity.  What can be woven from beads?  You can find affordable schemes for any skill level.  The list of products is very voluminous: </p><ul><li>  The simplest version of beadwork is jewelry, represented by elementary baubles.  There may be complex options for base jewelry using additional materials. </li><li>  More complex products will be flat and figured trinkets, which are made in accordance with certain weaving patterns. </li><li>  Flowers from beads are considered complex works, since the bud can be made according to the scheme and consist of several parts. </li><li>  Beads embroider paintings.  This is the most difficult and painstaking task.  Here you need to skillfully use colors and clearly work according to the pattern. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead bracelet" class="if uuid-3200122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200122.jpg"></div><p>  In many ways, the complexity of the work depends on the type of weaving and color design.  Important is the time spent on manufacturing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What materials can be used additionally, how does the appearance of the product depend on this </h2><p>  When a general picture of the manufacturing principle is presented, it is easier to decide on the question of what can be woven from beads.  You can use a fishing line for work.  Strong and transparent thread has many advantages: </p><ul><li>  fibers are not visible due to transparency; </li><li>  a strong base is not subjected to mechanical stress; </li><li>  it holds its shape perfectly, but is plastic at the same time; </li><li>  will be used for flat and three-dimensional weaving; </li><li>  beads are easily strung on a fishing line. </li></ul><p>  Often used and ordinary sewing thread.  Exceptionally flat products with plasticity and elasticity can be made from such a base.  The color of the thread can be an original addition to the appearance of weaving.  There are also disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  it is difficult to choose a strong base, which quickly fades with time; </li><li>  quickly fouled; </li><li>  does not withstand complex mechanical stresses; </li><li>  Stringing beads is very difficult, so you need to use a special needle. </li></ul><p>  For weaving body products, elastic thin wire is used.  This is the only option for the foundation, thanks to which the product will acquire the desired shape.  Stringing beads is very simple, but with a strong stretch, the wire can break.  Sometimes the metal part peering through the beads spoils the appearance of the item.  Due to its elasticity and suppleness, almost any voluminous thing can be made of beads on such a basis. </p><h2>  Most popular weaving options </h2><p>  There are several basic options for weaving, which are basic and are used very often.  Based on such motives, you can create any product, depending on the desire of the needlewoman and what can be woven from beads.  You can focus on the list of basic patterns: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A continuous web that weaves a bead into a bead. </li><li>  The cross, where 2 beads are placed at opposite ends of the fishing line, and then connected by one bead. </li><li>  The combination of several strips in one part.  Beads are strung on separate cuts of wire, fishing line or thread, and then these parts are joined together into one element with the edges. </li></ul><p>  The technique for performing such motives may be different.  There are more complex options for weaving, which only experienced craftswomen can do. </p><h2>  How to read a diagram of a pattern or drawing by beginners </h2><p>  What can be woven from beads for beginners is already a secondary issue.  Before you get started, you need to learn how to read beadwork patterns.  Key designations: </p><ul><li>  The numbers may indicate the number of beads or a number of weaving. </li><li>  Lines with arrows indicate the direction of creation of the canvas. </li><li>  If two lines come out of the same bead, and the direction is indicated in different directions, then penetration of the bead is implied. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="brickstitchbeadpatterns.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of a pattern for weaving" class="if uuid-3200226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200226.jpg"></div><p>  Having received the skills of weaving the canvas, you can apply any version of the patterns that determine the position of each bead.  Knitting sketches, sudoku drawings, or sketching for embroidery may be suitable. </p><h2>  The simplest beadwork for a beginner needlewoman </h2><p>  For a beginner needlewoman, it is important to decide that it is possible to weave a light, but at the same time beautiful bead from beads.  Experienced craftswomen recommend starting with the manufacture of a bracelet with a "Cross" pattern.  It is necessary to prepare: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  A few sachets of beads.  It is advisable to choose a material of the same color so as not to complicate the pattern. </li><li>  You need to prepare a fishing line or thread.  In the initial stages it is better to work with the fishing option. </li><li>  A square cut of natural fabric, preferably white.  You can pour beads here so that it does not roll out and is conveniently taken. </li></ul><p>  Features of the manufacture of a flat canvas through the use of the pattern "Cross": </p><ol><li>  String 4 beads on a fishing line.  Holding the 2 ends of the base, thread one of them through the last bead.  Get the basic cross.  You need to place the first element so that the ends of the fishing line are the same length. </li><li>  To put on one bead on one and on the other end of the fishing line.  Put another bead on one of the cuts, and pierce it with the second. </li><li>  Further weaving is made in the same way. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cross stitching" class="if uuid-3200249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200249.jpg"></div><p>  This option for making a bracelet is basic for many products. </p><h2>  Bead Harness Bracelet </h2><p>  Standard primitive patterns quickly get bored.  What kind of bracelets can be weaved from beads for beginner needlewomen so that they are voluminous?  In addition to the elementary "Cross", it is better to use more complex, but suitable for beginners, weaving techniques.  Such is a bracelet, a braid, which is a three-dimensional product with an elastic base. </p><p>  Algorithm for making a harness: </p><ol><li>  String 1 bead on a thread, add one of the ends on the other side of the bead and thread through.  In this way, the bead is puffed.  Weaving is done with one thread, so it‚Äôs worthwhile to place the tightened bead closer to the second end of the warp. </li><li>  String 10 more beads on the long end of the thread, and returning, connect the last 4 beads with the first one tightened.  The oval will turn out. </li><li>  Next, string 3 beads per thread.  Thread the base through the first bead of the previous row-oval. </li><li>  In each subsequent row, 3 beads must be strung, which will be fixed in the middle bead of the loop obtained in the previous row. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.frankarnoldministries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tourniquet" class="if uuid-3200180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200180.jpg"></div><p>  This principle of weaving is carried out until the very end of the tow, when the desired length is obtained. </p><h2>  What exactly can be made from beads and fishing line </h2><p>  Not always a standard set of materials implies simple operation.  Many beginner needlewomen think that only flat products can be made from beads and fishing line.  Trivial are: bracelets, earrings, flat charms, cloths for further decoration.  Additional options regarding what can be woven from beads and fishing line: </p><ul><li>  Brooches and stripes in which beads can be successfully combined with larger beads and glass pebbles. </li><li>  It is possible to make three-dimensional figures, since a well-drawn fishing line and a correctly selected scheme are an option for the manufacture of such elements. </li><li>  With the help of beads and fishing line you can embroider a beautiful picture.  By the same principle, you can decorate clothes. </li><li>  False collars, ties and bows are easy to recreate with beads and fishing lines. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.trinketsbeading.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Figured pendant bead" class="if uuid-3200144" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200144.jpg"></div><p>  The list goes on and on.  The right manufacturing principle can help you work on your creation. </p><h2>  Bulk Bead Products </h2><p>  More difficult options for beginners is to make intricate shapes.  Therefore, the question arises as to what volume weaving can be made of beads: </p><ul><li>  Animals, fish and birds: crocodile, fish, beetle, penguin, dolphin, shark, lizard - it all depends on the imagination. </li><li>  Caskets and boxes that are made of beaded fabric, phone cases, wallets, pockets. </li><li>  Pipes can be made, which will then be used to make other products. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="bazaar-africa.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulk Bead Products" class="if uuid-3200138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200138.jpg"></div><p>  To create a volumetric element, you can use wire or fishing line.  It is enough to choose the right instruction to recreate the forms. </p><h2>  Specific Variants of Compositions </h2><p>  What can be woven from beads?  The photo of needlewomen presents a huge selection.  The current option remains a combination of several methods of weaving, shapes and types of figures. </p><p>  Original and functional are diverse mini-trees.  With the help of wire and beads, you can recreate the famous bonsai.  A souvenir money tree, where small beads and coins are combined - a universal decoration on your desktop or shelf.  A basket of vines with fruits or berries looks very attractive.  Such a product can find a place on the kitchen shelf. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zimboarts.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead tree" class="if uuid-3200158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200158.jpg"></div><p>  The pictures embroidered with beads are incredibly beautiful.  Making such a masterpiece takes a lot of time and effort.  But such a product can decorate any room. </p><h2>  How does the color scheme affect product design? </h2><p>  Each color of beads can become the basis for a huge number of diverse products.

If you shade the color in a different tone, you get an original decoration with a unique color scheme. </p><h2>  Diverse plants made of beads and wire for decorating the interior and other products </h2><p>  It is easy to figure out what can be woven from beads and wire, if you choose the right patterns.  Usually on this basis flower buds and tree leaves are made. </p><p>  Features of creating petals are determined by the scheme.  Most often, parts of the flower are woven according to the principle of the canvas.  Weaving in circles is used when first a small circle is made, then a larger one in diameter.  The first element is embedded in the larger one.  Next is an increase in circles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Flowers" class="if uuid-3200112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3200112.jpg"></div><p>  When weaving leaves for trees, the ‚ÄúCross‚Äù pattern is ideal for creating.  More voluminous compositions are formed using ovals and circles, which are very simply made from beads and hold their shape thanks to the wire. </p>
