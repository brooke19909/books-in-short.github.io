    <h2>  <span>Alexei Leonov:</span> spacewalk.  When did this happen and how was it? </h2><p>  The whole cosmic exercise took about twenty minutes.  Leonov still recalls with aspiration those first sweet minutes when he realized how quiet and calm it was in outer space.  The first thing he talked about in his most recent interviews after this event was silence.  The astronaut was even able to hear his breathing and heartbeat.  Aleksey Leonov‚Äôs entry into space was the number one event in the Russian and foreign press, a huge leap forward of all mankind in the <span>development of space.</span> </p><p>  Leonov went into outer space from the board of the Voskhod-2 experimental ship.  It was significantly different from the Gagarin's Voskhod-1: it already housed a couple of places for pilots, in addition, it was equipped with a Volga camera, which was inflated during a space flight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The crew of the ship consisted of only two people.  The commander of the apparatus, too, often flashed in the press at that time.  It was <span>Pavel Belyaev,</span> and the pilot was appointed Alexei Leonov.  Especially for this mission, the Golden Eagle spacesuit was made.  It is he who will fail the astronaut at the most inopportune moment. </p><p>  Leonov's release into outer space is a very well-known date: the start was made from Baikonur at ten in the morning Moscow time.  The matter was very risky, the astronauts had to go into space already at the second turn of the flight.  Just at this time, under the apparatus stretched the sands of the Sahara.  Already at half past eleven in the morning Leonov visited open outer space. </p>

    <h2>  Difficulty flying </h2><p>  It was very tightly connected with the aircraft Leonov, everything was calculated to the smallest detail, the cable length was five meters.  Five times the astronaut approached and moved away from the ship during his stay in vacuum.  The danger began to be felt almost from the first minute: the pressure suit inflated the pressure suit.  When it came time to return, Leonov had to break two points of strict instructions from Earth.  Due to the dimensions, he reduced the pressure inside the suit and penetrated the ship forward with his head, and not his feet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the terrible misfortunes, unfortunately, did not end there.  Due to the temperature difference, a rather large cleft formed directly in the hatch, which could lead to depressurization of the ship and the death of the astronauts.  Automatic systems "Voskhod-2" at the same time worked to increase the supply of oxygen mass, so everything could end in an explosion.  It was possible to overcome the problems only after seven hours, only then the pilots could feel safe. </p><p>  And before the exit, the legendary astronaut almost forgot to fix the safety cable.  Belyaev accidentally noticed this and barely managed to save his partner.  If not for this fact, Leonov‚Äôs body would still be in the orbit of the planet. </p><p>  The 1965th, when Leonov went into outer space, was a very significant year for the USSR, so the astronauts had no right to make a mistake. </p>

    <h2>  Landing </h2><p>  Voskhod-2 made as many as nineteen orbits around the Earth before descending to the solid surface of the planet.  Just imagine: the calculations did not correlate with reality, so the landing did not happen at all where it was originally planned.  Two hundred kilometers from the city of Perm, in a cold and inhospitable deserted taiga, far from civilization and pilots sat down.  For two days the astronauts were waiting for rescue, later they were sent to Perm, and from there by plane again to Baikonur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Error handling </h2><p>  Leonov very often still recalls his flight: in many interviews he said that there were a lot of mistakes, that they could be avoided and that in many ways only a happy combination of circumstances helped him and his comrade to survive. </p>

    <p>  Just imagine: the spacesuit was practically not tested, since it was almost impossible to create proper test conditions on Earth, it was based on calculations only on the basis of its developments.  But this was not enough, the spacesuit was the first to fail. </p><p>  The flight altitude was significantly greater than originally planned.  A few tens of meters higher - and the astronauts would have received strong radiation exposure.  The reason for this fact was not identified even after the flight. </p><h2>  Indescribable feelings </h2><p>  When the legendary astronaut was already in the spacesuit and everything was ready for the important event, which should have been Leonov‚Äôs exit into outer space, everyone was not given permission.  Leonov languished in anticipation until he heard a voice from Earth.  Gagarin personally communicated with Leonov, he gave permission, and Alexey Arkhipovich rushed to the hatch. </p><p>  And then there was silence and the sound of breathing and heartbeat, which were transmitted by a signal to Earth.  It would seem that the flight was supposed to excite Leonov, but this serene silence only calmed, breathing was even. </p><p>  The first spacewalk did not last long, but was imprinted in the memory of the astronaut forever.  When Leonov went into outer space, the release date was published in all world newspapers.  Therefore, this flight was remembered literally by all his contemporaries. </p><p>  Everything in the sky was surprising: and the fact that the Earth was indeed a sphere, although Leonov knew this, he was still amazed at what he saw;  and the fact that the stars in the sky are simply unmeasured;  and the fact that they are all so bright, and the cosmos is completely black, well, just impenetrable.  And the Sun, as if mounted in the sky, exuded enormous heat and very bright light. </p><h2>  Spacesuit </h2><p>  Now try to imagine how hard it was to work and be in a spacesuit.  To just clench his fist in outer space, had to make efforts equal to lifting twenty-five kilograms on Earth.  And it is with one hand!  Leonov‚Äôs earthly training, so that he could later cope with the task, was extremely difficult.  He had to lift a barbell of ninety kilograms daily.  It was impossible to do less - then I would not have coped with the task.  And this is in addition to other grueling daily workouts. </p><p>  Leonov‚Äôs experience showed that a person‚Äôs presence in outer space is possible, in addition, all the shortcomings and errors were taken into account for future flights.  And the suit of Alexei Arkhipovich was taken as the basis for future developments.  Many modern cosmonauts work based on the experience that Leonov once received. </p>

    <h2>  Leonov‚Äôs experience is invaluable ... </h2><p>  The memoirs of the Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, who made several such flights, as well as having spent one hour in space in total, are filled with gratitude to Leonov and the experience he received.  Now space suits are being created in such a way that the pilot can spend several hours quietly in airless space.  More precisely, about seven hours.  There is a detailed briefing that all modern astronauts undergo before flights.  In the first hour they need to look at the Earth as little as possible, since this view is very mesmerizing and distracting.  It is in the first hour that it is better to calmly perform the main part of the work, and then you can already enjoy the view.  And the basis of all these instructions is the experience of Alexei Leonov. </p><p>  Leonov‚Äôs first spacewalk was a matter of national importance.  His spacesuit was proudly named "Golden Eagle", and so that the astronaut could train, the layout of the entire space ship was installed in full size on board a real Soviet aircraft. </p><p>  Leonov went into outer space for the first time.  And few know that he could die due to another oversight - already on his own.  It‚Äôs very scary to imagine, but due to the long wait for Leonov‚Äôs order to be absent-minded, I almost forgot to fasten the insurance to the suit.  His partner and part-time commander barely managed to grab the pilot‚Äôs leg and fasten it.  If this had not happened, then Leonov would have died. </p><p>  In addition, when he went into the ship, having completed his main task, he kicked the cylinders necessary for life support.  Everything really could end in disrepair.  So many mistakes, but none led to dire consequences.  Oh, and the lucky crew crept up! </p>

    <h2>  Work in space is a risky business </h2><p>  Some time after the feat of Leonov, American pilots, who also visited orbit and in outer space, were able to repeat his flight.  Only Leonov was the first, and no matter how hard the Americans tried, they had to watch the Soviet pioneer pilot from the Earth in the development of <span>airless space.</span> </p><p>  Work in space only seems romantic and beautiful, in fact it is a constant danger and enormous expenditure of energy.  All spacecraft pilots unanimously say just that.  And therefore, everyone who wants it will not be taken into astronauts.  Health for this job should be excellent. </p><p>  And it also requires constant concentration and concentration: you get distracted for just a second - and that‚Äôs all ... Anything can happen.  For example, such a force majeure, as when Leonov made an exit into outer space: the pressure increased sharply, the spacesuit was inflated.  That is why now there are very strict and clear briefings for space pilots, where recommendations are given regarding behavior in a variety of situations. </p><h2>  Colleagues </h2><p>  An interesting story is another cosmonaut - S.K. Krikalev, the successor of Leonov‚Äôs case.  This man is the absolute world record holder for the number of hours spent in Earth orbit.  His experience is eight hundred and three days. </p><p>  In many interviews, he talked about the fact that once his partner's cooling system in a spacesuit failed.  And now astronauts always come out and work at least together.  Having spent a lot of time saving his friend, he had to carry out the entire task independently, also in a short time. </p><p>  And one day his partner‚Äôs glass was completely foggy, he could see absolutely nothing.  But such situations are thoroughly worked out even at the Earth cosmodromes, therefore, the colleagues coped with the work at that time masterfully, everything ended well.  But Leonov entered into orbit all alone, without safety net.  It‚Äôs still amazing to realize how hard it was for this person. </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  It is almost impossible to prepare for the emotions and physical sensations that a person experiences when entering into outer space.  Leonov's first spacewalk was a matter of responsibility.  Training was a must.  They last with future cosmonauts all day and are conducted on special simulators that create conditions similar to space ones.  There are, for example, hydraulic simulators that can create weightlessness.  And there are those that completely imitate the spacecraft‚Äôs atmosphere and living conditions in it.  The loads are huge.  The health of pilots is carefully monitored by qualified doctors, and nutrition and daily routine are also monitored. </p><p>  Of course, the pilots do not rest for a minute in flight.  In addition to repairs, astronauts are constantly engaged in <span>research activities.</span>  Therefore, the astronaut is not only a physically strong and healthy person, but also a qualified specialist in various fields of science. </p><p>  It was the space expeditions that made it possible to prove that life in space is possible.  Bacteria survive perfectly and overboard, as well as mosquito larvae, which were placed in a vacuum for a long time at one of the space stations.  Often astronauts take eggs, fish and insect larvae with them on a flight to see what will happen to them in space.  The astronauts carry out a huge number of experiments during each flight, the results of which scientists are eagerly awaiting on Earth. </p><p>  And many of the space pilots claim that space has its own smell.  It‚Äôs hard to feel, but it is.  It most resembles the discharged air after a thunderstorm, filled with freshness.  And this is the opinion of so many.  Probably, Leonov also felt it. </p>

    <h2>  Land </h2><p>  The pressure difference caused the legendary Soviet cosmonaut to almost die.  When Leonov went into outer space, he realized that it would be very difficult to climb back into the hatch.  And the air supply was exhausted, the decision was simply necessary right now.  Leonov‚Äôs spacewalk was accompanied by many errors, but nevertheless ended successfully, as we already know. </p><p>  Now Alexey Arkhipovich can already tell the whole truth about the flight.  Earth did not meet him so well.  Incorrect calculations, many errors during the flight also led to an unplanned, unexpected landing place. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that at that time, probably, in order to maintain the prestige of the party and Soviet scientists, all the media said that the flight was successful, and the astronauts were resting and gaining strength for new achievements near Perm in the country.  Leonov‚Äôs dacha is still not there, and, of course, they didn‚Äôt see any dacha there.  Not in the country, but in the taiga, in a forest littered with snow, in the neighborhood with many dangerous animals were both pilots.  They were found only after two days, they had to go on their own for nine kilometers on skis.  If it were not for the grueling workouts before the flight, then it is not a fact that they would have succeeded.  After they were transported to Perm, and then to Baikonur so that the astronauts continued to train. </p><p>  There are very few such people who will not spare their lives and strength for the good and prestige of their state.  When Leonov went into outer space, this date was remembered by very many.  And the citizens of our country still remember this heroic feat. </p>
