    <p>  One of the attractions of the island is its climate, for which travelers cross half the world. </p><h2>  Seasons on the island </h2><p>  Many tourists are attracted to Phuket in October.  Reviews of vacationers say that at this time you can buy tickets at the lowest prices.  Why are such prices in this period? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are no distinct seasons in Phuket, as is noticeable in other countries.  They can conditionally be divided into a dry period and a rainy one.  It is believed that the first lasts from November to April, and the second from May until October. </p>

    <p>  The tropical <span>monsoon climate of</span> this area can manifest itself in the form of prolonged rains for several days in a row (July and September) or short-term rains in the morning, as, for example, Phuket looks like in October.  Reviews of tourists recommend coming here on vacation from the middle of the month, since in the first half more frequent rains are possible, although their intensity differs from year to year. </p><p>  Wise Thais hang red flags on the beaches if swimming in the sea can be life-threatening.  This is due to the formation of strong undercurrents, therefore, deciding to visit Phuket in October (tourists' comments warn about this), you should carefully monitor possible warnings.  In extreme cases, you can always have a good time near the hotel pool. </p><h2>  <span>Phuket beaches</span> in October </h2><p>  This month is considered the end of the monsoon season, so many travel agencies ‚Äúseduce‚Äù tourists with low prices to this exotic country.  This works because good weather is already starting to set in Phuket at this time.  In October (tourist reviews report this), the rains, starting from the first decade of the month, become less and less intense and mostly occur at night, which brings a long-awaited cool.  The temperature of night air + 25-31 degrees does not please everyone, so a little rain can refresh the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In early October, swimming on the beaches of Phuket is dangerous, since high waves are frequent during this period, but by the middle of the month they will become a usual surf, and by November sand will gently ‚Äúlick‚Äù. </p><p>  Dangerous undercurrents can occur even in the dry season, so Thai rescuers track these areas and enclose them with red and yellow flags.  An inexperienced swimmer is better off not taking risks and not adding worries to the rescuers. </p><h2>  What Phuket looks like in October </h2><p>  This island is unlikely to disappoint travelers even on a rainy day.  The richness of greenery and flowers growing right on the streets of fruit trees washed with clean rainwater, a riot of aromas - all this will make an unforgettable trip to Phuket in October.  Reviews of vacationers note that even this month you can find a lot of entertainment for yourself and take the time to get to know the island and its inhabitants. </p><p>  For example, a farm for growing orchids has not left anyone indifferent.  It is located in a greenhouse, which may not be enough for a whole day to inspect all exhibits.  Here orchids are grown for any color and purse.  In general, Phuket is a paradise for lovers of exotic plants, as in numerous shops you can buy inexpensive copies of a few centimeters in height, as well as real tropical giants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Holidays in Phuket in October (reviews of tourists say this) must be combined with a visit to local waterfalls.  They are especially beautiful after the rainy season, as the rivers become more full-flowing, and the waterfalls themselves are more powerful. </p><h2>  Things to do in Phuket </h2><p>  Even the rainy season does not stop exotic lovers from getting new experiences.  Thai culture and the ability to organize holidays in a quality manner make it possible to have a great time in Phuket.  Here travelers are expected in any weather: </p><ul><li>  Butterfly Museum, where you can see an extensive collection of these exotic insects of completely different sizes and colors.  All the necessary conditions are created for them, but it is also useful to observe the life of the caterpillars.  Their gluttonous mouths do not close for a minute, and if you are lucky, you can see the birth of a new beautiful butterfly. </li><li>  In the warm October days, when there is still no stuffiness, it is worth visiting the "houses of spirits."  These incredibly beautiful and elegant crafts are very important in the beliefs of Thais.  They ‚Äúlive‚Äù as the guardian spirits of the family and home, as well as the spirits of deceased ancestors.  If the Thais do not get along well at home or at work, they order the monks to make a new ‚Äúhouse of spirits,‚Äù and simply throw away the old one that they left.

    </li><li>  Also on a clear October day, you should make time to visit the local botanical garden.  It is better to do this at a time when the beach gets hot or big waves do not give the opportunity to swim.  In this private garden, plants are collected from almost all corners of the planet. </li></ul><p>  According to travelers, even in cloudy weather, the beauty of the island is irresistible.  Many tourists, on the contrary, like Phuket in October.  Reviews about the island at this time of the year are the most positive. </p><h2>  Extreme sports in October </h2><p>  October also attracted rafting enthusiasts to Phuket.  It is during this period, when the rains practically stop, and the rivers after them are still full of water, you can get real pleasure from the descent to the raft. </p>

    <p>  Rafting in Phuket is available not only to experienced rafters, but also to beginners.  The most popular route of various difficulty levels is located in Phang Nga.  Under the guidance of experienced coaches, everyone can try this extreme sport.  Groups are formed depending on the level of training of people in them. </p><p>  The rafting program includes not only a trip along a bustling river, but also a bungee jump from a cliff above a beautiful lake for the most daring.  The average cost per adult will be from 1000 baht, which also includes a visit to the SPA with fish, elephant trekking, lunch (buffet) and much more. </p><h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  Often, the decisive incentive for tourists is prices to spend their holidays in Phuket in October.  Their reviews report that during this period it is possible to combine the low cost of a ticket and the main events with the already established weather. </p><p>  For example, a ticket for 15 days will cost only $ 1,300 per person.  As many travelers who have visited the island during this period note, by the end of the month there is an increase in prices for everything from food to souvenirs and excursions. </p><p>  Phuket is recognized as the most expensive resort in Thailand, so for those who wish to relax here inexpensively October will be the best option for saving money. </p><h2>  Pros of rest in Phuket in October </h2><p>  If we summarize all the reviews of tourists who visited the island in October, then among them we can distinguish a number of advantages of such a vacation: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, quite low prices literally on everything.  What is important, while the quality of service does not decrease. </li><li>  Secondly, this lack of heat.  Since it begins to rain mostly at night, tourists have wonderful warm days at their disposal, which can be spent both on the beach (with the sun) and on numerous excursions (in cloudy weather). </li><li>  Thirdly, the warm sea and the absence of storm waves allows both adults and children to swim hours to fly. </li><li>  Fourthly, there are still not so many vacationers, so there is no crowding either in the dining rooms or during sightseeing. </li></ul><p>  Thus, October, according to travelers, especially its second half, is a great time for a quality vacation in Phuket at an affordable price. </p><h2>  Holidays for every taste </h2><p>  It is very important for many travelers to know what the weather awaits them on the island.  Phuket (October reviews of tourists consider it a good time to relax) is especially attractive at this time of the year for visiting attractions, spa centers and various festivals. </p><p>  Here everyone will find entertainment to their taste: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúKings‚Äù of the dance floor await numerous discos and night clubs; </li><li>  those who prefer to combine relaxation with self-care are waiting for massage rooms; </li><li>  extreme waves in October are waiting for high waves for surfing, and full-flowing rivers - for descent on rubber rafts and boats of rafting enthusiasts;
