Dagomys (Lazarevsky district, Sochi)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dagomys is a resort microdistrict in the south of the Lazarevsky district of the resort of Sochi.  More than 130 years ago, on its territory, on the orders of Nicholas II, the estate was founded, which was considered the property of the imperial family.  However, until the 70s of the 20th century, Dagomys was an ordinary workers' village.  The situation changed after the construction of two hotel complexes there, which today are popular among beach lovers.  It offers vacationers a well-developed tourist and entertainment infrastructure, as well as chic beaches.  Tourists are also attracted by interesting sights. </p>

    <h2>  Tea Houses in Dagomys </h2><p>  Those who prefer to combine beach activities with educational excursions in Lazarevsky district and its environs will be able to visit many interesting natural, historical and cultural sites.  For example, in a forest located north of Dagomys, there are houses in ethnic style, located next to the picturesque tea plantations.  They are very popular with tourists, as they are treated to delicious pastries and a variety of jams.  They are served with fragrant local charcoal samovar tea.  There you can see the exposition of folk crafts and purchase original souvenirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dagomys troughs </h2><p>  Everyone who rested in this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSochi leaves captivated by its natural beauties.  The miraculous sights of Dagomys and the surrounding area are quite diverse.  Among them, a special place is occupied by the cascade of waterfalls.  Although it does not have a poetic name (Dagomys troughs), this natural monument deserves the attention of lovers of beautiful landscapes.  It is located 9 km from the resort in an inaccessible area, which cannot be reached by car.  Therefore, from the site where a wooden bear figure with the sign ‚ÄúTroughs‚Äù is installed as a pointer, tourists have to walk to the waterfalls.  At the same time, it is recommended to take bathing accessories with you in hot weather in order to be able to plunge into the cool waters of the mountain river Western Dagomys. </p>

    <h2>  Assumption Mountain </h2><p>  This natural object is present in most photographs, which depict famous local attractions. </p><p>  Dagomys has repeatedly become the scene of fierce clashes with the Turks.  At least, according to legend, the brave Cossack Georgy Uspensky once served there, who did not give the Basurmans any descent.  Once, he and his comrades were forced to make a stop at the mouth <span>of the Dagomys River</span> and engage in battle with the Turks.  The enemies had to retreat, but it turned out that the Cossacks suffered heavy losses and many wounded.  Among them was Old Man Uspensky.  Before his death, he asked his comrades-in-arms to put together a coffin with a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù for him, and after his death put his body there and put a stand on top of the mountain.  The Cossacks did everything as he wished, and for three days the dead man warned his comrades about the attacks of the Turks.  Only after the final victory the body of the father was interred.  The Cossacks themselves, in hats, applied so much land to the grave that they poured a whole mountain named after the brave warrior George. </p><p>  Climbing to the top of this miraculous pyramid for people with appropriate physical training is not difficult, but in the end they will be rewarded with the opportunity to enjoy magnificent views of the sea, the resort and its surroundings. </p>
