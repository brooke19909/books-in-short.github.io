People come here from all over Europe, and it is not surprising that the transport accessibility of the city is at its best.  From Rimini to Venice you can independently get by train, bus or your own car, however, in the latter case, the car will have to be left somewhere outside the city.  Since inside of Venice, instead of streets, there are mainly canals, and public transport also runs along them. </p>

    <h2>  Better ride by train </h2><p>  It is best to travel from Rimini to Venice on your own by train, if only because there are a lot of them leaving, and they arrive at one of two railway stations in Venice: mainland Mestre or directly to the city center, to Santa Lucia station.  And no parking problems.  The average train duration is from 3 to almost 5 hours.  Cost - from 20 euros.  Based on the fact that the distance between the two cities barely exceeds one and a half hundred kilometers, the travel time seems too long.  This happens because all trains transit through Bologna and make a long stop there.  There are trains that stand there for about two hours. </p>

    <h2>  Schedule and prices </h2><p>  It is easy to get from Rimini to Venice on their own, they go almost every half an hour or an hour.  The schedule is so constructed that the bulk of trains go early in the morning, from about 5-6 in the morning until 11, and in the evening.  This is convenient if you want to go on a trip to Venice from Rimini for a day to see the sights of the legendary city on the water.  However, if you wish, you can leave at any time - there are routes both night and day.  Another thing is that the price can be very different.  The minimum price is 20 euros, but depending on the composition, time of departure or some other parameters, it can reach almost 100 euros. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Itinerary </h2><p>  Any train, if you travel from Rimini to Venice on your own, which has a Santa Lucia station terminus, passes through Mestre, where you can get off to get first impressions in this particular area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVenice.  The same boating, wonderful shopping - so many antique shops and various designer boutiques can not be found anywhere else.  The huge shopping center Le Barche has long been included in the list of attractions that tourists do not ignore.  There are historical places, which include, for example, the church of St. Lorenz, built in the 17th century, as well as architectural monuments.  An electric train often runs from Mestre to Venice, so you can leave for the center at any time. </p><p>  The help desk gives us a distance between Rimini and Venice of 154 km, but this is a direct distance laid right across the sea.  If you go along the highway, you will have to overcome 261 km of the path.  In time, this usually takes about 2.5 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of independent travel </h2><p>  Many doubt it, not knowing how to get from Rimini to Venice on their own, because you can go along with one of the tourist groups that are constantly organized in Rimini.  These are the so-called one day or weekend tours.  The advantage of such a trip is that you will not have to worry about anything - just pay for the trip, and it will include the cost of round-trip tickets and one-night stay at the hotel.  Yes, and an excursion program will be provided.  Nevertheless, many people want to organize their trip on their own.  This will allow you to calmly look around, it is better to delve into Italian everyday life, feel a different mentality and understand the characteristics of the nation, which guarantees a great and powerful experience, for which tourists often travel to distant lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Beach vacations quickly become boring, and Venice is rich in such views and historical sights that swimming in the affectionate Adriatic will seem like a boring activity amid unforgettable emotions.  What stops tourists from an independent trip most often is that there is little information on how to get from Rimini to Venice on your own.  But I would like so much to travel without eternally rushing tiring guides to calmly consider all the charms of the unusual sights of Venice.  These fears are in vain. </p><h2>  How to organize a trip and buy tickets </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, it is very easy to get from Rimini to Venice on your own, because these are large tourist centers, and here everything is suitable for tourists.  There are many signs for those who travel by car, and you can order tickets for a train or bus on sites that are easily located through the Google search engine.  Buying a ticket online is simple, almost everything is clear on an intuitive level, even if you do not speak Italian at all.  Almost all sites have an English interface - enough minimal knowledge to cope with the purchase of a ticket. </p>

    <h2>  Venice Stations </h2><p>  There are two railway stations in Venice, you can choose to arrive where you prefer.  Santa Lucia Central Station is located directly on the island in the city center, and Mestre is on the so-called mainland.  Therefore, take a ticket so that it is closer to the hotel.  And if you intend to return on the same day, then, of course, it is better to take a ticket to the station of Santa Lucia (Stazione di Venezia Santa Lucia).  Here, all the attractions will be literally within walking distance: to the <span>Piazza San Marco</span> and the Palazzo Ducale barely reach one and a half kilometers, to the Basilica - also no more than 2 km.  You do not have to spend time getting from the suburbs of Mestre to the center of Venice. </p><p>  Venice and Rimini are connected by a quite busy railway route, so you can take a ticket from Rimini only one way (only andata).  So you can stay longer if you do not have time to see what you have in mind.  And to buy a return ticket already upon arrival at the Santa Lucia train station - since trains run around the clock and often. </p>

    <h2>  Bus route: timetable and ticket price </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to take a bus from Rimini to Venice on your own.  There is less comfort, of course, and there is no choice either, because one bus from Bonelli Bus runs from Rimini to Venice.  He walks along the coastal highway, collecting everyone on the road at stops.  You can leave from the central station of Rimini, where tickets are a little cheaper, at 16 euros, your schedule, there are 2-3 routes per day, depending on the time of year and demand. </p><p>  At the first stop of Rimini (the southernmost), the Bonelli bus appears at 6:12 in the morning and arrives in the center of Venice closer to 11 hours.  He departs back at 18:00 and arrives in Rimini after 22:00.  The cost of a one-way ticket is 26 euros.  You can save by buying tickets back and forth (andata and ritorno) right away, it will cost 41 euros per person.  For children discounts are provided.  Another opportunity to save is to buy a ticket in advance.  If it is possible to plan a trip in two months, then a bus ticket may be able to take for 9 euros.  Below is a Bonelli bus schedule and ticket price (left). </p>

    <h2>  Travelling by car </h2><p>  To get from Rimini to Venice on your own by car is the best option if you are not accustomed to depend on any schedule.  The route is simple - along the coast to the north to Mestre and further east along the embankment to Venice.  Although you should not go to Venice by car, because finding a parking lot in this city is still a headache.  Yes, and it costs a lot more.  If in Mestre you can leave the car in the parking lot, paying from 5 to 15 euros per hour, then in Venice this figure will increase to 25-30 euros if you can find a free seat. </p><p>  In the city itself, in its central part, there are only two large parking lots: Tronchetto, where the Bonelli bus and Piazza Roma arrive.  Although in fact the choice is much wider, but information about this is difficult to find.  There is also a Toderini garage, Doji parking lot, Venice garage and others, but this is more for those who have the opportunity to call directly and reserve a place for a car.  For parking here you have to pay up to 30 euros per hour.  If you leave your car in Mestre, this will not spoil your vacation at all, since the bus service to Venice and the suburbs is very lively, and trains run often. </p><p>  Driving around Venice by car is also not a great pleasure: the streets are narrow, stone pavements.  The romantic air of Venice is still better not to breathe from the car window.  You also need to know that a trip by car will require additional expenses, because most of the route between Rimini and Venice will be paid, one way will have to pay about 15 euros.  Of course, after a day spent in the medieval atmosphere of Venice, you will most likely forget about all the expenses - you will get too many unforgettable impressions, but it is better to know about them in advance. </p><p>  Those who rest in Rimini and think about an independent trip from Rimini to Venice should definitely implement these plans - Venice will give you a lot of positive emotions. </p>
