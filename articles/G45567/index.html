In this country, the infrastructure and conditions for tourism, active and recreational recreation are ideally developed.  <span>Austrian nature is</span> incredibly beautiful, numerous <span>mountain lakes are</span> crystal clear and clean.  Even in the smallest town, hotels invariably provide excellent service for their guests.  The cuisine here is excellent.  An extremely extensive and well-developed public transport network, an impeccably arranged system for renting cars and bicycles, which, combined with the highest quality roads, allows you to freely travel around the country. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.48718233495569" data-lng="14.722293499999978" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/4/8/1248.png"></div><p>  In Austria, amazing opportunities have been created to spend a beautiful vacation in an unforgettable atmosphere both in winter and in summer, for single travelers, couples or families.  The main thing is to choose your vacation option and think about what places I would like to visit. </p><h2>  Types of rest </h2><p>  Austria is a paradise of <span>alpine tourism.</span>  Numerous ski resorts will offer pistes of different difficulty levels.  Winter activities in selected mountainous areas can be extended until May.  In summer, these places are preferred by hiking enthusiasts.  For such an active type of vacation in Austria, many marked trails have been developed, also with different levels of difficulty. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austrian mountain landscape" class="if uuid-2305318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305318.jpg"></div><p>  The same excellent conditions are provided for cyclists.  An incredible number of routes have been laid in the country for family companies and trained athletes.  You can choose any bike track if you wish, or spend your holidays in Austria on the shores of one of the many mountain lakes.  Another type of relaxation that is acceptable at any time of the year is the numerous balneological and spa resorts that are highly valued by Europeans. </p><h2>  Active winter holidays </h2><p>  Many people prefer to spend holidays in Austria in the winter.  Of course, the country where the most popular sport is skiing, and whose athletes are the most successful skiers in the world, and the slopes, jumps, lifts are best suited for this sport, was simply created to spend winter holidays in it.  There is another indisputable advantage of the Austrian Alps: the snow here is suitable for sports for a long time, even after the end of the main ski season.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter if not all family members or companies own skis.  In the ski resorts there are always instructors ready to train beginners.  In addition to the ski slopes, adrenaline buffs are available for snowboarding and freestyle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotel-seiwald.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austria ski slopes" class="if uuid-2305275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305275.jpg"></div><h2>  Pitztal </h2><p>  The Pitztal Valley is located in the picturesque Tyrolean Alps, not far from the second highest <span>mountain in Austria,</span> Wildspitz.  It offers the perfect combination of services for the whole family.  Skiing is promised by well-groomed slopes, which due to their width are ideal for carving - descent with "cut" arcuate corners.  It is no coincidence that here you can meet the famous local native Benny Reich.  Pitztal will satisfy even opponents of skiing - just go up the highest cable car in Austria.  The view of three hundred snow-covered rivers stretching far below will make you catch your breath.  Together with the surrounding resorts Hochzeiger and Rifflessee, the glacier offers almost 100 kilometers of slopes, romantic cross-country skiing trails, as well as many attractions such as sleigh rides, snowshoeing and vertical climbing the ice mountain, as well, importantly, babysitting and children‚Äôs the gardens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hochkoenig.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austrian city Maria Alm" class="if uuid-2305253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305253.jpg"></div><h2>  Stubaier </h2><p>  An unforgettable ski vacation in Austria will give the largest glacier in the country of Stubai (Tyrol).  It is located south of Innsbruck, in the Stubaital Valley.  The nearest hotel complex is Austria's largest ski resort Neustift, which operates year-round.  Stubai promises good snow from October to June and offers 150 kilometers of slopes, mainly with blue and red markings (medium and more difficult levels) with lengths from 2,300 to 3,200 meters.  A special feature is the 10-km descent along the Wilde Grub'n slope.  Fans of other winter pleasures will also find activities for themselves.  About 70 kilometers of toboggans for useless sleighs and more than 100 kilometers of cross-country skiing runs here. </p><h2>  Hintertux </h2><p>  Hintertux is the only Austrian resort that offers good snow conditions for all 365 days of the year.  The glacier will satisfy even the most demanding skiers.  There are almost 90 kilometers of tracks of excellent quality.  Hintertux is a paradise for snowboarders and boasts the highest arched springboard in Europe.  Here you can see the natural ice palace Natur Eis Palast with giant icicles and interesting ice formations.  Hintertux is also known for its Apres skis and the Betterpark summer snow park, open from April to December. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hochkoenig.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Funicular in the mountains of Austria" class="if uuid-2305248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305248.jpg"></div><h2>  Cycling tourism </h2><p>  After skiing, cycling is the most popular summer vacation in Austria.  The network of rental points and routes for cyclists is impeccably developed here.  Such points are in all tourist towns and at each railway station, where, having rented a bicycle, you can rent it at any other station. </p><p>  Upper Austria is the dream of cyclists.  Here you can ride comfortably among lakes and rivers.  Bikers prefer routes through beautiful <span>alpine valleys,</span> skirting picturesque pastures.  And the track along the Danube is a proven classic.  The Upper Austrian section of the cycling route runs from Passau to Green and is about 150 kilometers away.  This is a very comfortable walk along the European road, and it involves many excursions in various points of the Danube riverbed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alpina.cz" data-author=": Ale≈° Padƒõra, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cycling in Austria" class="if uuid-2301979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2301979.jpg"></div><p>  But a trip to M√ºhlviertel is a challenge for a strong biker.  The region in the south of Bohemia does not belong to the alpine terrain, but its green hills still require preparation.  It is a 258 km long track with an ideal starting point and destination in Julbach on the Austrian side of the Bohemian forest in Bemerwald.  The road leads through the countryside among forests, meadows and pastures past amazing formations of granite rocks. </p><h2>  Hiking </h2><p>  Hiking in the mountains is a relatively safe, but demanding sport that requires prior preparation.  First of all, you should evaluate your capabilities and, according to them, choose a route. </p><p>  Almost all areas of Austria offer a variety of destinations with standardized marking of trails indicated on tourist maps.  Blue color indicates a safe, well-groomed track, suitable for beginners.  Red color usually characterizes rocky mountainous terrain with steep climbs and, in many places, steel ropes.  Among the red marked trails, there are no really dangerous places, but some skill in alpine crossings is necessary.  Black routes - for experienced tourists.  These are long rocky hills that require a lot of experience and the right equipment.  When choosing your ideal trail, two more factors should be considered: the physical condition of all team members and weather conditions that can be specified in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tierischer-urlaub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hiking in Austria" class="if uuid-2305375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305375.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most beautiful routes is the Waldviertel of Lower Austria, which is suitable for relaxation and easy walks.  The area is almost flat, with a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains and granite rock formations.  Its culmination is the famous Ysperklamm Gorge, which, in fact, is a 2-kilometer forest abyss with waterfalls.  Another area that will be appreciated by beginners thanks to the flat terrain is Lake Millst√§tter See in the heart of Carinthia. </p><h2>  Holidays on the lakes </h2><p>  In summer, Austria is especially beautiful with its pristine lakes, which many tourists prefer to sea beaches.  In Carinthia, the dominant part of the landscape is the cleanest lakes with warm summer water.  All the waters of this region offer many sports and recreation.  Werther See is one of the most popular and largest lake in Carinthia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.landhotels.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the lakes of Austria" class="if uuid-2305213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305213.jpg"></div><p>  Another magical place is Lake Zeller See in Salzburg, with two famous ski resorts on the shore - Kaprun and Zell am See, which are among the centers with the most thoughtful organization of health and sports events.  In addition to many advantages, the attractions of the Zell am See resort include the Grossglockner Strasses panoramic alpine road and paragliding flights, which give a relaxing experience in the mountains of Austria.  The mountain village of Kaprun is located in the northern foothills of the year-round ski resort - the Kitzsteinhorn Glacier.  The water of Lake Zeller See is drinking, there are several beaches along the banks, playgrounds, conditions for lake cruises, windsurfing and other water sports.  The water temperature ranges from mid-May to September within +22 ... 24 degrees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.berge-meer.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mountain Lakes of Austria" class="if uuid-2305174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2305174.jpg"></div><h2>  Spa </h2><p>  Austria is known for its thermal springs, which became the basis of its popular spa centers.  Many Europeans come to rest in Austria not only for the sake of beautiful alpine nature and sports, but also for water relaxing, therapeutic and cosmetic procedures.  After all, Austrian thermal springs are well known for their healing properties and medical indications in a number of diseases of the skin, internal organs and nervous system. </p><h2>  Therme laa </h2><p>  Therme Laa Resort &amp; Silent Spa is a 4-star hotel in a quiet location with excellent service amidst the beautiful hilly landscape of Lower Austria.  Paying for a stay at the hotel, the guest receives a number of free services and procedures, including: </p><ul><li>  Wellness center with several thermal pools, indoor and outdoor (temperature in the main outdoor pool all year round +34 degrees; </li><li>  water slide 90 m long; </li><li>  salt pool with a constant temperature of +36 degrees; </li><li>  outdoor hot tubs; </li><li>  fitness and cardiozone with an active and relaxing program; </li><li>  steam bath and Finnish sauna; </li><li>  massage and luxurious relaxation areas (conservatory, Asian room). </li></ul><h2>  Aqua dome </h2><p>  The luxury four-star Aqua Dome Thermal Spa Hotel is located on the outskirts of L√§ngenfeld in Tirol.  Despite the large-scale territory (50 thousand square meters), this place is calm, with a beautiful view of the mountains, it will leave an unforgettable experience of a vacation in Austria.  The Aqua Dome Thermal Spa consists of 12 pools with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã2000 meters and has salt caves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rakousko.svetadily.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Dome Thermal Spa" class="if uuid-2302337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2302337.jpg"></div><p>  The wellness program includes daily outdoor classes with the advice of fitness trainers.  And the rooms are furnished according to the rules of Feng Shui, only soft drinks are provided in the minibar, and fresh fruit is served daily in the room.  The resort is close to ski slopes and 12 km from the S√∂lden cable cars. </p><h2>  St.  Martins Therme and Lodge </h2><p>  This stunning thermal spa in Burgenland is set in the middle of its own lake next to the Neusiedlersee-Zewinkel National Park, bordering Hungary.  The combination of such a location with an exciting safari-style atmosphere and the latest spa services creates conditions incomparable with other types of recreation in Austria, according to the opinions of tourists who visited here.  You can go to the small Hungarian plain of the national park and then return to this wonderful oasis of calm and indulge in care and relaxation in the large wellness center, and then dine in the restaurant, which serves delicious local cuisine and offers a selection of fine wines. </p>
