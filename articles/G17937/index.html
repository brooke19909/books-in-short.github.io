This is not a science, but a special classification of personality types, as well as the relationships that develop between them.  It was founded in the seventies of the last century by such a sociologist as Ausra Augustinavichute.  And this typology aroused <span>genuine interest</span> among many <span>.</span>  So, it’s worthwhile to tell in a simple and understandable language about this concept and understand its principles. </p>

    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  So, what is socionics, this is understandable.  Now you need to disclose this term in more detail. </p><p>  The purpose of this concept is that each person can find out their individual <span>socionic type</span> and, based on the result and the read characteristics (usually with some tips that guide you on a certain path), choose a way of self-realization. </p><p>  Many critics and scientists say that socionics is already an independent discipline, which does not apply to psychology, but significantly goes beyond its framework.  One could say otherwise.  Socionics is a peculiar and unique science, which lies where computer science, sociology and psychology intersect. </p><h2>  Application of discipline </h2><p>  Socionics is not only the discipline that developed <span>socionic types.</span>  It is also a science that has found its application in certain fields of activity.  So, for example, in Russia the socionic test is often carried out in the selection of personnel.  It also happens that methods based on the principles of this discipline are used in pedagogy.  <span>Professional orientation,</span> equipment and the formation of surgical ambulance teams - in this, she also found her application. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even in linguistics, socionics is used.  Based on its principles, a systemic typology of a linguistic personality is clarified.  In this case, linguosocial types are isolated and analyzed.  But this is a completely different “industry”. </p><p>  And, of course, politics.  In this important field of activity, this concept has also already begun to be used. </p>

    <h2>  Mental function </h2><p>  Socionics is an unusual test.  It may seem simple (although, in fact, the way it is), but in order to make it such, scientists conducted various experiments and studied human thinking. </p><p>  Personality types are identified based on characteristics such as intuition, sensation, feeling and thinking.  And they have their own definition.  So, for example, thinking is a function that brings information and data into a concrete conceptual connection.  Feeling is characterized a little differently.  It gives this content a certain value.  This refers to the moral component.  That is, a person received information (thinking), processed it and made a conclusion - is it bad or good, beautiful / ugly, mean / honest, etc. These are feelings. </p><p>  Now the feeling.  Synonym for the word “perception”.  The person, determining the conclusion (as mentioned above), is guided precisely by sensations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And the last one is intuition.  That function by which a person perceives something without reflection.  It can be said unconsciously.  It just seems so to him. </p><p>  On the basis of these functions, and more precisely on how they are combined in the consciousness of a particular person and in what quantities, the socionic type is determined. </p>

    <h2>  Don Quixote, Dumas, Hugo and Robespierre </h2><p>  These are the first four types that I would like to talk about.  There are 16 of them. </p><p>  So, “Don Quixote” (aka “Seeker”).  <span>People of</span> this <span>type are</span> described as intuitively logical extroverts.  Excellent organizers, personalities who try to be useful, thrill-seekers who need constant excitement and are always eager for prospects. </p><p>  “Dumas”, aka “Mediator”.  These people are sensory-ethical introverts.  They are friendly, they like art and nature, they are attentive and caring, rarely refuse, love to help and do not like to stand out from the crowd.  Unfortunately, these kind and sincere people are rare today.  Socionics has already proved this.  The relationship table shows that the ideal pair (dual) for such people is “Don Quixote”, which was described above.  And indeed, according to their characteristics, they ideally complement each other. </p><p>  “Hugo” and “Robespierre” - they are also “Enthusiast” and “Analyst”.  Ethical-sensory extrovert and logical-intuitive introvert.  Ideally complement each other from a psychological point of view.  A fiery, emotional, tireless lover of order and a rational fighter for justice with developed logic is a very colorful combination, as socionics shows.  Women and men who meet in this combination are quite interesting couples. </p>

    <h2>  “Hamlet”, “Maxim”, “Zhukov” and “Yesenin” </h2><p>  The first two types listed are “Mentor” and “Inspector”.  And they are also duals.  “Hamlets” are serious and problem-focused individuals.  Socionics shows that these people can cope with anything if they prepare for the situation and find a solution.  They clearly divide good and evil and never do wrong undeservedly. </p><p>  “Maxim Gorky” - sober realists who never change their minds.  At all.  In addition, they are quite secretive.  For them, “mine” means exclusively “mine.”  They are hardy, persistent in character, sometimes even ruthless.  And emotional. </p><p>  “Zhukov” and “Yesenin” are also an interesting dual pair.  “Marshals” are strong-willed and purposeful people who are interested in achieving the intended goal.  Do not experience fear, anxiety or other strong emotions.  “Esenin” is an ideal dual pair for him because these very people are fighters for emotional emancipation.  Very subtly feel the rest.  Romantics who pursue inspiration.  A man of the socionic type “Yesenin” will become something that the somewhat callous and serious “Zhukov” lacked. </p>

    <h2>  “Napoleon”, “Balzac”, “Jack” and “Dreiser” </h2><p>  This is the penultimate “four”, which offers our attention socionics.  The relationship table shows that these types really complement each other in full. </p><p>  After all, “Napoleon” and “Balzac” are, indeed, a unique couple.  Active, energetic esthete and kind-hearted intellectual.  “Balzac” becomes an ideal pair for “Napoleon” because he needs a man at his side who would become a “second half” at once.  That is, he does not want to adapt to his partner.  And in this dual pair it is quite possible. </p><p>  “Jack” is a true workaholic, a romantic who loves adventure, a tireless optimist and just a person who loves life.  What does socionics tell us?  The relationship with the “Jacks” is excellent with the “Drivers”.  Because they are polite, tactful people, modest, faithful, loving.  In general, “Dreisers” “Jack” will definitely want to amuse, show a real, eventful life.  As a rule, such pairs are strong. </p><h2>  “Stirlitz”, “Dostoevsky”, “Huxley” and “Gabin” </h2><p>  This is the last four <span>socionic types.</span>  "Shtirlitsy" - people who know how to act logically and reasonably.  They are assertive and do not tolerate any delay.  Also, "Stirlitz" - an ardent opponent of cunning, meanness and dishonest game, whatever it may be.  “Dostoevsky”, considered the ideal socionic pair “Stirlitz”, are owners of a very sensitive and <span>delicate mental organization.</span>  They never refuse and try to help everyone.  Indeed, these people are able to become a good pair of “Shtirlitsam” - they will be able to teach them to be more emotional and softer in those situations where without this they can’t build a relationship. </p><p>  Huxley is an ardent enthusiast.  Emotional, active, like fun companies and adventures.  And everything can depend on their mood.  “Gabin,” his dual is a restrained in emotions person who will not work without any purpose.  They really get a <span>mutually beneficial relationship</span> with Huxley <span>.</span>  One of the other teaches to control emotions (when you need to be restrained, and when you do not need to do this), and the second - pushes your partner to be active. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, it should be noted that each type has a detailed description, and all that is described above is only briefly and for general familiarization.  And finally, I would like to make a reservation that from the above “duals” not necessarily love couples can be obtained.  Colleagues, comrades, friends - we mean the whole relationship between people!  Indeed, “duals” are simply certain pairs that are ideal from the point of view of the psycho-sociological complement of each other. </p>
