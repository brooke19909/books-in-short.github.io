No matter how they relate to it, but they are a necessity in the life of each of us.  But the heirs of the oligarchs are few, and only a few manage to win the lottery.  Therefore, for most of us, the question is acute: "How to make money without start-up capital?" </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money without start-up capital" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/119747.jpg" width="600"></div>  Recall the joke: "How did I get rich? I had an apple. I sold it and bought two. Two sold - bought four. Then I opened my own stall. Then the store. And then the millionaire uncle died and left me his fortune."  What is its essence?  The fact that you can quickly find a state only with a happy (for you) set of circumstances.  The remaining methods require either investment or hard work.  And yet, <span>how to make money</span> without start-up capital?

    <p>  Remember how in "Prostokvashino" Uncle Fedor reasonably offers "to sell something unnecessary ..." So, selling your property, of course, can generate income quickly, but provided that we have it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money online" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/119749.jpg" width="600"></div>  If he is not there, or we cannot afford to lose him, the question again and again arises: "How to make money?"  Without start-up capital, it‚Äôs hard to start anything.  But we have the most valuable capital: skill, desire and time.  The number of people interested in <span>how to make money on the Internet is</span> growing rapidly day by day.  And not by chance: because the network allows us to sell ourselves. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money on the phone" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12066/119748.jpg" width="560"></div>  No, there is nothing wrong with this: after all, in the same way, when we come to work every day, we do it.  In exchange for our knowledge, skills, time, we receive banknotes.  But the Internet allows you to make money on your phone, computer, just for a living, without leaving home.

If we do not have any special skills, but we have a lot of free time, then for sure we can make money on it.  Where and how?  For example, posting on the forums.  Mostly, they pay a few cents for messages, but if you write a lot and interestingly, the forum owner, who is eager to promote his site, will appreciate this, or maybe offer to become a moderator: immediately the payment level rises.  The other two online professions that help you understand how to make money without start-up capital.  - An online chat worker or group administrator on social networks.  Please note: the resources you visit always have support that is ready to answer your questions.  A list of problems and their solutions, of course, is provided to such an employee.  Moreover, he can work remotely while in another city or even a country.  The most important requirement is to be online at a specific time.  Group manager in social networks is another idea how to make money without start-up capital.  Here you only need a desire to communicate and a fantasy that will allow the community to expand and acquire more and more fans. </p><p>  If you do not like these professions, but you know how to correctly and colorfully express your thoughts, you can become a copywriter or rewriter.  The first writes original texts for websites, online publications, magazines.  The second from the source makes a unique text.  Sometimes you need to look for the source code yourself, sometimes it is provided by the customer.  You can recommend a beginning author to search for customers on article exchanges and freelance portals.  Work through the site insures first of all the copywriter: it ensures that if the text is written in a high-quality and competent manner, the author will receive his reward.  Then, when you already have a name, you will receive direct, more expensive orders from serious partners.  But it's still better to start on the stock exchange. </p><p>  There are many opportunities for making money on the network: these are the services of a designer, and programming, and the administration of sites.  Of course, the development of these types of activities requires time and determination, but if desired, nothing is impossible.  Facebook, after all, also began as a local student network. </p>
