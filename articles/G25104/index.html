Antarctica exploration in the 21st century</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The discovery and exploration of Antarctica is one of the greatest events in history.  The discovery of the sixth continent and the further study of its features gave mankind a lot of opportunities to expand its knowledge of the world.  The largest <span>scientific activity</span> was conducted in Antarctica in the middle of the last century, but even today the icy continent is not deprived of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="modern studies of antarctica" class="if uuid-800845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/800845.jpg?1554829500"></div><h2>  Arrangements </h2><p>  Modern <span>research of Antarctica is</span> carried out by several countries at once.  The document on the special interaction of different states on the territory of the ice continent was formed in 1959.  Then twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty, according to which it is forbidden to conduct hostilities within the sixth continent, to bury toxic and other wastes, and also any territorial claims were frozen for a while.  To date, 33 more countries have joined this agreement.  Antarctic exploration in the 21st century is often international in nature.  In addition, since 1991, the ice continent has been declared a world nature reserve. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="discovery and exploration of Antarctica" class="if uuid-800846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/800846.jpg?1554829500"></div><h2>  The position of Russia </h2><p>  Our country does not officially have territorial claims.  Russian researchers work in <span>many national</span> sectors of Antarctica.  The scope of scientific activity, however, has still not reached the level that was during the Soviet Union.  However, every year the situation is getting better.  The constant expeditions of the Russian polar explorers are busy studying a wide variety of issues related to the geological, geographical, climatic and other features of the continent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Antarctica research in the 21st century" class="if uuid-800849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/800849.jpg?1554829500"></div><h2>  Areas of interest </h2><p>  Modern studies of Antarctica are carried out in several main areas: </p><ul><li>  <span>fundamental study of</span> Antarctica; </li><li>  scientific and applied research and development; </li><li>  collection of data on the <span>natural environment of the</span> South polar region; </li><li>  environmental protection; </li><li>  logistical support of research, contributing, in particular, to increasing the capabilities of Russian stations and the comfort of staying at them. </li></ul><h2>  Microworld </h2><p>  Antarctica - the geography of its landscape, the population of living organisms, the climate, - seems to be well understood.  However, in each of these areas there are still gaps.  For example, the attention of scientists is increasingly attracted to the microworld peculiar to the continent.  The various bacteria and fungi that exist here differ from their counterparts from other continents in their ability to adapt to the extremely harsh conditions of Antarctica.  If you do not take into account the coastal zones, the temperature here does not rise above -20 ¬∫, the air is dry, strong winds constantly blow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="south antarctica" class="if uuid-800847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/800847.jpg?1554829500"></div><p>  Many modern studies of Antarctica are associated with the identification of the characteristics of microorganisms.  Their adaptive abilities are planned to be used for medical purposes.  Scientists have the opinion that some microbial communities need to be established on the icy continent.  There they will acquire the properties and signs necessary for survival, and then on their basis it will be possible to create more effective drugs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  East Lake </h2><p>  One of the most interesting communities of microorganisms, scientists expect to find in the ice reservoir.  Lake Vostok, named after the nearby Russian station, is located at a depth of about 4 thousand meters.  Its uniqueness in the absence of contact with the earth's atmosphere for several million years.  The ecosystem of the lake is ‚Äúconserved‚Äù and may contain many amazing microorganisms.  The alleged "inhabitants" of the lake must be able to withstand high pressure, very low temperatures, an oxygen concentration 50 times higher than its level in drinking water, and be fed with inorganic carbon.  Until now, such organisms are unknown to science. </p><p>  To explore the lake in the 70s of the last century, it was decided to start drilling.  However, the surface of the East reached very recently, in 2012.  3507 unique DNA sequences were found in the samples obtained then and a little later.  Most of them, about 94%, belong to bacteria, in second place mushrooms - their four percent.  Also found in the samples are two sequences belonging to archaea. </p><p>  Research on the lake continues today, as it is necessary to obtain water samples from its bottom, as well as confirm or refute previous results.  The attitude towards them in the scientific world is ambiguous.  Some researchers predict the discovery of even such large organisms as fish.  Their opponents say that part of the DNA was probably brought in with a drill, the other is the remains of extinct creatures. </p><h2>  A bunch of </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="land in antarctica" class="if uuid-800844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/800844.jpg?1554829500"></div><p>  The East is not the only subglacial lake on the continent.  Today, 145 reservoirs are known, presumably being similar formations.  In addition, modern research on Antarctica is concentrated to one degree or another around the open lakes of the continent.  Some of them are filled with <span>fresh water,</span> others are mineralized.  The "inhabitants" of these lakes are all the same microorganisms, scientists were not able to detect the presence of fish or arthropods.  Part of the lakes located in the so-called oases and on the subantarctic islands are annually freed from ice.  Others are always hidden.  Still others may be released only once every few years. </p><h2>  Overhead </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Antarctica geography" class="if uuid-100066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12223/100066.jpg?1554829500"></div><p>  Earth in Antarctica, or rather the surface of the mainland and its internal structure, is not the only thing that is interesting to researchers.  The focus of research is often on atmospheric and climatic processes.  In 1985, an "ozone hole" was discovered over Antarctica.  Since then, it has been constantly under the scrutiny of scientists.  The data collected by researchers at Russian stations suggest that the hole will ‚Äúgrow‚Äù soon.  Some researchers in this regard are of the opinion that the phenomenon itself is not of an anthropogenic nature, as previously assumed, but natural. </p><p>  Far, mysterious, icy, southern - Antarctica has received a lot of epithets since the first assumptions about its existence in Antiquity.  And it fully corresponds to all of them.  The current stage of development of the sixth continent differs from the previous ones in the best preparation of equipment and specialists.  The comfort of staying at stations is increasing, methods for selecting polar explorers are being improved (according to research, the psychological climate is much more important than weather conditions).  The <span>technical support of</span> expeditions is constantly improving.  In a word, all conditions are created for further study of the secrets and mysteries of the ice continent. </p>
