  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in China: a journey along the Silk Road</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>A trip to China</span> is a great opportunity to visit a majestic country, an unshakable and pristine world, in which there is literally everything: the amazing nature and exquisite beauty of cities, majestic <span>architectural structures</span> and historical monuments.  There are picturesque mountains and plains, lowlands, beaches and ports, marvelous caves and swift mountain rivers.  You can visit the most beautiful waterfalls and monasteries in the world in China (including the famous Shaolin), but the most important thing is to understand the deep philosophy that pervades almost everything here. </p><p>  Things to do? </p><p>  Take a trip to China - what could be more interesting?  This is not a traditional vacation on sunny beaches, not a trip for skiing, and not an opportunity to visit health resorts ....  Holidays in China - it's all at once - and something completely different from other types of recreation.  Here you can take part in a wonderful hunt in the forests of the Bolshoi Khingan ridge, or you can watch horse riding.  In winter, ice sculpture festivals or ice skating and skiing will be great fun.  History buffs will appreciate the beauty of the ancient Silk Road at its three most important points - on Mount Emei, in the Sansya Canyon (Yangtze River) and in a wonderful reserve called Jiuzhaigou. </p><p>  Holidays in China will be remembered for the aroma of many varieties of real tea, the delicate sensuality of the touch of fine Chinese silk, the awareness of the greatness of the Great <span>Wall of China</span> and the incredible taste of traditional delicacies.  The last point of the ‚Äúexcursion program‚Äù is worth paying the most attention: a Peking duck, slightly smoked and fried in aromatic vegetable oil, soaked previously in spicy soy sauce and tinted in an appetizing bright red color, is worth it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you are afraid of frosts - in the north-west of China (beyond the Greater Khingan Range) you should not go.  There, the temperature can sometimes drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius.  The best option is a trip to the ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù city of Harbin with its ice sculpture festivals or to Beijing, where the weather conditions are similar to the Russian ones, and the snow that has fallen perfectly decorates ancient pagodas and palaces. </p><p>  Top 5 cities, without visiting which rest in China makes no sense </p><p>  The city of Luoyang, located on the banks of the Lo River, offers to take part in a one-day excursion to some of the two thousand unusual caves, which will allow you to see more than at least a small part of the hundreds of thousands of sculptures and sculptures sculptured in them. </p><p>  The city of Shanghai is a magnificent <span>temple of the Jade Buddha,</span> in which you can see two sculptures of Buddha carved from white Burmese jade, richly decorated with precious stones.  Attention deserves the Royal Mausoleum in Nanyue, as well as the Shanghai Opera. </p><p>  Hong Kong is a city with ancient shops and Chinese markets, peacefully coexisting side by side with high-rise office buildings and modern shopping centers.  Nowhere in the country did Chinese culture and philosophy mix with modernity so tightly and bizarrely. </p><p>  Beijing City: China's largest zoo, located in <span>the Ming Dynasty</span> Emperors Park <span>,</span> Tiananmen Square, the largest in the world, the great Temple of Heaven and one of the best Asian aquariums.  But the biggest adventure may be to participate in the morning exercises, which hundreds of local residents gather daily. </p><p>  Taiwan City: This place is famous for its amazing combination of natural conditions - forested mountain slopes and sunny beaches. </p><p>  Each of these cities is original and multifaceted in its own way.  Even if you are not too interested in cultural and historical monuments, in this country you can always find something interesting, something that is not found in any other country in the world.  Holidays in China are a touch of wondrous Asia - mysterious, exciting and full of mysteries. </p>
