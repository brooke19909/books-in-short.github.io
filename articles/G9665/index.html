  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Waterpark in Vladivostok, description, photos, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The water park is a great place to relax, where there is everything for games in the water, water slides, pools of various shapes and sizes, artificial rivers and much more.  The most modern of them have special waves in the pool, others are located in the open.  Let's try to figure out what constitutes a water park in Vladivostok.  It is located on the recreation center "Forest Glade" in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSadgorod, has huge dimensions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vl.moiotdyh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Forest Glade" class="if uuid-2518229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2518229.jpg"></div><h2>  Place Features </h2><p>  The perimeter of the water park is fully protected, which bypasses it regularly.  This is a great advantage, because it means that the recreation area is completely safe.  Entrance fee for an adult is 100 rubles, for a child - 50 rubles on weekdays, but on weekends the fare is doubled.  At the entrance to the water park is a hotel complex, consisting of five buildings, which have rooms of different classes, from standard to luxury.  VIP houses with a separate pool are built separately, and for lovers of relaxation there is a bath complex and related services.  The recreation area has many places where you can have a good lunch: cafes, restaurants, etc. In winter, you can also find leisure for yourself.  A large ski run with ski lifts, a park for snowboarders, a skating rink and rental of sports equipment are built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.25472" data-lng="132.03287999999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/9/1/6/3916.png"></div><h2>  Description of the recreation area </h2><p>  Next, there are two pools of impressive size, next to them are bars and sun loungers.  This is what it is worth coming to.  An open-air slide is built near the pond, gliding along it with ease, smoothly, and at the end of it there is a sharp descent into the water.  However, there is always a large crowd of people near the hill; you will have to stand in line.  To appreciate the charm of this place, you need to see a photo of the water park in Vladivostok.  The place where the water center is located is very popular among visitors, because it is suitable for holidays with the whole family.  I don‚Äôt feel like leaving here.  The safety of the water park in Vladivostok is high, the risk of injury is extremely low. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lesnaya-polyana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location of the water park in the &quot;Forest Glade&quot;" class="if uuid-2518230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87358/2518230.jpg"></div><h2>  Entry cost </h2><p>  Double room has a price tag of 7500 rubles per day, on weekdays the price is slightly lower.  The water park in Vladivostok is amazing, and the entry prices are quite pleasant: an entire day of visiting for an adult costs 1100 rubles, for a child - 1050 rubles.  Five o'clock field is an evening discount.  Employees of the institution maintain the required water temperature.  Children are ready to sit there for hours.  After visiting the water park in Vladivostok, you can go to bask in the bath.  A few days spent here will allow you to remember this place for a long time and relax well. </p>
