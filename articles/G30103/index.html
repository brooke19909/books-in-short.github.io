The diameter of the TV is 81 cm, the resolution is 1920 √ó 1080 pixels, and the frame refresh rate is 100 Hz.  The device has a backlight and a spread.

The power of the speakers is 20 W, the sound, in principle, is not bad for the budget option.  Among the external advantages include a remote control and a convenient menu.
