    <p>  The sea is about a quarter of an hour's walk.  True, to go up for longer, about forty minutes.  Therefore, if it is difficult for you to <span>walk,</span> it is better to take bus number sixteen.  He goes to the port no more than five minutes.  You can get to both wild and equipped (paid) beaches. </p><p>  The best coast for relaxation is considered Laco Ameno.  It is there that you can visit for free.
