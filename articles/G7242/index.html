    <h2>  The benefits and harms of thermal baths </h2><p>  In addition to comfortable, in the region there are "wild" hot springs.  Tyumen offers a lot of options for healthy rest for residents and visitors of the city.  However, thermal water has not only beneficial, but also harmful properties.  A contraindication for taking thermal baths is tuberculosis, cancer, and also blood problems. </p><p>  It contains a lot of sulfides and hydrogen sulfide, which positively affect many body systems.  In humans, metabolism is activated, skin cell regeneration improves, blood supply is regulated.  Many inflammations resolve, excess weight decreases and all this is due to the fact that people use a hot spring (Tyumen).  Vacation prices pleasantly surprise and delight visitors.  As a rule, they fluctuate within 200-500 rubles per person.  The subscription is issued for several hours (or for a day).  For children under 7 years old, swimming at many recreation centers is free. </p>
