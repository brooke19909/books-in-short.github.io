  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Genoa: port, cruise port, old port, city infrastructure, interesting places and attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Mediterranean Sea, where the seaports of Genoa, Athens, Marseille, Venice, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãValencia are located, is the cradle of European civilization.  It served (and serves) a broad road for the movement of goods, the interpenetration of cultures, and the exchange of experience.  And the main gate to southern Europe today is the ancient city of Genoa. </p><h2>  Becoming </h2><p>  In the III century BC, the Romans learned about the existence of the fishing village of the Ligurians and annexed it to their territory.  However, the elevation of a small village as a "mistress of the sea" began in the X century.  The impudent pirate raid of Muslims in 934 was the reason for the construction of port fortifications.  The protected bay has become attractive for both fishermen and merchants.  The latter established trade routes with the Eastern Mediterranean and Spain. </p><p>  During the Crusades, the port of Genoa became one of the important points for the delivery of crusaders to Palestine and trade with the Holy Land.  Huge profits were spent on strengthening infrastructure and building their own merchant and navy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="suitcasemag.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://suitcasemag.com/travel/explore/destination-inspiration-genoa-italy/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Port of Genoa: how to get there" class="if uuid-2558473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558473.jpg"></div><h2>  The ups and downs of history </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XII century, the Genoese Republic was created.  One hundred thousandth city becomes one of the richest and strongest in the Mediterranean, and its ships can be found in all corners of the known world.  Only Venice could create competition for him.  The port of Genoa founded colonies and trading posts from the Crimea to Greece, from the Apennines to North Africa and even Belgium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, was a Genoese.  He did not find support for his ideas at home, which, apparently, the townspeople still regret.  One can only guess how world history would change if the wealth of a distant continent went to Liguria. </p><h2>  Decline and rebirth </h2><p>  Since <span>the Republic of Genoa</span> was a "trading empire", the welfare of the seaport of Genoa depended directly on the economic situation.  In the XIV century, the Ottoman Empire significantly strengthened, crowding out Italian merchants from the rich East.  At the same time, increased competition with <span>the Republic of Venice</span> led to a protracted, exhausting war.  The erupted economic crisis led to decline, internal strife and the struggle of factions.  In the end, the republic was occupied by the French in 1499, and they were there until 1528.  May 30, 1522 the city was attacked and completely looted by the Spaniards who fought with France. </p><p>  The revival of the city, as you might guess, contributed to the ubiquitous merchants.  They invested heavily in the enterprises of the Spanish crown and received fabulous income from the American colonies.  In 1557, after the financial collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, Genoese bankers became the main creditors on the continent.  The period from 1557 to 1627 in historical chronicles is called the "Century of Genoa." </p><div class="photo" data-original="gilboys.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port of Genoa, Italy" class="if uuid-2558579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558579.jpg"></div><h2>  The fall of the republic </h2><p>  The strengthening of the British fleet, as well as the 80-year war of Holland with Spain for independence led to the decline of the latter in the XVII century.  The port of Genoa, being a longtime ally of the Spaniards, lost significant income.  Moreover, the island of Corsica was sold to France in 1768, and Tunisian pirates seized the last outpost in Africa four years later, the Tabarku fortress.  However, Liguria still owned a large fleet, and in wealth and power surpassed the eternal rival in trade affairs - Venice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not known how the fate of the Genoese republic would have been in the future if Napoleon Bonaparte had not come to power in neighboring France.  Driven by a passion for conquest, he easily captured Genoa in 1797.  Since then, the city has ceased to be an independent player in the international arena and subsequently became part of the united Italy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.freeimages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoa Old Port" class="if uuid-2558480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558480.jpg"></div><h2>  Old port </h2><p>  The old port of Genoa is as old as the settlement itself - more than 2000. He is an unbiased witness to both the incredible ups and dramatic falls of the city.  To its moorings moored the triremes of the Greeks, and the triremes of the Carthaginians, and the liburnans of the Romans, and the Dromons of the Byzantines, and the <span>Viking dragons,</span> galleys, brigantines and barges of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  The heart of Porto-Vecchio is Piazza Caricamento, built up of old customs warehouses, houses of sailors and bankers.  Guests are greeted by the Palazzo San Giorgio, painted with frescoes by the master Lazzaro Tavarone.  The palace was erected during the heyday of the city in 1260, and for a long time was the center of secular power.  By the way, the Venetian merchant Marco Polo was held in its walls.  In the XV century, it housed the oldest bank in Italy - San Giorgio.  And today the building does not stand idle - the port administration is located in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe old port attracts tourists like a magnet.  On its narrow streets there are cozy hotels, cafes, restaurants, clubs and entertainment venues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seaport of Genoa" class="if uuid-2558573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558573.jpg"></div><h2>  New port </h2><p>  The modern seaport of Genoa in Italy (and throughout southern Europe) is the largest both in size and in terms of cargo turnover.  Its construction began in the XIX century and continues to this day.  Every year it receives and sends more than 3 million passengers, and unloading / shipment of goods exceeds 1.7 million tons. </p><p>  The secret of success lies in centuries-old experience, a convenient harbor, well-thought out infrastructure and a good location near the industrial areas of Northern Italy.  29 operating terminals are designed to accept all existing types of vessels, including tankers and container ships.  About 150 routes connect Genoa with other ports of the world.  The enterprise is the main employer of the region: about 60,000 people work here, more than 10,000 are indirectly dependent on its work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cruisemapper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoa Cruise Port" class="if uuid-2558555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558555.jpg"></div><h2>  Cruise port </h2><p>  Despite the historical ups and downs, Liguria remains the most important marine region.  Convenient harbor, developed infrastructure, interesting sights attract without exaggeration millions of tourists annually.  Cruise ships arrive here daily for the maintenance of which the Genoa cruise port is built. </p><p>  It is a modern port complex, which includes 5 large moorings capable of receiving ocean liners.  There are also 13 terminals for mooring and servicing ferries.  The berths extend over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã250,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  Cargo turnover is 4 million passengers, 250,000 trucks, 1.5 million cars. </p><p>  The pride of the townspeople is the historic maritime station Ponte dei Millet.  Today it is a technologically advanced cruise terminal with facilities designed in the image of the best airports in the world to ensure the fast boarding and disembarkation of the latest generation liners.  A new cruise terminal is currently under construction in the Ponte Parody industrial zone. </p><p>  Direct regular connections are made with the tourist pearls of the Mediterranean, such as Porto Cervo, Nice, Cannes, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãetc. The cruise port is connected to the city by metro line, there are numerous bus routes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.celebritypix.us" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.celebritypix.us/celebrities/soprana-medieval-celebrities-97e56.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoa: Porta Soprano Gate" class="if uuid-2558511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558511.jpg"></div><h2>  Porta Soprano </h2><p>  One of the main symbols of Genoa is the gate of Port Soprano.  They are located in the center of the old city and are a visible symbol of the power of the Genoese Republic.  The name of the attraction translates as "highest."  And it is no accident: in the Middle Ages it was the central city gate, which was part of a powerful fortress wall. </p><p>  The construction consists of two round towers with loopholes connected by an arch.  It rises above the old quarter of Ravecca and occupies the top of the hill of Piano di Sant'Andrea.  As the city expanded, the strategic importance of the gate decreased.  In 1930, the gates of Porta Soprana were reconstructed.  Nearby is the Columbus Museum. </p><h2>  Tourist infrastructure </h2><p>  The port of Genoa is a major tourist center with a developed infrastructure.  Most hotels are concentrated in the eastern part - in the historic districts of Maddalena, Molo and San Vincenzo.  The five-star Melia Genova and Grand Hotel Savoia stand out with the greatest comfort and variety of services.  Among budget options, experienced tourists recommend hotels such as Agnello D'Oro (3 stars);  Comfort Hotel Europa Genova City Center (3);  Nuovo Nord (3);  Hotel Acquaverde (2);  Della Posta Nuova (2).  Of course, the options are not limited to this.  The city has hundreds of hotels, resorts, hostels, villas.  You can also save when renting private housing. </p><p>  Numerous eateries, restaurants, cafes are also located here.  Attractions within walking distance include: </p><ol><li>  Aquarium of Genoa. </li><li>  Cathedral of San Lorenzo. </li><li>  Basilica of the Holy Annunciation. </li><li>  Picture Gallery Red Palace. </li><li>  Royal Palace of the Palazzo Reale. </li><li>  The historic quarter of Via Garibaldi. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.atorus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where are the seaports of Marseille, Genoa, Athens" class="if uuid-2558544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2558544.jpg"></div><p>  The transport network of Genoa is well developed.  The capital of Liguria is penetrated by hundreds of public transport routes: buses, trams, fixed-route taxis.  There is also a metro line.  In the western part of the village, right on the waterfront, is located the international airport.  H. Columbus.  It was erected on an artificial peninsula. </p><h2>  How to get to the port of Genoa </h2><p>  Nothing is easier, because all the main roads of the city flock here.  Perhaps the best way is to take the subway.  It connects two railway stations and passes through the historic center.  Directly to the port are metro stations (from east to west) S. Agostino, San Giorgio, Darsena, Principe and Dinegro. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.4140194" data-lng="8.91867030000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/5/2/4652.png"></div><p>  From the airport to the central promenade about 7 km.  By bus, tram or taxi can be reached in just 10-15 minutes.  However, travelers are advised to go on foot if they are not burdened with luggage.  A walk takes about 40 minutes, during which it will be possible to assess the grandiose scale of the port infrastructure. </p>
