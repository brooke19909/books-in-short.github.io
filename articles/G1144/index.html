The price of his room is from 2600 rubles per night per person.  This ancient land, considered the gateway to Asia, knew many civilizations: the state of the Ptolemies, the Roman Empire, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire.  For 800 years, thanks to the healing climate of these parts, they are known in the Mediterranean as resort places.

    <h2>  About the best beaches in Alanya </h2><p>  The magnificent sandy beaches of Alanya, marked by the international brand - the "Blue Flag", traditionally attract tourists.  From the super-beaches closer to the hotel we are examining, there are the beaches of Dalmatash (famous for the nearby cave) and Cleopatra, separated by a cape towering above them.  Portacal and Kevkubat beaches stretch to the east along the coastline with a sand ribbon.  To the west - Ulash, Inzhnkum and Fugla. </p><p>  Alanya itself is famous for the two most famous beach vacation spots (photo above and hereinafter).  They are located in the city.  We are talking about the beaches of Cleopatra and Dalmatash.  Vacationers of the three-star considered in the article can easily get to Cleopatra's beach.  It is enough in front of the hotel to take a minibus, get to the central market, and then ask, and they will tell you how to walk to this famous vacation spot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  ‚ÄúBut the hotel has its own coastline, which is well-maintained for relaxation!  Why else go somewhere? ‚Äù  - you ask.  We will answer unequivocally: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth the ride!‚Äù  Here's an argument: for all the fashionable steamboats cruising the Mediterranean, the place of mooring is always Alanya (a photo of one of these cruise beauties is presented below).  Why?  Due to beaches and excursions. </p><h2>  Hospitable hotel </h2><p>  We digress from the main topic.  So, our plane landed on the land of the Land of the Star and the Crescent.  From <span>Antalya Airport</span> to the hotel Vital Beach drive and a half hours.  This is a first-line hotel, a hundred meters from the sea. </p>

    <p>  For the services of tourists - a 6-story hotel building.  This is a quiet, comfortable, hospitable hotel where you can really relax and rejuvenate.  Although the settlement here is from 12 <sup>00</sup> to 14 <sup>00</sup> , but settled immediately after arrival.  Friendly staff.  Cleaning - during the day, good food.  In this article we will try to tell in detail about the rest in Vital Beach Hotel 3 *, guided by our impressions and reviews of other vacationers. </p><h2>  Three star hotel and five star service.  Is it possible? </h2><p>  According to most tourists, the hotel actually provides service above a three-star. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let‚Äôs ponder ... We are convinced that in a three-star hotel you can relax better than in a five-star ... The "trick" of good three-star hotels in a special "family" setting.  The efficiency of the service.  It is no secret that, for example, <span>hotels in Alanya</span> 3 * will give odds to many domestic five-star <span>hotels</span> .  Why?  Perhaps because the local staff does the work with a soul. </p><h2>  Be polite and correct </h2><p>  Unfortunately, some holidaymakers themselves spoil their vacation.  They, as they say, can be seen a mile away because of the low personal culture.  Arriving on vacation (and paying about $ 100 for a day board) they are, to put it mildly, indifferent to the country where they are staying, they are indifferent to people working to provide service.  Know how to be thankful.  We dare to note: ‚ÄúGentlemen, you are served by the same people as you, with families, with problems ...‚Äù (we are talking about the staff of Vital Beach Hotel 3 *).  What is simply to thank a person for the service? </p><p>  In the end, remember the words of the unforgettable Oleg Yankovsky: ‚ÄúGentlemen, smile!‚Äù  Do not treat the hotel staff as your old and also large, impersonal debtors ... </p><h2>  Choose Vital Beach 3 * (Turkey) if ... </h2>

If you fundamentally do not want to see intrusive animators, look at the sickening pathos of five-star people, if it seems indecent for you to eat, when everyone tries to bite off a piece of fifty buffet dishes.  This hotel is for those who came for a relaxing holiday, for the impressions of excursions.  By choosing a three-star, you initially saved money.  And now - spend them wisely, at your service are objects of modern infrastructure and historical sights!  The expression "already breathtaking!"  appropriate for such excursions.  However, we will touch on their topics later in the same article.  The hotel has a lot of Germans resting.  Some of them stay here annually.

    <p>  But ... We do not recommend coming with young children (there is a minimum of animation, there is no separate children's menu, there are no nanny services).  However, if you yourself intend to be an animator for your child (which seems natural to us), then this problem disappears in principle. </p><h2>  Territory and hotel building </h2><p>  Hotel Vital Beach Hotel 3 * owns an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1500 m2 and, as we have already mentioned, a six-story building.  It has 66 rooms.  The design of the hotel complex building assumes a streamlined shape.  The windows are large.  The rooms have a good view of the sea.  The color scheme of the facade is classic, it is based on a combination of white and blue colors with the predominance of the first of them.  There is no "squareness" in the architecture of the building. </p><p>  The territory of the Vital Beach hotel complex is relatively small.  Around the building is a terrace.  From the sea, an outdoor pool is equipped.  It is quite spacious, can be used both for swimming and for swimming (for playing water polo, however, it‚Äôs not enough);  has a "G" - shaped.  Around the pool there is a relaxation area with sun loungers, umbrellas, mattresses.  There is a bar near the pool.  The outdoor part of the hotel restaurant also opens onto the terrace and relaxation area. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The Vital Beach Hotel has 54 standard rooms of 22 m¬≤ and 12 family rooms of 42 m¬≤.  Standard rooms accommodate up to three hotel guests, and family rooms accommodate up to 5. </p>

    <p>  The furnishings of the hotel rooms can be very briefly described as a solid economy class.  In the rooms of the guests made a renovation of economy class.  The walls are neatly plastered and painted in white and pastel yellow, pastel coffee colors.  The floor is tiled with ceramic tiles.  Thanks to panoramic windows, Vital Beach 3 * client rooms have good natural light during the day.  Curtains as well as bedspreads are in harmony with the decor.  It is felt that professionals engaged in color combinations of the interior.  The furniture is new, neat, in harmony with the overall design of the rooms.  What is its difference from a classic European-style renovation?  There are no Art Nouveau elements in the interior.  The furniture is not made of classic noble wood - oak, walnut, yew, ash - but with its imitation.  There is a certain lack of free space.  It is impossible to distinguish the logical center of the layout of the interior, because this requires a design of a different level. </p><p>  However, on the other hand, the Vital Beach 3 * hotel is fully landscaped for a comfortable guesthouse.  For vacationers, it has a bathroom, the rooms are equipped with all necessary appliances: individual air conditioning, TV, hairdryer, telephone.  For an additional fee, residents can also use the safe and minibar. </p><p>  The rooms are always clean.  There is no such level of cleaning in the "five-star"!  This is the know-how from this hotel complex: here, not only cleaning is done daily, but also the replacement of bedding and towels.  Upon returning from the beach, guests of his rooms will enjoy a composition of towels, regardless of whether they left $ 1. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  It's nice to relax here.  It is famous for its clean mountain air and the classic Mediterranean climate, separated from the continental air masses by the Toros Mountains of Alanya.  ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù - the principle of service for local hotels is no lower than the level.  However, the level of the <span>hotel "three stars"</span> suggests that there is at least entertainment, the animation is purely symbolic, since the hotel staff is small.  And yet on the territory of it you can relax and restore health. </p><p>  Where and how to relax?  Firstly, this is the pool area (we already mentioned it).  Secondly, there are equipped places for free recreation and pastime: Turkish bath, billiards, table tennis, volleyball.  Having paid a small amount, hotel guests can take a course or separate massage sessions (which is very useful - in combination with a hammam).  The peeling is very successful (the hotel has a beauty parlor). </p><p>  Paid water activities guarantee a fun holiday on the beach: the well-known ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù, jet skiing, catamaran, water skiing (the latter - if you have the appropriate skills). </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Visiting a hotel restaurant, designed for simultaneous meals of 100 vacationers, you feel the traditional hospitality that Turkey is so rich in.  Vital Beach is a hotel with a well-organized food system for spa guests.  The chef works on conscience.  The menu mainly includes dishes from Turkish and Mediterranean cuisine.  The main dishes are prepared from chicken, turkey, liver, fish.  There are sausages, sausages, soy meat, cheese like cheese.  The side dishes are varied: french fries, peasant, rice, spaghetti, from various vegetables.  A large assortment of salads, mashed soups.  Varied and delicious pastries. </p><h2>  About excursions </h2><p>  Vacationers at a hotel book excursions, as a rule, not with guides, but with travel agencies.  In addition, the most visionary rent a car, and also not at the hotel.  Why vacationers do not take these services from their guides (and this is not unique to Vital Beach)?  The reason is the price policy of travel agencies, traditionally setting a tariff on them, twice the average market price. </p>

    <p>  Some vacationers for a more complete acquaintance with the host country prefer to travel more by renting a car.  The rental price for a C-class car provided by the hotel is 20% higher than in a rental office: $ 75 versus $ 60 per day.  In this case, it is advisable to choose a company recommended by travel agencies, sound, providing all casco insurance.  In lesser-known companies, a Volkswagen Polo or Ford Focus car can also be bought for $ 40‚Äì45. </p><h2>  Ankara </h2><p>  Where to go with a rental car?  A visit is, of course, Ankara.  Start your tour by exploring the second largest city of the Land of Stars and the Crescent from the Atacupe tower, which ascended 125 meters.  The entrance price to the tower is 10 Turkish liras.  It has 2 restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  Further, getting acquainted with the country, it is reasonable to visit the mausoleum of <span>Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the</span> great reformer, the first President, creator of the secular state in the ancient land of Asia Minor.  Entrance to Anitkabir - the so-called mausoleum - is free.  Its complex includes several parks, a square and, of course, the museum building. </p><p>  Next - look at the ruins of the ancient city citadel, once erected by the Romans, in the ancient district of Ankara - Uluse.  There are many inexpensive cafes and interesting souvenir shops.  It is worth seeing one of the largest mosques in the world - Kojatepe.  Entrance to the mosque is free, but clothing should hide the shoulders, stomach and legs.  From museums it is worth visiting the ethnographic and national art.  And the <span>capital of Turkey</span> is famous for its parks, for example, Genclik, where a recreation area with an amusement park, Geksu, Dikmen, Altinpark, equipped with fountains, with a picturesque landscape design with many artificial reservoirs is equipped. </p><h2>  Natural and historical tourism sites </h2>

    <p>  Traveling to Cappadocia leaves no one indifferent.  This is an ancient country of cities with floors immersed in the ground.  The land where the temples were cut down in the rocks.  Here, the rocks themselves, often consisting of soft sedimentary rocks, were subjected to truly bizarre wind and other erosion.  Now the ancient mountains in places in Cappadocia have turned into arrays of the same type of mushroom-like inclined conical formations. </p><p>  The majestic ruins of the ancient Roman city center can be seen in the city of Side.  This is the most ambitious complex archaeological site in Turkey.  Moreover, visiting it for free.  An amphitheater has survived, where once gladiators fought in the arena with large predators and among themselves, in the center are the remains of the temple of the fertility goddess, the slave market.  There are even 24 public toilets.  Of course, now they do not work for their intended purpose, but still running water is supplied to them and the drain works.  It seems that for "antique plumbing" three thousand years is not a deadline. </p><p>  You can also visit on your car and objects for the inspection of which you should pay.  Anyway, if you relax with your family, you will save.  Indeed, in Turkey, a tourist pays twice for an excursion: to a travel agency - for delivery to the object and back, and to the guide conducting the excursion. </p><p>  Of these excursions, it is worth visiting the travertine cascade of Pamukkale thermal mineral baths.  It is worth buying a tour of Istanbul to see the <span>Blue Mosque,</span> Dolmabahce Palace, Galata Tower ... A visit to the majestic stalactite grotto Dalmatash is remembered.  Business people, of course, are eager to see the Grand Bazaar market, so beloved by our wholesalers, which is one of the largest indoor markets in the world (31 thousand square meters).  Gourmets will be shocked by a visit to the world-famous Egyptian bazaar (do not worry, this is only the name ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù, it is actually located in Istanbul).  Its second name is the Spice Market. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In order to enjoy a beach holiday, and at the same time to get acquainted with the sights of the country, a good option is the three-star Vital Beach Hotel (Konakli). </p>

    <p>  Note that for vacationers there are several alternative options for arranging their guesthouse.  The first - the simplest and most expensive - to buy excursions from the guides of your travel agency.  The second - more economical - to buy them from specialized tour agencies.  The third is for active people who have come to really get to know the country.  He intends to rent a car and pay only guides.  However, often they are successfully replaced by a travel guide.  Dining on the go (lunch box) is provided by the Vital Beach Hotel‚Äôs restaurant. </p>
