    <p>  The question of <span>who sold Alaska</span> is one of the most difficult in Russian history.  Many simply do not know the answer, they confuse the names of the autocrats, who, in their opinion, took responsibility for such a deal with America.  The fact of the sale of land is documented.  Therefore, dispelling any doubts is quite simple - you just need to familiarize yourself with the sources. </p><p>  <strong>How it really was: who sold Alaska</strong> </p><p>  Alaska was actually discovered by the Russian navigators I. Fedorov and M. Gvozdev in 1732.  According to official data, its discovery dates back to 1841 and belongs to captain A. Chirikov.  For sixty years, Russia was not at all interested in the discovery of these lands.  Its territory was mastered only by Russian merchants who bought furs from local residents. </p><p>  In 1799, the situation changed somewhat.  Officially, the territory of Alaska began to belong to Russia as a discoverer.  However, in fact, the state still did not show interest in these lands.  Only Siberian merchants, to their advantage, disposed of the natural riches of open lands, mining coal, hunting <span>fur seals</span> and supplying ice to the USA (refrigeration units had not yet been invented at that time). </p><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, from distant lands that did not cause the Russian leadership any problems, did not require money for maintenance, and therefore constantly remained out of the spotlight, unexpected news arrived.  A gold deposit was found in Alaska. </p><p>  So why then were the rich lands transferred to another state?  Who sold Alaska and why?  Who is responsible for making a decision that today seems unreasonable to many?  At the time of the sale of land, Emperor Alexander II knew very well that they were rich in native metal.  The initiative to sell them from him did not come directly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the first time, N. Muravyov-Amursky, the governor general of Eastern Siberia, who considered such a deal inevitable, spoke of the possibility of selling land.  Four years later, he was supported by the Grand Duke <span>Konstantin Romanov.</span>  He considered that having learned about the gold deposits, England would certainly make an attempt to seize the land (Russia did not have the strength to defend in these parts), and then the Empire would lose any benefit.  In addition, the government understood that the income from these lands in the future might not cover the costs of its protection and protection.  This was especially disadvantageous if we take into account the remoteness of land from the main territory of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  At that time, Russia developed particularly friendly relations with the United States, especially after it refused to support the West in its desire to regain control of American territories. </p><p>  Russian Emperor Alexander II made a decision by which the <span>sale of Alaska to the</span> United States became a settled matter.  Negotiations began, the conduct of which was entrusted to Eduard Andreyevich Stekl.  He competently intrigued, wanting to create a favorable climate for the deal (the American government initially met the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãacquisition without much enthusiasm). </p><p>  The issue of the sale was postponed several times due to various events (they waited for the expiration of the privileges of the Russian-American Company, then the end of the American <span>Civil War).</span> </p><p>  But on March 30, 1867, the contract was signed by both parties.  The Russian Empire decreased by about one and a half million square kilometers, and its treasury replenished with 7.2 million dollars.  Officially, the lands in the possession of the United States were transferred on October 18, 1867. </p><p>  Did the one who sold Alaska do the right thing?  Many Russian historians consider this deal a big mistake for Russia.  However, when analyzing this problem, it is impossible to discount the situation in the Russian Empire that existed at the time of sale.  At that time, such a deal was quite justified from the point of view of the interests of the all-Russian economy and politics. </p><p>  So who sold Alaska to America?  Of course, such a person is Emperor Alexander II, who, although he was not the initiator of the transaction, but put a decisive signature under it. </p>
