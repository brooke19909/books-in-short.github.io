    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  Let‚Äôs discuss feedback about the developer ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù, which will give the necessary information to the future buyer. </p><p>  The company was registered in 2012.  Its founders are a team of professionals who have vast experience in implementing integrated construction projects in Russia.  Nevertheless, several years passed before they became known about them throughout the region.  The first two years were spent on acquiring sites, developing projects and advertising.  But this time was not in vain.  Already in 2014, the first <span>residential complex</span> was presented - from that moment reviews began to appear on the developer ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù.  This made it possible to conclude new agreements and develop.  Today the company is one of the most famous - the quality of the commissioned properties meets all the requirements, and satisfied customers respond well to the acquired property. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Airplanes First </h2><p>  But this is in a famous song, and the company has quality in the first place.  This can be seen in everything.  The first principle that guides the board and employees is a reference to the highest standards at each stage of activity.  That is why the reviews about the developer "Airplane Development" every year change only for the better, and the company offers more and more new projects.  Talented managers think through every step, starting from choosing the optimal sites in terms of transport accessibility, located in ecologically clean zones, and ending with high-quality finishing of finished apartments.  The buyer loves when his comfort is taken care of. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Reviews about the developer ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù emphasize that the company uses the most advanced sales technologies.  Each client receives personal escort right up to check-in.  It is carried out so professionally that the transaction takes a minimum of time and leaves the most pleasant experience. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="airplane development lyubertsy" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Name, status and rating </h2><p>  It is the accumulation of all of the above that each new company is engaged in when it starts work.  The company ‚ÄúAirplane Development‚Äù entered the market only in 2012, but in a short 5 years it managed to establish itself as a reliable developer who successfully implements projects in clearly defined terms, always with an always excellent result.  The opinion of the townsfolk is certainly very important, but first we will dwell on what the experts say. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Colleagues and supervisors note the thoughtful organization of living spaces, <span>common areas</span> and developed infrastructure.  At the same time, the company cannot be blamed for slowness: it leases over the floor every week, which is an excellent speed. </p><h2>  Geography of activity </h2><p>  The company has long gone beyond the capital, and the portfolio of completed projects has become very weighty.  Now let's talk about each of them individually.  The scope of activity covers the entire Moscow region, the capital itself and several areas of the Moscow Region.  Moreover, these boundaries are planned to expand further.  It is clear from everything that a lot remains to be heard about the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forest plane development" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lyubertsy </h2><p>  In 2015, Airplane Development began selling apartments in its first housing estate, which grew literally before our eyes.  These are eight cast-brick houses with developed infrastructure located on the same territory: a new kindergarten, playgrounds and sports facilities are located under the windows, so parents can watch the children play.  In each porch there are places for strollers, which makes life easier for young mothers. </p><p>  In 17-story high-rises of 7 sections, 480 modern apartments are located in one house.  The first floor is reserved for non-residential premises, offices and warehouses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each staircase is designed according to an individual design plan.  The courtyard is equipped with outdoor courts with exercise equipment and sports grounds with a safe surface.  Children will definitely not be bored! </p><p>  Saltykovsky Forest Park, the banks <span>of the Pekhorka River</span> and Lake Black are located very close to this housing complex.  These places are ideal for leisurely evening walks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new buildings Lyubertsy" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957202.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <h2>  Residents reviews </h2><p>  Residents note excellent transport accessibility - you can get here from anywhere in the city.  The place is quiet, calm, the air is fresh.  In the yard there is everything necessary for children to play sports.  On warm evenings the whole family can go for a walk ashore.  New buildings in Lyubertsy have become a model of housing for a comfortable and relaxing life.  The buildings were built with high quality, during the years of operation nothing sank, did not leak and did not freeze.  The developer gives guarantees to tenants for after-sales service and a full refund in case of violations of the construction rules, but so far no one has contacted about this. </p><h2>  New project </h2><p>  Successful completion of the first array gave a chance to continue working in Lyubertsy.  ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù, two years later, offered its customers to buy property in a new housing complex, which is located next to the first.  These are three seventeen-story buildings with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã200,000 sq.m.  There are also places for strollers, a concierge room, underground parking and parking lots, playgrounds and park areas.  Apartments in the ‚ÄúAirplane Development‚Äù Lyubertsy ‚Äútook a fancy‚Äù for a long time, which is evident from the new project, which will be implemented in 2018. </p><p>  The company plans another beautiful housing estate.  The price per square meter starts at 57,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Quarter ‚ÄúSuburb.  Forest ¬ª </h2><p>  ‚ÄúAircraft Development‚Äù, with the support of the government, built a housing estate in the village of Mikhailovo, Leninsky District, on a 372 hectare site.  This is another priority area that the company is developing today.  For those who can not afford housing in the city center, the suburbs will appreciate. </p><p>  This is a whole town of new buildings, which, like mushrooms after the rain, grow one after another next to the city of Vidnoe.  In addition, the necessary infrastructure facilities are being built here, so residents will not have to experience discomfort.  Construction is carried out in 13 phases, the entire facility will be completed in 2029.  In the framework of the project ‚ÄúSuburb.  Lesnoye ‚ÄúPlane Development‚Äù plans to build 144 monolithic houses of varying number of storeys with playgrounds and playgrounds.  Today, all of these swings and carousels, sandboxes and labyrinths, locks and obstacle courses can be seen on mock-ups.  It looks pretty attractive.  But this is not surprising, since ‚ÄúAirplane Development‚Äù took up the matter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="airplane development suburb" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing affordability </h2><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments in this complex is from 24 to 75 m <sup>2</sup> .  The apartments are sold with a fine finish, so the newly-minted owner of the apartment will only have to arrange furniture and lay out things.  You can buy an apartment at a price of 1,870,200 to 5,000,000 rubles.  Buying is possible both in cash and in a mortgage.  The company works with all types of certificates. </p><p>  Buyers who have already purchased property from this developer emphasize the complete transparency of the transaction and the good terms of the contract.  The buyer is fully protected from any force majeure, he is given guarantees for the operation of the building for a period of 5 years. </p><h2>  LCD "Vnukovo" </h2><p>  New buildings in Lyubertsy is not the only object.  The developer is actively developing the territory in the Vnukovo settlement of Moscow near the village of Likovo: 13 km from the Moscow Ring Road, the company is implementing a new project, which will also be completed in several stages.  Today, one can only be surprised at the capabilities of the company, which is conducting several large projects simultaneously. </p><p>  It is planned to build ten fourteen-story buildings and infrastructure here: a kindergarten, open parking lots, a school.  The remaining facilities are located in the <span>settlement of Vnukovsky,</span> so residents do not have to travel too far. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd airplane development" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957198.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hundreds of customers have already managed to love this area and decide what they want to live here.  Still would!  Picturesque landscapes, fresh air of the <span>Ulyanovsk Forest Park, a</span> small pond and a river will please everyone. </p><p>  Very close is the Borovskoye highway and transport interchange.  These two important factors speak in favor of the choice of this object.  The cost of housing is 68,000 rubles per square meter.  Yes, this is a pretty impressive price, but the quality of development fully compensates for the investment.  It‚Äôs quite possible to buy a small apartment for more than two million rubles. </p><h2>  LCD "Sputnik" </h2><p>  ‚ÄúPlane Development‚Äù LCD ‚ÄúSputnik‚Äù built in the Odintsovo district of the Moscow region, 1.7 km from Strogino.  The project involves the construction of three buildings with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã200,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  Its own infrastructure will include a school with 825 places, three kindergartens, a medical center, a fitness center and underground parking.  Add to this the objects that are located in Strogino, and you will understand that living here will be no worse than in Moscow. </p><p>  On the territory of the housing complex will be laid bike paths and eco-paths, equipped with sports and fitness facilities, as well as a panda park.  This means that large and small will have the opportunity to spend time in the fresh air with health benefits.  The cost of an apartment here starts from 1,900,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="], apartment airplane development Lyubertsy" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1957232.jpg" width="600"></div>
