    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Many years ago, or rather, in the XIV century, on the banks of the Belaya River, the city was not discussed at all.  There was one fortress, something like the residence of one of the governors of the Nogai Horde.  The year 1557 completely changed the circumstances.  This year, in order to get protection from Russia from raids, Bashkiria voluntarily wished to enter its structure and thereby protect its people.  More than 20 years passed before Ivan the Terrible came up with the idea to build a village on the site of the fortress, and after another 12 years, the built village received the status of the city now known as Ufa.  It became the capital of Bashkiria - a huge city with a population of one and a half million people.  Moreover, more than a dozen different nationalities. </p><h2>  There is something to see here </h2><p>  According to statistics, Ufa is considered one of the greenest cities in Russia.  <span>Ufa monuments</span> have become the hallmark of the capital of Bashkortostan. </p><p>  The most famous of them are the monument to Salavat Yulaev, the Friendship Monument, the monument to V.I.  Lenin in the park M. Gafuri, Devil's hillfort, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to these well-known and favorite tourist attractions, the city has 20 museums, 8 parks, more than 40 monuments, the Botanical Garden, the Akbuzat Hippodrome, and, of course, the unforgettable, incomparable nature of the surroundings: endless rivers, forests, fields . </p>

    <p>  In addition to the aircraft, rail services are at the service of the population.  From Moscow to Ufa will have to travel by train almost a day. </p><p>  But if you get your own car, it is possible to get a lot of impressions and pleasures from the trip.  It all depends on which highway to go to Samara or Kazan. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  But before you decide to come, you need to consider not only the route of excursions, you need to take care of the overnight stay.  You can, of course, rent a room for a couple of days or an apartment for rent, but the best option is a room in one of the hotels in the city, especially since Ufa hotels - inexpensive and chic - are available in sufficient quantities for every taste and budget.  The budget option is very convenient if there is money, but not so much that all of them spend on living.  It is better, of course, to go to the park for a saved money, to visit a museum or theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This is the Naberezhnaya Hotel, the Arderiya Guest House, the Argo, Akkerman, Aviator, Nice House, Tan, Tourist Hotel, and Agidel Hotel.  Ufa offers accommodation in these cozy places where everything is equipped for a convenient temporary stay. </p><h2>  Most Available Options </h2><p>  One of the most affordable is the mini-hotel "Embankment".  Here you can rent a room at a price of 600 rubles, but the bathroom is shared.  If there is a desire that the bathroom was in the room, then the cost of the room will be from 1700 rubles.  One of the minuses of the hotel is the lack of free Internet access. </p>

For example, the hotel "Profitable House". </p><p>  Here, unlike the previous hotel, the price for a room will be from 1200 rubles, but on the other hand, guests enjoy free Wi-Fi and free parking in the surrounding area.  In addition, each room has a bathroom, cable TV, an electric kettle and a refrigerator. </p><p>  However, the journey to the Central Station takes more than 30 minutes by car. </p><p>  One of the big advantages of the Profitable House hotel is the large number of positive reviews in which guests thank the staff for their excellent service, despite the low prices. </p>

    <h2>  But there is even cheaper </h2><p>  But hotels in Ufa boast record holders at prices.  This is one of the most affordable options for an overnight stay - guest house "Arderia".  It is located on <span>General Gorbatov</span> Street <span>,</span> 3 - it is about 3 km from the <span>center of Ufa</span> . </p><p>  Here you can spend the night in a small room for only 400 rubles, but you need to be prepared for the fact that the rooms are uncomfortable.  Also, the services that other Ufa hotels offer for free, everything is here for an additional cost.  These include housekeeping, iron, electric kettle and other amenities.  An even more alarming circumstance is that some rooms do not even have windows.  Shower and toilet are shared.

    <p>  All rooms are divided into the following options: economy, studio, luxury and apartments.  But there is practically no difference in them.  All rooms are equipped to the latest European standards.  Each is equipped with a plasma TV and has a sauna and shower.  A customer in economy rooms can use a telephone; purchased food and drinks can be stored in the refrigerator. </p><p>  The studio hotel room differs from an economy wide bed and cable TV.  There is also Internet access, Wi-Fi, which is not provided in economy rooms. </p><p>  Well, the apartments have a huge living room, a bedroom no less in size, a cable TV, Internet access, air conditioning, a telephone, a sauna, a shower and a bathroom.  And all this in one issue. </p><p>  You can have breakfast without leaving the hotel.  The restaurant is located inside the complex.  Here you can enjoy the national dishes of Bashkiria, drink fine wine, sitting in a restaurant decorated in the Venetian style. </p><p>  And so that it doesn‚Äôt happen that there are no free rooms here, you need to make a reservation before arrival and book your favorite room.  Moreover, such a service can be used by anyone, at any time of the day, no matter where he is currently located, it does not matter that this place is not Ufa.  Hotels, prices for which will not change from this, will accept the application and reserve the right room for the required time. </p><h2>  Even if on working moments ... </h2><p>  To visit the Bashkir capital does not mean getting to know Ufa.  But if you see with your own eyes a monument to Salavat Yulaev rising above the hill near the city, which can be seen from afar ... And why is there a beautiful alley at the monument?  Just do not take your eyes off!  It was here that just recently, in honor of the 450th anniversary of the accession of Bashkiria to Russia, the magnificent building of the Congress Hall, the House of Friendship of Peoples was built. </p>

    <p>  Visit the Opera and Ballet Theater is also worth it.  This is the main cultural attraction of Bashkiria. </p><p>  In addition, the city has one old mansion, which Aksakov himself fashioned.  Now it is a memorial house-museum of S.T.  Aksakova, where you can not only wander around at ease, but at the same time get to one of the literary meetings, which, as a rule, are held only here. </p>
