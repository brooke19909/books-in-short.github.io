    <h2>  The lineup </h2><p>  In fact, today this Chinese company is represented on the market with only four models.  Each of them has a diagonal of at least five inches and boasts good computing capabilities.  The most affordable at the moment are MX3 and M1 Note.  The first of them is last year‚Äôs flagship of this manufacturer, which still meets all the requirements for performance and hardware stuffing.  The second is the company's budget decision this year.  This Meizu phone in terms of hardware and software resources is even more productive than the previous model.  It‚Äôs just built on a more modern chip, which also supports 64-bit computing.  Well, the MX4 and MX4 Pro occupy the high-tech solutions segment.  The first of them is equipped with more modest technical parameters in comparison with the MX4 Pro.  And the second, in essence, is the flagship decision of 2015. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Last year's flagship </h2><p>  The most modest price tag at the moment is the MX3.  This is last year‚Äôs flagship of this manufacturer.  It is based on the eight-core Samsung Exynos 5410 chip.  It is made according to the proprietary technology of this manufacturer - big.LITTLE.  That is, its cores are combined into 2 modules.  One consists of four energy-efficient A7 cores, and the second is turned on when maximum computing performance is needed, in which case a more efficient architecture, A15, works.  At most, only 4 cores can be in operation at a time.  The diagonal of the screen is 5.1 inches.  Its <span>resolution is 1800 √ó 1080,</span> that is, slightly less than Full HD.  The amount of integrated RAM is 2 GB, and the size of the internal drive can be 16 GB (the most economical option) and 32 GB (a more advanced solution).  Moreover, even the capacity of the integrated drive is enough for comfortable work.  But the Meizu phone is not equipped with an expansion slot for installing an additional flash drive.  <span>The battery capacity</span> of it is 2400 mAh and this, according to the manufacturer, should be enough for one day of intensive use of the device.  In the list of interfaces, it clearly lacks support for LTE and Glonass.  And the rest of his communication set is identical to the models of the middle and higher price range. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Budget segment </h2><p>  Phone Meizu M1 <strong> </strong>  positioned by the manufacturer as an entry-level solution.  Only now his price is not quite democratic - $ 280.  But on the other hand, this smart phone has everything you need to start using it immediately after purchase.  It is built on the basis of one of the most productive chips at the moment - MT6752.  As in the previous case, this is an eight-core solution, which consists exactly of two computing clusters.  Only now the cores in this case are all built on the same architecture - ‚ÄúA53‚Äù.  The only difference is in their <span>clock frequency</span> .  More productive ones operate at 1.7 GHz, while energy-efficient ones operate at 1.3 GHz.  The "chip" of this chip is support for 64-bit computing.  This provides a backlog on future performance and software compatibility.  The amount of RAM he has is identical to last year's flagship and is equal to 2 GB.  The capacity of the built-in drive can be either 16 GB or 32 GB.  The diagonal of the display is 5.5 inches, and here the picture is already displayed in Full HD, that is, with a resolution of 1920x1080.  The battery capacity is increased in comparison with the previous model and is 3140 mAh.  This is enough for 2-3 days of battery life with an average load on the device.  Note also the design of the smartphone.  Its prototype was definitely the iPhone 4S.  It is enough to pay attention to the bright back cover made of plastic and everything becomes clear.  But the developers in this case went further.  Although it is on this Android device, the version most common today is 4.4, but it is almost impossible to recognize it.  Its interface has been redesigned and looks more like iOS (another common feature with the "apple" device).  Just on top of "Anroid" installed a special add-on - Flyme version 4.1.  It is its presence that leads to such a significant transformation.  Among the interface set in this device, support for LTE can also be singled out (another plus in comparison with the MX3). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Advanced Model: MX4 </h2><p>  There is also a more productive solution in the lineup of this company - this is the Meizu Mx 4 phone. The key difference between the M1 and this smartphone is the type of processor installed.  It uses MT6595 of the same manufacturer, MediaTech.  Here are all the same 8 cores, divided into 2 computing clusters.  The first of them consists of four cores and is a high-performance solution based on the architecture version ‚ÄúA17‚Äù.  These computing modules operate at a frequency of 2.2 GHz.  The second cluster consists of four ‚ÄúA7‚Äù solutions that operate at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  Such a constructive solution allows you to get even greater levels of performance and energy efficiency than the M1.  But the weak point of this CPU is the lack of support for 64-bit computing.  Now this is not felt, but at a certain stage problems with the installation of software may occur.  The memory subsystem of MX 4 is organized identically to M1.  The capacity of RAM is 2 GB, and the size of the internal drive can be 16 GB or 32 GB.  The display diagonal of this smart smartphone is 5.36 inches.  The image is displayed in Full HD, as in the previous case.  The Meizu Mx4 is equipped with a more modest <span>battery,</span> compared to a budget device with a capacity of 3100 mAh.  By the degree of autonomy, these gadgets are identical to each other and one charge here should also be enough for 2-3 days of average load. </p>

    <h2>  Flagship solution </h2><p>  The Meizu Mx 4 phone with the Pro index is the most productive solution to date for this brand.  It also uses a more efficient CPU - Exynos 5430 from Samsung.  This is a complete analogue of the chip, which is installed in the MX 3, but it has increased clock speeds.  The diagonal of the screen is identical to M1 and is 5.5 inches.  Only here the resolution in this case is increased from 1920 to 2560 and from 1080 to 1536. The capacity of the complete battery is 3350 mAh.  A significant increase in battery life from this increase in battery capacity can not be expected.  In reality, these are all the same 2-3 days with an average level of load on the gadget. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  Good value for money is the hallmark that Meizu phones boast without exception.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  distinguish them from this feature.  There are no questions regarding the performance and autonomy of these devices.  Build quality is also on par with them.  The memory subsystem is well thought out and organized.  The only thing that can be attributed to their minuses is a rather high cost.  For example, the MX3 is currently priced at $ 230.  In turn, the M1 costs $ 280.  And the flagship versions of smartphones are priced at $ 370 and $ 450, respectively.  But on the other hand, a good device cannot be cheaper.  If his price is lower, then the quality will be much worse.  So it turns out that this Chinese manufacturer makes excellent smartphones, but they also have a corresponding price. </p>

    <h2>  Selection recommendations </h2><p>  Any Meizu MX <strong>-</strong> series phone loses the M1 Note in terms of processor performance.  Still, the processor architecture "A53" is more promising and it supports 64-bit computing.  This suggests that this smartphone still has room to grow.  All other gadgets of this manufacturer can not boast of such.  Therefore, the purchase of M1 Note is more preferable.  The only thing that is weaker in it is the camera.  If you want to receive high-quality photos and videos, then it is better to pay attention to the MX 4 or MX 4 Pro.  They have a camera based on a 20.7 megapixel sensor developed by Sony.  But in M1 this indicator is already 13 megapixels. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Every Meizu phone is ahead of time.  Its hardware and software characteristics make it possible to solve any problems without problems within the next 2-3 years.  Moreover, their quality is above average.  But for this quality and margin of productivity you have to overpay.  You need to understand that a good smartphone can not be cheap. </p>
