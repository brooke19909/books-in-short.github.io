    <p>  In principle, the equipment is standard for most mobile devices.  It is noteworthy that already at the factory, a protective film is glued to the smartphone. </p><h2>  The appearance of the phone </h2><p>  The design of the device is designed in rather conservative concepts, but in general the device looks good.  The back cover of the device is made of a material that looks like metal from a distance, but it is plastic, on which microscopic aluminum particles are applied.  If you remove the back cover of the phone, you can find 2 slots for SIM cards.  One of them is designed for SIM cards in nano format with support for LTE technology, the other - for a full-sized SIM card that works in GSM channels.  Next to the corresponding connectors is a slot for microSD memory cards, as well as a battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The smartphone display Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO (user reviews and experts are especially positive in terms of the corresponding hardware component) has a diagonal of 5 inches.  Able to work in HD resolution.  It is protected by glass like <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. Supports, as we noted at the beginning of the article, 2.5D technology.  The quality of the display is estimated by experts and users as very high - especially for a budget device, which includes the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs screen supports OGS technology, which allows the manufacturer brand not to use the air gap between the screen itself and the glass in the structure of the corresponding hardware component.  This option allows, firstly, to create the effect of a raised image, and secondly, to provide large viewing angles of the display. </p><p>  It can be noted that the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone (reviews regarding this nuance are extremely positive) at the processor level supports Miravision technology, developed by the brand manufacturer of the chip, Mediatek.  This option is intended to improve picture quality.  The essence of the technology in question is that at the time of scrolling the image, the processor increases the frame rate to about 120 units per second, while the standard indicator is 30 or 60. The screen supports up to 5 simultaneous finger touches - a similar possibility is considered the norm for modern mobile devices. </p><p>  Touch button illumination is not implemented on the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone.  The reviews of the owners of the device, however, indicate that this feature should not be considered as a device flaw.  Apparently, these hardware components of the device are not used very often. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  How productive is the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO 4G phone?  Reviews about the device allow us to characterize it as sufficiently fast.  This is due, according to experts, to the presence, first of all, of a high-performance processor with 4 cores, which, moreover, can operate in 64-bit mode.  The chip that the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO device is equipped with is MTK6735.  Feedback from users and professionals characterizing the speed of his work is positive.  The test results of the device using the Antutu Benchmark application are about 20 thousand points.  A very decent indicator, according to many owners of Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO.  The reviews found on thematic online portals confirm this. </p>

    <p>  Among other advantages of the processor, which is installed in this smartphone, - support for a wide range of frequencies of mobile communications.  In the structure of the chip, as we noted above, there is a powerful graphics module Mali T-720.  The combination of a sufficiently powerful processor and a graphics accelerator determines the compatibility of the phone with many demanding games. </p><p>  Is there enough 2 GB of RAM to run applications that require high speed, the amount of RAM installed in the smartphone?  According to experts and owners of the device, this resource is quite enough.  In addition, as experts in the field of mobile solutions, the RAM chip processes the data quickly enough.  This has a positive effect, in particular, on the quality of processing tabs in the browser, on the level of comfort at the same time working with different applications. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Among the communication standards that the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone supports is 4G.  The quality of communication, provided that the subscriber is in the coverage area with a stable signal, is estimated by experts and users as the highest.  The same can be said of other communication technologies supported by the device - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS.  Thus, the user can use the usual Internet services without any problems, use navigation, share files with his friends. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main camera of the device, as we noted above, works at a resolution of 13 megapixels.  This hardware component is equipped with a 2.0 aperture sensor.  The front camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels. </p>

    <p>  Among the most noteworthy software options for the camera is HDR, which can be used for shooting in the dark. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs battery has a capacity of 2.2 thousand mAh, which is a rather modest indicator for modern smartphones.  However, experts pay attention to how smoothly he gives his charge.  It happens that as the battery life approaches an indicator of the order of 10%, the phone may turn off.  A similar property for the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO 4G smartphone (expert reviews confirm this) is not typical.  The marked battery life of the device is enough for about half a day of active work.  But if you use it exclusively for calls, the battery life of the device will increase to about 1-2 days.  Specialists pay attention to the fact that an energy-saving processor is installed in the phone. </p><p>  Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone - expert and user reviews confirm this - it charges pretty quickly, at about the speed that the manufacturer promised.  That is, 70% of the battery should be charged in about 30 minutes. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The device is running the new Android OS - in version 5.1.  As we noted at the beginning of the article, Android is the firmware installed by default on the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO phone.  If necessary, it can be replaced with alternative shells.  But in practice, such needs may not arise for the user, since the software component of the device functions perfectly.  The firmware is stable, compatible with OTA updates.  This technology greatly simplifies the process of installing new versions of software for a smartphone. </p>

    <p>  There are no problems with installing additional applications, as well as games from the Google Play store and similar directories.  The performance of the device, as we noted above, is sufficient for the user to be able to use modern applications and many demanding games.  If the resources of the built-in flash memory of 16 GB are not enough, you can always add additional disk space to the phone due to microSD-cards.  The phone recognizes the corresponding modules very quickly, they function stably. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We‚Äôll now study what the owners of the device say about their experience in operating the Doogee Valencia 2 Y100 PRO smartphone.  Responses of device owners can be classified into the following main categories: </p><p>  - opinions regarding the appearance, convenience of managing the device, </p><p>  - reviews of functionality, </p><p>  - opinions regarding the speed of the device. </p><p>  We will study them in more detail. </p><p>  User reviews regarding the appearance and design solutions implemented in the device allow us to conclude that the Chinese brand product in this aspect turned out to be very positively accepted by the Russian market.  The owners of the device note that their choice was not least connected with the design of the phone itself.  As for the ratings of the convenience of controlling a smartphone, users are satisfied.

    <p>  But what do users say about smartphone functionality?  Again, it can be noted that the set of capabilities of most smartphones present in a particular segment is generally the same for all devices.  Therefore, the main thing for a brand, especially if it has recently entered the market, is to remember to implement one or another significant function in the manufactured device.  According to reviews, users do not find any special flaws in the Chinese company regarding the device‚Äôs functionality.  The capabilities of the phone are assessed as quite consistent with current market trends. </p><p>  Another aspect of reviews is users ‚Äôassessment of smartphone performance.  Above, we pointed out that in Antutu tests the device gains about 20 thousand points.  In principle, this is not bad for a modern smartphone.
