They are, for the most part, positive.  Here are the most common comments: </p><ul><li>  Kata beach, located on the left side, is simply gorgeous - with wonderful white sand and warm, blue water without big waves.  Karon, although famous, is not liked by everyone.  Because there are big waves and rough yellow sand. </li><li>  There are no sun loungers, so towels should be taken to the beach.  Their guests are provided.  Then the used can be changed directly at the reception. </li><li>  Nearby is a market with fruits and things - there is a huge selection and low prices. </li><li>  The hotel is located on a small hill, but at the reception you can always find administrators who are ready to take guests to their case on an electric car. </li><li>  It is recommended that when ordering a voucher order breakfast only.  The surrounding area is full of restaurants and cafes offering a wide range of interesting dishes at low prices.  The main thing is not to eat somewhere near the hotel - it‚Äôs expensive there.  It is better to go left, to the intersection, then turn again to the left side - a street will open to your eyes, where there are countless places. </li><li>  The hotel itself has a welcoming, welcoming atmosphere.  And the staff is excellent, does its job flawlessly.  Apartments are always cleaned on time and honestly, not forgetting to change linen, towels, bring tea, coffee and hygiene items (shampoos, gels, cotton buds, etc.). </li><li>  Breakfast some tourists consider not very diverse, even meager.  But people who do not like to be full are satisfied.  Special attention is paid to the presence of fresh and tasty fruits. </li><li>  You can rarely meet Russians in a hotel.  Mostly elderly foreigners rest in it, including the Chinese. </li><li>  If, by mistake, the guests were accommodated in another room (for example, in the one where there are two separate beds, and not one 2-bedroom), then you need to say this immediately, and the problem will be solved immediately. </li><li>  All the equipment in the rooms is decent, not old, including furniture.  By the way, on TV, it shows two Russian-language channels with good films. </li><li>  Excursions are recommended not to be taken on site, but ordered from a tour operator.  It is more profitable. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.xn----5wf3cwbhbb3vg0a.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="karon phuket hotels resort diamond cottage and spa" class="if uuid-2957827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2957827.jpg"></div><p>  Guests pay special attention to the hotel.  It is designed in a colorful Thai style - very beautiful.  Everywhere fountains, pools, elephants, blooming plumeria - every detail pleases the eye. </p><p>  The only drawback noted by tourists is the Superior category apartments.  Their minus is that their windows overlook the main street.  Life does not stop at Karon at night, and therefore guests who decide to stay in this room suffer from loud music.  Although, you can close the door to the balcony and sleep under the air conditioning, but this solution also does not suit everyone. </p><p>  Therefore, it is recommended to think about this point in advance in order to book a good room. </p><h2>  Who should go here? </h2><p>  This question also needs to be answered.  Phuket, in particular Karon, is a place for people longing for an active pastime.  The resort is not suitable for individuals who want to relax from the hustle and bustle of life, as life here is in full swing. </p><p>  When is it best to go to Karon?  In January, December and February.  In winter, comfortable weather reigns here (30-32 ¬∞ C), there is no unbearable heat and rain.  The sea, of course, is also warm - from 26 to 29 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Although, the beach season in Phuket lasts only at least 10 months.  However, these months are the most favorable for spending a comfortable vacation in all plans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="asiabooking.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="diamond cottage resort spa 4 thailand phuket" class="if uuid-2957828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2957828.jpg"></div><h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  Now you can talk a little about prices.  At the Diamond Cottage Resort &amp; Spa (Phuket, Thailand) a trip for one person will cost about 45,000 rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  Accommodation in a double room for 8 days (7 nights). </li><li>  Round-trip flights departing from Moscow. </li><li>  Breakfast </li><li>  Free transfer to the hotel from the airport and then back. </li><li>  Services of a Russian-speaking guide provided throughout the rest. </li></ul><p>  For two people, the ticket will be, accordingly, about 90,000 rubles.  Prices can vary up to 110,000 rubles, but for this amount better conditions are offered - for a longer period with accommodation in a high-level room. </p>
