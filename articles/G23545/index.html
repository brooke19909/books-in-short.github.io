Shushary, St. Petersburg: new buildings with finishes from the builder - reviews, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Own apartment in St. Petersburg is a dream, for many it is completely inadmissible luxury.  Of course, only wealthy people can afford to buy real estate in the city, in a developed and landscaped area.  Most residents of the cultural capital, who do not have impressive capital, consider new buildings and excellent residential complexes with their own infrastructure, located in the suburbs, as an acceptable option.  This is a budget alternative, which really has the right to exist.  We suggest you pay attention to new buildings in Shushary and together with us evaluate the best options. </p><h2>  Shushary: how attractive is the area </h2><p>  <span>So, if we consider geographically, Shushary is a small urban-type settlement located in the Pushkin district of the Leningrad region.</span>  <span>From the northern part it adjoins the Ring Road, so all its inhabitants have access to the developed infrastructure of the cultural capital.</span>  <span>Vitebsky Prospekt, Moskovskoye Shosse - all these major highways pass through Shushary.</span>  <span>The nearest metro station is Kupchino.</span>  <span>Currently, the area is actively being built up, while it is still possible to purchase apartments on favorable terms, an order of magnitude cheaper than in the city.</span>  <span>Do not miss your chance.</span> </p><h2>  LCD "Shushary" </h2><p>  <span>If you are really considering Shushary for your stay, new buildings from the builder are a great option.</span>  <span>These are modern houses with excellent planning solutions and their own infrastructure.</span>  <span>LCD "Shushary" - one of the first complexes in the village, which was commissioned in 2012.</span>  <span>Of course, the first tenants purchased apartments in an unfavorable area, but today all the necessary conditions for life are created here.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
