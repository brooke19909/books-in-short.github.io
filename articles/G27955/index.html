The only thing that unites all countries is the division into classes that has existed since the primitive communal system. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What is the estate structure </h2><p>  The division of the state or society into classes can be called differently.  The estate of the country was characteristic of <span>medieval Europe</span> and tsarist Russia.  The statuses of these units have been created over hundreds of years.  The presence of various social groups has always spoken about <span>social inequality.</span>  The population was formed by characteristic signs, primarily in order to single out the privileged layer, or to know, standing at the highest state level, and to give it all the powers.  Since the beginning of the 18th century, a representative of this class in Russia has been a person belonging to the nobility. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nobleman" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/349548.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Plato spoke of a similar state system.  But the estates appropriate for Ancient Rome, with its fall, lost their name, meaning and significance.  Each time, each country has its own division into classes.  In Russia in 1917, as a result of the revolution, the largest Eurasian state ceased to exist, and such "castes" as nobles and bourgeois ceased to exist.  Consequently, a person belonging to the nobility, as well as to the bourgeois class, lost his rights and privileges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Characteristic features of social classes </h2><p>  National strata, identified in some respects as a social group, possessed characteristic features, rights, powers and privileges, fixed at the state level and inherited.  Strict caste was always observed, there were traits inherent only to this social class.  And even if some class ceased to exist in reality, for many years it continued to live in the human mind or became a household name, included in the lexicon.  Thus, the word "slaves" will always be applicable to a person of the lowest, most dependent origin or behavior.  And the concept of ‚Äúnobility‚Äù, even mentioned ironically, implies a group of influential and wealthy people.  The word "bourgeois" generally acquired a dismissive meaning, although it referred to the human contingent, which had a certain abundance, law-abiding and non-conflict. </p><h2></h2><h2>  ‚ÄúThe nobleman - for many alone‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  After the October Revolution, state policy was aimed at belittling the dignity and achievements of representatives of high society.  In general, it was impossible to delete them from memory, since the most vivid historical figures for the most part came from this society.  Suvorov - a person belonging to the nobility.  Kutuzov and Nakhimov, Glinka and Zhukovsky - nobles, heroism, patriotism and a contribution to the greatness of Russia which no one is belittled or deleted from memory.  It was possible to shut up or completely distort the passionary traits and human courage of Stolypin, Kornilov and many other best representatives of mankind.  As the proverb says well: "The nobleman will not throw honor, even though the little head disappears." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, not only the elite have the highest virtues.  Hundreds of examples can be cited, but the most famous were always the exploits of Ivan Susanin, as well as Minin and Pozharsky, who liberated Russia from the invaders <span>of the Commonwealth.</span>  The first of them is a peasant, the second (Minin) is a tradesman, the third is a person belonging to the nobility.  Like Pushkin, Nekrasov, Turgenev and Tolstoy - Leo and Alex. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Territorial affiliation of the nobility </h2>

    <p>  Each Russian province had its own "noble assembly", had its own leader.  Actually, being in a particular association spoke of the addressee belonging of a person of this estate, indicating, so to speak, the location of his "noble nest." </p><p>  In the Tula province there was its own noble assembly, uniting a group of <span>people of high</span> society.  V.I. Chernopyatov (1857-1935) compiled the most reliable and multivolume reference book entitled The Noble Estate of the Tula Province, published during 1908-1915.  It included absolutely all the data from the moment the nobility arose under Peter I until the day it disappeared.  It takes into account not only family trees, family intertwining among themselves, family conditions, but also feats in the name of the Fatherland, performed by representatives of this class, their good deeds for the prosperity of the province and Russia as a whole, schools, hospitals, libraries and industrial enterprises erected on their facilities.  Nowadays, such sciences as heraldry and genealogy are becoming incredibly popular.  It is very fashionable to restore one‚Äôs pedigree, to discover belonging to ‚Äúglorious Russian surnames‚Äù, preferably with their own coat of arms.  Therefore, the works of such historians as V.I. Chernopyatov are incredibly in demand. </p>
