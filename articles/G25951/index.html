One such entertainment is the Panda Park rope park in Moscow. </p><h2>  About Panda Park </h2><p>  Panda Park is a dynamically developing company.  Nowadays, the network of these rope amusement parks works not only in Moscow, but also in other cities of our country.  In Moscow, there are 11 such parks, and three of them are indoor, located in the premises. </p><p>  "Panda Park" is a rope park, that is, a system of all kinds of rope crossings and obstacles.  Designed for all categories of the population, from children from three years old and a height of 90 centimeters.  Cableways hang at a level of one to twenty meters above the ground, either between trees or on artificial posts.  Trails vary in degree of difficulty, and their passage takes from 20 minutes to 1 hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kiddiemundo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="PandaPark Fili" class="if uuid-3251065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251065.jpg"></div><p>  This is a great option for relaxing with a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions.  Here you can experience different feelings - from fear and an adrenaline rush to delight and pleasure.  You can also take a lot of memorable photos in Moscow at Panda Park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  School sports competitions and children's educational activities are often held here. </p><h2>  Advantages of Panda Park </h2><p>  This is the only network of rope parks located in the city of Moscow, which saves time and reduces transportation costs.  The advantage of any indoor ‚ÄúPanda Park‚Äù in Moscow is the ability to go routes in any weather and season. </p><p>  The company uses double insurance, which gives a guarantee of complete safety.  Experienced staff and detailed instruction provide an exciting pastime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jcczhukovka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo &quot;PandaPark&quot; in Moscow" class="if uuid-3251052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251052.jpg"></div><p>  The designs of the open Panda Parks are safe for people and trees.  And for each element there is a certificate confirming the fastening system. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the number of participants in the passage of the route can be any.  No special skills and preparation are needed here - the instructor will tell you everything. </p><p>  Events of different levels are held here - children's parties and graduations, student and corporate.  Find out where in Moscow "Panda Parks" can be on the official website of the company. </p><h2>  Requirements and Limitations </h2><p>  The passage of any route is allowed only after a briefing, after which the ticket can no longer be returned.  There are restrictions in the entertainment PandaPark: a person‚Äôs weight should not exceed 110 kg and height 210 cm. In addition, depending on the route, the height of a child or teenager should be at least 90 or 140 cm, respectively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For safety reasons, the passage of routes is carried out in sneakers, as well as in comfortable sportswear that does not restrict movement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Routes in PandaPark" class="if uuid-3251066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251066.jpg"></div><p>  Also an obstacle to the passage of routes can be health restrictions, recent surgery. </p><p>  Children can visit the park on their own, but only at the age of 14 years with a passport and a receipt from parents. </p><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  An outdoor park may change working hours due to weather conditions.  Ticket offices close one hour before the official closure of the park. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that there are several addresses of the indoor "Panda Park" in Moscow, having arrived through which you can go routes in any weather. </p><p>  Panda Parks introduced a growth limit.  This is due to the fact that children, whose growth is below a certain level, cannot themselves cross the safety carabiner. </p><p>  There are no restrictions on physical preparation: tracks of various degrees of difficulty are specially designed so that everyone can choose their own path in strength.  However, here you need to remember about medical contraindications.  If necessary, you can call for help from an instructor.  However, if the visitor is evacuated to the ground, his visit is considered completed.  If you want to return to the route, you will have to buy a new ticket. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Addresses of the covered ‚ÄúPanda Parks‚Äù </h2><p>  The park works in any weather and in winter in units located indoors.  This is an undoubted advantage of the closed Panda Park.  Addresses in Moscow: </p><ul><li>  Aviapark - SEC Aviapark, Khodynsky Boulevard, 4; </li><li>  Zelenopark - SEC Zelenopark, metro Rechnoy Vokzal, Zelenograd, 18 km from MKAD along Leningradskoye Shosse; </li><li>  "Riviera" - SEC "Riviera", st.

It is located not on trees, but on artificial supports.  This is the first and perhaps the most extreme rope park where routes hang directly above the atrium of the shopping center.  During its construction, a unique system of attaching the park to the ceiling was used.  From afar, it seems that it is floating in the air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pandapark.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Panda Park&quot; Aviapark" class="if uuid-3251064" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251064.jpg"></div><p>  This is the latest format of sports and entertainment space and a real epicenter of adventure.  The park is open from Sunday to Thursday from 10 to 22 hours.  On Fridays and Saturdays it is open from 10 to 23 hours.  There are various tariffs and routes at heights from 1.5 to 18 meters.  Designed for the whole family.  Children's route - for children from 90 centimeters tall;  teenage - one route from 120 cm, 2 adult routes - from 135 to 210 cm. </p><p>  There is a play area with stationary relay obstacles, as well as cozy spacious rooms for various holidays. </p><h2>  GreenPark </h2><p>  Another indoor Panda Park in Moscow is located in the ZelenoPark shopping center and is a small-format rope park.  It has several rope tracks at ten meters, a climbing wall 11 meters high, and a children's climbing wall 6 meters high. </p><p>  In addition, the first Rollglider coastal attraction in the city is open here, where you can reach speeds of up to 25 kilometers per hour. </p><p>  There are various bridges made of logs and thin beams with hanging ropes, a Himalayan bridge, and suspended platforms with vertical grips.  There is a left-luggage office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventure.walltopia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;PandaPark&quot; in the shopping center &quot;Zelenopark&quot;" class="if uuid-3251058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251058.jpg"></div><p>  Designed for visitors growth of more than 120 centimeters.  The park is open daily from 10 to 22 hours.  The cash desk is open until 21h.  It is better to specify the cost on the website or by phone. </p><h2>  "Panda Park" in the shopping center "Riviera" </h2><p>  The rope town in the Riviera shopping center is the largest indoor Panda Park in Moscow.  It is located in a large room and has three levels, has eleven routes at a height of one to nine meters. </p><p>  This all-season complex of high-rise attractions is perfect for families with children from three years of age and a height of 110 centimeters.  There are all the necessary conditions for this.  For parents there are soft poufs around the perimeter and a loft located here, where you can have a bite and watch your child walking the route.  There is a baby zone for the smallest. </p><p>  Routes are thought out to the smallest detail, therefore they are safe even for children.  Joint trails with children from 125 cm are possible. According to reviews, this indoor PandaPark in Moscow has a lot of space and light, clean and fresh. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indoor &quot;PandoPark&quot; Reviera in Moscow" class="if uuid-3251054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251054.jpg"></div><p>  There are 11 routes of different difficulty levels: beginner-advanced-extreme.  According to visitors' reviews, they are interesting and unusual, and in some places they need good physical preparation.  There are about a hundred obstacles in the rope park, including an attraction - a jump from the height of a four-story building. </p><p>  There is a children's labyrinth eight meters high for the youngest visitors - from a year to seven years.  There is also a climbing wall with ten panels. </p><p>  There is also a cafe on the territory of the park where you can relax, have a bite and even celebrate a children's birthday or go another holiday. </p><p>  The park is open daily from 10 to 22 hours. </p><h2>  Panda Park Fili </h2><p>  In addition to the indoor Panda Park, rope parks in the open air, in the fresh air, among trees are very popular in Moscow.  The largest and most extreme of the open parks in Moscow and the region is PandaPark Fili.  It provides nine routes of various categories of complexity and duration.  Adult tracks rise up to twenty meters above ground level.  There are short and basic routes for babies.  There are routes for teenagers from one hundred and forty and one hundred and fifty centimeters - for example, a very long ‚ÄúTroll‚Äù of suspension bridges. </p><p>  For adult visitors, six routes are offered, among which there are very difficult and extremely high.  This is the highest route in Russia - ‚ÄúObservation‚Äù and ‚ÄúExtreme‚Äù with a climbing wall of sixteen meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alinkadmitrenko.livejournal.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://alinkadmitrenko.livejournal.com/7132.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="&amp; quot; Pando Parks &amp; quot; in the open air" class="if uuid-3251059" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62915/3251059.jpg"></div><p>  For adults, children above 150 cm can also go to adult tracks, but this level is very difficult, so many instructors, on request, take off the routes. </p><p>  As the park has become very popular, there are a lot of people here on weekends.  In this regard, sometimes it takes a long time to wait for the issuance of equipment or to wait for the people who are ahead to go ahead.  On weekdays, of course, fewer people. </p><p>  The amusement park has a bicycle parking and luggage storage.  You can eat at a local cafe, where even a special children's menu is provided.  In ‚ÄúPandaPark Fili‚Äù a variety of events are held - from children's birthdays to corporate parties. </p><p>  Before the trip, it is better to clarify the park‚Äôs working hours, as sometimes some routes do not work.  This can be done on the official website, as well as by phone. </p><h2>  Addresses of rope complexes ‚ÄúPanda Park‚Äù </h2><p>  In Moscow, there are eleven rope attractions "Panda Parks" in different parts of the city.  Three parks are located indoors, that is, they are covered.  The rest are in the open.  In addition to the three addresses we have already reviewed, you can find out others.
