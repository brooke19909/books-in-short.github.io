Even now, they can get around many modern tweeters.  And after appropriate refinement, even budget Yamaha speakers cannot compare with them.  And now we will consider the legendary <span>Soviet speakers</span> Radiotehnika S90.  This is a symbol of the <span>Soviet Union.</span>  Even abroad, they noted the high quality of this <span>speaker system</span> (at one time).  Therefore, it makes sense to consider these columns.  Moreover, many still use them to this day. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Columns Radiotehnika S90 were first released in the early eighties of the last century.  A plant located in Latvia was engaged in their production, which became an additional incentive for citizens to purchase them.  Despite the rather high price, the speakers scattered like hotcakes.  People have been saving for a long time, malnourished, hiccuping them wherever possible.  Acquired even used speakers.  If only to decorate your little rooms with Radio Engineering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983783.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  Nowadays, many audiophiles are still chasing this speaker system.  Columns "Radio Engineering" - the blue dream of any connoisseur of quality sound.  But now they can be purchased only in the secondary market.  And far from the fact that their condition will be acceptable ( <span>‚Äúdashing nineties‚Äù</span> affect <span>).</span>  Nevertheless, this speaker system can give odds to many modern speakers.  And after appropriate refinement, it completely turns into a Hi-End class acoustics.  And this is a completely different level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The <span>speaker system</span> from Radio Engineering looks impressive.  These are very large columns.  Each of them weighs about 15-20 kilograms.  This is not to mention the fact that to transfer them because of the bulky and voluminous case is not very convenient.  The front panel (as well as the entire case) is covered with veneer.  There are several color combinations.  The speakers are covered with a metal mesh.  Only the tweeter is not covered by protection.  This, of course, is good, but it does not affect the acoustic properties of the speakers in the best way.  Nevertheless, the design is quite acceptable.  Much better than other ‚Äúclumsy‚Äù Soviet-made cloves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983788.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  On the right side of the mid-range and tweeters are two mode switches.  It is not known why they were put here.  A normal amplifier itself is able to switch modes.  And the work of the speakers is to reproduce the sound correctly.  However, in the Radiotehnika S90 such switches are available.  But in the process of refinement they can be removed, because they affect the overall sound quality very negatively.  But for those who appreciate retro and antiques, such proposals will seem sacrilege. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  So, let's move on to the mean numbers.  The normal speaker power is 35 watts.  But these beauties can easily give out 90. That is why they were called the "nightmare of neighbors."  However, for their full disclosure, appropriate stereo amplifiers are needed.  Only then will this speaker system sound for real.  The frequency range starts at 20 hertz and ends at 25,000 hertz.  Such a wide range allows the speakers to fairly reliably reproduce almost all the instruments.  Frequency response is quite acceptable for a speaker system of this level.  No miracles can be expected from her.  But the sound is quite decent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983787.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  Now the fun part is the woofer.  This is the legendary "Dean 75 DG."  The thing, of course, is good, but perfectly reliable bass does not work out of it.  If the woofer is at least something of it, then the midrange and woofer, although they cope with their task, but they cannot be called ‚Äúkosher‚Äù.  Ordinary paper "bells".  It would be much better to replace them with Kevlar or silk domes during refinement.  Then the big speakers will sound.  Yes, and it is better to rewind the low frequency, as in used speakers it is often burned out due to "super-mega bass." </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the speakers "Radio Engineering" with standard components can not boast of a very clean and correct sound.  But the quality is enough for not very demanding listeners.  The speaker system perfectly copes with instrumental music (soft rock, jazz, blues), the electronic one also works well.  But heavy and other subgenres of the great and terrible metal - not really.  That is, the speakers reproduce it as expected, but the low-frequency twitches so that it can easily break.  Especially when listening to those groups that often abuse the gimbal on the "barrel". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983786.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  Not a bad thing is also a classic.  This is probably the only genre that the Radiotehnika S90 copes with perfectly.  All instruments sound crystal clear.  Nothing runs ahead.  Listening to the classics on these speakers may well appeal to even audiophiles.  However, it will not work to call this speaker system a Hi-End thing.  To achieve this level will have to modify the column.  As standard, it‚Äôs average but confident Hi-Fi.  But the Soviet man did not need more. </p><h2>  Amplifiers for S90 </h2><p>  In order for passive speakers to sound good, high-quality stereo amplifiers are also required.  It should be noted that the "nineties" is able to swing and fully reveal only a very powerful amplifier.  The Soviet Brig and Odyssey cars will do just fine with such work.  These monsters are able to squeeze everything out of the speakers.  Amphiton U-001 will do quite well.  Just do not try to connect this speaker system to the Vega 50U.  The amplifier will immediately refuse to work even at minimum volume. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983785.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  An ideal option for this speaker system is the amplifier "Radio Engineering".  They were produced in huge batches, with different power and resistance.  Therefore, finding such a thing in the secondary market is not a problem.  Amplifiers of such a plan suitable in power are more than enough.  You can, of course, be puzzled and connect these speakers to a completely modern receiver such as Yamaha.  But then such a set will go far beyond the "budget".  And such a decision is not worth the candle.  This is how to put the engine from the Porsche to Zaporozhets.  It is possible, but it makes no sense. </p><h2>  Price S90 </h2><p>  Now we will analyze the most interesting quality of the Radiotehnika S90.  The price in the secondary market depends on the "killing" of the kit and its originality.  Speakers in standard equipment and in good condition will cost from 1000 to 2000 rubles.  Depending on how good they look.  Almost as much are the speakers with the whole internal system.  You can even find almost unused ones.  It all depends on the seller and the degree of awareness of the buyer.  Modified by all the rules, the speakers will cost more, since this is already an acoustic system of a completely different class.  They will cost about 3,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983782.jpg?1556657951"></div><p>  Amplifier "Radio Engineering" will also cost about the same amount.  Monsters such as Brig or Odyssey in perfect condition will be pulled somewhere by 15,000 rubles.  But the problem is that finding them is almost impossible.  Total estimated cost of a complete set will be approximately 6,000 rubles.  Much better than an incomprehensible Chinese speaker system for the same money.  However, this is an approximate cost.  It can vary depending on the degree of refinement of the speaker system and its condition.  But still it turns out much more profitable.  And the sound quality will be up to standard. </p><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  Now consider the reviews on the speaker system Radiotehnika S90.  Amplifier is a separate issue, so we will not consider it here.  So what will the owners say?  Positive and negative reviews about these columns go "nostril to nostril."  Competent audiophiles have long finalized their ‚Äúnineties,‚Äù and therefore their reviews are laudatory eulogies for Soviet speakers.  There is clear sound, clearly traced bass, a wide range, versatility (for all genres) with some equalizer settings.  Also an important plus for many was the completely wooden case.  And the power of these columns is a parable at all.  This quality was noted by all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1983790" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/1983790.jpg?1556657951"></div><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  However, there are snobs that are not satisfied with the sound quality of this speaker system.  They note insufficient drawing of medium and high frequencies (and this is true).  The case after so many years of use is already rattling.  Low-frequency thumps out of place.  But, comrades, any thing needs to be monitored and timely prevented.  This also applies to columns.  After the appropriate procedures, they will sound very different.  Dissatisfied owners of the S90 - take note! </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The Soviet</span> Radiotehnika S90 <span>speaker system</span> is among the most preferred budget options.  It copes with its duties much better than any modern acoustics originally from China, lends itself to refinement and can provide sound Hi-End class.  What else is needed for happiness to the music lover? </p>
