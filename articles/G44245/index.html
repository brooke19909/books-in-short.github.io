However, it seems to many that this resort is not accessible to everyone and that mainly millionaires come here - owners of huge fortunes, and in euros.  However, this is not quite true.  After all, this is hospitable Spain. </p><p>  Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * and other three-star hotels provide tourists with services at very affordable prices.  Moreover, the quality practically does not suffer from this.  Canaries is a brand that is already a guarantor of high quality.  That is why every year millions of tourists from all over the world travel to one of the seven islands of the Canary Archipelago to find their personal paradise here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibh bahia flamingo 3" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431545.jpg" width="345"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays on the island </h2><p>  The magnificent three-star hotel Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * <span>(Tenerife, Spain)</span> is located on the second beach line, 350 meters from the water's edge and a 5-minute walk from the center of Puerto de Santiago - the city that belongs to the municipality of Gia de Isora.  From <span>Tenerife South Airport,</span> which is located on the territory of Granadilla de Abona, it can be reached in 30-40 minutes.  Within walking distance from the hotel there are wonderful cafes and bars where you can try a variety of dishes and drinks of international cuisine, as well as delicious exotic cocktails prepared by experienced bartenders of the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Along the beach line you can also find supermarkets or small grocery, vegetable, and souvenir shops.  The biggest local attraction is the <span>volcano Santiago del Teide.</span>  Its shape is visible from the windows of the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * Guia De Isora.  Due to the volcanic origin on the surrounding beaches, the sand is not golden, but black.  This indicates its volcanic origin.  By the way, it is very hot in the sun, has useful properties, can contribute to the treatment of certain diseases, especially the musculoskeletal system. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, you are waiting for incredible adventures in the Canaries (Spain / Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 *).  Tours to this hotel can be bought from one of the main tour operators working with both island and mainland Spain.  Of course, you are interested in how to get there.  Do not worry, your tour operator will make sure that your path is comfortable and without incident.  He organizes your meeting and delivery in a comfortable minibus from the airport to the very entrance to the hotel. </p><p>  However, if you still want to know in more detail which path you have to make, then we bring to your attention all the necessary information.  So, the address of Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * Guia De Isora is as follows: Canarias, Avenida La Gaviota, 3 - 38683. The only transportation hub is Tenerife South Airport.  You can fly here on a charter flight.  The flight duration is 6-7 hours. </p><p>  By the way, if you want to move around the island freely, you can even rent a car via the Internet before arriving in Tenerife.  Then at the airport you will be waiting for your chosen iron horse.  We think that this is a great idea, and you will definitely use it.  As they say, to walk, so to walk.  Imagine how happy it is - with a breeze (if you choose a convertible) to ride around the island of your dreams, which is located in the Atlantic Ocean and is so close to the equator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibh bahia flamingo 3 guia de isora" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431546.jpg" width="435"></div>

Three three-story hotel buildings located at right angles to each other, in the form of the Russian letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù, have a very beautiful architecture.  Balcony terraces that look at both the pool and the expanse of the ocean are like waves.  The pool has the same shape.  The Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel is considered a medium-sized hotel, as it accommodates 140 spacious (mostly two-room) rooms. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As already noted, the hotel has only one hundred and forty rooms.  Among them there are rooms for non-smokers, as well as for people with disabilities.  The administration claims that all dwellings are soundproofed.  However, if you read about the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * reviews, you can see that they tell the exact opposite.  For example, according to former guests, the audibility is so good that a neighbor's snoring or babble is clearly heard from the next room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain ibh bahia flamingo 3 description" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431550.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description and room service </h2><p>  All rooms of Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * (photos are presented in the article) are connected to the heating system, since the hotel is also valid in the winter months.  But not all rooms have air conditioning, although this is not indicated in the hotel description.  But here in the summer there is a terrible heat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Almost all rooms are two-room.  They consist of living rooms and bedrooms, which is very convenient for couples with children.  If you indicate in advance that you will come to rest with a baby up to 5 years old, then you will definitely be provided with a cot.  There is also a desk, bedside tables, wardrobe, beds.  The balconies overlooking the pool and the ocean are very spacious and comfortable.  There are also <span>clothes dryers.</span>  Bathrooms and toilets are simply magnificent, equipped with showers.  There are all the necessary toiletries. </p><p>  However, this information is slightly inconsistent with that which can be seen in the comments section for visitors to the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel <span>(Tenerife).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> say that shampoo, liquid soap and toilet paper are provided to tourists only upon arrival, and then employees either forget or simply do not want to add them. </p><p>  Cleaning is carried out in good faith, every day.  The rooms also have flat-screen TVs (the remote control will be brought for a fee), wireless Internet (a password for connecting to Wi-Fi is paid), a safe is also a paid service, and a telephone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibh bahia flamingo 3 pics" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431543.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing at the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * Guia hotel can choose the following types of meals during the tour: half board (HB) - two meals a day (breakfast and dinner), or all inclusive - all inclusive, up to local drinks.  The hotel's restaurant serves a buffet twice a day (in the mornings and evenings), which is full of various international and Mediterranean dishes. </p><p>  According to tourists' reviews, the food in the hotel restaurant is very tasty, although it would be nice if the breakfast menu was more varied.  As for dinners, they are simply excellent here and consist of meat, fish dishes, vegetable side dishes and gourmet appetizers.  At lunchtime, the restaurant operates on an ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù system, and the order needs to be done in advance.  The hotel also has a bar and a cafe where you can try snacks and drinks (for tourists vacationing on an all-inclusive basis, everything is free). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibh bahia flamingo 3 tenerife reviews" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431549.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  For young tourists in the restaurant you can always find dishes from the children's menu.  There is no separate pool for them at the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 Guia, but there is a paddling pool where kids can splash around in plenty of warm water.  Throughout the day, animators try to diversify the leisure of young guests, in the evenings they organize children's disco and various competitions.  Unfortunately, there are no employees who speak Russian, especially among the organizers.  That is why Russian children do not always want to participate in fun, with the exception of dancing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bh bahia flamingo 3 reviews" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel has a 24-hour reception desk, although check-in is from 12:00 and check-out is not later than 12:00.  If you want to rent a car and explore the island on your own, then you can use the car rental service available at the hotel.  To do this, you need to have an international class driver's license with you, and, of course, the necessary amount of euro. </p><p>  At the reception there is a left-luggage office.  Using the cell will cost less than renting a personal camera for use in the room.  Despite the fact that the hotel has only 3 floors, an elevator does work.  For convenience, laundry and dry cleaning services are provided.  There is a currency exchange and an ATM for cashing money from plastic cards. </p><h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  Between the three buildings of the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel there is a bizarre-shaped pool.  It is rectangular, only its sides are wavy, the same as the balcony walls.  Many tourists spend most of the day by the pool and only rarely go down to the beach.  There are also sun loungers with umbrellas, and there is also a pool bar.  A TV lounge is open in the central building.  Sports activities include billiards, ping-pong, tennis courts.  There is no gym in the hotel, but in the mornings in the pool classes on aqua aerobics are held. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  As already noted, the beach is only 350 meters, that is, you can walk in 10 minutes.  It leads to a cool track from the hotel.  The beach is sandy, but the sand, as already mentioned, is black volcanic.  It is very hot, so without slippers it is simply impossible to step on it.  By the way, the beach does not belong to the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel.  He is public.  That is why you can only use equipment (umbrellas and deckchairs, as well as showers and changing rooms) only after paying for them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain ibh bahia flamingo 3" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1431548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Latest hotel reviews </h2><p>  According to the reviews of vacationers at this hotel in the summer and early autumn of 2016, some of the items that are indicated in the descriptions of the Ibh Bahia Flamingo hotel on the tourist portals do not quite correspond to reality.  Of course, in general, they are very pleased with the service that they met here, but they do not want to be silent about the minuses, so as not to mislead those who are just going to visit this hotel. </p><p>  So, the disadvantages include the lack of air conditioning in many rooms.  Apparently, they were dismantled for the purpose of replacement, but new ones were never installed.  As a result, during the hot August months at night, it is simply impossible to sleep.  Former guests are also advised to bring shampoo, shower gel, toilet paper.  Of course, when you check all this you will find in the room.  They are enough for a couple of days.  No one else thinks to add them. </p><p>  There are also complaints about breakfast.  According to tourists, they are very monotonous and in a couple of days I want something new.  But with regard to dinners, reviews, on the contrary, are enthusiastic.  A lot of seafood dishes.  What we call delicacies in the Canaries is the most ordinary food, and the freshest.  As for the children's menu, then this issue is also in full order.  After all, what is important for mothers?  So that their child does not remain hungry and eat exclusively fresh and wholesome foods. </p><p>  Tourists also thank the aerobics trainer for their great workouts.  Many complain that the hotel rooms do not have refrigerators.  And their presence is especially important for those who choose the type of food half board.  It turns out that for lunch they buy food, and there is no place to store them.  However, after the guests asked to bring a refrigerator to the room, it was delivered immediately and completely free of charge. </p><p>  Some of the vacationers complained about the lack of a playground on the hotel grounds where children could have fun.  Of course, for older children, animators organize various contests and entertainment programs.  But what is the use of them if the children do not understand anything said?  Tourists from Russia often come to this hotel, and the administration should think about inviting at least one Russian-speaking employee.  In everything else, everything here is just fine, especially the view that opens from all the rooms without exception. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  If you carefully read this article, you probably understood that the Ibh Bahia Flamingo 3 * hotel is worth a visit.  Despite some flaws, it is simply magnificent.  Such a wonderful panorama is rarely found.  In addition, you can easily come here in November, at a time when the Greek islands and Cyprus are not at all suitable for a beach holiday.  Give yourself and your children a holiday, have a wonderful vacation on the largest of the Canary Islands - in Tenerife.  Believe me, you deserve it! </p>
