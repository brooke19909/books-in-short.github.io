    <p>  Likhaya station is located on the way from the capital of Russia to Rostov-on-Don.  This two-way highway is electrified by alternating current.  A non-electrified double-track highway to Volgograd was laid from this <span>railway station</span> .  Previously, there was a single track on Izvarino, but now it is in a disassembled state. </p><h2>  Origin of station name </h2><p>  There are two main versions of the origin of the name Likhaya station.  Judging by the word, we can conclude that both versions are associated with something bad and dashing.  And it is true.  The first option is associated with the dropped phrase of Empress Catherine II, who in 1787 had the imprudence to stay in this secluded place of the tract for the night.  In the morning, many of the Empress‚Äôs retinue found themselves robbed.  Thieves were not ashamed to rob Catherine the Great herself.  In anger, she said that the place was dashing.  And since then, the settlement in which an important person spent the night, and began to be called. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But there is another version of the origin of the name Likhaya railway station, which is told by local historians.  She is also connected with the local bandit, the leader of the robbers who hunted in these places by the name of Likhachev.  Which version is true and which is not, it‚Äôs difficult to judge now.  One thing is clear, that in ancient times this settlement was famous for many dangerous robbers. </p><h2>  Station history </h2><p>  Likhaya station began to be built in 1869.  The first commissioning took place in 1872, when the Voronezh-Rostov line opened.  At the beginning of the XX century, the Likhaya-Tsaritsyn path opened and this station becomes a nodal point.  But during the wars that took place at the station, the building was destroyed.  Around the station grew a village that fully justified its name.  Crime at that time was quite high. </p><p>  After World War II, it was decided to build a new railway station station Likhaya.  A new building was opened in the late 40s - early 50s of the last century.  Since 2008, a third path has opened, which operates on the stretch to Zamchalovo. </p>

At the station, workers periodically check the serviceability of rolling stock; the locomotive traction of trains is being changed.
