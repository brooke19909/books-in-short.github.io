    <h2>  General aspects </h2><p>  Outstanding loans and <span>penalties,</span> inability to pay arrears - surely many people are familiar with this situation.  Banks transfer your debt to collectors, and the real "bullying" begins.  They call, write and trap you in the most unexpected places.  A person falls into a trap and does not know how to act.  Very often, such pressure is very effective, and the debtor pays not only credit, but fabulous fines.  The thing is that many are not familiar with their legal rights and therefore do not know how to communicate with collectors.  And the "extortionists" use this situation perfectly.  But there is a way!  You need to know the law, and then the dialogue will become much simpler and more productive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Law to help you </h2><p>  Know that the activities of such organizations are strictly regulated by law, which protects our rights and freedoms.  Therefore, no one has the right to violate them!  The main threats that collectors use are: </p><ul><li>  <span>Article 177 of the</span> Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúMalicious evasion of repayment of accounts payable‚Äù.  Remember, such threats are an absolute bluff on the part of the collector!  There are no more than a dozen precedents for attracting this article in our country. </li><li>  Article 159, Fraud.  This argument is the most frequent.  Remember, if you paid at least once, even the minimum amount for obligations, this "letter" of the law does not apply to you.  There is no intent and you will not be prosecuted. </li></ul><p>  Very often, collectors themselves do not know the laws, but as soon as they see a competent debtor, their arrogance and assertiveness simply disappear. </p>

    <h2>  Psychological pressure </h2><p>  Practice shows that collection organizations have fairly narrow rights.  These are commercial firms that can only persuade a person to pay a debt.  They have no more authority, of course, if the matter is not in court, and the sentence they pass to the executive service has not been passed.  So they can be formidable only in conversation.  How to communicate with collectors over the phone?  First of all, know that they want to scare you as much as possible and bring you to emotions.  And it is in this state that a person panics and is ready to fulfill any requirements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Try to keep calm and calm, do not shout, swear, insult employees.  And if threats come to your address, be sure to let us know that you have recorded this fact, and the police will already communicate with them.  It is advisable to record such calls for the purpose of further presentation to the law enforcement agencies.  You should not answer attacks on your dishonesty, ignore such remarks and ask for the reasons on which they dared to intimidate and insult you. </p><h2>  We collect information </h2><p>  You need to be prepared for dialogue with ransomware.  Yes, that's right, because without a court order and a <span>writ of execution</span> they are engaged in illegal activities.  How to talk to collectors on the phone correctly?  Remember a few important points: </p><ul><li>  Ask to introduce yourself and write down all the information. </li><li>  Specify which office bothers you (name, details). </li><li>  Which bank transferred your debt, let them clarify the details of the contract (document number, date of signing, amount of claims). </li><li>  Request a copy of the contract for the <span>transfer of rights</span> to your debt. </li></ul><p>  If you are denied such information, feel free to hang up.  It will be useful to put the device with a caller ID to record all calls and their time.  Be sure to tell the collectors that you are ready to complain to the police about illegal actions on their part. </p>

    <h2>  Communication algorithm </h2><p>  How to talk to collectors on the phone so that they understand your intentions?  Firstly, do not be afraid and make excuses.  Do not allow yourself to insult, threaten your family or relatives.  Such actions qualify as hooliganism or extortion.  Once the calls have become annoying, try to explain to the collector that you intend to solve this problem. </p><p>  If the situation does not change and you are constantly worried, contact the police with a statement about the persecution and threats.  In no case do not communicate with them after 23 hours or in the early morning until 7, otherwise such calls will become constant.  If you feel that you are openly provoked to aggression, hang up.  Upon learning that these dishonest citizens began to threaten loved ones, immediately report to the police.  If calls to work have begun, this is a disclosure of your personal information.  Here you already have the right to sue them for illegal activities! </p><h2>  What should not be reported </h2>

    <p>  How to communicate with collectors over the phone so as not to harm yourself?  You should not provide any unnecessary information.  Do not give the phones of the organization where you work, do not give the coordinates of your home.  Do not share information about relatives and friends.  Many in an attempt to solve the problem tell collectors the date of receipt of a salary or the fact of the sale of real estate or property, this is not worth it.  This is another reason for them to pressure and intimidate you.  If you really intend to pay the debt, you can tell the repayment date.  But lawyers do not recommend paying them at all, it is better to go to court, because it can significantly reduce the amount of penalties. </p><h2>  Unpleasant visit </h2><p>  And how to communicate with collectors if they dare to pay you a visit home?  First of all, know that you do not have to open the door for them and let them into your own home.  The law is on your side.  If they started shouting and cursing, harassing their neighbors and scaring you, immediately call a police outfit stating that unknown citizens are breaking into your house.  Believe me, it perfectly cools their ardor.  If you still decide to talk with them, do not let them into the apartment until they provide you with: </p><ul><li>  Agreement on the transfer of rights to your debt. </li><li>  Documents proving their identity. </li><li>  The article that claims you. </li><li>  Documents confirming the organization‚Äôs rights to perform collection activities. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, the conversation ends already at this stage.  But if the workers began to threaten you, defiantly record everything on a camera or recorder, invite neighboring witnesses.  Experts recommend documenting the entire process of communication as thoroughly as possible.  If letters are written to you, be sure to save them, and send the answer by <span>registered mail</span> with a list of attached documents.  An excellent way out of the problem will be to attract a credit attorney.  These specialists know very well how to communicate with collectors correctly. </p>
