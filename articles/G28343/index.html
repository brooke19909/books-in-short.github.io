    <h2>  When to paint </h2><p>  If you decide to start making paper wickerwork, you need to learn not only the weaving technique, but also how and how to paint newspaper weaving tubes.  If you use colored newspaper or magazine sheets to curl blanks, you can leave them unpainted.  After all, a wicker product will have an interesting surface without it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the better to paint newspaper weaving tubes" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1242192.jpg" width="447"></div>  If ordinary black and white newspapers are used, the tubes are often painted the color of a natural vine (not sanded), that is, brown or light (as if the bark was removed from the branches).

    <h2>  The better to paint newspaper weaving tubes </h2><p>  In fact, a huge number of options.  Almost any composition that has a color pigment is suitable, but the choice is determined by what shade you want to get and how saturated.  Some compounds make the tubes stiff after the paint layer has dried, while others make them soft, but have lost their brightness, and faded.  Dyes can be used both on an aqueous basis, and on an alcohol basis, and also powder which are previously diluted in liquids.  So, the list of options is as follows: </p><ul><li>  gouache; </li><li>  watercolor (fades); </li><li>  acrylic paints; </li><li>  stain; </li><li>  car spray paint; </li><li>  iodine solution; </li><li>  brilliant green; </li><li>  <span>potassium permanganate (potassium permanganate)</span> ; </li><li>  <span>aniline dyes</span> for clothes; </li><li>  <span>food coloring</span> </li><li>  ink; </li><li>  ink; </li><li>  hair dye. </li></ul><p>  If the preforms themselves are supposed to be painted before weaving, they usually use a stain that interacts well with the paper and after drying gives a beautiful brown tint.  To increase the saturation, it is possible to apply the dye in several layers with preliminary drying of the previous layer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you decide to first weave the product, and then process it, use acrylic colors or gouache.  They are sold in sets, so they are suitable for creating a complex pattern on the surface of a <span>wicker basket, box</span> or vase.  You can draw an ornament, floral motifs or any other pattern. </p><p>  It is worth considering that when using any of the proposed options, newspaper tubes need to be varnished so that the product becomes more dense, resistant to moisture.  It is better to process the finished basket, since the varnish layer will make the paper stiff and not too comfortable for weaving. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how and with what to paint newspaper tubes for weaving" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/1242193.jpg" width="218"></div>
