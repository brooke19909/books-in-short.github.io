This is due to the positive reputation of the company, which it managed to earn in just a few years of producing successful models of acoustic accessories designed for any equipment.  And it's not just about computers.  Portable and individual acoustics, developed by a team of professionals, can be used in a wide variety of areas of life, and even used as professional solutions.  One example of successful budget headphones is the SENNHEISER HD 201, a review of which will help identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as familiarize yourself with the opinions of users. </p><h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  As mentioned above, this model is budgetary, which guarantees a low cost and makes it possible for almost every user to purchase it for themselves.  It has become widespread due to the good price-quality ratio, as well as a pleasant and convenient design that makes this set of headphones a everyday device, inseparable from the owner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gearooz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sennheiser hd 201 full-size headphones" class="if uuid-2485658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485658.jpg"></div><p>  As noted in the recommendations for use, first of all, SENNHEISER HD 201 headphones should be used in conjunction with a desktop computer or laptop.  They are quite large, and wearing them on the street is not always convenient.  However, if you like this particular form, then using the model as an accessory for a mobile phone or player will not cause any problems - it is compatible with most modern devices that use a 3.5 mm standard connector for audio output. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Options and appearance </h2><p>  The headphones come in a sturdy cardboard box, teeming with all the colors of the rainbow.  It is beautifully designed and attracts attention.  However, it cannot be said that it was overloaded with information - the characteristics of SENNHEISER HD 201, a small instruction manual and recommendations for maintenance were harmoniously located on the packaging surface. </p><p>  Inside it are securely packaged headphones, fixed so that they are not damaged during transportation.  They can be attributed to the class of monitor, because the ear pads are quite large in size and completely cover the ears.  The speakers are made in a rectangular version.  Outside, the case is matte, has a silver tint with a black logo of the manufacturer.  From above the arch is hemmed with soft material, which provides reliable fixation of the headphones on the head.  At the same time, they do not press, and they can be used without increasing discomfort for many hours in a row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="headphones.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 201 specifications" class="if uuid-2485627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485627.jpg"></div><p>  The wire has a length of 3 meters, which, according to reviews of SENNHEISER HD 201, is quite enough even to connect to a computer unit located under the table.  The main thing when using them is not to forget that the wire is still limited, and not try to get up from the desktop without removing the headphones.  If you plan to connect to other devices that have a 6.3 mm jack, you can use the special adapter, which is also carefully included by the manufacturer in the package. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  Testing these headphones, the experts were able to draw some interesting conclusions regarding the quality of their sound.  So, the most pronounced frequency group can be called the average frequency range.  It sounds nice, not annoying, and doesn't stand out from the others.  At the same time, these features are enough to reveal the main instrumental group in almost any track. </p><p>  As for the low frequencies, then with them the headphones are also very confident.  The bass is clean, without spurious rattles and unpleasant sounds.  However, as emphasized in the SENNHEISER HD 201 reviews, despite the rather large diffusers, it lacks a bit of depth, which affects during active games, in particular shooters, abounding with sharp low deep sounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearopen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 201 headphones review" class="if uuid-2485652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485652.jpg"></div><p>  But the upper limit is a bit upsetting.  Despite the fact that all sounds can be distinguished from each other and they are quite juicy, there is a slight hiss in the background generated by the membrane of the speakers.  It is not strong, but it can be a little annoying.  If the headphones are used for a long time, then the hearing gets used, and hissing disappears. </p><h2>  External noise protection </h2><p>  The ear pads are made of foam rubber covered with artificial leather.  At home, they protect the listener well from external noise, but when using them as a headset for a phone, the user may encounter the fact that the city around him will interfere with comfortable listening to music or watching movies.  There is the opposite effect, when at high volume, others can clearly hear the same thing as the user of the <span>full-size</span> SENNHEISER HD 201 <span>headphones</span> . This fact upsets some users who want to use the headphones for the most part on the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sonicelectronix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 201 headphones" class="if uuid-2485623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485623.jpg"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  If some when choosing headphones rely on reviews and opinions about the appearance, then for others this information may not be enough.  The specific numbers of the SENNHEISER HD 201 Headphones in the form of specific numbers can help make a choice for someone who knows this issue.  So, one of the main indicators is the impedance, or resistance of the windings of the speakers.  In this model, it is 24 ohms, which is the average for this class.  It follows that the headphones will sound a little quieter than other familiar models.  This fact should be taken into account, especially if the device used as a sound source has a weak audio path. </p><p>  The gadget is capable of reproducing frequencies ranging from 21 Hz to 18 kHz, which completely covers the auditory capabilities of an adult.  In this case, the sensitivity is within 108 dB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 201 headphones specifications" class="if uuid-2485657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485657.jpg"></div><h2>  Headphone usability </h2><p>  Many users note that the headphones are quite practical and convenient for everyday use.  This manufacturer managed to achieve thanks to a large number of moving elements.  The user has the opportunity to adjust the angle of each speaker, as well as adjust the correct position of the headband.  All the clips are quite rigid, which prevents the headphones from loosening due to long use and starting to fall from the head.  The weight underlined in the reviews of the SENNHEISER HD 201 headphones is only 165 grams, so that the head and neck do not get tired. </p><p>  The wire connects to each speaker separately, and does not go on one side.  This allows you to mark it in the center, and it does not interfere with one of the hands, especially when playing games on a computer or console. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sennheiser hd 201 headphones" class="if uuid-2485654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2485654.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  One of the key criteria that allow you to make the final decision on the acquisition of a particular gadget are user reviews.  Reviews of SENNHEISER HD 201 headphones will also help you make the right choice.  Let's start with the positive aspects: </p><ul><li>  <em>Low cost with good quality.</em>  Users note that for the same money it is difficult to find a competing model that would be able to provide the same pleasant sound and reliability. </li><li>  <em>Convenient shape of the body and headband.</em>  The manufacturer has thought of any options that will help place the headphones on your head as comfortably as possible.  The user can finely adjust the location of all the main elements and the distance to them. </li><li>  <em>Light weight.</em>  Having facilitated the design, it was possible to reduce the load on the neck muscles, and so they suffer when they are at the computer for many hours in the same position. </li><li>  <em>Pleasant appearance.</em>  Despite the fact that many manufacturers do not pay due attention to the appearance of budget models, these headphones can safely be called an exception to the rule.  They are made of high-quality, pleasant to the touch materials and decorated with additional elements such as company logos and cutouts. </li><li>  <em>The presence of a long wire.</em>  Headphones can be easily connected to a device located at a decent distance.  Some users even use them to watch TV without additional extension cords. </li><li>  <em>High durability of the case.</em>  Headphones can survive more than one fall from the table, without losing their appearance and without receiving visible damage. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.komputronik.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SENNHEISER HD 201 Headphones" class="if uuid-2488095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2488095.jpg"></div><p>  However, some features of the headphones did not appeal to users.  It is worth paying attention to the negative aspects not listed in the SENNHEISER HD 201 review, even before the acquisition of the device. </p><h2>  Negative moments </h2><p>  First of all, it is noted that a rather long cord is not too strong.  If you managed to successfully position it, and it does not fall into the arm, then the headphones can last a long time.  However, you can damage it by just rolling around by accident over its braid with the wheel of an office computer chair.  Therefore, some users decide to replace the entire cord after the first damage. </p><p>  As already noted in the SENNHEISER HD 201 review above, the headphones have not too high volume.  This becomes a significant disadvantage when playing at low levels, since in this case, low frequencies are almost completely lost, which annoys many users. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  These headphones are perfect for those who do not want to spend too much money and plans to use them mainly in conjunction with a desktop computer.  The use of headphones with a smartphone or player is not recommended due to the low sound volume and damage to the cable. </p>
