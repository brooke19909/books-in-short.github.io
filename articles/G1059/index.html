Description, features, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Coin 5 kopecks 1935 - this is a real find for numismatists.  This year, when stamping monetary units, several stamps changed, which provided a variety of varieties of coins.  The price of such money varies from a thousand to one hundred thousand rubles.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 kopecks 1935" class="if uuid-3165481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165481.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Production - Leningrad Mint.  Coin 5 kopecks 1935 was produced in a circulation of more than eleven and a half million copies.  It would seem that the circulation is huge, why is the price so high?  The answer is simple.  Several stamps were used in production over the year, the appearance of the obverse has changed, the appearance of the reverse is also different for many coins. </p><p>  Coins of 5 kopecks of 1935 were made of bronze with the addition of aluminum.  Golden color.  The coin weighs five grams.  On both sides there is a edging with protrusions.  There are no magnetic properties and characteristics. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The entire upper half of the disk is occupied by the number "5".  In appearance, it is more like a capital letter than a printed one.  It seems that someone wrote it by hand.  But the inscription "cents", located below, is already printed.  The lowest share of the coin disk at 5 kopecks in 1935 is the year of manufacture.  And, of course, an indispensable attribute on the coins of that time is a decorative dot under the numbers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Edging - ears of wheat beautiful with thin stems.  They are located on both sides, as if enveloping the main image.  If on later coins the ears come out of oak leaves, then on a coin of 5 kopecks in 1935, simply beautiful monograms are located below - continuation of the stem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worthpoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 kopecks 1935 photos" class="if uuid-3165483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165483.jpg"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  The upper part and the main central place is, of course, the emblem of the Soviet Union.  It is a drawing of planet Earth, in the center of which are a sickle and a hammer.  Ears of wheat, decorated with a beautiful ribbon, encircle the Earth.  It has seven turns (three on each side) and one turn at the bottom, connecting.  The sun comes out of the center of the ribbon bow.  It is not fully depicted, only its upper quarter is visible.  Long and thin rays extend from the solar semicircle, reaching the pattern of the Earth.  Above, where the ears are almost connected, a star is located.  There are five faces, carved, rounded. </p><p>  At the very bottom is the abbreviation of the USSR with dots after each letter, as it was customary to write then.  Already in the same year, on the same coin of 5 kopecks 1935, everything will change.  The dots will disappear, a greater distance between the letters will appear, they will become blurry, thinner and sharper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Along the entire perimeter of the coin is the famous slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!"  All punctuation marks were followed. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  In total, the coin of 5 kopecks in 1935 has seven varieties.  Two of them are formed due to the use of two stamps for reverse, four for obverse.  Another type of coin is considered the most expensive and rare. </p><h2>  Old type of stamp </h2><p>  A stamp of 1926-1934 was used for production.  It was printed a call for the unification of all countries.  In addition, if you look closely, the hammer was close to the second meridian.  The spike on the right has one long and one short spine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ma-shops.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="five kopecks" class="if uuid-3165484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3165484.jpg"></div><h2>  New type of stamp </h2><p>  On the obverse, the image of the star has changed.  If it was convex on 5 kopecks coins of 1935 of the ‚Äúold‚Äù type, then on new coins you can see a concave five-pointed star, as if engraved inside the coin. </p><p>  It is worth taking a closer look at the tips of the left spikelet (the longest).  On one coin, it will go above the ray of the (left) star, on the other a little lower.  The distance at which the letter "P" is located in relation to the image of the coat of arms also differs.  On one variety it will be more removed, on the other it will be moved more strongly. </p><p>  The only marriage that occurred at auctions was a chip in the top of the coin. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The cheapest coins will be defective (from 300 rubles), as well as monetary units that have a spike of wheat that goes beyond the left ray (550 - 750 rubles).  Coins, the obverse of which does not have knots, and also on which there is a slogan and decorative dots, are estimated at between 4,000 and 90,000 rubles. </p><p>  The most expensive will be a ‚Äúremake‚Äù of the times of Khrushchev, which was released in scanty numbers as a presentation for foreign leaders.  Such coins are estimated at 350,000 rubles and higher. </p>
