Prince Oleg the Prophetic: biography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  History is an interesting science that stores information about the life of mankind, legendary events and personalities that have influenced the course of historical events on Earth.  This knowledge is especially important now when events of a negative order occur in countries such as the former Yugoslavia or today's Ukraine.  But after all, Oleg Veshchiy was designated Kiev as the ‚Äúmother of Russian cities‚Äù!  Today, not everyone knows <span>why they</span> called <span>Oleg Veshchim</span> .  Maybe he was a fortuneteller? </p><h2>  "The Tale of Bygone Years" </h2><p>  Oleg‚Äôs personality appeared in the chronicles of historians when events related to the death of Novgorod prince Rurik were described.  Dying, Rurik handed over to him under the care of his young son Igor.  In 879, both Novgorod and son Igor became the concern of Oleg, whom historians consider to be a relative of Rurik's wife.  Modern scholars insist that Oleg was just a talented warrior, who became a governor and a close man of the prince of Novgorod.  Whoever Oleg is, he became regent under Igor, the prince of Novgorod and Kiev, the person who stood in power during the creation of a united Russia.  <span>The chronicler Nestor</span> in his "Tale ..." describes the activities of the prince and indicates why Oleg the Prophet. </p><h2>  Campaign to Kiev </h2><p>  Having become regent and prince of Novgorod, Oleg three years later decided to expand the territory of the principality and went on a campaign to Smolensk.  Having gathered a huge army, in 882 he goes south and captures this city.  Smolensk was followed by Lubech.  In these cities, he placed his governors with a sufficient number of soldiers and moved further along the Dnieper.  On his way stood Kiev.  At this time, the rule of the <span>Kiev principality was</span> carried out by Askold and Deer.  Prince Oleg possessed the dignity of an experienced military strategist and a cunning clever man.  Once at the Kiev mountains, he hid his squad and appeared only with Igor in his arms.  Having convinced <span>Askold and Dir</span> that this was a courtesy visit on the way to the Greeks, he lured them out of the city.  The warriors dealt with the rulers, and Prince Oleg took control of Kiev. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Why - Prophetic?  This name began to be called only after the Byzantine campaign in 907.  In the meantime, he became the prince of Kiev and declared this city "the mother of Russian cities."  Since then, Oleg pursued a policy of uniting the Slavs, expanding the borders of the land, liberating him from tribute paid to the nomad tribes. </p><h2>  Campaign to Byzantium </h2><p>  If we turn to the explanatory dictionary, then we can make sure that the name Prophetic means not only a ‚Äúpredictor‚Äù, but also ‚Äúa sensible person‚Äù.  That was Prince Oleg.  It was in a campaign against Byzantium in 907 that the Prophetic Oleg showed his ingenuity.  Having conceived the campaign, he gathered a huge army, not only on horses, but also on ships.  They were all sorts of people: Varangians, and miracles, and Krivichi, and Slovenes, and many others, whom the Greeks called the "Great Scythia."  Prince Igor remained to rule Kiev, and Oleg went on a campaign.  It is after the campaign that it becomes clear why Oleg was called the ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù.  The desire to expand the borders of the Russians, establish trade relations with other countries pushed Oleg on a trip to Byzantium, where he went in 907. </p>

    <h2>  Fighting </h2><p>  Having come to Constantinople (Constantinople) with an army and ships, which were two thousand, Oleg landed on the shore.  This had to be done, because the city from the sea was protected by chains that locked the <span>Golden Horn,</span> and the ships could not overcome them.  Having gone ashore, Prince Oleg began to fight around Constantinople: he killed many people, set fire to houses and churches, and did a lot of evil.  But the city did not give up.  And then Oleg came up with a trick: he ordered his ships to be put on wheels.  When a fair wind blew, the sails were opened and the ships went towards Constantinople.  The Greeks realized that it was time to send ambassadors and agree on a tribute.  They promised Oleg to give everything he wanted.  They brought him various dishes and wines, which the prince did not accept, fearing that all this was poisoned - and he was not mistaken.  This fact also indicates why they called Oleg the ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù: forethought saved his life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sword on the gates of Constantinople </h2><p>  And the Prophetic Oleg overlaid the Greeks with a tribute.  He ordered to pay 12 hryvnia for each soldier in the ships: and there were forty of them.  And there are two thousand ships.  He also ordered tributes for the cities: for Kiev, Chernigov, Lyubech, Rostov, Polotsk, Pereyaslavl and for other places over which Oleg ruled.  The Greeks agreed to all conditions for the sake of maintaining peace in their land.  To make peace, they swore an oath to each other: the Greek kings kissed the cross and promised to pay tribute.  And Prince Oleg and his men swore by their weapons and gods: the Rus were pagans.  They promised that they would not fight, and made peace.  As a sign of victory over the Greeks, Oleg hung his shield at the gates of the city and only after that went back.  Oleg returned to Kiev with enormous wealth, and they nicknamed him after that - ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù.  So for the first time a peace treaty was signed between two countries - Russia and Byzantium, relations began: they allowed to conduct duty-free trade.  But one day Oleg Prophetic made a fatal mistake: the events of his death speak about this. </p>

    <h2>  Prediction of the Magi </h2><p>  Oleg Veshchiy turned to the wise men with a question about his death: why should he die?  Those predicted death from his beloved horse.  And then the Prophetic Oleg ordered to put the horse, feed, but never lead to him.  He vowed never to sit on it.  This went on for several years.  Oleg went hiking, reigned in Kiev, making peace with many countries.  Four years have passed since then, the fifth, 912, came.  The prince returned from a campaign from Constantinople and remembered his beloved horse.  Calling the groom, he made an interrogation about his state of health.  To which he received an answer: the horse died.  And that - three years.  Oleg concluded that the magi are deceiving their predictions: the horse has already died, and the prince is alive!  Why Oleg Veshchiy did not believe them and decided to see the remains of a horse?  This is not known to anyone.  Oleg wanted to see his bones and went to the place where they lie.  Seeing the horse‚Äôs skull, he stepped on him with the words: ‚ÄúDo I accept death from this skull?‚Äù </p><p>  A snake appeared from the skull and stung the Prophet Oleg in the leg.  After that, he fell ill and soon died.  A prediction came about how Prince Oleg the Prophet died, whose biography is described in the chronicles of Nestor, where this legend is given. </p>

    <h2>  Years of the Principality </h2><p>  The Grand Duke of Kiev and Novgorod Prophetic Oleg gained fame in 879 and died in 912. The years of his reign did not go unnoticed: during this period there was a union of Slavic tribes, a single center was organized - Kiev.  The borders of Russia significantly expanded, good-neighborly relations with Byzantium were established.  Why did they call Oleg the ‚ÄúProphetic‚Äù?  For his mind, insight, for the ability to choose the right strategy and competently conduct foreign policy. </p>
