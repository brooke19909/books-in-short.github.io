It is these qualities that the new representative of the Fs502 company acquired.  What will surprise this state employee? </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  When choosing a smartphone, the buyer pays more attention to appearance.  The hardware in the cheap gadgets is almost identical, but the unusual design of the public sector stands out against the general background.  Actually, the manufacturer <span>Fly Fs502</span> and relied on appearance. </p><p>  The smartphone turned out to be a pleasant eye, with rounded shapes and a texture coating on the back.  The case of the device is completely made of plastic, which significantly reduced its cost.  Although the material does not shine with originality, the device turned out to be very solid. </p><p>  Among the many impersonal devices, the <span>Fly Fs502</span> smartphone will find a response in the hearts of customers.  The only thing that bothers you is the lack of color variations.  The device is available exclusively in black. </p>

    <p>  Changes in the arrangement of parts on the case did not happen.  In front is a speaker, screen, camera, touch controls and sensors.  The left side has absorbed the volume control, and the right - the power button.  The camera, flash, the main speaker and, naturally, the Fly logo hid behind.  The top end was taken under the headphone jack, and the bottom under the microphone and USB jack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of particular interest is the rear panel of textured material, as well as what is hidden under it.  Under the cover is a battery and card slots.  The peculiarity is that the device works with Micro and Mini Sim. </p><p>  To protect the device, <span>tempered glass</span> on the display and olophobic coating are used.  There are almost no fingerprints on the phone, and the screen is perfectly protected from scratches.  For the public sector, the design and protection are great. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Equipped Fly Cirrus 1 Fs502 black display, excellent for the price category.  The diagonal is as much as five inches, and the resolution is not bad - 1280 by 720 pixels, which is HD-quality.  In principle, this is the minimum resolution for such a screen, but for a budget employee 293 ppi is quite acceptable. </p>

    <p>  The Fly Fs502's display turned out to be quite bright, but more cold shades prevail in it.  Viewing angles are also impressive due to the IPS matrix, although with a large slope there is slight distortion.  There are no problems in the sun, you can even read from the display without difficulty. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  They supplied the Fly Fs502 with the not very well-known Spreadtrum processor of the SC7731 model.  Judging by the information, this platform is very close to MTK MT6582.  If in reality the characteristics are similar, then the 502 received a solid processor.  But the schedule is responsible for the already accustomed to budget employees Mali-400. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__up0"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;" class="vn-container-iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone has got four cores with a frequency of 1.2 GHz each.  Despite the powerful stuffing, you should not expect the incredible from Fly Fs502.  The device will cope with most tasks without problems, but demanding games confuse it. </p><p>  The device‚Äôs RAM does not stand out.  The manufacturer has placed a gigabyte of memory in the gadget.  In principle, for a state employee this is a good indicator. </p><p>  No surprise and native memory.  The device has 8 GB, but only 5.5 GB will be available for the user.  The rest of the memory is occupied by Android.  Available and expansion card up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  An interesting feature of Fly Fs502 Cirrus is the work on the modern "Android" 5.1.  This decision of the company was very unexpected, since even many middle-class representatives have not yet switched to this system.  If the manufacturer wanted to surprise his users, then he succeeded. </p>

    <p>  The system includes many applications installed by the company.  Naturally, most of them will be scrapped or will not be used.  There are also useful applications for working with banks or watching movies. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  I got the device eight megapixels familiar to budget employees.  Under ideal conditions, the pictures are acceptable, full of life and with good detail.  The situation changes dramatically in poor lighting conditions - photos acquire noise. </p><p>  To say a lot about the video also does not work.  The device shoots videos with HD-quality, but it is not able to surprise the image. </p><p>  The front camera is also quite common - for inexpensive gadgets.  Equipped the device with two megapixels.  This is enough for video calling and self-portraits. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The smartphone has a removable battery having 2050 mAh capacity.  Such a battery is quite enough for continuous operation.  In an average load, the phone will last eight hours, and in standby mode - for a whole day.  Having fun in advanced games and watching videos, you can reduce the life of the device to five hours. </p>

    <p>  Autonomy indicators are quite standard and do not stand out.  In case of emergency it is possible to change the battery to an analog of a larger volume. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of Fly Cirrus 1 Fs502 black is very affordable and attractive.  You can become the owner of this device for 7 thousand rubles.  The phone is definitely worth the money, given the good functionality.  Actually, in the price segment of the device it will be difficult to find worthy competitors. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the Fs502, the owner will receive a standard set of adapter, headset, USB cable, instructions and battery.  You may need to replace the headphones with better ones, as well as buy a case. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  For its segment, the smartphone has not many disadvantages.  The reviews written for the Fly Fs502 Cirrus 1 are full of doubts about the processor used.  Unfamiliar filling repels potential buyers.  Most likely, the use of the already tested MTK would increase the popularity of the smartphone. </p><p>  The camera does not cause delight.  But here everything is much simpler - the usual 8 megapixels are not able to provide the proper quality. </p><p>  There are no special claims to the appearance, but the only variation in color is depressing.  Even adding standard white would greatly dilute the design. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Significantly more advantages received Fly Fs502 Cirrus 1. Reviews note the high performance and gigabytes of RAM. </p><p>  Not deprived of attention and the display of new items.  Usually, cheap phones get a much lower resolution, but there is no talk of protecting glass. </p>

    <p>  A nice bonus was the ability to use different models of sims.  Modern devices try to adapt to the leaders and make cards less and less, thereby creating problems for the user when switching to a new gadget. </p><p>  An improved system will also not leave the owner indifferent.  In addition to many fresh applications, the happy owner of the gadget should not worry about updates. </p><p>  The final and most important advantage is the price of the device.  The opportunity to get an excellent device for such a low price pleases. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  It rarely happens that there are more advantages in a state employee than disadvantages.  However, Fly was able to prove that this is possible.  Without a doubt, the novelty will appeal to many buyers. </p>
