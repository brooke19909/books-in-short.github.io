This is especially true for products such as Texet shockproof phones.  These portable devices differ from their ‚Äúrelatives‚Äù in that they can be dropped onto soft soil, earth and even asphalt without any serious concerns.  In addition, they are not afraid to load in the sand, swim and lie in the water.  The only thing that can not give a 100% guarantee of maintaining its integrity and performance after falling on stones is the screen, which is perhaps the most vulnerable spot of such phones, although it has a fairly high level of reliability and resistance to external damaging factors. </p><h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Texet Shockproof <span>Phones</span> <strong> </strong>  - An ideal option for tourists and lovers of extreme sports.  It is also suitable for active people who do not like to mess with very capricious touch smartphones and other sophisticated attributes of the modern world of cellular communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet shockproof phones" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051552.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is worth noting that any Texet shockproof phones <strong> </strong>  work flawlessly where their other ‚Äúcolleagues in the shop‚Äù simply cannot survive.  So, for these units of the modern industry, neither the scorching sun, nor the cold wind, nor severe frost, from which many phone models freeze and turn off, nor even a <span>sandstorm in the desert, are scared.</span>  Such stress resistance is explained by the full compliance of the phones with the IP67 standard, which is confirmed by the presence of a special international certificate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Texet Shockproof <span>Phones</span> <strong> </strong>  can be called those that are able to function without additional recharging for quite a long time.  According to the manufacturers, the devices can operate in continuous talk for more than a day, and in standby mode from one to two months, depending on the model.  In particular, the Texet tm 511r shockproof phone <strong> </strong>  has a battery capacity of 2700 mAh.  This indicator can be considered truly impressive, since most of these communications equipment have 1400-1600 mAh batteries.  Battery Type - Li-Ion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet shockproof waterproof phones" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051559.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Housing </h2><p>  The phone has aluminum plates on its sides, which are widely used in the space industry.  Strong armor is secured by high-tech screws.  In addition, the housing is protected by extremely durable rubber.  Assembly of the device is a separate issue.  Texet do not have any extra holes, crevices, or other elements that could damage the seal.  The back cover is attached using two steel screws.  With all this, the phone can not be called too large and heavy, it looks quite neat, although it still obviously will not suit a beautiful girl. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that perfect autonomy of work is achieved by the fact that Texet shockproof <span>waterproof phones have</span> not received wide functionality.  Simply put, the devices make calls, send, receive messages, play video and music, take pictures, make it possible to record a voice on the recorder, have an organizer, currency converter, a couple of games and a primitive browser.  In reality, a two-inch display does not allow you to fully enjoy watching a movie, and the browser is able to open only the simplest web pages (by the way, EDGE is not supported).  As for the quality of reproduced audio files, only picky listeners will be satisfied with them.  Although, in fairness, we note that you can listen to audiobooks without any distortion of the sound range.  If desired, the supplied headset can be replaced with a more modern one, since the 3.5 mm jack provides this opportunity.  This nuance is extremely important, since the vast majority of the so-called SUVs are sold with headsets that need to be connected to USB ports and it is not possible to replace them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof texet phone Price" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  This is not to say that it is too good, but its resolution, equal to two megapixels, fully justifies it.  Of course, you cannot create any masterpiece with it, but the simplest shots turn out to be quite high-quality.  Unfortunately, the camera does not make it possible to capture moving objects, and indeed it works quite slowly. </p><h2>  Memory and Slots </h2><p>  Shockproof Texet Mobile Phones <strong> </strong>  support microSD and microSDHC.  In this case, the maximum allowable supported amount of memory can reach 16 gigabytes. </p><p>  The devices can simultaneously serve two SIM cards.  Their work takes place in a fairly standard format: in standby mode, phones process information from two cards, and when talking, one of them is necessarily turned off. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof mobile phones texet" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051582.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <h2>  Connection quality </h2><p>  Texet shockproof phones, reviews of which are full of exceptionally positive characteristics, can fully work even after removing them from water or another not too aggressive liquid.  And for this, there is even no need to instantly completely dry the devices, as is often the case with other similar phones, Naturally, the speech will not be heard as well as if the speakers remained dry, but at the same time the conversation will be understandable to both interlocutors. </p><h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  Texet phones have screens with a diagonal of two inches and a resolution of 240x320 pixels.  When direct sunlight occurs on such a monitor, the colors almost completely disappear, however, the text displayed on the screen remains completely readable to the user.  The color palette is about 65 thousand colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof texet phones reviews" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051590.jpg" width="281"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  Generally speaking, in almost all Texet models it has a standard design and a joystick.  The size of the buttons is not too big, but quite acceptable for pressing.  By the way, the buttons are often, as in the Texet TM-540R model, made of plastic.  Because of this, slipping of fingers is sometimes observed, although, ultimately, this does not lead to accidental pressing of extraneous buttons.  The key travel is large enough, which allows you to comfortably press them even when tight gloves are put on your hands. </p><p>  <span>The keyboard backlight is</span> uniform, white.  It is enough to use the phone in absolute darkness, though it is not possible to regulate it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="texet tm 511r shockproof phone" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1051596.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In conclusion, we note that the Texet shockproof phone, the price of which is in the range of 3,000 rubles, is absolutely consistent with its value and fully fulfills its functions without serious malfunctions.  Unlike various capricious iPhones and other similar analogues, Texet will be your faithful assistant, who can be put into the back pocket of your pants without fearing for its integrity and sit down. </p>
