    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a very good location was received by the residential complex "St. George".  Volgograd, Zhukov Ave. - here is his address.  And since this avenue is an important transport artery of the city, the residents of the complex can easily get to work.  The avenue is connected to another main highway - 3rd Longitudinal.  There are many public transport stops on these roads, allowing citizens to get to their destinations quickly and practically without traffic jams. </p><p>  Along with the plus, the proximity of the location to the main city highways can become a minus.  Since every day they are loaded with cars, including trucks. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Infrastructure is represented by several schools and gymnasiums.  Since the complex pleases the Dzerzhinsky district (Volgograd), its amenities are also available to residents.  True, the small residents of the complex will have to overcome some distance to them.  Also nearby are two pools.  Well, and about shops, and at various levels, it‚Äôs not even worth talking.  There are a lot of them in the district: from hypermarkets to the ‚Äúat home‚Äù format.  It will take public or private transport to the former, while the latter please with its proximity to the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> "George" (Volgograd) decorates the city with two single-section buildings, consisting of nineteen and twenty-three floors.  Not every residential complex being built boasts the simultaneous construction of a parking lot.  But only not "George" (residential complex, Volgograd).  The cost of apartments at the same time did not increase and remained within the average per square meter of housing.  Two hundred car owners can count on the quiet parking of their "iron horses". </p><p>  Currently, the nineteen-story building is fully constructed, and finishing work has been completed in its apartments.  In addition, almost all housing has already been sold.  And another is being completed. </p>

    <p>  The complex offers apartments of various sizes and layouts.  One-room at 43 meters, three-room - up to 90 square meters.  This allows its future residents to choose apartments that they like and wallet. </p><p>  The construction promises to be completed by 2018.  And this is almost a year ahead of the originally planned deadline.  Moreover, in the most high-rise building, all apartments will be in their category of one meter. </p><h2>  Plot history </h2><p>  The land plot used for the Georgievsky residential complex was not accidentally provided by Volgograd.  In 1976, a model of its development was created.  But until now, it was not possible to build the complex.  And only in 2014, the developer began to implement long-standing plans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost 40 years ago it was planned to completely develop the Dzerzhinsky district.  Volgograd was to become a city of multi-storey buildings.  In total, 11 modern residential microdistricts were provided for by the layout.  But perestroika made adjustments to the plans, and therefore they were not implemented.  Only in the 21st century were they finally able to start them. </p><p>  The erected buildings of the complex involve two delivery lines.  The first is for rent nineteen.  It is built of monolithic reinforced concrete, with the exterior walls finished with white silicate facing brick.  From which the internal partitions are made. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  <span>The residential complex</span> "George" (Volgograd) provides for the presence on the ground floor of non-residential premises.  And in the basement of the complex will be located pantries intended for use by residents.  The ceiling height in the apartments will be 2.7 meters. </p><p>  The walls are well insulated with specially designed material.  Their thickness will not allow residents to freeze in the cold season.  In addition, gaskets from the specified material simultaneously perform a soundproofing function.  This is an important factor in modern buildings.  After all, everyone knows that audibility is now very large.  Therefore, the developer company tried to solve this problem and create the maximum convenience for its apartment buyers, a quiet and peaceful life. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the residential complex leaves only the most favorable impression and offers its future residents only the very best.  These are beautiful buildings, well-developed infrastructure, and, importantly, solving problems with parking spaces.  By the way, only a few residential complexes can boast of parking.  This is a problem not only of Volgograd, but also of any more or less large city.  Everywhere there is not enough territory.  And developers are striving to build their buildings closer to the center in order to provide residents with the necessary infrastructure, and not to build it additionally. </p>
