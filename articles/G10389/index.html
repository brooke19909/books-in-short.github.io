Guests visit the resort's municipal beach areas.  However, this does not spoil the impression of rest, because they are all well equipped. </p><p>  The beach closest to the hotel consists of sand and has a length of forty meters.  Vacationers are provided with sun loungers, umbrellas, changing cabins and comfortable showers. </p><p>  For children, this beach is great.  There are practically no stones, and a gentle entry into the water makes it possible not to worry about the swimming guys.  Of course, sun loungers and umbrellas must be rented, but tourists claim that these costs will not be noticeable to the wallet. </p><h2>  Territory: description of infrastructure facilities </h2><p>  It is expected that such a large hotel as the Green Garden Resort Apart Hotel 4 * (reviews about the hotel complex contain a lot of useful information about it) can please guests with a large number of infrastructure facilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel has nine restaurants, two of which provide all-inclusive meals.  Guests can also spend time in five bars located in different parts of the complex. </p><p>  The hotel has one large pool, which has an unusual shape.

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a modern four-star hotel in which Wi-Fi would not work.  Therefore, in the hotel complex we are describing, guests are always in touch with their loved ones.  The connection speed is high, and the signal is stable. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Green Garden Resort Apart Hotel 4 * hotel, an iron is issued here for a fee.  In addition, his model is far from modern, which encourages many guests to use the laundry service, where things are not only washed, but also ironed. </p><p>  We already mentioned at the beginning of the article about individual transfer.  It can be negotiated at the stage of booking apartments and directly at the hotel.  If you approach the staff at the reception and tell what exactly you need, then by the indicated time a comfortable transport will be waiting for you at the entrance. </p><p>  Many tourists are not happy that the room is filled with bags and suitcases, so they hand them in to the luggage storage room.  The hotel provides a similar service to its guests. </p><p>  The apartments are cleaned daily, in addition, vacationers can order room service. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Please note that pets are not allowed in the hotel complex.  Therefore, it is better to leave them with loved ones who will be waiting for your arrival in their hometown. </p><p>  Check-in at two in the afternoon.  In cases where earlier check-in is required, it becomes possible if there are free rooms.  Departure from the apartment takes place before noon. </p><p>  If you plan to use a safe in your room, then get ready to pay three dollars a day for it.  This practice is very common in hotel complexes in Turkey. </p><h2>  Features of accommodation with children </h2><p>  Since the hotel is positioning itself as a family, here with great attention to children of any age.  Please note that a child under 11 years old sharing the same bed with their parents will stay free of charge. </p><p>  Kids under the age of two who are allocated a separate bed can also have a rest absolutely free.  Only one extra bed is allowed per room. </p>

    <h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  Often children from four to twelve years old spend time in a kids club.  His employees are very praised by his employees, because every day kids are waiting for adventures and interesting activities. </p><p>  For very young guests, a playground with a large number of structures is equipped.

By the way, the field, equipped at the hotel, the game experts praise. </p><p>  It is impossible to be in Turkey and not relax in a hammam with a massage.  It‚Äôs not a pity to give money for such a pleasure, and many even visit the massage parlor during the whole vacation. </p><p>  Gym classes are great for keeping fit.  It is small in size, but it is very comfortable to work here due to its good equipment and a nice design for the eyes. </p>
