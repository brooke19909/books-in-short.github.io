  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most beautiful places of Omsk and the best attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Omsk is not only a large transport and industrial center of the country, but also just a beautiful city.  It is located on the coast of the Om and Irtysh rivers, from where its name came from.  Visitors to the city and tourists will be primarily interested in the question of what to see in Omsk.  And there are more than enough attractions in the city.  It is about them that will be discussed in our article. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  In the ranking of attractions of the city of Omsk in the first place, of course, is the city embankment, which is a real decoration.  It is the main promenade where not only tourists gather, but also citizens.  The embankment was built along the full-flowing river Irtysh.  It is one of the most beautiful places in Omsk for walks.  This is where you can take great photos.  By the way, all the newlyweds of the city on the embankment, according to a long tradition, arrange photo shoots.  And this is not surprising, because the Omsk registry office is nearby.  The building, which houses the House of Celebrations, is the mansion of the merchant Batyushkov, which is an architectural and historical monument.  It signed many generations of local residents.  After the solemn registration, the newlyweds usually take a walk along the promenade with the photographer, making memorable pictures.  Irtysh sparkling in the sun is a wonderful background for a photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omskgazzeta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Embankment" class="if uuid-2596784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596784.jpg"></div><p>  There are other interesting objects on the promenade.  Among them are historical buildings, modern cosmetology clinics, shopping malls and shops.  Residential buildings and hotels were built along the promenade.  For local residents, the promenade is the best place for walking in Omsk.  In the mornings, townspeople jog along the promenade and young people ride bicycles.  Here, in the open air, a platform with exercise machines was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Batyushkov Mansion </h2><p>  The lists of interesting places and attractions in Omsk include the mansion of the merchant Batyushkov.  Its building, as we have already mentioned, is located on the Irtysh embankment.  It was built in the early twentieth century.  In the mansion in 1919 the famous Admiral A. Kolchak lived.  The building, unfortunately, was damaged during the assassination attempt on the admiral. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://agentika.com/ru/encyclopedia/316e45d3-3ee8-419c-ab9f-b32e4b68592d/places/root/2ef155e4-50b8-439f-a721-ef3bcc0b6d93?version=uoe-0" data-original="agentika.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batyushkov Mansion" class="if uuid-2596792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596792.jpg"></div><p>  But later the consequences of the explosion were eliminated, and the mansion was restored.  Now it houses the city registry office, as well as a center for studying the history of the Civil War and museum funds, the exposition of which will allow you to learn a lot of new things not only about the history of the city, but also about the life of Kolchak himself. </p><h2>  Omsk Academic Theater </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful places in Omsk is the Academic <span>Drama Theater, which</span> claims to be the oldest in Siberia.  Its building was built in 1905 and is considered an architectural monument of federal significance.  The theater is made in the style of Siberian baroque.  The building combines elements of classicism with rich balustrades, complex volumes and turrets on the windows. </p><p>  Residents of the city did not have their own theater until the mid-nineteenth century.  I had to confine myself only to performances by touring troupes.  The first theater building was built of wood, and therefore did not last long.  It burned down in 1877.  The new building was erected in 1882 from stone, but it was not entirely successful, so it was demolished.  The troupe once again resided in a wooden building.  They began to build a new modern theater in 1901.  For a long time, work was carried out on the decoration of the facades.  Now on the pediment of the building you can see a sculpture by the Czech author Winkler called ‚ÄúWinged Genius‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Anniversary bridge </h2><p>  The Jubilee Bridge is not only a beautiful place in Omsk for a summer photo shoot, but also a symbol of the city.  A pedestrian and road bridge connected the two banks of the Om River.  It offers stunning views of the city, the river port and the river itself.  The name of the building was in honor of the 50th anniversary of Soviet power.  The bridge was built in 1967. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this design is already the third in this place.  Remains of past structures still exist.  The Ilyinsky bridge (first) was wooden and was built in 1826, lasting until the beginning of the twentieth century.  But at the end of the nineteenth century, the local head of the city after a trip to Paris came up with the idea to build a movable iron bridge.  He realized his plan in 1903.  The central part of the structure was adjustable.  The bridge itself was called Paris or Iron. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.om1.ru/realty/news/122825/" data-original="www.om1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anniversary bridge" class="if uuid-2596798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596798.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the modern Jubilee Bridge reaches 80 meters.  On city holidays, it is completely blocked, making it pedestrian.  Locals say that under the bridge there were some caves.  Whether they exist now and whether the legend is true is not exactly known.  However, residents love to tell this mysterious story to tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Musical Theatre </h2><p>  The list of attractions of the city includes the <span>Omsk State Musical Theater.</span>  Its history began in 1946, when a decree was issued on the creation of a <span>musical comedy</span> theater <span>.</span>  The new troupe was created on the basis of the Stalingrad, which lived in the city during the war.  So the creative foundation of the theater was laid.  For many years of the institution's work, many works have been staged on the stage.  Currently, the theater is one of the leading groups in Siberia.  Its actors are actively touring the region.  The repertoire of the institution is not only a classic, but also the creations of domestic authors. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  Museum of Fine Arts.  Vrubel is another beautiful place in the city of Omsk.  Of interest is the architecture of the building itself and the large exposure of the institution.  It is worth noting that the museum is the largest in Siberia.  Its extensive collection includes more than 25 thousand exhibits.  Many items presented in the halls are world famous.  Among them, one can distinguish: the most beautiful ancient works ‚ÄúSarmatian gold‚Äù (1-2 centuries), canvases of native painting of the nineteenth century, the unique creations of Faberge, paintings of the Russian avant-garde of the twentieth century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Art Museum" class="if uuid-2596804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596804.jpg"></div><p>  The museum was founded in 1924.  Initially, it was only an art gallery at the West Siberian Museum of Local Lore.  But later grew into an independent institution.  But the name of Vrubel was assigned to him only in 1996.  The triptych of the great artist - ‚ÄúRoses and Lilies‚Äù, ‚ÄúYellow Roses‚Äù, ‚ÄúChrysanthemums‚Äù is presented in the museum‚Äôs collection.  The exhibition also has exhibits from the collections of the Golitsyns, Yusupovs and from the Winter and Marble Palaces. </p><h2>  Holy Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  Among the beautiful cities of Russia Omsk occupies a worthy place.  The city is decorated with numerous ancient buildings that perfectly adjacent to modern buildings.  While in Omsk, you should definitely visit the Holy Assumption Church, which is listed in the catalog of the world temple culture.  The cathedral is a unique architectural monument of Russia. </p><p>  The first stone in the foundation of the future building was laid by Nicholas II in the period when he was still a prince.  After the city became the capital of White Russia, the cathedral became the main temple for the movement of the White Guards. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://travelask.ru/blog/posts/6056-samyy-krasivyy-hram-v-rossii" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Assumption Church" class="if uuid-2596826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596826.jpg"></div><p>  During its construction, the project of the St. Petersburg Church of the Savior on Blood was taken.  However, the architect Wierrich did not reproduce the exact copy, creatively processing the existing material.  The result is a unique building.  After the revolution, they wanted to convert the temple into a theater, but the acoustics proved to be insufficient.  In 1935, the building was blown up, and the bells were sent for re-melting.  On the cleared place the Garden of Pioneers was laid out.  And only in 2005, it was decided to rebuild the temple.  According to the plan, an exact copy of the structure was restored.  After the consecration of the new building, the area near it was called Cathedral.  If you have the opportunity, it is worth taking a walk at the temple in the evening, when its facades are illuminated by numerous lamps.  In the light of the lamps, the Holy Assumption Cathedral looks even more magnificent and can rightfully be called one of the beautiful places in Omsk. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><p>  Omsk is famous for the fact that during the Civil War it was the capital of White Russia under the leadership of Kolchak.  The city has one of the first Siberian museums - historical and regional studies.  It was founded in 1878 at the initiative of the Russian Geographical Society.  In just a few years, the first collections were formed.  For a wide visit, the museum was opened only five years after its inception.  The Second World War became the most significant period in the history of the institution, since museum collections of different cities of the country were stored in its walls. </p><p>  Today, the museum‚Äôs exposition has more than 200 thousand items of interest from the point of view of artistic, historical and cultural value.  The institution also stores real pearls.  Among them, there are Shi-Dzi - the figures of Chinese lions transferred from China in 1895.  In ancient China, such lions adorned temples or noble houses.  Their peculiarity is that they are cast from cast iron, therefore they are considered a unique monument. </p><p>  Another unique specimen is the skeleton of a woolly mammoth, composed of the remains in parts.  The representative of the ice age is of great interest to all visitors.  The height of the skeleton reaches three meters.  Such exhibits are a rarity.  And not in many museums they are available. </p><h2>  Cossack Cathedral </h2><p>  As the heritage of the Russian Cossacks stands St. Nicholas Cathedral, which is considered the oldest <span>church in Omsk.</span>  At one time it was built with the money of the Siberian Cossacks.  And the building was designed by the famous architect Stasov.  In 1883, the cathedral found the main relic - the banner of Ermak himself, which depicts St.  Dmitry Solunsky, killing a Tatar khan with a spear.  Unfortunately, during the Civil War era, the canvas was lost.  Now in the walls of the temple is stored only a copy of the banner. </p><h2>  Bird Harbor </h2><p>  For guests and tourists, not only the city of Omsk and its main attractions is of interest, but also the rich nature of the region.  On its territory there are many beautiful places.  One of them is the Bird Harbor Reserve.  Omsk's natural landmark is located on the banks of the Irtysh River.  The picturesque place is located just in the way of bird migration.  During periods of autumn flights, three thousand individuals rest on the river and lakes.  Ponds formed on the site of the former channel of the Irtysh.  During the construction of the dam, a pit was dug, which connected to the Zamarayka river, as a result of which a series of lakes formed.  Gradually, the banks were overgrown with grass and filled with inhabitants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="omsk.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird Harbor" class="if uuid-2596814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596814.jpg"></div><p>  Since 1975, the first zoological studies began to be carried out here, during which it was found that up to 150 species of birds inhabit local water bodies during the periods of spring and autumn spans.  Since 1979, ponds have found their name - ‚ÄúBird Harbor‚Äù. </p><h2>  Omsk fortress </h2><p>  Now the fortress is an interesting and beautiful place in Omsk.  It was with her that the history of the whole city began once.  For a long time, the intersection of two rivers - the Irtysh and Omi, was desolate.  And only in 2009-2011 the site was ennobled and turned into a popular holiday destination.  Unfortunately, so far only part of the buildings has been restored: the Irtysh, Tarsk, Omsk and Tobolsk gates and the building of the Money Pantry.  Within the walls of one gate, a museum was organized in which you can learn about how ordinary guards lived, what their service was.  Other objects of the historical complex are gradually being restored: kitchen, arsenal, barracks, engineering workshop.  In the renovated premises it is planned to place several museums and a center for Slavic culture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.admomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Omsk fortress" class="if uuid-2596818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596818.jpg"></div><p>  The first Omsk fortress consisted of only a few redoubts built in 1716.  A few years later, the foundation was laid on the steep coast of the river.  The walls were erected mainly from stones and clay, since it is difficult to find good wood in the region.  By the middle of the eighteenth century, the fortress was hopelessly outdated.  On its territory lived exiles, Cossacks and the military.  By the decision of the new commander of the district in the 60s of the eighteenth century, a new fortress was built on the opposite side of the river. </p><h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  Despite the impressive number of historical and cultural attractions of the city, the nature of the region is a real pride.  There are a lot of beautiful places in Omsk and nearby.  On the natural expanses of the region there are several climatic zones - forest-steppe, taiga and steppe, which are inhabited by lynxes, foxes, brown bears and other representatives of the animal world.  A huge variety of flora and fauna has led to the appearance in the region of a large number of parks and squares.  In addition, more than twenty reserves have been created that attract lovers of fishing and hunting. </p><p>  Of the archaeological sites of interest is Peipsi Mountain.  On it was discovered an ancient parking lot, ceramics and human remains.  Historians date the finds to different periods of the Iron Age. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://rulandinfo.ru/tours/214/1271/" data-original="rulandinfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Peipsi Mountain" class="if uuid-2596821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596821.jpg"></div><p>  Among the beautiful places of Omsk and the region it is worth highlighting Ebeyty.  It is the largest salt lake in the region.  It is known for healing mud.  But the shore of Dravert is of interest from the point of view of geological tourism.  You can also see the Devil's finger - a rock that resembles a fist with an index finger. </p><h2>  What to see in Omsk in 1 day? </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to Omsk, but you can only allocate one day to explore the city, you should pay attention to the most important sights, or at least some of them.  The following objects can be included in the list: Irtyshskaya Embankment, River Station, Solar Circle Rotary Park, Lublin Prospect, Cathedral Square, Chokan Valikhanov Street, Omsk Fortress, Pervomaisky Square, Lenin Street. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.2do2go.ru/places/32873/statuya-lyuba" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Statue on Lublin Avenue" class="if uuid-2596832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2596832.jpg"></div><p>  This is only a small list of beautiful places in Omsk.  The one-day visit route can be supplemented or replaced with other objects at your discretion.  We only provide an indicative list.  Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt be able to see all the sights even in one trip, and not just in one day, because there are a lot of them. </p><p>  If you come to the city with children, then you should pay attention to Rotary Park - a new facility in the city.  Its main feature is that it is equipped with a playground not only for ordinary children, but also for children with disabilities.  The special design of the attractions allows absolutely everyone to have fun here.  The site is equipped in the center of the square, decorated with sculptures and flower beds. </p><p>  We hope that our list of attractions in Omsk will allow you to choose the most interesting places to visit. </p>
