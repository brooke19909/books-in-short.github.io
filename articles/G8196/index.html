From the previous generations of the 300 and 303 series, the gadget is completely touch-sensitive, that is, there is not even a hint of a specific Touch and Type. </p><p>  The device is manufactured in India and under the strict supervision of the OTK brand specialists.  Of course, the characteristics of Nokia Asha 311 do not allow it to compete with new smartphones, but it finds its consumer.  The latter, as a rule, looks undemanding to performance by a user who needs an apparatus for making calls and listening to radio / music. </p><p>  So, the subject of today's review is the Nokia Asha 311 smartphone. Consider the characteristics of the gadget, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the desirability of the purchase.  We take into account the opinions of experts in this field and the reviews of ordinary phone users. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Nokia Asha 311 comes in a nice box of blue with a bright design.  On the front side, you can see the image of the phone itself in two ways, and on the back there is a brief specification for the device, as well as information about the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spaces.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="delivery set nokia asha" class="if uuid-2449653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449653.jpg"></div><p>  The interior is organized quite intelligently, so the accessories do not "swear" with each other and do not fall out of the grooves.  The packaging itself is made of dense and high-quality cardboard, and after unpacking it is even a pity to throw it away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inside you will see: </p><ul><li>  Nokia Asha 311 device itself; </li><li>  proprietary charger AC-11; </li><li>  BL-4U class battery </li><li>  Headphones WH-102; </li><li>  2GB external SD drive (MU-37) </li><li>  micro USB cable; </li><li>  the documentation. </li></ul><p>  The package bundle can be called standard, and there is nothing superfluous, like covers or a stylus, in it.  You can use the phone ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù, so there will be no problems getting started.  Judging by the user reviews of the Nokia Asha 311, it is advisable to immediately replace the memory card that comes with it with a more capacious one.  Better if it will be at least 8 GB.  Otherwise, it will not work to organize a normal collection of music with tracks at high bitrate. </p><p>  There are no questions to all other accessories: the charge is high-quality, the battery is the same branded, and the cable in no way looks like a Chinese fake.  Headphones seem to be good, but again, picky music lovers should find an interesting option. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  At first glances it may seem that the phone is massive and heavy.  In fact, Nokia Asha 311 is a compact and very light candy bar.  And despite its size, the phone fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newcellphoneprices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Asha sizes" class="if uuid-2449654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449654.jpg"></div><p>  The case is made entirely of plastic, stylized as metal.  This is a good solution for a budget gadget, but the surface of the device is like a magnet for fingerprints and dust with dirt.  In this case, a matte finish would clearly not be superfluous.  Users in their reviews unanimously advise immediately to purchase at least some little case, otherwise after a week of intensive use the case will not be recognized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device comes in four basic colors: blue, red, gray and sand.  Gray and blue look more solid and suitable for conservatives, and the rest - for an amateur.  The shade in no way affects the cost. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  On the front part you can see the earpiece, brand logo, light sensor, microphone, as well as two mechanical keys (call and end).  On the left side is a hole for the cord, and on the right is the power key and volume rocker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="appearance of Nokia Asha" class="if uuid-2449657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449657.jpg"></div><p>  At the top there is a mini-USB interface for synchronization with a PC, and a little 2 mm away the connector and the usual 3.5 mm ‚Äúmini-jack‚Äù for a headset.  Behind is the main speaker, another brand logo and camera eye.  Judging by user reviews, the latter looks somehow hypertrophied and completely breaks down the overall style of the phone. </p><p>  Under the cover there are slots for an external drive and for a mobile operator‚Äôs card.  They are covered by a battery, so there can be no talk of a "hot" replacement.  The cover can be easily removed, but you should not get carried away with frequent card changes, because the grooves can become loose, and it will simply fly off by itself. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The gadget received a small 3-inch screen on a simple matrix with a resolution of 400 by 240 pixels.  The density of the latter is 155 ppi, so pixelation can be seen even with the naked eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.licensetoquill.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Asha screen" class="if uuid-2449655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449655.jpg"></div><p>  The matrix calmly gives out 65 thousand colors, but all of them become useless even with a small change in the viewing angle.  So the device is completely ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and you won‚Äôt succeed in watching a photo or video in the company of a like-minded person - you will have to constantly twist the device. </p><p>  The screen itself is protected by venerable glass Gorilla Glass.  Here we have the simplest version, so it‚Äôs not worth it to rush to the worst with the phone.  Glass can break when it hits the asphalt, as well as get scratched.  From the usual everyday troubles, such as keys in pockets or falling onto a wooden floor, protection saves, but no more. </p><h2>  Platform </h2><p>  The phone runs on the proprietary Nokia platform - Series 40 Developer 2.0.  The operating system interface is very similar to a similar solution in iPhones of earlier versions.  Users in their reviews note the intuitive controls and menu branches, which even a person who has never previously worked on the Nokia OS will understand. </p><p>  The interface itself functions smoothly, without delays and brakes, and regular applications for Nokia Asha 311 open very quickly.  Although some users complain about a slightly clumsy electronic keyboard, you can quickly get used to it or install some other version both from the manufacturer‚Äôs official website and from amateur forums. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Of course, you can‚Äôt count on serious 3D games.  The only game programs for Nokia Asha 311 that go without any problems are arcade games such as ‚Äúthree in a row‚Äù, ‚ÄúBirds‚Äù, ‚ÄúWorms‚Äù, etc.  Everything else will either slow down or not start at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgetian.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia Asha performance" class="if uuid-2449659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449659.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above - this is mostly a <span>music phone,</span> and the audio component is well implemented here: a normal player, an excellent radio and a sensible gallery for tracks. </p><h2>  Standalone time </h2><p>  The device received a mediocre 1110 mAh battery.  But despite such a modest amount, the battery life of the gadget is quite acceptable.  Here the undemanding "filling" and the same screen affected. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims 744 hours of battery life in standby mode, which, in fact, no one needs, and 6 hours of continuous talking.  If you properly load the gadget with videos or toys, then the battery lasts quietly for five hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cctbvi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interfaces Nokia Asha" class="if uuid-2449656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2449656.jpg"></div><p>  Listening to music, talking and SMS will discharge the battery of the day in two or three.  So this is a very good indicator, if you compare this model with the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù brother, which by the end of the day asks for a power outlet. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  This model is suitable for those who need a quality smartphone at a more affordable cost.  But the word ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù is not key here, because the capabilities of the device are very modest and it can not boast of either good performance or decent visualization. </p><p>  By and large - this is a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù with a large and convenient screen, as well as very good musical capabilities.  If you look at the ultra-budget segment of smartphones, we will see mediocre ‚ÄúAlcatel‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlies‚Äù and other similar devices, where all modern solutions are implemented just for show and work with terrible brakes. </p><p>  In our case, we have a high-quality budget phone from a renowned manufacturer with no claims on performance and advanced "chips."  But everything that is in it works as it should, and there is no need to talk about any ticks. </p>
