  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 5 Ways to Hem Jeans</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Given the existing standards of modern fashion, most people face the problem of length when buying new trousers.  Most often you need to <span>shorten jeans</span> by 5-10 centimeters.  You can, of course, just tuck them in or out to the required length, but this method is unreliable - the fabric can unfold, and, in addition, has an unaesthetic appearance.  In addition, if jeans are only 3-4 centimeters long, such a trick is acceptable, but in a situation where the difference between the real length and the desired exceeds 7-8 centimeters, you need to look for other options.  The easiest way out of this situation is to contact a clothing repair studio where you can correct any problematic item of clothing qualitatively and in a short time.  However, sometimes for a number of reasons this is not possible.  Then the question arises of how to hem jeans. </p><p>  The easiest option is to carefully measure the required length, mark it on the fabric (with a pencil or remnant), add an allowance for the seam.  Then, the excess part must be carefully cut, the edge twisted twice, carefully ironed with steaming so that it does not unfold, and stitch.  As a result, we get jeans of the required length with a smooth, neat edge. </p><p>  Problems arise in cases when it is necessary not only to hem the jeans, but we have a model with a decorative edge, whether it is abrasions, decorating a seam, braid or any other elements.  Let's <span>look</span> at a way to <span>hem jeans</span> with a decorative edge, saving it.  The most difficult thing in this situation is to correctly calculate the length.  Your task is to hem jeans, keeping the edge.  To do this, measure the required length, taking into account the edge, then cut off a part of the fabric a little higher than it, leaving a couple of centimeters for the seam.  The finishing seam that remains on the decorative edge should be flared.  When everything is ready, it remains only to stitch in advance the prepared part for the trousers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, sometimes there are jeans that have not only a decorative edge, but also a vertical decor running along the legs.  In this case, it is necessary not only to cut and sew the lower edge again, but also to connect the side pattern.  This is somewhat more complicated, but, nevertheless, also quite possible.  To do this, repeat all the steps described above, applying a cut bottom, navigate along the side seam, correctly connecting the pattern. </p><p>  If you wish, by hemming jeans, you yourself can give them individuality and create an original design, for example, having swept a previously shortened bottom with an overlock on a sewing machine, sewed decorative braid or applied one of the many techniques of artistic embroidery. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, there is a "male" or "lazy" way of how to hem jeans.  But it has a number of drawbacks, among which the inability to preserve the decorative edge, difficulties in washing (a shortened edge can unfold).  Actually, you don‚Äôt need to sew here at all!  All that is needed is jeans, scissors, an iron and ... Moment glue.  So, first we measure the necessary length, then traditionally add 2, and preferably 3 centimeters, and cut off the edge.  Tuck and iron it.  Then carefully apply a layer of glue on the inner surface, let it dry according to the instructions and firmly press it.  Repeat the same with the second turn.  After the glue dries, the edge will need to be ironed again with a hot iron, but without a steamer. </p><p>  Another way to hem jeans (for the lazy).  There is no need to sew again!  To do this, you only need an iron and a special adhesive tape, which you can buy in shops where accessories are sold.  This tape must be laid between the cut and the gateway and ironed with a hot iron.  And the pants are ready! </p>
