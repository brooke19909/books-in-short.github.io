    <h2>  How to choose the color of children's pajamas? </h2><p>  There is no shortage of fabrics on store shelves today.  However, remember that design pajamas need to be taken seriously.  For example, many mothers want to sew son pajamas in the form of a superhero costume. </p><p>  However, it will be extremely difficult to put the baby to sleep in such pajamas, because children are so easily addicted.  And then try to convince that you dressed him with Spider-man so that he went to bed, and did not go to perform feats. </p><p>  This wardrobe item with vivid pictures will produce approximately the same effect.  The kid will want to see his brother, sister, grandmother, aunt, uncle in him, but just going to bed in him is so boring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is better to give preference to fabric with soft pictures or even monophonic.  This item is especially important for children who suffer from sleep disturbance. </p><h2>  Pajamas style </h2><p>  The pattern of children's pajamas for boys is presented, as a rule, in the form of a free-cut jacket and the same pants.  For younger children, you can also sew a jumpsuit.  The main rule - it is better to make pajamas a little more: nothing should hamper the movements in a dream. </p><p>  The pattern of children's <span>pajamas for the girl</span> is represented by a wider assortment.  The most classic version is close to the male, that is, wide pants and a wide shirt.  An analogue of a more modern one is narrow pants that resemble men's pants with an elastic band on the ankle.  The summer version may consist of short shorts and a shoulder strap. </p>
