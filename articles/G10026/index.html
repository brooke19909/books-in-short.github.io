It owes its origin, like most Ural bodies of water, to a tectonic shift.  The lake is small, its area totals a little more than 1.5 thousand hectares.  Oz.  Kaldy has an elongated shape: length - about 6 kilometers, width - more than 4. The water in the lake is fresh, with a slight salty aftertaste.  The pond is quite transparent - visibility up to 3 meters.  The average depth is 3 m, the maximum is 7. The bottom of Kalda, like its shores, is mostly sandy.  In places, reeds grow, and the bottom is covered with silt.  The user of the lake is the Balyk fish factory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaldy Lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13098/470061.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kaldy is located 54 kilometers from Chelyabinsk, in the Kunashak district.  This forest-steppe zone of the South Ural region.  “Kaldy” in translation from the Bashkir language means “abandoned place”.  Tradition has it that the Bala-Katai tribe lived here, which was supplanted by other nationalities.  Leaving the lake, they left him that name. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities </h2><p>  Kaldy - the lake is open, only on the south-west side the coast is covered with forest.  There are numerous recreation centers of various amenities: “Russian Island”, “Azimut”, “Kaldy”, “Quinta”, “Lightning”, “Silver Key” and “Country of Lakes”.  Mostly relaxing on Lake Kaldy is possible in wooden houses and cottages.  Each recreation center has its own equipped beach and barbecue area.  More comfortable facilities offer other amenities, such as a swimming pool, a bathhouse, a shop, a cafe, boat and catamaran rental, sports grounds, dance floors and playgrounds.  The territories of recreation facilities are fenced and guarded.  Almost all institutions allow you to bring pets with you.  The price range is very wide, including depending on the season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Fish factory "Balyk" </h2><p>  Fishing, as a rule, is carried out on a specially allocated territory of the lake tenant - the Balyk fish factory.  It is through the efforts of the enterprise on Kaldy that fishermen are always provided with a good catch.  Every year, the company carries out stocking of the lake.  In 2007, 100 thousand year-old carps, 13 million fry of cigaripus, 20 thousand pike fry and 2 million burbot fry were released.  The fish took root.  On Kaldy you can catch carp - up to 10 kilograms, pike - up to three and cigaripus - up to kilogram.  In 2008, thousands of trout fry were released into Kaldy Lake (Chelyabinsk Region).  Unfortunately, this species did not take root in the pond.  Every summer, the Balyk fish factory produces fry and young fish.  In addition to the above species, crucian carp, chebak, tench and cheese are now found here.  There are many cancers in Kaldy. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Kaldy - the lake is mostly quiet, only occasionally there is a storm and waves up to 1 meter high.  Fishing here is excellent both from the shore and by boat, with the only difference that you can catch larger fish at a depth.  You can fish all year round - there is no break for spawning.  Summer fishing begins as soon as the ice melts.  A ticket costs 300 rubles per person per day.  The catch is not limited.  You can purchase a document on the beaches, recreation centers and in settlements on the shore (Sary, Big Taskino and Suleymanovo).  There are benefits for children under 14 years of age, disabled people of the 1st and 2nd groups, Chernobyl victims and people over 70 years old.  Participants in hostilities can fish for free if you have a document.  Underwater hunting is in great demand in the reservoir, since Kaldy is a lake with clean water.  Various championships and competitions are often held here.  In summer - for carp, in winter - for whitefish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Kaldy Lake (Chelyabinsk Region) is located between Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk along <span>the M5 highway.</span>  It is very close to the highway - just 800 meters.  If you go in the direction of Yekaterinburg, then after 50 kilometers from the traffic police post on the border of the regional center, on the right side you need to turn to the village of Big Taskino, which is located directly on the banks of the Kaldy.  If there is a desire to fish or relax on the opposite side, then you don’t need to turn to the village, and drive another 3 kilometers to the Kunashak junction, turn right at the sign and you will find yourself where you wanted to.  If you get from Yekaterinburg (140 kilometers) - all the same landmarks, only with the amendment "to the left." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the kalda lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13098/470058.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in the lap of nature </h2><p>  Beautiful and picturesque Kaldy Lake!  Photos completely convey the charm of this reservoir.  The forest around the lake is mainly birch, there are a lot of berries and mushrooms.  The western coast of the reservoir has been mastered to the maximum by the “savages”; in season, a real tent city grows here.  If you go just to sunbathe, then on the south coast there are well-maintained paid beaches.  You can also put up tents there.  You won’t have problems with the products: you can buy everything in the shops of the settlements, and purchase fresh fish at the fish factory or from fishermen.  But you will have to take care of the wood yourself, because there are many who want to.  The water in the lake heats quickly and remains warm for a week longer than in other local lakes.  If you are caught in heavy rains, which is not uncommon in the Southern Urals, you can try your luck and rent rooms at recreation centers. </p>
