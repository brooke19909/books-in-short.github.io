Marshal <span>Leonid Alexandrovich Govorov</span> is one of the main figures in the Great Patriotic War.  He participated in the battles during the defense of Moscow and Leningrad, for which he received many medals of the highest degree.  His skill as commander in chief is recognized not only in Russia, but also far beyond its borders. </p><h2>  The childhood and youth of Marshal Govorov </h2><p>  Leonid Alexandrovich was born on February 10, 1897.  His homeland is the famous village of Butyrka, which was located in the Yaran district of the Vyatka province.  His parents were simple peasants - his father worked as a hoover, and his mother was a housewife.  The family of Marshal Govorov had four children, the eldest of whom was Leonid Alexandrovich himself. </p><p>  After graduating from a rural school, he was sent to study at a school, which Govorov graduated with honors.  For incredible success in obtaining education, he was recommended to the Petrograd Polytechnic Institute.  At the age of 20 he was mobilized in the army, where he received the rank of junior officer. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Govorov" class="if uuid-2896637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91865/2896637.jpg"></div><p>  Six months after the demobilization, Leonid Alexandrovich Govorov was again drafted into the army.  Having become a second lieutenant, he took part in the battles against the Red Army.  By November 1919, he decided to desert from the imperial military forces and join the Soviet leadership.  By the end of December, Leonid Aleksandrovich became a member of the 51st division, which was led by Vasily Konstantinovich Blucher. </p><h2>  The period of the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  From the first days, the future Marshal Govorov participated in clashes with the German army on the Western Front.  There he served as head of artillery.  He was one of the strategists in the defense, participated in the Yelninsk offensive operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gorod.tomsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Govorov during the defense of Leningrad" class="if uuid-2896635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/91865/2896635.jpg"></div><p>  Throughout the war he conducted many successful defensive and counterattack operations.  In 1945 he received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  After the war he became a member of the CPSU, where he worked until his death.  In 1955, he learned about heart disease.
