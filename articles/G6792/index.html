This is due to politics.  Only how to talk if you have no idea where Alaska is located on the world map?  Let's figure it out.  Just say that it is not difficult to search.  You just need to understand which card is in front of you.  If geographic - then the guidelines and clues are one, if administrative - territorial - others.  So, all the details are below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is on the world map alaska" class="if" height="408" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/400947.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Geographic map </h2><p>  When you see a banner on which continents and oceans are applied with conventional signs, look for North America.  At the very extreme end of this continent, there is an answer to the question of where Alaska is located on the world map.  This is a peninsula washed by the waters of the Arctic and <span>Pacific Oceans.</span>  If you have not found it, then look where the <span>North Pole is.</span>  There below, closer to <span>North America,</span> and you will find what you are looking for.  I must say that about where the Alaska Peninsula is located, people in Russia learned back in the eighteenth century.  A huge expedition for those times was sent there to develop new territory.  The mission was quite successful, especially since no one except the Russians was interested in this area due to the cold climate.  Then everything changed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is gulf alaska" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/399942.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Administrative territorial affiliation </h2><p>  If you are asked to show where Alaska is located on the world map by slipping a banner divided into states, then the situation is simpler.  Search for the USA.  This peninsula is one of their states.  It is separated from all the rest by Canada.  However, incorporated into the United States.  But it happened because of a historical incident.  The fact is that initially the territory was developed by the Russian Empire.  However, it had to be inhabited, protected, which required large funds.  The empire itself was rather big in territory.  The management decided that the additional land "will not pull."  Alaska was sold to the United States.  It so happened that this fertile land withdrew from Russia under another protectorate. </p><h2>  What is known for the peninsula </h2><p>  The first glory brought him gold.  In those days, everyone hungry for gratuitous enrichment was looking for where Alaska is located on the world map.  People wishing to fill their pockets with shiny metal began to flock to the peninsula.  The boom quickly ended, since the conditions of the Arctic did not allow to extract a significant amount of gold without labor and costs.  Now the peninsula is gaining popularity as the land of untouched nature and extreme relaxation.  People come here to completely abandon civilization, to enjoy pristine landscapes.  National parks are arranged here, where tourists are specially brought to enjoy the flora and fauna.  Locals love to boast about their streams, rivers and lakes, which fancifully meander and cut through the entire surrounding land.  This is a very beautiful, but most importantly - pristine clean area.  There is virtually no industry in Alaska.  Part of the territory is included in the international reserve of the biosphere.  That is, it is there that species are preserved that disappear throughout the rest of the planet under the ‚Äúblows‚Äù of civilization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the peninsula alaska" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15236/399950.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Alaska Bay located? </h2><p>  Remember that the Pacific Ocean is located near the peninsula.  Its part, washing Alaska, is the bay of the same name.  This is a fairly large water formation.  Its width at the entrance (on the border with the ocean) is more than two thousand kilometers.  It is interesting by the tides.  In some places, the water rises to a mark of twelve meters.  Despite this, there are many ports on the shores of the bay.  Here fishing vessels, research and other ships moor.  The basis of the coastal industry is the extraction and processing of marine animals.  The largest ports are Seward (USA) and Prince Rupert (Canada). </p>
