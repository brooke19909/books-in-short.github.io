Of course, it‚Äôs easier for an amateur to get a universal model that is suitable for both everyday shooting and traveling.  One of the best options is the Canon 18-200 EF-S.  In addition, it is quite common, can be found in almost any store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lens Kenon 18,200" class="if uuid-2372686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/2372686.jpg"></div><p>  But this subject, however, like any lens, has both advantages and disadvantages.  Let's look at the positive, neutral, and negative aspects.  Then, towards the end of the article, you will learn some recommendations. </p><h2>  Who is the lens for? </h2><p>  The Canon 18-200 lens is designed for universal shooting, that is, it can be used in various fields: </p><ul><li>  travels, excursions; </li><li>  holidays and banquets; </li><li>  portrait shooting; </li><li>  "Photohunting" (shooting animals, birds, vehicles); </li><li>  reportage and so on. </li></ul><p>  We can say that this lens is suitable for almost everyone who wants to get high-quality pictures not only for memory, but also for media, websites, presentations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon 18,200 lens on the camera" class="if uuid-2372753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/2372753.jpg"></div><p>  The model referred to here has a ‚Äúzoom‚Äù, which means ‚Äúshooting at a wide range of focal lengths‚Äù.  This means that thanks to this lens, the camera can enlarge or reduce the image.  The photographer does not need to approach the object or move away from it in order to fully capture the frame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advantages of the model </h2><p>  It is worth getting to know the Canon 18-200.  Reviews about him are mostly positive.  Indeed, the lens has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  <span>fast shooting</span> ; </li><li>  the images are clear; </li><li>  You can adjust the sharpness manually or automatically; </li><li>  There is a wide range of focal lengths; </li><li>  any shooting genre is possible. </li></ul><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the quality of photographs does not fail.  But for each of us, the result is important.  Therefore, a beginner can safely purchase this particular option. </p><p>  As for the price, it is inferior in price to other universal models.  Therefore, this lens belongs to the budget options. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of technology </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the image quality is quite good, the price is adequate, there are some disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.streetphotographyprojects.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shooting at night on a camera with a Kenon lens" class="if uuid-2372773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/2372773.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs better to take them into account so that you don‚Äôt have to regret buying a Canon 18-200.  In principle, the comments are not critical, but can ruin the general impression for some amateur photographers: </p><ol><li>  When shooting, the ‚Äútrunk‚Äù of the lens often leaves, especially when shooting at medium focal lengths.  At 18 mm and 200 mm, the lens is well fixed. </li><li>  Chromatic aberration may occur in some shooting modes, which reduces the quality of the pictures.  In this case, a similar flaw has to be corrected in Photoshop. </li><li>  At extreme focal lengths, the image is blurred, noise appears and sharpness decreases.  Users note that focal lengths of 18-25 mm and 150-200 mm are useless, they can be considered inoperative. </li><li>  For macro photography, the lens is not suitable, since at a distance closer than 45 cm, it makes no sense to photograph an object. </li><li>  The Canon 18-200 lens, unfortunately, is capable of clogging dust from within for a short time of use. </li><li>  The model weighs 600 g and the lens diameter is 72 mm.  Of course, not everyone will like this size and weight. </li></ol><p>  Those who care about the quality of the images usually do not get in the way of such flaws. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Neutral side </h2><p>  As you know, any product can have both advantages and disadvantages.  But there are also neutral reviews.  The Canon 18-200 lens has the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  Normal aperture f / 3.5-5.6.  This means that shooting is recommended in the daytime, in a room with good lighting.  With proper camera settings, you can get good pictures at dusk. </li><li>  The quality of the images themselves is quite excellent, but on the condition that the photographer is good at this skill.  It is advisable to install a tripod under certain conditions (for example, in poor lighting conditions). </li><li>  The price of the model is average compared to peers.  But it‚Äôs better to take a ‚Äúnative‚Äù lens to the camera. </li></ol><p>  As you know, nothing is perfect.  Therefore, you can safely get a model that will replace several "narrow-profile" lenses at once. </p><h2>  Recommendations for beginners </h2><p>  When buying a SLR camera, do not rush to immediately buy individual lenses for specific cases.  The fact is that for equipment you will have to buy a large roomy backpack, and the weight of all equipment will be quite large.  In addition, total cash costs will be colossal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cosplayphotographers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="universal lens selection" class="if uuid-2372766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/2372766.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to purchase a Canon 18-200 lens and a couple of others that will completely replace it, for example, telephoto and macro.  Remember that excellent camera skills guarantee excellent image quality with any lens. </p>
