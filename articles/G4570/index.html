For both beach and sightseeing.  Athens is especially popular in this regard.  There is something to see for lovers of ancient history.  But rest here is expensive.  Local beaches are also far from perfect conditions, so tourists have to travel to the countryside.  Those who are mainly interested in the sea with all its pleasures, choose a vacation on the <span>islands of Greece.</span>  And having received a lot of positive emotions, they return there again and again. </p><h2>  Why do tourists choose to relax islands </h2>

    <p>  Many vacationers, going to rest in the country of Hellas, try to find <br>  beaches as comfortable as possible and with sand.  They want to have good coverage not only on land but also in water.  Most Greek resorts offer a high-quality vacation on the excellent beaches, which are very well equipped and located near the hotels.  But the best of them are on the islands of the country.  Why?  The main reason is that there are no port zones and industrial enterprises at a sufficient distance from the resort areas.  That is, these places are characterized by safe ecology.  Also, island coasts are washed by crystal clear sea waters.  With all this, the infrastructure of such resorts is well developed.  For information: more than 400 beaches of the country are marked by various high world awards.  Therefore, we offer you a vacation on the islands of Greece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When is the best island holiday season in Greece? </h2>

    <p>  Weather in Greece does not allow you to relax in the country on the beaches all year round.  The climate here is Mediterranean, which means hot and dry summers and cool winters.  There is little rainfall, the sun shines more than 300 days a year.  The beach season mainly begins in early May and ends in mid-autumn.  But since the territory of the country is quite large, the duration of the season is different in different places: </p><ol><li>  A little warmer on the islands of Crete, Kos, Corfu and Paros.  The climate here is softer than in other regions. </li><li>  The south of the country is available for swimming already in April. </li><li>  In the resorts of the north (Sithonia, Calicratia), the season begins later. </li></ol><p>  We can conclude that the best time for the most comfortable and quality vacation is June and September.  Favorable prices in March and April. </p><h2>  The best islands of Greece for holidays </h2>
