How to get to the beach?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Most tourists traveling to Sochi care only about the sun and the sea.  That is why the question of choosing a coast worthy for relaxation always remains relevant.  Indeed, in Sochi there are many places where entry into the water is covered with large pebbles, or even just stones, which is fraught with injuries, especially when the sea is rough.  The best Sochi beaches (if we talk about the Central district of the city) are located at the elite five-star hotels and resorts of the first strip.  This is the "Arctic", "Russia", "Rainbow," October ", named after F. Dzerzhinsky.  But entrance to them for strangers is carried out for a fee.  What is advised to do reviews of experienced vacationers?  Riviera is the beach of the Central <span>District of Sochi,</span> where entry is free for everyone.  About it will be discussed in our article.  How to get to this beach and how to relax on it, read below.  Our article takes into account the reviews of vacationers, including recent ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera beach" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1003424.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  What is the advantage of Riviera beach? </h2><p>  Sochi resort stretches along the sea for a hundred and fifty kilometers!  But, alas, out of one hundred thirty-one beaches, one hundred and one belong to various resorts, boarding houses, recreation centers and hotels.  The remaining thirty are free.  What awaits vacationers on these public beaches?  The proximity of the mountains determines that the coast is pebbled here.  The diameter of these pebbles can range from ten millimeters to five centimeters.  As for coverage, Riviera is the most comfortable beach.  Pebbles here are as small as sand.  Other beaches are small, sandwiched between the capes and representing a narrow strip of the coast.  At the peak of the season, which falls in July and August, there is nowhere for the apple to fall.  And the width of the "Riviera" reaches fifty meters with a length of 300 m. So it is spacious here and at the peak of the season.  Even if you are lucky enough to find a deserted beach (usually within Greater Sochi), the infrastructure on it leaves much to be desired.  The Riviera has everything you need for a comfortable stay: changing rooms, showers, wooden flooring, rescue service, several cafes and even a ramp for the disabled. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Riviera Beach: address </h2><p>  This coast is heard by all vacationers.  "Riviera" and "Svetlana" share the palm in attendance in the resort of Sochi.  Not far from the first beach is a beautiful amusement park.  It is also called the "Riviera".  The beach is separated from the park by some two hundred meters.  Nearby is the hotel "Star".  This hotel has its own modern beach complex.  In addition to water attractions, there are simulators, a football field and volleyball courts.  On the approach to the shore you will find souvenir stalls, toilets, a first-aid post, a shooting gallery, kiosks with beach accessories.  In addition to showers, faucets are installed so that sand and small pebbles can be washed off the feet.  Vacationers are placed under thatched umbrellas on rented sunbeds. </p><h2>  Riviera beach: how to get there? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to get to the eponymous park.  This is easy to do, because before this oasis of greenery with attractions and a dolphinarium, there are many fixed-route taxis and city buses.  Next, you need to go through the entire park and get to its southern gate.  Now, according to the reviews, you have two options.  The first is to go further, pass the monument ‚ÄúFeat in the Name of Life‚Äù and, having descended along the Riviera Lane, find yourself at the sign of the beach.  The second option is to turn towards the water area and walk along the corridor formed by two rows of cafes and restaurants.  Both roads are equally smooth, without steep descents, only the Riviera beach itself has several steps.  Passing the park with the child, be prepared to fork out for several attractions.  Yes, and on the beach there are also many of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera beach photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1003438.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews of vacationers with children </h2><p>  Sochi coast is quite difficult for young tourists.  On most beaches, the depth begins already after one and a half meters from the coast.  The bottom is full of stones, pits and pebbles.  Riviera is a beach ideal for small legs.  It is all lined with sand.  Pebbles, and even small ones, are present only at the very edge of the water.  To prevent the baby from being burnt, there are umbrellas throughout the rest of the recreation area, casting a shallow, openwork shadow.  But the most important thing is that the entry into the sea is gentle here, and the depth dangerous for young children begins five meters from the coast.  But, as the reviews warn, although lifeguards are on duty at the beach, parents should not relax either.  Behind a child on the water you need an eye and an eye.  In 2010, the beach ennobled.  Reviews say that now it meets all European standards for families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera beach address" class="if" height="469" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1003404.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Daytime activities </h2><p>  Much attention is paid to health promotion on this beach.  In the summer months, yoga classes are held daily from eight to nine in the morning.  Anyone of any age and physical fitness can take part.  Classes are held absolutely free.  The beach "Riviera", a photo of which you can see in the article, has an aerarium.  It is located on the second floor of the pier, under an awning.  Aerarium equipped with sunbeds.  Sports enthusiasts can play <span>beach volleyball.</span>  Not far from the shore there is an inflatable raft on which swimmers can relax.  And of course, like everywhere else in Sochi, on the Riviera many traditional water activities are available: bananas, cheesecakes, scooters, skis and others.  Hungry?  Satisfy the hunger on the "Riviera" is not a problem.  Nearby there is a budget dining room and many cafes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Riviera beach how to get" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1003449.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Evening entertainment </h2><p>  With the onset of darkness, life on the Riviera does not freeze.  A southern velvet night descends on the coast, colored with numerous lights.  Almost all restaurants and cafes work.  They sound live music.  People dance at discos.  The sea becomes warmer in the evening than in the afternoon, because the heat subsides and there is no longer such a temperature contrast between water and air.  Beach "Riviera" reviews are called the most advanced in terms of evening relaxation.  Nearby is a park where lovers find shelter on benches.  Amusement rides work.  The park also has tennis courts, and playgrounds for playing in towns and chess.  And the aromas of the rosary spread far beyond the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the riviera beach" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1003446.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  Little visitors to the Riviera will certainly not be bored.  After all, this is the only place in Sochi where you can build sand castles.  And if the parents do not spare money, then jump on a trampoline, somersault inside a balloon on a water surface.  Also on the shore is a swimming pool with a small slide.  This is an attraction for the little ones.  But in the park, where the Riviera beach is located, there is entertainment for more courageous children.  These are attractions such as <span>"Dragon Mountain",</span> "Indiana", "Freefall Tower", "Galaxy" and others.  If the adrenaline rush is unpleasant for you, then you can go to the oceanarium or undergo a dolphin therapy session, swimming in the same pool with cute and smart bottlenose dolphins.  In memory of a wonderful vacation in Sochi, you can take a photo with a monkey, monitor lizard, parrot or python. </p>
