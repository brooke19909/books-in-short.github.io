As stated by representatives of the manufacturer during the presentation, in this device, the developers sacrificed high-quality filling for the sake of mass and budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1320" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device are quite impressive and are 164.2x85.9x9.8 mm in height, width and thickness, respectively.  Due to such a large size, using a smartphone with one hand is almost impossible.  As for its weight, it is equal to 220 grams.  The case of the model is made of matte plastic, which was a pretty good solution for the Nokia Lumia 1320.  The reviews of its owners have become a clear confirmation that the smartphone fits comfortably in the hand and does not slip out of it.  The novelty is available in black, white, yellow and red.  On the rear panel you can see the speaker, flash and lens.  It should be noted that the device is equipped with a battery, which cannot be removed.  The back cover is removable, so the user can change the appearance of his gadget from time to time.  On the front side of the device there are three touch control keys - ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 1320 review" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552060.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The model received a six-inch screen created using IPS technology.  Its maximum resolution is HD, not Full HD, which some Nokia 1320 users would like.  The reviews of many owners and experts, on the other hand, indicate that this is quite enough for watching videos, photos, reading and games.  The use of proprietary technology known as ‚ÄúNokia ClearBlack‚Äù in the device guarantees large viewing angles.  It also provides readability of the text and a decent display of information in direct sunlight directly on the display.  The latest generation of Gorilla Glass protects the Nokia 1320 screen from scratches.  Case for the device will significantly extend its life.  A serious advantage of the phone is the fact that the sensor responds efficiently and quickly even to touched gloves, which is important in the conditions of a domestic cool climate. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The model is equipped with a camera with a resolution of five megapixels.  It was inherited from the Lumia 625 smartphone.  The pictures taken with her help, although they turn out pretty good, however, they cannot boast of outstanding quality.  The Nokia 1320 camera has many settings and applications, using which the owner of the device can independently adjust the shooting parameters.  However, in order not to delve into them particularly, representatives of the manufacturer recommend using automatic mode.  The front camera takes pictures in a resolution of 0.3 megapixels.  According to most experts, it is installed on the phone only ‚Äúfor show‚Äù, because even the average quality of the photo is out of the question here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1320 reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552057.jpg" width="600"></div>

Each of them operates at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  The device has 8 gigabytes of stationary memory.  It should be noted that about a quarter of it is required to meet the needs of the system, and therefore this part of the space is inaccessible to the user.  Be that as it may, the Nokia 1320 provides a slot for installing additional media.  The size of RAM in this model is 1 gigabyte.  The novelty supports almost all types of modern wireless connections.  In general, thanks to such technical equipment, demanding applications are launched and work without too much delay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 1320 case" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552064.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  As already noted above, the model is equipped with a stationary battery.  Its capacity is 3400 mAh.  Given the far from the most advanced characteristics of the device, a full charge lasts about three days in standby mode, for one hour of continuous conversations, or three to four hours of using the Internet.  Even some of the flagship smartphones cannot boast of such an indicator. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The Nokia 1320 has just one speaker.  It is located on the back of the device.  Two small tubercles are provided on the sides of it, which serve to protect the speaker from pollution and salinization.  As with incoming calls, and when listening to music, the sound is smooth and loud.  There are no special complaints about the telephone speaker.  After all, the interlocutor is heard clearly. </p><p>  The music player has exactly the same settings and functions as similar applications from more expensive modifications from this manufacturer.  Due to the fact that the audio capabilities of the device, the developers decided not to cut back, the recorded compositions and radio sound without any distortion, including in the headphones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 1320 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/552059.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  To summarize, the Nokia 1320 model as a whole can be called quite interesting and attractive from a consumer point of view.  Its processor provides a fairly high performance device, so most of the applications, including games, work on it without delay.  The smartphone‚Äôs display, although it doesn‚Äôt work with Full HD resolution, can boast rather large viewing angles, good contrast, brightness and depth.  The manufacturing company managed to create a good device for its price segment.  In this regard, if a potential buyer is looking for a smartphone with a cost not exceeding the mark of four hundred US dollars, he can safely give preference to this particular modification. </p>
