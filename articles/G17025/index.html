Salt Lake, located nearby, is rich in mineral springs and special silt mud, indispensable in the treatment of spinal problems, joints and diseases of the nervous system.  According to experts, their healing effect can not be compared with anything in the world. </p><p>  Ecotourism is unusually popular in these places: in the vicinity for many kilometers lies the taiga, in which many areas still remain undeveloped.  A certain distance separates Ust-Kut from Lake Baikal, Goudzhekit hot springs, Lena pillars, weathered outliers on the Lena River.

The cost of booking is 25% of the cost of daily living in the selected room (or on the spot). </p><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><p>  Hotel "Lena" among visitors is considered the best hotel in Ust-Kut.  Responses of visitors about living here are rather mixed.  Many guests are quite satisfied with the conditions provided at the hotel.  Mostly guests declare their readiness to consider the hotel service acceptable for temporary residence.  But often guests share their dissatisfaction with the amenities offered. </p><h2>  Furnishings and interior decoration </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews note that the institution is located in an old Soviet nine-story building on the square in front of the railway station of the same name.  The furnishings and interior of the hotel, according to residents, resemble the surroundings of old Soviet hotels with very good audibility on the floor.  Guests say that in the mornings, at around 7:30, service staff usually begin cleaning using a vacuum cleaner.  Due to poor soundproofing in the corridors and hotel rooms, morning relaxation of residents becomes impossible.  Even if the vacuum cleaner is silent, guests are disturbed by loud conversations of the maids involved in cleaning. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Guests are offered accommodation in small rooms in which residents have to be content, according to them, with very narrow beds and small sinks in the bathroom.  From the dishes in the rooms are provided: a glass and a key for opening beer, tea, coffee, sugar are absent.  At the stated price there are no one-time toothpaste, brush, comb.  The number of cable channels in the hotel is very limited. </p><h2>  Settlement / Eviction </h2><p>  The computer at the reception gives an electronic key to the room only after payment is made, guests say.  After the payment term has expired, a key is blocked, as a result of which it is impossible to get into the room without subsequent payment.  Checks and receipts are issued only after the delivery of numbers, the authors of reviews note.  For those who are late for a plane or train, this is very inconvenient.  Prices for accommodation, guests call high.  Contrary to advertising claims, breakfast is not included in the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In the hotel restaurant" class="if uuid-2660189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2660189.jpg"></div><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  The fact that food is not included in the price, many guests consider a significant drawback of the hotel.  Those breakfasts that have to be satisfied with the guests, the reviewers call the minimum or even miserable.  Breakfast usually includes one dish (porridge), sometimes it consists of two dishes (porridge and pancakes), less often an omelet is added to them. </p><p>  In the buffet, guests are offered water, beer, juices, as well as food, presented in a very small assortment of dishes.  Food prepared at the student canteen level, guests note, is served in disposable dishes. </p><p>  For those who rely on business trips, the authors of the reviews share, the catering in Ust-Kut is generally quite problematic.  The cost of three meals a day in the city is usually about 800 rubles, and if you have to have dinner after 20:00, you should be prepared for the fact that the most modest dinner will cost the guest about 300 rubles. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Hotel Lena is in significant demand among visitors.  The main reason for this is the lack of competition.  This accommodation option is recommended as one of the best in Ust-Kut. </p>
