  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coin of 20 kopecks of 1982. Characteristics, cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the Olympics of the 80th year, many thematic objects were created, but the coin of 20 kopecks in 1982 is no different.  The circulation was large-scale, therefore this monetary unit was not particularly popular with numismatists.  But over time, its price began to rise, so it is still unknown what will happen in fifteen years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopeks 1982 price" class="if uuid-3164624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3164624.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  A coin of 20 kopecks in 1982 was produced in large quantities by the Leningrad Mint.  There is no exact number of copies.  The material of manufacture is an alloy of zinc, copper and nickel.  This "coin" material is also called nickel silver.  The weight of the currency unit is not more than 3.4 grams (in some materials the figure 3.2 is indicated).  The color of the coin is light gray.  It has no magnetic properties and characteristics. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The lower part of the circle is occupied by figures showing the year of production of the monetary unit, just above the inscription "cents".  The entire upper part is occupied by a figure indicating the face value.  The Twenty is minted in a round font, which began to be used after 1975.  Previously, large numbers of coin denominations were more angular and sharp in appearance. </p><p>  On the edge of the coin 20 kopeks 1982 on the reverse there is an image of a wheat stalk (on both sides).  Each stalk originates from a pair of oak leaves.  Wheat spikelets do not touch each other, do not converge from above, reach only the middle of the number "20". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pogodovka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopeks 1982 photos" class="if uuid-3164618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3164618.jpg"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Almost the entire surface of the coin of 20 kopeks 1982 on the obverse is occupied by the image of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.  These are wheat ears, entwined with ribbons that go around the globe.  Inside the planet is a sickle and a hammer, and just below - half the sun.  Rays emanate from the star, long and straight.  They heat the Earth with their heat. </p><p>  In the center of the composition, where the wheat stalks are practically touching, is a drawing of a five-pointed star.  Its rays are not split, as on many coins of the Stalin era.  The star looks unified, rounded and holistic. </p><p>  Sheaves of wheat wraps around a lush ribbon.  If you count her turns, then there will be fifteen.  Symbol of 15 union republics.  There are seven dressings in total.  The lower band forms the likeness of a small undisclosed bow, completes the composition from below.  The inner spikelets have long spines.  At the very bottom (under the coat of arms) is the abbreviation of the USSR. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  For minting coins of 20 kopecks in 1982, several stamps were used.  Coins always differ in this, and this is what determines their different value at numismatic auctions. </p><p>  So, for the production of 20 cents, 3.1 stamps were used;  3.2;  3.3.  The first option differs in the number of awns on the first (left) spikelet.  There will be five of them.  The image of the coat of arms of the Soviet Union is slightly overestimated (if compared with coinage on other coins of the same denomination, but made using a different stamp). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 20 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3164622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3164622.jpg"></div><p>  The second stamp option can be identified by the three awns on the inner first spikelet of wheat.  If you look closely at the image of the Earth, you can see that there is no Gulf of Guinea.  The coat of arms in this case will be slightly reduced. </p><p>  Coins minted with the 3.3 stamp are very similar to the currency units that were produced in 1979.  The image of the union coat of arms will be located quite low.  And the Gulf of Guinea can very well be seen on the minting of the Earth. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price of 20 kopecks in 1982, which were made by "standard coinage", does not exceed thirty rubles.  More expensive will be the coins that were made using stamps 3.2 and 3.3.  The first will cost from ten to 120 rubles, the cost of the second option varies from one hundred rubles to three hundred. </p><p>  Despite the fact that such coins were regulars of Soviet wallets and many found in piggy banks, there are isolated variants among them that were produced using the 1981 stamp.  The price of such coins reaches 2000 rubles. </p>
