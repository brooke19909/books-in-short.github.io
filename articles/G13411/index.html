It implies the following - to exchange data through a computer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The walkthrough looks like this. </p><p>  The first stage is from an Android device to a PC: </p><ul><li>  on the smartphone enter the “Contacts” application; </li><li>  being in it, open the menu of available functions; </li><li>  select the “Import / Export” tab; </li><li>  the source to install "Phone memory"; </li><li>  start the process of generating a vcf file; </li><li>  after completion, connect the smartphone to the PC via a data cable; </li><li>  transfer the file to the computer. </li></ul><p>  The second stage - from PC to iPhone: </p><ul><li>  connect an "apple" gadget to the computer; </li><li>  open the iTunes application; </li><li>  go to the “Information” tab in it; </li><li>  here will be the line "Synchronize contacts"; </li><li>  clicking on it, a window opens in which you need to select Outlook; </li><li>  Confirm sync </li><li>  After completing the process, be sure to restart the smartphone. </li></ul><h2>  Yandex.Moving </h2><p>  If you have access to the Internet, then you can use the service from Yandex.  How to transfer contacts from android to iPhone in this way?  First enter disk.yandex.ru/pereezd in the address bar of the browser.  In the window that opens, select from the drop-down list the models of those smartphones from which and to which the file will be transferred.  Then log in or if there is no profile in Yandex, then register. </p><p>  The next step will be the installation of the Yandex.Moving application on the android.  Enter it by entering data (password and username).  Start copying information to Yandex.Disk.  After completion, a window will open asking you to enter the code (it is in the "Relocation" program). </p><p>  Now you can transfer directly to the iPhone.  Add an account in the smartphone settings.  Be sure to register a server - carddav.yandex.ru.  Here, specify a description - Yandex contacts, as well as a login with a code.  Then save the "account", enter the "Contacts" application and activate synchronization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nastrojkin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer contacts from android to iPhone" class="if uuid-2345787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2345787.jpg"></div><h2>  Google Contacts Cloud Service </h2><p>  Transferring contacts from android to iPhone is also carried out using the Google Contacts service.  This can be done in two stages: first, transfer the file to the "cloud", and then to the "apple" device. </p><p>  The action algorithm is as follows. </p><p>  The first stage - from android to the "cloud": </p><ul><li>  synchronize with the Google service; </li><li>  go to the "Settings"; </li><li>  find the “Accounts” tab in it; </li><li>  to become active; </li><li>  mark the item “Synchronize contacts” by ticking; </li><li>  start the synchronization process. </li></ul><p>  After completion, you can proceed to the second stage.  It will consist in receiving data from the “cloud” to the iPhone.  On the smartphone, go to the "Posts, addresses, calendars" section.  Click on the link “Add account” here.  The user opens a submenu in which to select "Other".  In order to enter the Google account, you need to select the “CardDAV account for contacts” tab.  Start the process of copying contacts by clicking on "Next". </p><div class="photo" data-original="nastrojkin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transfer contacts from android to iphone 6" class="if uuid-2345786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2345786.jpg"></div><h2>  The most convenient way - through a SIM card </h2><p>  You can transfer contacts from Android to iPhone 6 and other modifications using a SIM card.  This method, unfortunately, has a significant drawback.  Data is not transferred in full.  For example, some information will be missing - the name of the subscriber, email address, photo, work number and so on. </p><p>  However, if this method is suitable for the user, then you will need to do just five completely simple actions: </p><ol><li>  on android enter the address book; </li><li>  select the tab “Export to SIM” in the menu; </li><li>  After that, install the SIM card in the iPhone; </li><li>  in his settings open the item "Mail, contacts ..."; </li><li>  click on the link “Import SIM contacts” here. </li></ol><p>  That's all, now each user will know how to transfer contacts from android to iPhone. </p>
