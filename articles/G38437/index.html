  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Jordan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The pearl of the Arab world can be called a shy - Jordan, which is located between Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.  Among <span>tourists, rest in Jordan is</span> not widely demanded because of its strict rules of behavior, even regarding guests.  This is a Muslim country where ancient customs are honored.  Local women cannot appear on the street with bare hair, arms and legs.  Tourists are also not recommended to appear naked in public places, and women are not allowed to take topless sunbathing at all. </p><p>  Nevertheless, a vacation in Jordan is beautiful and makes it such a clear Dead Sea, white beaches, a huge number of monuments and simply beautiful places, and the high moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof Jordanians provide a safe pastime for families with children.  Observing the simple rules of this people, you can have a great vacation in an amazing corner of the world with ancient history.  Jordan is especially beautiful in the spring, when everything blossoms, and it is buried in bloom.  The holiday season lasts from March to November, but in principle it can be all year round, since the temperature here does not drop below 23 C. The Jordanians are a very hospitable people.  It is common practice for them to invite a stranger they like to dinner.  Moreover, such an invitation is not an optional formality.  If the guest has ignored the owner‚Äôs home dinner, he will be very offended, because he will really be waiting for him along with his whole family and richly laid table.  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Jordan without tasting <span>Arabic cuisine.</span>  She is very sophisticated, the Arabs are very responsible for cooking.  This is a special ritual for them.  Usually, a meze is served for a snack in this country - thin cakes, sweets with syrup, as well as pistachios and other delicacies.  This is a very satisfying snack and it is quite possible to eat it.  The classic main Jordanian dish is Mansaf.  It is made from lamb with rice and yogurt sauce.  Staying hungry in this country is simply impossible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who can‚Äôt imagine their holidays in Jordan without visiting local attractions should visit castles in the desert.  The sandy desert abounds with grottoes, forts, caravanserais.  The Kuysar Amra Castle, built in the 8th century, stands out especially.  It is listed as a UNESCO cultural property.  The castle inside is fully lined with colorful frescoes.  Fort Azraque, which was built during the Roman Empire, also attracts attention.  Its walls are made of black basalt.  The main function of the fort is to protect against external expansion into the country. </p><p>  If a tourist purchased last-minute packages to Jordan, to Amman, then he should visit the Citadel.  This is the oldest building of the <span>Byzantine Empire.</span>  She talks about the times of the emergence of Islam in the world.  In the same city is the most interesting Jordanian Archaeological Museum, which displays exhibits telling about the development of the country until the 15th century.  It is located on the Citadel.  In Amman there is the Roman Amphitheater, the date of creation of which, according to approximate estimates of scientists, dates back <span>to 151</span> BC  For so many years it has undergone changes, but to this day, mass events are held here, because the amphitheater can accommodate up to 6 thousand people at a time.  Regardless of whether the tourist bought last-minute tours to Jordan or not, his vacation can not be considered failed if he has never visited Souk, a local market that has been around for several centuries.  Here you can not only get all kinds of things for every taste, but also get acquainted with the history of the country, its culture.  The souk is indeed an unusual open-air museum.  Jordan differs from other <span>Arab countries by</span> its chastity and lack of a large number of tourists, but this is what attracts it. </p>
