This society of people exists by its own rules and laws.  They are not trying to adapt to the world order; they are creating it.  Changing the world and <span>social relations,</span> this secret organization controls all <span>financial flows</span> and the most important political decisions.  At least, those who think their opinion from the press and television rumors think so.  What this organization represents, what goals it pursues and how it becomes a Freemason, can be found in this article. </p><h2>  History of Freemasonry </h2><p>  The emergence of this secret organization dates from the late Middle Ages.  In those days, guild masters were reluctant to share the secrets of their skill.  One of the most closed societies was the workshop of builders.  They called themselves Masons.  Translated, this word means "masons, builders."  Towards the end of the sixteenth century, professional builders in the ranks of the Masons became less and less, and aristocrats and the big bourgeois came in their place.  From the old guilds they inherited a whole system of secret symbols and signs by which they could identify their fellow organization.  Keeping the secret nature of their society, the Masons tried to support and help each other out. </p><h2>  First masonic lodge </h2><p>  In 1717, the first society of Freemasons officially announced itself, forming a great box in the UK.  The influence and <span>wealth of this</span> organization was very great.  In this regard, many were interested in how they become Masons.  Multiple branches of the organization arose on all continents, penetrating the economic, political and cultural life of society.  Currently, the World Masonic Organization has about 8 million members. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="secrets of masons" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/837171.jpg" width="600"></div>

The main task is to change the world for the better.  This organization does not discriminate on national or racial grounds.  There is no single center for coordination of this movement.  The governing body is the great Masonic lodge, which is located in every major country in the world.  Great lodges recognize each other, as they adhere to general rules and principles, the effect of which has been estimated for centuries.  These rules are called landmarks.  Each great box operating on the basis of landmarks is called regular.  There are also associations of liberal Freemasonry in which the list of goals and priorities differs slightly from generally accepted ones.  Mostly the Masonic lodge is gaining men into its members, but there are also mixed and purely female forms of these organizations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of freemasonry" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/837176.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Principles of the Masonic Movement </h2><p>  The basic principles of this worldwide secret fraternity are set forth in the book of sacred laws, which should be present at every meeting of the fraternity.  Its main points are as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - The great box is the union of all the boxes of the state that share the general rules of the fraternity; </p><p>  - all persons who are interested in how they become freemasons, with the aim of joining this fraternity, must be full age, wealthy, free people of liberal views; </p><p>  - discussion of political and religious issues between members of society is prohibited; </p><p>  - Each member of a secret fraternity should not put the ideas of the Masonic movement above their duties in relation to God, family and the state. </p><h2>  Dedication to the Freemasons </h2><p>  About how they become Masons, many assumptions and evidence of the so-called eyewitnesses have been written.  Those who want to join <span>this fraternity</span> pass several types of tests, each of which is heavier than the previous one.  The full cycle of initiation includes 33 steps, but few reach the heights of brotherhood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Masonic lodge" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/837170.jpg" width="310"></div>  All Masonic rituals and initiations take place in a gloomy and depressing atmosphere.  The dark halls of the lodges are cleaned with black curtains, in the corners are human skeletons, skulls, the walls are painted with symbolic images of the apocalypse and the Last Judgment.  Coffins, incense burners, urns with ashes, bloodstained swords and rusty armor are indispensable attributes of initiation.  A candidate for Freemasons or someone who wants to get another Masonic degree is led to the senior members of the blindfold box.  After a list of questions and a series of tests that should test the physical strength, endurance and strong spirit of the initiate, the elders make their decision. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how do they become freemasons" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/837174.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It follows from all that has been described that the numerous secrets of Masons are typical of <span>religious and social organizations.</span>  The religious character of society is also emphasized by its own ideology, which members of the fraternity should share and spread. </p><p>  The vast majority of Christian movements do not share the principles of the Masonic movement and urge believers not to enter secret societies. </p>
