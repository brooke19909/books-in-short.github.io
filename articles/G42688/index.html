Crochet, patterns for which have become especially popular in recent years, these clothes knit quickly and without much difficulty.  The main thing is to choose the right style and pattern so that they blend perfectly. </p><h2>  Circular bolero </h2><p>  There are several patterns of this clothing.  Recently, many choose crocheted boleros in a circle.  Schemes can be built on the basis of any napkin or tablecloth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero pattern" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968733.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It fits so.  First, a rectangular back is made.  The pattern here can be any.  In the presented diagram it can be seen that these are simple double crochet posts.  But you can make any openwork pattern that only the craftswoman likes. </p><p>  Then, armholes for hands from chains of air loops are attached to the back.  They are not made small, so that in the end a product looks like a square inscribed in a circle. </p><p>  And now the knitting begins in a circle.  The pattern here can be varied.  The proposed model consists of fans.  The number of columns in each row increases slightly so that the canvas becomes flat.  This is a great option for full boleros.  Crocheting, diagrams and descriptions for which we are considering, it fits very well. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bolero tube </h2><p>  There is another constructive model of a crochet bolero, for which any scheme is suitable.  This is a rectangular fabric that is sewn along the edges so that the sleeves are obtained.  At the same time, its middle part remains as a back.  Shelves in such a bolero are practically absent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern bolero in a circle" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968734.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The model proposed in the photo is intended for a doll, but it visually demonstrates the features of this cut.  The pattern here is built on double crochet and air loops.  In the first row we make 1 column, 3 high / low and a column in the same base.  The next column is made through 3 loops of the base.  We continue the rest according to the scheme described above. </p><p>  We do the second row in the same way, but as the basis for the columns with a common point, we already use a chain of air loops of the previous row. </p><p>  The finished bolero must be tied with an edging, but only after the sleeves are sewn in order to mask the seam places. </p><h2>  Blouse made of square flowers </h2><p>  We continue to disassemble <span>crochet bolero knitting.</span>  With circuits, it‚Äôs much easier to do this job.  Therefore, we consider the option where the algorithm for working on the square motif "flower" and the assembly diagram of the finished product are shown in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sleeved bolero" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968735.jpg" width="354"></div>

It was built mainly from arches of air loops.  Only in the places of expansion and squaring it are inserted double crochet columns, as well as in the first row, from which the flower begins. </p><p>  Depending on the size of one product, about 60 motives will be needed.  It is better to combine them during the knitting process.  It is done like this.  The first motive is carried out independently and is postponed until the second is ready.  Then, when the next motive is almost complete, in the last row we make a binding to the first.  To do this, at the points indicated by arrows, you need to knit a crochet, instead of the middle air loop, and then complete the last arch. </p><h2>  We combine patterns </h2><p>  Let's analyze another bolero model.  This diagram is presented only as an example of how to combine round motifs and a simple openwork pattern.  With this work, needlewomen with a certain experience will cope.  And in their collections there are already many schemes suitable for these purposes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero with patterns" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968736.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  We start work with the main part of the blouse.  Here, the back and the front shelves fit in simultaneously.  The pattern for the product is a variation on the theme of double crochet fans.  This pattern fits like this: unpaired rows consist of fans (3 columns, a chain of air loops, 3 columns, a half-column) adjust the number of w / p as you wish.  Paired rows consist of two double crochet posts with a common base, high-arch arches between them and along the edges. </p><p>  This model will make an excellent bolero with crocheted sleeves.  Schemes of this type are ideally suited for this. </p><p>  The round motif should be six-pointed and also consist of fans in order to create a common holistic composition. </p><h2>  Fan Striped Bolero </h2><p>  We further consider bolero models that require a certain skill, but are not so complex as to be considered the pinnacle of art.  All crocheted boleros, the schemes of which are presented in the article, are designed so that almost any needlewoman could knit them. </p><p>  The basic pattern is not very complicated.  It is a two-tier fan that fits as follows.  In the first row we perform 3 air loops, 5 double crochets, 3 air loops, a half-column.  One air loop between 6 double crochets and on both sides of them.  At the top of the half-column we knit 2 double crochet and 3 high / low between them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a bolero" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968737.jpg" width="383"></div>

    <p>  We carry out the work on the pattern, trying to achieve a semicircular shape of the shelves.  To give the clothing a finished look, it is tied with an edging.  Their diagram presents 3 options.  Choose whichever you like best, or use your own. </p><h2>  Scaly pattern </h2><p>  The pinnacle of excellence will be this model.  Now we‚Äôll figure out how <span>to crochet a bolero, the</span> patterns of which resemble feathers or scales. </p><p>  At first glance, the work seems complicated, but it is not at all.  The pattern is built in 2 stages.  On the first, we knit a row of two double crochets, two air loops and again two columns.  In the opposite direction, we form scales. </p><p>  They are knitted <span>with double crochet</span> on the basis of the cells formed in the previous row.  2 columns are knitted at the base of the first paired column, the same amount at the base of the second.  Then the connecting half-column is made and the columns with two double crochets are again knitted. </p><p>  The third row is made similar to the first, only the formed scales are bent to the bottom of the canvas so that they do not interfere, and we make the first for the third row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bolero for full crochet patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/968738.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  With such an interesting pattern, a fantasy bolero is obtained that will definitely distinguish its owner from the crowd and attract attention to her. </p><h2>  Bolero must be worn correctly </h2><p>  Crocheting a <span>bolero, the patterns of</span> which are discussed above, is not enough to become unsurpassed.  It still needs to be combined correctly with the whole costume. </p><p>  First of all, it is a stylish accessory that allows you to hide your shoulders.  It is not customary to expose them in official institutions and offices.  Therefore, you can easily transform your favorite sundress, if necessary. </p><p>  An evening outfit will also seem lighter with him, but subject to the right combination with the fabrics.  Knitwear looks rough with a touch of chiffon, organza or silk.  But velor is perfectly emphasized by them. </p>
