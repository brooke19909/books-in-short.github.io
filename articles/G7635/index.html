The landscape of the peninsula is so diverse that it is amazing.  The chic <span>mountain Crimea, the</span> amazing south coast, the amazing west coast, the peculiar eastern part - wherever a person goes, everywhere there is such a different sea, mountains and vegetation. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Most residents of our country look forward to the holiday season.  Many people prefer to spend it on a warm, salty sea, sunbathing on the beach and indulging in idle pastime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swallow's Nest" class="if uuid-2340610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340610.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, more and more Russian tourists have again begun to choose the resorts of Crimea on the seashore for recreation.  And there are a lot of them on the peninsula!  Moreover, choosing the best resorts of Crimea, each tourist relies on their own preferences.  Some people just need to breathe in the fresh sea air, swim and sunbathe on clean beaches, and spend time in the evenings in entertainment venues.  But there are those who prefer to combine all this with studying the history of the peninsula and visiting iconic historical places and sights.  Crimea has always been considered a wonderful holiday destination for everyone.  The peninsula offers more than a dozen corners, among which each tourist can easily choose something to his liking.  But among vacationers, the most popular resorts of Crimea, which were famous in the Soviet years, are the most demanded for several decades, which every year become more developed and attractive. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Choosing the best option </h2><p>  The cost of housing in the private sector on the peninsula, of course, is cheaper than in comfortable hotels.  This is the best option for relaxing in the economy class.  Here you can rent a room, an apartment, a room in a private pension, a turnkey house, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Crimea with children" class="if uuid-2340613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340613.jpg"></div><p>  But the hotel business does not stand still.  New mini-hotels and comfortable private hotels offering a fairly high level of service, huge hotel complexes - all this have numerous resorts of the Crimea.  "All inclusive" - ‚Äã‚Äãa concept so popular in Turkey and Egypt, is also being implemented here.  According to this system, both hotels and pensions, as well as health resorts, and even private guest houses work. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  Crimea is called the "green pearl" of the Black Sea.  Almost the entire territory of the peninsula is a resort area.  The main and most popular tourist centers with developed infrastructure, which have been hosting vacationers for two centuries, are located on the southern, western and southeastern shores of the Black Sea, as well as on the Kerch Peninsula.  People come here to treat the body in one of the many health resorts, enjoy the mild climate, the sun, the warm sea and just relax your body and soul.  From west to east along the seashore are resort towns and villages. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea Hotels" class="if uuid-2340611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340611.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, the proposed vacation here will satisfy the needs of any categories of tourists. </p><h2>  Description of the east coast </h2><p>  In this article, we will provide a detailed overview of the major tourist centers of the peninsula, as well as talk about what are the best resorts of Crimea, introduce them to their rating, based on the estimates of our compatriots.  The eastern part of the peninsula is Sudak, Kerch and Feodosia.  In this region, the mountain landscape smoothly passes into the steppe.  The beaches in this part of the Black Sea coast are mostly sandy and pebble.  Only in the suburbs of Feodosia there is a wide sand strip.  <span>The Kerch Peninsula</span> is unique in itself: it is located between two seas - Black and Azov.  Such Crimean resorts as Sudak and Kerch are attractive not only for lovers of beach holidays, but also for tourists who are interested in local history.  In their vicinity, many ancient monuments have been preserved.  Greater Feodosia is popular with lovers of swimming and sunbathing.  In gradually developing villages, such as Primorsky, Ordzhonikidze, etc., you can rent inexpensive housing.  Natural tourists from all over the former CIS come to Koktebel, in particular to Fox Bay, a mecca of wild relaxation. </p><h2>  South coast </h2><p>  Here are such popular resorts of Crimea as Gurzuf, Alupka, Alushta, Simeiz and, of course, the pearl - Yalta. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ua-travel.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The nature of Sudak" class="if uuid-2340622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340622.jpg"></div><p>  They in the Soviet years were incredibly famous and popular.  Every summer, millions of armies of tourists gathered here.  The most popular resorts of Crimea are close to each other, moreover, Alupka, Gaspra and Koreiz have already merged altogether.  In this part of the peninsula, rich in lush subtropical vegetation, the cleanest sea. </p><h2>  Sevastopol </h2><p>  It is not a resort as such.  However, from the point of view of vacationers, it is not inferior to any tourist center on the peninsula.  There are many historical monuments, well-developed infrastructure, which not all the best resorts of Crimea can boast of, a huge selection of beaches, both sandy and pebble.  In Sevastopol there are both crowded swimming areas and lonely bays, in which there are practically no vacationers. </p><h2>  West Bank </h2><p>  This part of Crimea is primarily interesting to those who prefer a rest in the economy class.  Prices are comparatively lower than in other regions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----8sbucbve2abtl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="On vacation in Yalta" class="if uuid-2340627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340627.jpg"></div><p>  You can come here to relax both in such little-known villages as Peschanoe, Uglovoe, Nikolaevka, and the most famous resort on the Crimean peninsula - Yevpatoriya.  In the Soviet years, it was considered the most favorite place for a vacation with children.  It must be said that today almost half of all those who choose Crimea for their holidays come here.  Evpatoria has recently begun to develop as a tourist and historical center, because the city is 2500 years old.  On the western coast of Crimea there are also places that are well known to scuba diving enthusiasts.  And first of all it is <span>Cape Tarkhankut.</span>  And such small resorts of the Crimea, such as the Black Sea and Mezhvodnoe, have recently become popular with beach lovers because of the excellent beaches covered with fine sand.  And although their name is still not familiar to everyone, nevertheless, the flow of tourists here every year increases. </p><h2>  Rating of resorts of Crimea </h2><p>  By right, the first place is occupied by Yalta.  <span>The popularization of this</span> resort began in the XVIII century.  Each of the noble families considered it their duty to own at least a small estate in this part of the Crimea.  Embankments, parks, palaces and castles - many historical places in Yalta still attract tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="proudofukraine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of Crimea - Sevastopol" class="if uuid-2340629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340629.jpg"></div><p>  In the rating "the best resorts of Crimea", compiled on the basis of the reviews of vacationers, Koktebel takes its rightful place.  This small village attracts primarily creative youth.  It is the unspoken center of nudists.  In the water area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKoktebel, you can see the incredibly beautiful volcano Kara-Dag, Golden Gate, etc. The beaches of this resort are large-pebble, due to which the water is almost always transparent. </p><p>  In third place is Evpatoria with its diverse beaches, temples, mosques, water parks, dolphinarium, attractions. </p><p>  The next in the ranking of ‚Äúthe best resorts of Crimea‚Äù is Alushta.  A huge number of hotels and resorts made it extremely attractive for tourists.  In addition, you can relax here relatively inexpensively.  Prices for accommodation in the tourist infrastructures of Alushta are much lower than those offered by many other resorts of Crimea, including Yalta. </p><p>  Balaclava takes its rightful place in the ranking.  Due to the fact that it is located in an unusual bay, where even in a strong storm on the sea there is practically no excitement, Balaclava gained great popularity among beach lovers.  In the list of places that our compatriots awarded the highest scores are also Theodosius, Kerch, Simeiz, Foros, Partenit and, of course, Saki. </p><h2>  The best health resorts </h2><p>  Many people come to the peninsula not only to relax, but also to heal.  For this, excellent conditions have been created here since Soviet times.  One of the most famous is the Saki resort in Crimea.  This famous resort town is located in the northwest of the peninsula.  Since ancient times, Russians have been treating many diseases in Saki.  The golden beach by the clear sea, ionized air and much more helps not only rest and relax, but also restore health.  The unique treatment here is not inferior to the world level.  Here you can drink water from mineral springs, take mud baths.  Balneological resort Saki in Crimea today offers to relax at relatively low prices. </p><p>  Most resorts operate year-round.  Here the digestive, nervous and musculoskeletal systems are restored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="revngo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Saki" class="if uuid-2340632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2340632.jpg"></div><p>  Two hundred years ago in Crimea laid the foundation for spa treatment.  Many sanatoriums were built.  The unique <span>nature base of the Crimea</span> contributed to the development of spa treatment <span>: its mineral waters and mud lakes, fresh air and hot springs.</span>  <span>One of the best sanatorium is Ai-Petri, located on the southern coast of the peninsula, near Miskhor.</span>  <span>No less popular are ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolden Ear‚Äù in Alushta, ‚ÄúRodina‚Äù (Gaspra), ‚ÄúPoltava-Crimea‚Äù in Saki, etc.</span> </p><h2>  Rest in Crimea with children </h2><p>  This Russian peninsula is rightfully considered one of the best places for families.  Convenience of transport links, developed infrastructure for kids - all this contributes to the fact that many resorts of Crimea are just fine for children.  Some are attractive for their safe sandy beaches, others for the variety of entertainment available for the youngest.  An important role in choosing a resort in Crimea is played by the age of the child.  For example, children up to five or six years old are interested in just a carefree swimming at sea or the opportunity to build sand castles for hours.  Those older are more likely to visit the water park, dolphinarium, oceanarium and other Crimean attractions.  One of the attractive places for families with children is Gurzuf.  This town is attractive for its clean mountain air, good pebbled beaches, and a relaxed atmosphere.  Also noteworthy are the resort villages of Simeiz, Gaspra, Nikita, Koreiz.  True, the beaches here are small in area.  A similar situation in Alupka, Foros and Livadia. </p><p>  The most famous Black Sea resort, where you can safely come with young children, is, of course, Yevpatoriya, located in the western part of Crimea.  Spacious sandy beaches, well-developed tourist infrastructure, hotels operating according to the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù concept (the most popular among vacationers with family) - all this contributes to the fact that the number of visitors here is growing every year.  In addition, the climate of Yevpatoriya is excellent for a child's body: the process of acclimatization takes place gently and without side effects. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Those who are a supporter of sports pastime are interested in the question of whether there is a ski resort in the Crimea.  The answer is yes.  Today Crimea is famous not only for its chic beaches and health resorts, but also for its ski resorts.  The local nature created mountainous terrain that is ideal for outdoor activities during the coldest times.  There are a large number of camp sites on the peninsula.  It is best to come for a ski vacation in Crimea in February and March.  It is during these months that snow is best suited for skiing or sledding.  The most popular resorts intended for active winter recreation are tourist camps located on the slopes of Ai-Petri Mountain, in the lower reaches of Chatyr-Dag and in the famous Angarsk Pass.  The latter is considered one of the best <span>Crimean ski resorts.</span>  It is primarily suitable for beginners who love skiing, as well as sledding and snowboarding.  Parents with children have a great time here. </p><p>  Ai-Petri as a ski resort was created by fans of this pastime, well versed in this sport.  Here are the best tracks convenient for both professionals and amateurs, and even for children.  Here you can go not only for skiing or snowboarding, but also for ice skating, because this resort has an ice rink. </p><p>  The hills of the Chatyr-Dag massif can be reached both on foot and by road.  The tourist base, located in the lower reaches, provides tourists with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãaccommodation, food, equipment for skiing. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many resorts in Crimea are well known to everyone.  Their names are familiar to middle-aged people since childhood.  Fashionable Yalta and the bohemian Koktebel, inexpensive Theodosia and Sudak, the extremely popular village of Simeiz, Alushta and the "children's" Yevpatoriya are the most popular resorts of Crimea.  Feedback from our compatriots suggests that today they are the most popular destinations among Russians. </p><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots call their advantages a magnificent sea and amazing nature.  Many share their unforgettable impressions, talk about those attractions that they saw.  Russians call Sudak a great place to relax with children with its spacious beach, specific nature, thickets of undersized conifers and a bay surrounded by picturesque mountains.  For those who want to sunbathe in the sand, Evpatoria is perfect.  Judging by the reviews of divers, in Balaclava for them a real paradise.  Almost all the resorts of Crimea, our compatriots liked.  There are, of course, negative reviews.  And first of all, they relate to high prices for tour packages and the absence in some places of a sufficient number of entertainment venues. </p>
