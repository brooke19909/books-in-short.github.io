Every day, hundreds of Muscovites apply it to the terminals.  It is the main transport map of Moscow, without which moving around the city is uncomfortable and not at all profitable. </p><h2>  Why do I need a Troika card? </h2><p>  Being an electronic wallet for paying for public transport in Moscow and Moscow Region, the plastic counterpart successfully replaces paper tickets, eliminating the need to queue.  The number of advantages of using an electronic card is constantly increasing, which makes such a carrier a popular means of payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hostelhunting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check the balance of the three" class="if uuid-3188718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188718.jpg"></div><p>  A similar card is a universal travel card for Moscow public transport.  On it you can write a ticket "Wallet" or any paper ticket.  ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù allows you to travel by metro or ground passenger transport, in commuter trains, in Aeroexpress trains, on the cable car located on the Vorobyovy Gory, as well as on Velobike bicycles. </p><p>  In addition, the card can be used when paying for access to the zoo, to the skating rink, to the sights. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The Troika‚Äôs core is a 2 x 2 mm Near Field Communication chip, in which a radio module, a flash memory module and a wireless power system are built-in.  A copper wire antenna is attached to such a chip.  The chip operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz.  He eats with the help of radio waves.  Its active part, generating pulses, is located in the replenishment validator, turnstile or smartphone with NFC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the Troika card, manufacturers selected NFC chips that are compatible with the Mifare Classic standard and have a low cost.  MasterCard PayPass technology, these chips are not supported.  Therefore, it is impossible to replenish Troika in the bank terminal.  However, there is a nuance.  Troika services are integrated into the Bank of Moscow social cards.  Such funds can be replenished in terminals with PayPass. </p><p>  Transport cards are made in the form of bracelets, cards, rings and key rings.  How to check the "Three", we will tell below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.rambler.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonuses three" class="if uuid-3188729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188729.jpg"></div><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  It is very easy to get confused in the tariffs of this card.  Three tickets are recorded on the Troika card: 90 minutes, Unified and TAT.  In addition, there is a "Wallet".  This is a kind of balance from which various amounts are debited, depending on the type of trip. </p><h2>  Tariff "Wallet" </h2><p>  "Wallet" can be replenished, and then spend money on travel.  For the trip by metro, ground transportation or monorail, 38 rubles will be debited. </p><p>  For the ticket ‚Äú90 minutes‚Äù (one entrance to the metro plus any number of transfers on the tram, trolleybus, bus for 90 minutes) - 58 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "One" </h2><p>  There are two options: the number of trips or days.  What is the difference?  1, 2 or 60 trips are recorded on the card.  After purchasing tickets for 1 and 2 trips, there are 5 days for activation, for 60 trips - 90 days.  You can record tickets valid for a certain period of time.  There are options for a different number of days or for a month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check the top three online" class="if uuid-3188720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188720.jpg"></div><h2>  TAT </h2><p>  If a person rarely uses a monorail or metro, it makes sense to purchase a TAT ticket for a trolley bus, bus and tram.  Tickets are sold for 30 days or 1 trip. </p><p>  An unlimited ticket for 1 month costs 1194 rubles.  If you make trips twice a day, then one trip will cost about 20 rubles, which is very cheap for Moscow. </p><h2>  "90 minutes" </h2><p>  On this ticket you can go once in the subway, and also make any number of trips by bus, tram and trolley bus for 90 minutes. </p><p>  You can get out of the subway, money will not be debited additionally.  One trip costs 59 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeslive.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bonuses three how to check" class="if uuid-3188719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188719.jpg"></div><h2>  How to sign up for a Troika ticket </h2><p>  To record travel fares, ‚ÄúTAT‚Äù, ‚Äú90 minutes‚Äù and ‚ÄúSingle‚Äù use the box office of city vehicles or ATMs ‚ÄúEleksnet‚Äù.  For such an operation do not charge a commission.  To record a ticket, a plastic carrier is applied to the reader of the ATM and the tariff of interest is selected. </p><h2>  How to replenish the card balance? </h2><p>  You can top up such a card from 1 to 3000 rubles without a commission.  Ticket offices and terminals are located in Aeroexpress, at metro stations, ATMs MKB, EuroPlat, Eleksnet, Megafon. </p><p>  At subway ticket offices and terminals, ‚Äú90 minutes‚Äù and ‚ÄúSingle‚Äù tickets are recorded on the card, and ‚ÄúTAT‚Äù tickets are written exclusively in terminals.  Subscriptions for trains are recorded at the box office of suburban stations, at train stations in ticket machines, at the terminals of Russian Railways and the Electric Train. </p><p>  The easiest way to replenish a similar card through banking applications.  From a smartphone, this can be done in the Metro Moscow application, on the Troika service website, as well as in the mobile applications of Sberbank, Tinkoff, Alfa Bank, using Qiwi, Portmone, and Payment systems Yandex money". </p><p>  When replenishing the balance of the card with the iPhone, you need to activate the operation using the yellow validator located in the metro turnstiles.  And how to check the "Three"? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsnation.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check money on the top three" class="if uuid-3188721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188721.jpg"></div><h2>  Ways to find out the balance of the card, as well as the balance of funds and bonuses </h2><p>  The travel card works by the mechanism of an electronic wallet with an identification number.  There are three ways to check the balance of such an account: </p><ul><li>  via the internet; </li><li>  using a smartphone; </li><li>  through the terminal and validator. </li></ul><p>  Many are interested in how to check the ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù in a special terminal. </p><h2>  Check in the yellow terminal </h2><p>  Such terminals are at all metro stations.  They are hard not to notice.  To find out the rest of the money on the card, you need to attach it to the terminal scanner and wait for the information to appear on the screen.  When payment is made for travel by metro or any other transport, the validator shows the remainder of trips, cash or minutes.  You can also check Troika in the terminals of Megafon, Eleksnet and Aeroexpress. </p><h2>  How to check the "Three" by card number? </h2><p>  You can find out the balance only by one card number by calling the hotline.  Recently, however, operators have refused to voice the amount of money, and are advised to go by metro to the terminal.  Now we learn how to check the "Troika" via the Internet? </p><h2>  Internet Verification </h2><p>  At present, it is impossible to find out about the availability of funds on the card and available bonuses via the Internet.  However, active work is underway to create a personal account.  You can use the balance check on a smartphone with NFC.  If the Android operating system has the NFC function, you can find out the amount available on the account, as well as the number of unspent trips. </p><p>  Are there other methods to check Troika bonuses? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsbtc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check triple by card number" class="if uuid-3188722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3188722.jpg"></div><h2>  Verification through the My Travel application </h2><p>  A similar mobile application also works through NFC and requires an Internet connection.  If your smartphone supports the NFC protocol, you can download such an application, install it and hold the card at the back of the phone for several seconds. </p><h2>  Phone control </h2><p>  How to check the money at Troika, it is important to find out in advance.  If a card user activates the Mobile Ticket service, which is installed on a smartphone, in the mobile phone department, you can find out the remaining funds in the Balance tab, which is located in the main menu.  However, you should initially familiarize yourself with the list of smartphones that support this option.  We examined how to check the balance of Troika. </p>
