On the way from the air harbor to the hotel, tourists, according to their reviews, take about 40 minutes. </p><p>  With regard to proximity to the sea, Dong Hung is located on the seventh coastline.  According to travelers, they reached the beach on foot in about a quarter of an hour.  In general, many knew about this feature in advance, so no difficulties arose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dong hung hotel 3 nha" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1133454.jpg" width="600"></div>

It consists of one eight-story building.  The hotel does not have its own territory, with the exception of parking.  In total there are 50 comfortable rooms.  For the convenience of guests, the building is equipped with a high-speed elevator.  In addition to housing, the hotel has a restaurant, lounge and reception. </p><p>  According to our compatriots who stayed here during their stay in Nha Trang (Vietnam), this hotel will be an excellent option for active tourists who prefer to spend a lot of time on the beach, walking around the area and going on excursions.  Travelers with small children did not complain about the hotel.  True, some family guests noted that it took them a couple of days to get in with a stroller between scooters everywhere parked on sidewalks, but this did not cause any particular complaints.  If you are embarrassed by the need to go to the sea for about 15 minutes, then it makes sense to consider more expensive hotels closer to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dong hung hotel 3 nha trang" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1133453.jpg" width="600"></div>
