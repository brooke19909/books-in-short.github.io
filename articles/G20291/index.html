Sukharev.  He guarded the Earth City, which surrounded the part of Moscow.  In front of the tower is Sukharevskaya Square, where they organized a lively market. </p><h2>  Noteworthy place </h2><p>  The Sukharev Tower was a tall monumental building.  Its top with a spire was viewed from a long distance.  It resembled the town halls in the western cities that the king saw during his Great Embassy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharevskaya Square" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1611906.jpg" width="424"></div>  She even wore a watch.  In it, Peter I arranged a mathematical and navigation school.  This was the first technical educational institution in Russia that trained engineers.  An observatory was equipped here, and people continued to settle in the free space in front of it, calling it “Sukharevskaya Square”.

    <h2>  Popular market </h2><p>  In 1780, the square briskly traded in various products that the peasants brought.  Later it was possible to buy old things on it, very often - antiques, as well as shabby, sometimes very valuable manuscripts and books.  This market was visited by Pierre Bezukhov to buy a gun and shoot Napoleon from it.  About a hundred and forty years ago, lovers of antiquity often visited him.  Sukharevskaya Square with its market was a popular destination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fast forward to the first third of the 20th century </h2><p>  By decision of the Moscow City Council, they first closed the market.  Then they decided that the tower was obstructing traffic, and this beautiful and ancient structure, despite protests, was demolished.  Two squares were called Bolshaya and Malaya Kolkhoz.  There, of course, no one was trading, but the name was fixed from 1936 to 1990.  They returned the historical name, but left the old division into two squares and the old name, although they actually merged. </p><h2>  Big square </h2><p>  It is distinguished by one amazing attraction of Sukharevskaya Square.  The photo shows the main entrance to the Institute of Emergency Medicine.  Sklifosovsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharevskaya Square photo" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1611909.jpg" width="600"></div>  Before the revolution, it was a strange house, or the Sheremetyevo hospital, designed for two hundred people.  It is decorated with a double colonnade and a large dome.  This majestic classicist building looks like a palace and was built in 1810.  It is located in the back of the yard and covers it in a semicircle.  According to legend, Count Sheremetyev built it at the request of his beloved actress Parasha Zhemchugova.  The reproaches of conscience did not allow them, unmarried, to live in peace, and they somehow tried to mitigate their sins by charity.  They married a year before Parasha's death.  She died, according to some, from consumption, according to others - in childbirth.  In 1812, the French did not touch the magnificent building, but housed their wounded.  The wounded house was hosted during the Russo-Turkish, Russo-Japanese and World War.

    <p>  Bolshaya Sukharevskaya Square is another beautiful building.  This is a former apartment building, which was built by architect S.K. Rodionov for the shoe dealer Gutman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukharevskaya area what area of ​​Moscow" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1611911.jpg" width="600"></div>  It looks like Russian mansions of the seventeenth century.  Its roofs are four-pitched with a ridge, with a turret on which there is a weather vane.  The house is very elegant, as it is decorated with white and bright green tiles.

    <h2>  Where are the squares </h2><p>  It is not very difficult to answer where the large Sukharevskaya Square is located.  What <span>district of Moscow</span> is this?  She organically blended into the Meshchansky and Krasnoselsky districts.  The second, Small Square, is located only in the <span>Meshchansky district.</span>  The singer and actor M. Bernes lived on it.  There is an exit from metro station "Sukharevskaya" on it.  These areas have a small paradox: a small area is larger by twenty meters. </p><p>  As we have said, almost two squares merged into one.  When you quickly pass by, you no longer distinguish how one goes into the other.  A completely different thing is walking. </p>
