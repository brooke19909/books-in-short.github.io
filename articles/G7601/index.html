This happens, despite crises, economic shocks and the popularization of foreign holidays.  Lazarevskoye is one of them.  "Savages" and "cultural" tourists collect their bags and buy tickets in a southerly direction with a stop in this wonderful place.  They know where Lazarevskoye is: only sixty-five kilometers from Sochi. </p><h2>  The history of the appearance of the village of Lazarevskoye </h2>

    <p>  True, the resort was not always here.  More than four thousand years ago, Circassians, jihis, kasogis lived here, who in those days did nothing but hunting.  It took them a millennium to master agricultural work.  And only in the fifteenth century did a great industry appear here - trade.  At the place where Lazarevskoye is located, in 1839, during the military operations, the Russian fleet landed.  A defensive fort was built here.  Thanks to this, it was possible to repel the attacks of the British and Turks.  At the head of our sailors was Admiral Lazarev, who, incidentally, was the discoverer of the mysterious Antarctica.  His last name also gave the name to the future resort. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crowds of vacationers began their pilgrimage to Lazarevskoye only in the second half of the twentieth century.  Before, it was a quiet place where locals cultivated grapes, corn, tobacco, collected fruits, nuts and chestnuts. </p><p>  After World War II, the construction of tourist camps, resorts and boarding houses began here. </p><h2>  How to get to the place by plane and train? </h2><p>  How to get to Lazarevsky?  It all depends on the starting point of the route.  The fastest option is a flight.  There is no airport in the village itself.  But the planes to Adler depart from many Russian cities. </p>

After all, the places where Lazarevskoye is located are famous for unique natural creations and historical monuments. </p><h2>  Interesting places in the village of Lazarevsky </h2><p>  The Jegosh Gorge itself is mysterious and attractive.  And the numerous waterfalls that cascade down from a height of twelve meters captivate and stun.  From the side, everything looks like a giant staircase made of stone, along which mountain streams majestically descend.  The place is known as <span>Thirty-three Waterfalls.</span>  On the hiking trails, the dense foliage of relict trees casts a shadow.  Despite the wildness of nature, daily trade in national souvenirs and treats is quite briskly there. </p><p>  It gives pleasure not only the Black Sea, Lazarevskoe known and freshwater sources.  The ‚ÄúCrab Gorge‚Äù route leads tourists to a mountain stream, which has been chosen by short-tailed crayfish.  Note that they are found only in clean water.  The font of Adam, the Mermaids, the Canyon of desires with its beauty make the tour one of the most interesting and attractive. </p><p>  Not only Russia knows: Lazarevskoye is a place of mysterious gorges and waterfalls.  Foreign tourists often come here to enjoy the unique dolmens.  These funerary sculptures from stone blocks can be found in forests, on mountain climbs.  Nobody still gives a concrete answer to the question of where they are from. </p>
