Rimini is such a corner of the east coast of Italy, which captivates the hearts of tourists from the first minute.  There are several thousand hotels here.  Hotel Saxon impresses with its genuine hospitality and exceptional service.  Guests are always welcome here.  Whenever tourists get from the airport to the hotel, they will receive a warm welcome, a cozy room, a glass of wine or a cup of tea from the road and delicious food. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a very convenient location of the city is the hotel Saxon 3 *.  Rimini is known to many people.  The legendary Rubicon River flows next to this resort. This resort is secretly called the beach of Europe.  But at the same time, Rimini is located quite far from all the recognized tourist centers of Italy.  For example, 335 km to Rome, more than 330 km to Milan, more than 200 km to Venice, and just over 100 km to Bologna.  Therefore, deciding to relax in Rimini, you need to know in advance that it will be very difficult to make excursions to other cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Saxon 3 Rimini" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1520381.jpg" width="554"></div>  But this city can offer its guests its own unique attractions, museums, parks and, of course, beaches.  From Hotel Saxon to all of these city sites, various people estimate it is 7-15 minutes on foot.

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  A classic inexpensive hotel of a family type is Saxon 3 *.  Rimini, like the whole of Italy, has many similar establishments.  Since its location is the city center, where the buildings are built close to each other, there is practically no place for a large hotel area.  Therefore, Saxon 3 * does not have a garden where guests can walk, there is no pool and no other structures, only one four-story building, where all the infrastructure is located.  Before entering the hotel right on the street, guests can park their cars (if they arrived in Italy by private car or rented a car in one of the vehicle rental offices).  That's all that awaits guests outside the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Rimini" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1520383.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Quite close to the coast is Hotel Saxon 3 *.  Italy, Rimini in particular, is famous for its excellent beaches.  The city is washed by the Adriatic Sea.  The province of Rimini lies approximately in its northwestern water area. </p><p>  Regarding the climate, there is a border between the continental and Mediterranean zones.  This means that Rimini has hot summers, cool winters, moderately warm spring and autumn.  The beach season here begins in May.  Then numerous bars, cafes, and other tourist services are opened.  You can swim in the sea already at the end of spring, since by the beginning of summer the water manages to warm up to +20 degrees.  In summer, the sea is like fresh milk, very warm (up to +26 degrees), clean and calm.  September and even the first weeks of October also allow you to soak up the sand and swim in the Adriatic waters. </p><p>  All the beaches in Rimini, and they stretch for 15 km, are numbered.  Hotel Saxon 3 * rents a plot at number 38.  Guests at the reception are issued special cards that give the right to discounts on sunbeds and umbrellas.  As a result, they have to pay 10 euros every day.  Without a card, the same service costs 15 euros.  The guards do not allow them to sit on their towels just on a sand and take them to the municipal beach, which takes about 20 minutes to walk along the shore. </p><p>  On all the beaches of Rimini, the sand is covered, the entrance to the water is gentle, but the sea itself is not very clean, and in some months you can stumble upon painfully stinging jellyfish in the water.  Having paid for sunbeds, on the beach you can already use a tennis court, volleyball court (sports equipment is issued), fountains with drinking water, a shower and a foot washer for free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Saxon 3 Italy Rimini" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1520394.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  At any time of the year, especially when the weather in Rimini is not very suitable for relaxing on the beach, all tourists are happy to shop, enjoy the sights of the city or go by train and bus to nearby towns.  It takes about 15 minutes to get to the train station from the hotel. There are several shops in Rimini called Outlets.  Their feature is that here you can buy cheap things from famous brands that were fashionable last season.  That is, these are discounted, although completely new products. </p><p>  In terms of <span>attractions, Rimini is</span> not inferior to other ancient Italian cities.  Tourists will be interested in strolling along the old streets, visiting the clock square, admiring the bridge, the Malatesta temple and dozens of other historical masterpieces. </p><p>  Rimini's nightlife is a magical celebration of music, dance and fun.  The city has about 100 nightclubs.  Mostly their visitors are young people.  But there are also about a dozen of such institutions where it will be interesting to older people. </p><p>  And of course, you need to go to Rimini to take part in festivals.  The most popular are the festivals of folk, classical and modern music, a city festival dedicated to the memory of the famous Fellini, a native of Rimini, and the Pink Night festival, when the whole city literally drowns in all shades of purple and pink.  Here, even the water in the fountains is tinted with special dyes, and the store shelves are filled with clothes of pink hues. </p><h2>  Saxon 3 * (Rimini): reviews </h2><p>  This cozy family-run hotel is liked by those who are not particularly demanding of living conditions and the range of services offered.
