Today it is developing rapidly, and its borders are expanding, which is facilitated by new residential neighborhoods and even entire neighborhoods.  And the residents themselves have become more demanding of real estate: increasingly they give preference to new buildings located in areas with developed infrastructure. </p><p>  LCD Volga Park (Yaroslavl) is one of the largest residential projects in the Frunze district of the city.  Great location, comfort, promised by the developer, attract the attention of many.  But how good is the complex really?  How does it differ from other new buildings actively being built in various areas of the city?  This is what we will understand in the framework of this material. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Volga Park (Yaroslavl) is a large-scale residential development project, the delivery of which will take place in several stages.  The first stage is represented by three skyscrapers and the necessary objects of social infrastructure.  The construction of the new complex took place in the Frunze district, just a 15-minute drive from the city center, right on the banks of the Volga.  This place was not chosen by chance.  According to the residents of the city, it is this area that is currently being actively built up, already today it has everything that is necessary for a full comfortable life.  And which of the windows of the apartments offers a view - already breathtaking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The concept of enclosed courtyards completely isolates them from the through movement of cars, making it possible to allocate space for rest and leisure for all residents - both children and adults. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the Volga Park complex (Yaroslavl) is PIK.  This is one of the largest construction organizations in the Central Federal District, which implements a full cycle of activities, from design to commissioning.  The company has dozens of successfully implemented projects, including in Moscow and the Moscow Region.  Following the requirements of modern buyers, the use of advanced technologies and innovations make it possible to build not just residential buildings, but full-fledged complexes with developed urban infrastructure, leaving apartments accessible for many modern families. </p>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Bright and expressive facades with windows of various configurations and bold color combinations give the complex exclusivity.  The residential complex "Volga Park" in Yaroslavl can rightfully be called one of the most spectacular, it attracts increased attention.  Once on its territory, I want to pack all my things and move in an instant: it is so comfortable and spacious here, which certainly can not be said about the close Yaroslavl courtyards of the Soviet era. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The entrances are at ground level.  This is a conscious step by the team of architects who worked on the project.  First of all, this design greatly facilitates the task of mothers with babies, the elderly and cyclists.  Moreover, in the cold season, the likelihood of injuries is significantly reduced: no one else will slip on the icy steps and hurt himself.  A convenient navigation system is a hallmark of the project.  Each of those who fall into the residential entrance knows perfectly well on which floor he is located, how to get to the apartment he needs. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Volga Park (Yaroslavl) is a new modern <span>residential complex</span> located near the city center.  Numerous public transport routes run in its direction, thanks to which it is easy to get to any point of the city not only for those who have a private car in their family.  Moreover, as the microdistrict grows, additional public transport routes will be organized. </p>

On foot you can walk to the Metro hypermarket and the ennobled Shipbuilders Park. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The quality of construction of the Volga Park residential complex in Yaroslavl does not cause any complaints from those who have already managed to acquire an apartment for themselves and their family.  The apartments themselves are characterized by comfortable modern layouts that can satisfy the preferences of all modern residents. </p>

    <p>  The proportions of the rooms are selected in such a way that it will be possible to place almost any furniture in shape and dimensions.  Spacious kitchens, halls and entrance groups provide room for even residents of a one-room apartment, and panoramic windows fill the space with light.  High ceilings (3 meters) allow you to translate any design idea into reality.  In addition, each apartment has a wardrobe, which has become for many modern families a modern alternative to bulky and sometimes completely uncomfortable wardrobes. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  We presented to your attention one of the largest residential development projects - Volga Park (Yaroslavl).  The feedback from the first buyers confirms that the project reflects the wishes and requirements of various categories of citizens, whether they are newlyweds or people of advanced age.  On the territory of the complex and within walking distance from it there are enough infrastructure facilities that provide comfort to every resident.  If you live in Yaroslavl and have long been choosing a complex ideal for life, pay special attention to the Volga Park residential complex. </p>
