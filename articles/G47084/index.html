    <p>  <span>The Severnaya Korona Hotel and Severnaya Hotel</span> are two different hotels (the first object is unfinished, located on the embankment of the Karpovka River), many are confused in the name.  The building of the described complex is located on Enlightenment Street.  There are several ways to get to it: </p><p>  -121 bus to the station "Prospekt Enlightenment"; </p><p>  - on a fixed-route taxi under numbers No. K121A, K99K, K271, K108, K214; </p><p>  - by tram No. 100, 58 to the station "Ladozhskaya" or "Ozerki". </p><p>  You can also order a private taxi or use the transfer, as described at the beginning of the article. </p><h2>  Digest: opinions of tourists </h2><p>  After reading the many reviews of people on the network who have already repeatedly stayed at this hotel, you can understand: the main audience of the guests was satisfied with the living conditions and quality of service.  Almost everyone liked the territorial location - the Severnaya Hotel (St. Petersburg) was located close to the central attractions.  Reviews in a positive way were said about the number of rooms.  The rooms are equipped with new plumbing, there is ironed linen and towels.  And what else is needed for a picky tourist. </p><p>  The building is always quiet, very comfortable, neat and not smoked.  There were insignificant comments about the repair, but in general the hotel is a worthy place for budget tourists, eager for new experiences.  The hotel "Severnaya" makes a positive impression.  The capital St. Petersburg welcomes all nonresident guests with true hospitality. </p>
