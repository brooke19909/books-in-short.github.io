    <h2>  Socles </h2><p>  For domestic needs, there are lamps with a small, medium and large base.  The dimensions E14, E27 and E40 correspond to these characteristics.  The number here means millimeter diameter.  Size E27 is the most common.  E40 is used on street lamps with a power of 300, 500 and 1000 watts. </p><p>  In addition to the socles screwed into the cartridge, there are variants of the pin type.  Their types: G5, G9, 2G10, 2G11, G23, R7s-7.  Such socles are needed to save space.  <span>The electric lamp</span> is mounted in the lamp with pins. </p><h2>  Power </h2><p>  This is one of the main characteristics.  The manufacturer indicates it on the base or cylinder.  <span>The power of an electric</span> lamp determines what light flux will come from it.  Luminous efficiency and the level of emitted light are different concepts.  After all, an energy-saving light bulb with a power of 5 watts can shine no worse than a 60-watt incandescent lamp.  Unfortunately, the light output parameter is not fixed.  Therefore, it remains to rely only on their own experience in using certain options, as well as on the advice of sellers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Light output </h2><p>  The parameter means that for 1 Watt the lamp gives out the corresponding number of lumens.  Comparing the indicators of different types, you can see that an energy-saving fluorescent lamp will be four to nine times more economical than an incandescent lamp.  If the latter at 60 watts gives approximately 600 lumens, then the energy-saving ones will show the same results with parameters of 10-11 watts. </p>

    <h2>  Electric <span>bulb: characteristics,</span> power, voltage </h2><p>  These <span>types of light bulbs</span> first appeared in homes in the nineteenth century.  They, of course, have changed a lot since then.  However, the principle of action has remained the same. </p><p>  All of them consist of a glass cylinder, inside of which there is a vacuum space, a socle with contacts and fuses, as well as incandescent filaments emitting light.  The spiral is made of tungsten alloys, which can easily withstand a working temperature of +3200 degrees Celsius.  The electrical circuit of the lamps is as follows: when passing through a conductor with a small cross-section and conductivity of an electric current, part of the energy goes to the heating of the spiral part.  Therefore, it begins to glow.  So that the thread does not burn out at the same moment, inert gas is pumped into the lamps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite such a simple device for an electric lamp, many of their types have been invented, differing from each other in shape, size and materials used.  In addition, lamps are made with different capacities.  It ranges from 40 to 250 watts, if intended for domestic lighting.  For industrial needs make more powerful installations. </p><p>  A simple diagram of an electric lamp may look as follows. </p>

    <p>  There are decorative lamps in the form of candles, the cylinder of which has an elongated rather than a round shape, and is similar in shape to a candle.  Usually they are used in small fixtures.  Glasses can be painted in different colors.  Mirror lamp glass includes a reflective coating to direct light into a compact beam.  Most often they are used for ceiling lighting to direct all the light down.  The electric bulb has a low voltage.  Those intended for local lighting have a voltage of only 12, 24, 36 V. They are used in accidents, in hand-held devices, and so on.  Together with low energy consumption, they provide very little lighting. </p><p>  Electric lamps also differ in resistance, which varies with voltage and power, but not in a linear manner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Such lamps have a number of disadvantages.  First of all, they have a low efficiency - it does not exceed 2-3% of the energy consumption.  The rest is given to heat generation.  Secondly, they are unsafe in terms of the risk of fire.  An ordinary newspaper can catch fire just twenty minutes after it is attached to a lamp with a power of 100 watts.  Lamps are also not durable, as they serve only from 500 to 1000 hours. </p><p>  But they are very cheap and do not require any additional settings and connections.  Therefore, despite the shortcomings, many consumers respond positively to these lamps and continue to use them. </p><h2>  Halogen lamps </h2><p>  This view has the same principle of operation as in the previous case.  The difference is only in the composition of the gas inside the cylinder.  Here iodine or bromine are added to an inert gas.  Thus, the temperature of the filament increases and the evaporation of tungsten decreases.  Therefore, their service life is many times longer compared to incandescent lamps. </p>

    <p>  Since the temperature of the glass increases very quickly, they are made of quartz.  Such material does not tolerate any pollution. </p><p>  Halogen lamps, in turn, are divided into different types.  These are linear options used in stationary or portable searchlights, and lamps with a mirror coating, which are often installed in drywall constructions.  Among the shortcomings they can distinguish sensitivity to voltage drops.  Therefore, when applying, it is desirable to use an additional special transformer, where the current strength of the electric lamp will be aligned. </p><p>  Often such lamps are installed for car headlights.  And although car owners respond positively to them, they do not see much difference between economical options and expensive ones, with various sprayings and other effects. </p><h2>  Fluorescent lamps </h2><p>  If halogen lamps had a similar principle of operation with incandescent lamps, then this type differs significantly in its work.  Here, under the influence of current, not tungsten filaments burn in the glass flask, but mercury vapor.  Since light is emitted in ultraviolet light, it is virtually impossible to distinguish it.  Ultraviolet forces the phosphor to emit light, a coating on the walls of the tubes.  We see him.  The connection method in this case is also significantly different.  There are pins on the tubes that need to be inserted into the cartridge and turned. </p>

    <p>  Fluorescent lamps work at low temperatures, so they are easy to touch.  Due to the large surface, it is possible to achieve even diffused light, good for human eyes.  The service life is ten times higher than that of incandescent lamps. </p><p>  But such lamps are not directly connected to the network.  For them, special ballasts and starters are used, setting them on fire when turned on.  Most luminaires designed for <span>fluorescent lamps</span> have built-in glow devices that resemble electronic ballasts. </p><p>  Despite the high cost, buyers of lamps with such lamps note their naturalness for vision.  Therefore, their consumers remain true to their choice. </p><p>  Their markings are as follows: </p><ul><li>  LB means white light; </li><li>  LD - daily; </li><li>  LE - natural; </li><li>  LHB - cold; </li><li>  Ltb - warm. </li></ul><p>  After the letters are followed by numbers, the first of which indicates the degree of light transmission, and the next - the corresponding <span>glow temperature.</span>  The higher the light transmission, the more natural the lighting.  Different temperatures will give different colors.  So, very warm white will turn out at 2700K, warm - at 3000K, natural - at 4000K, daytime - at 5000K. </p><h2>  Energy-saving lamps </h2><p>  When these compact lamps appeared, they made a splash in the market.  Their views are extremely diverse.  And their advantages are obvious: now there is no need to install additional ballast and use special lamps.  They are easily screwed into a regular base.  At the same time, as with all species, they have disadvantages.  This is bad work at low temperatures, a long start-up, incompatibility with light controllers, a high price, mercury compounds in the composition, dissimilarity to natural light. </p><p>  Although such lamps are gaining popularity, people still treat them with some caution and, using them, usually have ordinary bulbs in stock. </p>

    <p>  But besides all these obvious advantages, there is one significant drawback: the price, which is 100 times higher than the cost of conventional incandescent lamps.  Such a significant minus, of course, reduces the number of consumers.  Nevertheless, LEDs are gaining more fans. </p>
