In the past 2 years, weaving bracelets from rubber bands with the help of this device has become gaining popularity and attract more and more children and adolescents.  From the very beginning, famous bracelets were created on the fingers.  Be that as it may, but complex and large weaving patterns can be mastered only on machines.  That is why a little later, the American Ching Chong created them for general convenience. </p><h2>  Types of machines </h2><p>  There are several types of machine tools for weaving bracelets, as well as weaving methods.  These are the so-called "slingshots", machines from ordinary pins, round or oval machines, with the help of which a wide variety of patterns and products are created.  But universal are considered machines for weaving bracelets with columns, which can be moved for more convenient use. </p><h2>  Features of the weaving process </h2><p>  So how to weave a bracelet on a loom?  One of the fastest in time is weaving a chain bracelet.  In this case, usually only 2 rows of columns are involved. </p><p>  With the development of this method of weaving, it will be easier for a newcomer to understand the principle of work on the machine, which will make it possible to move on in this direction and master more complex patterns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a bracelet on a loom" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58137/1928044.jpg" width="562"></div>

    <p>  Also from the figures will be a great accessory for hair clips.  To do this, you just need to string the elastic bands onto the braiding hook and fasten them in the center.  To make the decoration more colorful, you need to use as many flowers as possible. </p><h2>  Set for weaving a bracelet "Rain" </h2><p>  The peculiarity of the "Rain" bracelets lies in the fact that this jewelry can be worn both inside and outside.  Both parts have a different pattern. <br><br>  For weaving from gum bracelets "Rain" must be stocked with related materials.  It: </p><ul><li>  elastic bands of two colors - blue and white (the selection of colors can be any); </li><li>  large-sized machine; </li><li>  hook for weaving; </li><li>  clasp for a bracelet. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How to weave a bracelet on a loom?  To begin with, the middle row is required to be removed from the machine - it will interfere with the weaving of the Rain.  After that, you can start the process itself: for the lower row of weaving, use 3 blue elastic bands, each of which needs to be twisted on the machine with the ‚Äúeight‚Äù.  One is fixed on the first right and second left columns, the second - in the same way, but on the right side the elastic will be placed on the next column, and not at the beginning.  The last elastic is put on with the end already on the third column of the right side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further, the white rubber bands are placed on the machine in the same way as the blue ones, but with one exception - they should not be twisted by the ‚Äúeight‚Äù. </p><p>  The next step is to remove the rubber bands from the posts in the same order in which they were worn on the machine.  It‚Äôs worth starting with those that are below, that is, with the blue ones.  It so happened that on the second column of the left side of the machine the most layers were formed, so you have to fold the gum from it 3 times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet made of rubber bands" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58137/1928175.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After that, in the same sequence in which the white gum was worn, another layer of blue is fixed on the machine (without twisting the "eight").  White elastic bands will now be removed, but in the same order as the previous blue ones. </p><p>  In the same way, all subsequent elastic bands are put on and removed until the pattern is visible and the bracelet is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet made of rubber bands" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1929142.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to weave a quadrofish bracelet </h2><p>  Unlike the previous version of the "Rain" bracelet, a large machine is not needed for weaving "Quadrofish" - a small device for 2 rows is enough, because only 4 columns will be involved. </p><p>  The product will need at least two shades.  There may be more colors, but the main thing is that there should be an even number of them, for alternating colors. </p><p>  After the colored gum is distributed, weaving can begin. </p><ol><li>  The very first gum must be stretched to 4 columns in a square. </li><li>  After that, you should twist the elastic ‚Äúeight‚Äù near each column, thus forming a crosshair. </li><li>  The second gum should be a different color (except for the option with plain weaving).  It is also fixed in a square on top of the first, but is not twisted by the figure-eight.  In the method of weaving "Quadrofish", as in most others, only the first elastic is twisted. </li><li>  After the second gum, the third is fixed.  It should be identical with the first in color.  Thus, the machine should already have 3 gum. </li><li>  Now the bottom gum should be removed with a crochet (you can use a regular crochet hook) from each column, move it to the middle and throw it inward. </li><li>  At this stage, do not forget about the alternation of colors!  Next, the elastic is again put on the machine, item 5 is duplicated.  Thus, 3 gum remains on the machine. </li><li>  All actions should be repeated until the bracelet acquires the desired pattern and size. </li><li>  In order to finish the weaving beautifully and accurately, the last three gum should be moved inward as described in point 5. The last must be left on the machine!  After removal, it should remain stretched on two opposite columns diagonally.  This will help to fix and fasten the clasp more conveniently. </li></ol>
