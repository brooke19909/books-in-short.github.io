    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel in question is located in North Goa in India.  Its location to some tourists seemed not very successful, since the distance to the nearest beaches - Candolim and Baga - is about four kilometers.  As for the vicinity of the hotel, there is no special infrastructure here.  However, there are a couple of shops where travelers can buy everything they need.  Experienced tourists are advised <span>not</span> to <span>be upset</span> about the location of the hotel.  Indeed, according to them, even if it was located a two-minute walk from Candolim, the guests would hardly spend every day on this beach, since it seems to many too crowded and not very clean.  Therefore, the vast majority of tourists go to other beaches of the coast.  You can do this by taxi or by renting a motorbike.  The second option will cost much cheaper and allow you to visit all the places of interest to you.  By the way, the hotel in question provides its guests with a free shuttle to Candolim at any time convenient for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the distance from transport hubs, the distance from Nagoa Grande Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Goa) to Dabolima Airport is 45 kilometers, and to the railway station - 22 kilometers.  So after arrival, the path to the hotel will take you no more than an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nagoa grande resort spa 4 india saligao" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1138194.jpg" width="450"></div>

You can also always enjoy fresh vegetables and fruits, juice, coffee and tea. </p><p>  Guests can also have lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant.
