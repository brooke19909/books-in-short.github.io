    <p>  At all times, the dowry for a newborn created by the caring hands of mother and grandmother was especially valued.  And today, many women grab knitting needles and hooks, wanting to knit precious clothes for tiny princes and princesses. </p><p>  During pregnancy, even those who have not picked up yarn for a long time or did not know how to knit at all begin to needlework.  Having mastered simple tricks, you can complement existing clothing sets with a simple, but original little thing. </p><h2>  Where to start an inexperienced craftswoman? </h2><p>  The easiest and most win-win option is to create a bonnet for the newborn.  This is an integral part of the wardrobe of any baby.  Capers need a few.  Thin cotton and warm wool are required.  They will be useful regardless of the time of year in which the baby was born.  Its design is extremely simple and will not cause manufacturing problems.  Therefore, a knitted cap for newborns (knitting or crocheting) will certainly become a useful and often used thing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the small size of the product, the final result will appear very soon, which will inspire the future mother to create new and new masterpieces. </p><p>  Knitted cap for newborns with knitting needles is perfect for both a boy and a girl.  On the basis of the basic pattern, you can create many different product variations.  It all depends on the chosen type of yarn and the pattern of knitted fabric. </p>

    <h2>  Choose material for work </h2><p>  When creating any knitted product, you need to start with the selection of knitting needles and yarn.  In order for the cap for newborns to look neat, the loops should be small.  Accordingly, when choosing a tool, stop at the 3rd or 4th number, no more. </p><p>  If you knit a cap in addition to an existing set of clothes, choose a yarn in density and color that matches the finished item.  And for hats that are planned to be worn daily with different costumes, a low-key neutral color is ideal. </p><p>  When choosing a yarn, one should not forget about its composition and possible reactions on the skin of a child.  It should be soft, not fleecy, well tolerate numerous washings.  An ideal option would be baby-type yarn, present in the assortment of most manufacturers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not be afraid to experiment when choosing a color and pattern.  The most unconventional combinations, vibrant shades and bizarre applications will look fun and unexpected on the baby, and the young mother will be uplifted even on a gloomy autumn day. </p>

    <h2>  Knit cap for a newborn </h2><p>  Have you prepared all the materials?  Now you can start knitting a cap for a newborn with knitting needles.  The basic configuration diagram is shown below: </p><p>  1. We collect 17 loops on knitting needles and knit 32 rows with a 1x1 elastic band.  As a result, we get a rectangle that completely covers the back of the head of the baby. </p><p>  2. To the right and left of the resulting rectangle, we collect 16 loops.  <span>Edge loops</span> should be their basis <span>.</span>  We knit the first row of facial crossed, while to each third loop we add one from under the broach.  As a result, we get 8 additional loops on both edges.  We knit 17 loops on top of the rectangle.  As a result, around the initial rectangle we get the first row, consisting of 65 loops. </p><p>  3. The next 32 rows continue to knit the fabric with front stitch or any pattern you like.  The choice depends on the gender of the child and the season in which it is supposed to wear a cap for newborns, created with knitting needles. </p><p>  4. We knit the last 6 rows with the same 1x1 elastic band to give elasticity and shape to the product. </p><p>  5. The bonnet is ready.  It remains only to close the loops of the last row, hide the working thread and attach the ties. </p><h2>  Decorate the product </h2><p>  At this stage of creating a little thing, you can think about how to decorate it.  In recent years, among the works of experienced craftswomen, you can see a cap for newborns, knitted or crocheted, stylized as animal hats or hats of cartoon characters.  Such models are very fashionable and popular.  Their examples can be seen in the wardrobe of almost every baby. </p><p>  Mice and bunnies, dogs and monkeys, playful kittens, touching bears and bright raspberry bows of the Mini Mouse - all these images, created with great love and imagination, adorn the heads of crumbs.  Even serious adults smile from emotion and delight at one glance at them. </p><h2>  Openwork caps for girls </h2><p>  Expecting the imminent appearance of the girl, the expectant mother should learn crochet.  Victorian style caps for babies are a must-have item in the wardrobe of a little romantic fashionista.  This headdress will look amazing on photographs taken on the day of discharge from the hospital.  At the christening, he perfectly complements the dress and the kryzhma, and during evening walks the princess, sitting in a stroller in such a cap, will not leave indifferent any passerby. </p>

    <h2>  How to <span>crochet a cap for a newborn?</span> </h2><p>  Begin by purchasing yarn.  It will take no more than 50 grams.  Knit should be crocheted No. 2, so the yarn should not be very thick.  In most cases, such products are knitted from white yarn with a slight addition of a different color as a border. </p><p>  The head circumference in most newborns is 35-37 cm, so all calculations are based on these parameters: </p><p>  1. We knit a ring of 10 in.  n. In a circle we knit from it 16 tbsp.  with a crochet. </p><p>  2. From each loop we knit 2 tbsp.  with n  A total of 32 tbsp.  with a crochet. </p><p>  3. From the 3rd to the 6th row, we increase the diameter of the circle due to the increments obtained as a result of knitting <span>two double crochets</span> from one loop: the 3rd row from every second loop, the 4th from every third, the 5th - from every fourth, 6th - from every fifth loop.  Thus, we get that part of the bonnet that will cover the back of the head of the child. </p><p>  4. The resulting circle is tied with arches of five air loops.  They are connected in every 4th art.  with a crochet of the previous row.  Do not bind with arches about 2 cm. </p><p>  5. We continue to work with an openwork pattern according to the scheme we like.  We repeat the report so many times to get the necessary depth of the product. </p><p>  6. The bottom edge of the bonnet, that is, the neckline, is tied with one row next to a single crochet, and then another row of columns with two crochets.  Cut the thread, securely fasten and hide.  In the resulting cells we pass the satin ribbon, which will serve as ties. </p><p>  7. Attach the working thread to the lower edge of the rear (opaque) part of the bonnet.  We make the binding with one report of the openwork pattern. </p><p>  The product is ready.  Even those who have not fully mastered crochet will cope with its creation. </p>
