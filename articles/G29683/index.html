    <h2>  Limited Gadget List </h2><p>  So, for starters, we note that not all devices can work with 4G / LTE.  The reason for this is the features of the module, which can receive a signal at this frequency.  If it is absent, the phone will not be able to connect to the network of this protocol, which means it will not be able to support high speed file exchange. </p><p>  Just in practice, it turned out that only expensive, top-end gadgets of a higher class have support for interacting with LTE networks.  The budget models of this module, as a rule, do not have it - developers simply save on such an option.  Yes, and not always on cheap models you need the same 4G: their customers rarely use this expensive connection.  It is much cheaper to purchase a package with 3G Internet, which will be slow but more affordable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, finding a cheap smartphone with 4G is not so simple.  ‚ÄúFlagships‚Äù may not be available, as these are the most powerful and functional phones in the line.  As for the more affordable ones, we will pay closer attention to them. </p><h2>  Chinese phones </h2><p>  Finding a cheap 4G smartphone is very easy among the most stuffed devices that come from China.  Such gadgets, as we know, do not have special stability: they can be ‚Äúbuggy", have poor build quality, but at the same time they have the broadest functionality.  You don‚Äôt have to go far for examples. </p><h2>  Landvo L200G </h2><p>  Take at least this device model.  This is a very inexpensive smartphone with 4G and a good battery, which will be an excellent assistant in work or if you just need a second smartphone.  Of course, we also have not heard the name of its manufacturer, but at the same time brand unknown is not an automatic ‚Äúbrand‚Äù of its poor quality.  The device has only 1 SIM module, an 8-megapixel camera and at the same time has a 2000 mAh battery.  The price of the gadget does not reach $ 100.  Of course, the module for working in the LTE network is preinstalled here. </p>

    <p>  Regarding the performance and stability of this device, nothing special can be said, since the smartphone has not become as popular as the manufacturers expected, and there are very few reviews about it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Elephone g2 </h2><p>  This is another Chinese ‚Äúbaby‚Äù with LTE.

    <p>  In addition, we have before us the cheapest smartphone with 4G and IPS (the latter characteristic relates to the technology of displaying images on the screen).  It turns out that this is an interesting device with a low price, which can easily be turned into a gadget for high-speed surfing, watching movies or TV shows online and so on. </p><h2>  Cubot x12 </h2><p>  The brand under which this smartphone comes out is also owned by a Chinese manufacturer.  The device is also equipped with an LTE module, so we have in front of us the same cheap 4G smartphone as the gadgets described above.  Its cost, by the way, also does not go beyond $ 100.  Even its filling is typical for inexpensive devices from the Middle Kingdom.  Again, we cannot vouch for the stable operation of the device. </p><h2>  InFocus M512 </h2><p>  The manufacturer, which is engaged in the release of the original iPhone, is simultaneously developing other models.  One of them is InFocus. </p><p>  As you may have guessed, this is also a Chinese phone with the ability to connect to high-speed Internet.  Its cost is slightly higher, because it is not the cheapest smartphone with 4G (about $ 120).  But, having acquired it, the buyer also gets a high build quality (which is also good for a Chinese product). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Jiayu f2 </h2><p>  This unit is even more expensive than those described above.  But believe me, this smartphone significantly bypasses the capabilities of these models, having a price tag of only 10 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Its advantage is that it not only supports work in 4G networks, but also boasts a powerful processor that provides stable and uninterrupted operation.  The developers did not forget about the capacious battery (2250 mAh), and the 4-core ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone.  By the way, the design of the device was also not deprived. </p><h2>  Ulephone Be Pro </h2><p>  Even cooler is the device from the little-known manufacturer Ulephone.  This is a full-fledged modern phone with an excellent IPS screen and an acceptable price tag - 12 thousand rubles.  This inexpensive smartphone with 4G and a good camera has all the features of a higher-class device (for example, due to the powerful battery - 2600 mAh).  What can we say about the colorful display built on the matrix from LG - the leading manufacturer of equipment from Korea? </p><p>  The Chinese also tried on the appearance of the device, collecting it from glass and metal in the manner of some G2 or another ‚Äúflagship‚Äù ... It looks really cool, although this is a relatively cheap smartphone with 4G (LTE-module). </p><h2>  Devices from operators </h2><p>  From the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù we will move on to another interesting category of phones - smartphones, which are offered under the brand name of one of the mobile operators.  As we all know, such gadgets are often sold at a lower cost due to binding to a single provider. </p><h2>  Beeline Pro </h2><p>  Take at least the device from the ‚Äúyellow-black‚Äù operator (from the name it‚Äôs clear what kind of talk is in progress).  It was offered at a price of 4,990 rubles (at least at the time of launch), and had quite modest characteristics (as for a smartphone): a screen with a resolution of 480 x 854 inches, a camera of 2 megapixels.  This is clearly an inexpensive smartphone with 4G and a powerful battery (given the low consumption of its charge, 2200 mAh is really a lot). </p><p>  One minus - this model comes exclusively with a package from Beeline, so you must choose for yourself one of the tariff plans of this operator and order it in order to take advantage of this phone. </p><h2>  MTS-978 </h2><p>  Another interesting device is the 978 model from MTS.  It costs only 6,700 rubles, but it is also endowed with the capabilities of a modest smartphone and, of course, has support for working in LTE format. </p><p>  The device is equipped with an 8-megapixel camera, a screen based on IPS technology with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, a 1.4 GHz processor.  The battery here has a capacity of 2000 mAh, which is enough to work for two days with an average level of battery consumption.  In general, a good solution, again with reference to the mobile provider. </p><p>  If desired, you can choose models from other operators of interest to you.  The main question is whether you are comfortable with the functionality that such a cheap 4G smartphone can show.  Yes, there will be support for high-speed mobile Internet, but at the same time, the quality of the videos, the possibilities when working with games, the performance, the image from the camera - all this will be far from ideal.  Therefore, you should probably hold the device in your hands, or even better, ask your friends or colleagues who have such knowledge how easy it is to interact with it, whether the phone is comfortable and so on. </p><h2>  Low-cost smartphones from leading developers </h2><p>  Finally, in addition to Chinese models and devices manufactured under the brand of operators (which also, incidentally, relate to Chinese devices with their own characteristics), we can also name ‚Äúusual‚Äù companies for us, which supply various categories of smartphones - as ‚Äústate employees‚Äù with truncated functionality, and full-fledged ‚Äúflagships‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Sony Xperia E3 </h2><p>  With a fairly productive processor from Qualcomm, the device has very good performance in terms of the ability to work with bulky applications: games, high-quality videos and so on.  There is also a 5 megapixel camera and, of course, there is an LTE module. </p><p>  The design of the device is simple, but pretty enough, captivates with its simplicity.  For 8 thousand rubles you get an excellent model for performing a variety of tasks. </p><h2>  Acer Liquid E600 </h2><p>  If you are looking for an inexpensive smartphone with 4G and two SIM cards, you can pay attention to the brainchild of Taiwanese company Acer, namely, the model indicated in the header.  Here, as on the Xperia E3, there is a processor that produces a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  The model is assembled at a high level, has a powerful 8-megapixel camera and a ‚Äútasty‚Äù price - 7,100 rubles (as for the version with LTE support). </p>

    <h2>  Nokia Lumia 636 </h2><p>  As you can see, in our rating all devices were presented on the Android operating system.  A model with iOS, of course, cannot be placed here, since this is clearly not a budget option for the device.  At the same time, do not forget about phones with Windows Phone.  This platform is also starting to gain popularity among mobile device users. </p><p>  The device has nothing unusual in comparison with its ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù presented above, both in terms of technical parameters and in terms of price.  Unless, we can say that it uses a different OS, which will appeal to fans of WP.  It is more stable than Android, and taking into account the presence of the LTE module, the device can become a tempting solution for many users. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, as we can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to find an inexpensive and functional smartphone that supports the option of working in the format of fourth-generation networks.  Of course, some of the models presented in our list will become obsolete at the time you read this article, but this is not a problem!  Manufacturers will replace the device in the lineup with a new similar device. </p><p>  As for prices, in many cases they are quite affordable for a wide range of users.  Therefore, if you live in an area where LTE-format communication is spread at the proper level, and you agree to pay the cost of tariffs for this connection, you can safely talk about purchasing such a gadget for further work with it. </p>
