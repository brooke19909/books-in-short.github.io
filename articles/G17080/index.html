    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Cyprus is a very unusual place.  With distinctive streets, architecture and attractions that create a special atmosphere here.  In some places even medieval.  And a striking example of this is the Cypriot village of Tochni.  It is there that the specified hotel is located.  The village of Tokhni is a very unusual <span>stone city,</span> in which the production of decorative facade stone was once actively conducted.  This fact determines the extraordinary appearance of the village. </p><p>  The hotel is hard to miss.  The hotel complex is a stone house, surrounded by greenery and exotic vegetation.  They are located on a hillside.  The territory of the complex is spacious, cozy and well-groomed.  Guests strolling through it may have the impression that they are in their own village, located inside the town. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest beach is 200 meters away.  But you need to go down to him.  7 kilometers from the complex, by the way, is the popular governor's beach.  <span>Larnaca Airport is</span> about 35 km away.  Not so far, so the location can be called convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  The stone houses look medieval in an original way, but, as you know, the exterior is deceiving.  The complex has everything that is necessary for the tourist - high-speed Wi-Fi, an ATM, a car rental point (parking is also nearby), a souvenir shop, laundry and dry cleaning services, as well as a shuttle service. </p><p>  Since the area is quite specific, the hotel staff organizes the rental of not only cars, but also bicycles and even horses.  Taxis are also better to call at the reception - it's cheaper, there is a special tariff.  By the way, the staff speaks German, Greek and English. </p><h2>  What else is there in the hotel? </h2><p>  In addition to the above, Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses 3 * also has its own restaurant, sun terrace and a small swimming pool, the cleanliness and order of which is regularly monitored.  It also organizes fishing trips on bicycles and horses, which are especially popular in this area.  And also in Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses 3 * there is a small wellness SPA-center with a sauna - it will definitely appeal to lovers of relaxation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The area is not full of entertainment.  Nearby there are several shops and taverns, the epicenter of active life - in Larnaca.  But, by the way, people are sent here in order to enjoy the original atmosphere, amazing nature and silence. </p>

I would like to start with their description. </p><p>  Their area is 35 square meters.  m.

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  This is the second category of rooms in Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses 3 * (Cyprus).  Their area is 65 square meters.  m. People who wish to live in such apartments are given the choice - either two 1-double beds, or one, but the royal one.  One folding sofa will be available anyway. </p><p>  This is a one room with a kitchen.  Its difference from the studio is the layout - the bedroom in the apartment is separated.  The interior with decoration is a little different, but in terms of amenities - everything is the same.  A week of relaxation in these apartments for two people will cost approximately 25-26 tr.  Breakfast is also included. </p><p>  But there is another apartment - the same as these, but with two separate bedrooms.  Each of them, by the way, has a private bathroom.  One bedroom has a king bed for two.  In the other - 2 separate, standard.  Such apartments are designed for four guests, and for them a week will cost ~ 40 tons. </p>

    <h2>  Important information </h2><p>  Now a few words about booking and room rules.  At the hotel, registration of new guests begins at 13:00.  Therefore, the flight you need to choose the appropriate one.  But, if guests know that they arrive earlier, it is better to contact the hotel directly and ask if there is free space this morning in order to pre-configure yourself either for waiting or for instant accommodation. </p><p>  In the hotel you can live with animals and with children.  If tourists arrived with a child under 2 years old, they will be offered a cradle (free of charge).  He is older than 2, but his age has not reached 10 years?  There is also no need to pay for his stay.  Only the child will have to sleep on the bed / sofa, which is already in the room.  And finally, if his age is from 11 to 15 years, then accommodation will have to pay 14 euros per day.  The cost of additional accommodation for everyone over 15 is 18 ‚Ç¨.  But it is important to consider that an unlimited number of guests are not allowed in the apartment.  Maximum 2 extra cots and one bed.  Moreover, sleeping places are provided upon individual request - the hotel must send tourists confirmation that they will be provided with the service. </p>

    <h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  Now we can note the comments that people who visited Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses 3 * leave about this complex.  Reviews are different - there are both positive and negative.  But here it is very important to understand that this resort is not for everyone. </p><p>  Those people who deliberately went to Tochni to this complex to enjoy the originality, unique atmosphere and the feeling that they are in a medieval setting remain satisfied.  This is a paradise for connoisseurs of "something special."  And for those who are tired of the everyday city bustle and dream of silence and solitude.  Relaxation, nature, living in old houses, walks during which you can get acquainted with local outlandish sights - that's what they come here for.  This place does not need to be sent to a person who is eager to have fun in a modern resort hotel with a casino and Welness centers located a meter from the sea.  Because expectations do not fundamentally coincide with reality. </p>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Guests note a lot of interesting nuances.  For example, few people use air conditioning while relaxing here.  The houses are made of stone - and this is a natural material that cools quickly and regulates the temperature in the room itself. </p><p>  The guests praise the food - because there are few guests at the hotel, due to the number of rooms, they are preparing here for the stated number of vacationers, with appropriate quality and even care.  Everything is delicious and fresh at home, and you can eat plenty of breakfast. </p><p>  The apartments have towels and toiletries, but there are no mosquito fumigators.  Not all guests complain about them, but it is better to take a few pieces with you, and ointment - so as not to suffer from bites. </p><p>  And you definitely need to take a car, deciding to stay in Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses 3 *.  Limassol, Larnaca, Ayia Napa ... in Cyprus there are so many interesting places!  Even if the purpose of the trip is to enjoy the nature and atmosphere of a stone village, it is necessary to allocate 2-3 days specifically for exploring the island.  Excursions are good, but on your own vehicle you can see much more interesting places in a shorter time.  In addition, the hotel has a car rental point - you can not help but use this. </p><p>  So, we can conclude that the Cyprus Villages Traditional Houses complex is a worthy place and it is worth honoring it with your attention if the goals of your vacation correspond to those described earlier.  Surely you will not have to feel sorry. </p>
