There are many techniques and methods by which you can make your own flowers from almost any material.  A flower can be a plastic bottle, a piece of salt dough or clay, a flap of fabric, paper cuts, packaging from a bouquet or multi-colored beads.  What a flower will be, it will become an independent product, part of a bouquet, a picture or a beautiful wrapper for candies, depends only on the imagination of the master. </p><h2>  Paper flowers </h2><p>  This material is the most accessible of all.  You can use both color and simple office to use for making flowers from paper with your own hands.  Even an ordinary A4 sheet can be an amazing flower.  To add brightness to it, you can use paints, pencils or colored chalk. </p><p>  DIY flowers made of paper can be a beautiful decoration for any occasion, and children will be happy to help in their manufacture. </p><h2>  Water lily </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learnatwork.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami flower" class="if uuid-2366776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2366776.jpg"></div><p>  The plant is a symbol of trust and sincerity.  You can find many ways to make this flower from paper with your own hands, one of which is origami. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  Paper. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><p>  Indeed, one square sheet of paper is needed. </p><ol><li>  Fold the sheet in half 2 times to form 2 lines intersecting in the center. </li><li>  Expand sheet.  Bend each corner to the center so that the vertex connects to the intersection point of the folds. </li><li>  The corners of the resulting diamond should also be lowered to the center to make a square.  You can repeat this action as long as the paper size allows.  The more repetitions, the more rows of petals will be. </li><li>  In the last rhombus, bend the angle from the center to the middle of the side so that the fold line is 1 cm from the edge. </li><li>  Next, you need to bend from the center all layers of the petals. </li><li>  If necessary, the corners at the base can be slightly bent back, and the center of the waterlily can be decorated with contrasting color paper. </li></ol><h2>  Dahlia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="i1.wp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper bag dahlias" class="if uuid-2369800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369800.jpg"></div><p>  It is very easy to make this flower from paper with your own hands.  It consists of many kulechki glued to the base.  It can be either a sheet of paper - in this case, a volumetric applique will turn out, or a circle made of cardboard, which can be decorated with sepals and made of stems from wire.  Any paper can be used for making dahlias, especially for writing notes.  They already have a square shape, so they significantly save manufacturing time.  Dahlia can consist of sheets of the same size and color, but to make it look more natural, it is better to use sheets of 3-4 different sizes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fabric flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Ribbon Flowers" class="if uuid-2369738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369738.jpg"></div><p>  Fabric flowers have been popular for quite some time.  For many centuries they have been used to decorate clothes and hairstyles, and in Japan their manufacture is one of the oldest types of applied art.  Today, such flowers not only complement the dress, but also are an independent decor.  They do not need to be looked after, they do not fade, like natural flowers, they retain their original appearance for a long time, therefore they are great for decorating the rooms of busy people.  Flowers from fabric can be collected in a bouquet, make a wreath or an original panel.  For making flowers yourself, you can use trimmings of fabric and ribbon.  In composition, the material can be absolutely anything.  Depending on the desired result, you can take both cotton fabric and organza or burlap.  Especially naturalistic flowers are obtained from satin and silk, and the flowers from ribbons will be the simplest and most affordable.  With their own hands, even a child can make them. </p><h2>  Tulip from ribbons </h2><p>  This flower has long been a symbol of International Women's Day.  The counters of flower shops, and not only that, on the eve of this holiday are littered with tulips of different varieties and colors, however, they, like many other fresh flowers, wither very quickly, so connoisseurs of this flower decorate their rooms with tulips from satin or any other ribbons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To make such a flower with your own hands you will need: </p><ul><li>  red satin ribbon 2.5 cm wide - 90 cm; </li><li>  green ribbon 5 cm wide - 15 cm; </li><li>  threads are red; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  candle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  skewer. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: red tulip" class="if uuid-2369775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369775.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cut the red ribbon into 6 equal strips of 15 cm each. To melt the edges with a candle. </li><li>  Twist each segment in the center 2 times, fold in half.  Sew from the bottom, stepping back from the edge of 1 cm. </li><li>  Cut a leaf from a green ribbon, melt the edges.  Fold it in half and hold it over the candle so that the fold is slightly fixed.  The main thing is not to melt the fabric through.  Attach a piece of paper on the skewer with glue, wrap it with the remaining green ribbon. </li><li>  Picking up the petals on a single thread, arrange on the stem 1.5 cm below the edge of the stem.  In doing so, they should look down. </li><li>  Start forming a bud.  This can be done with glue or thread, securing the desired position of the petals with stitches.  The first row consists of half the petals, the second - from the remaining.  They should be located between the petals of the first row.  The bottom cut of the ribbons should be inside the bud. </li></ol><h2>  Bell </h2><p>  Making such a flower is very interesting.  It consists of the same modules, connecting which in different ways, you can get many completely different flowers. </p><p>  To make it you will need: </p><ul><li>  cream tape 2.5 cm wide. - 30 cm; </li><li>  green ribbon 10 cm; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  candle; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  stamens. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: flower" class="if uuid-2369803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369803.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cut the cream tape into 6 pieces. </li><li>  Put a piece of tape 2.5 x 5 cm with the front side on the table, lower the short sides to the base to make a triangle.  Secure with two pins. </li><li>  Turn the workpiece over and fold in half to make a right triangle.  The edges of the tapes should remain outside. </li><li>  The lower leg, consisting of 4 layers of tape, must be melted above the candle along the pins, and then press the still hot material with tweezers or scissors.  Thus, all 4 layers are glued together.  It remains only to turn the part slightly so that the bend falls on 1/2 of the second leg.  Prepare the remaining 5 petals. </li><li>  Prepare the stamens.  You can use ready-made, made from beads or improvised material.  For example, the photo used a melted yellow mesh edge. </li><li>  Arrange the petals with a cone so that the fused edge is in the center.  Apply glue to the sides of the workpieces and press gently.  Place the stamens in the center. </li><li>  Make a sepal and, if necessary, a stalk.  It is better to fix it with stamens in advance, so that the product is more durable. </li></ol><h2>  Corrugated Paper Flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Corrugated Paper Flowers" class="if uuid-2369735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369735.jpg"></div><p>  Another material from which you can make flowers with your own hands is corrugated paper.  It is quite easy to work with it, while products from it are very similar to real ones. </p><p>  There are two types of paper: </p><ol><li>  Thin corrugated.  Folds on it are almost invisible, the material is easily wrinkled and poorly holds its shape.  It is suitable for making small delicate flowers, for example, forget-me-nots.  Roses from such paper also look very beautiful, but making them so that they look like real ones is quite difficult. </li><li>  Dense corrugated.  Creating flowers with your own hands from paper of this kind is much easier, since it is quite rigid and holds its shape well.  You can buy it at any flower shop, as this material is actively used for decoration of bouquets. </li></ol><p>  Regardless of which kind of corrugated paper flowers are made of, they have only two drawbacks.  Firstly, such products are afraid of water.  And, if only an ugly stain appears on thick paper, then a product made of thin material can be completely damaged from one drop of water.  Secondly, they are afraid of bright light.  Paper under the influence of the sun quickly burns out, turns yellow, regardless of the original color. </p><p>  But despite this, corrugated paper flowers are still very popular. </p><h2>  rose flower </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular flowers.  Following the step-by-step photo, making flowers from corrugated paper with your own hands will be quite easy to make. </p><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  pink paper 21 x 30 cm; </li><li>  green 10 x 15 cm; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue stick; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  skewer; </li><li>  napkin. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: rose 1" class="if uuid-2369733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369733.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Roll a napkin into a ball, fasten on a skewer.  If the flower is in a bouquet or on its own, it is better to close the sharp edge.  If it is in the composition, the basis of which is a sponge or polystyrene, then for the convenience of fastening, the sharp edge is best left below. </li><li>  Cut pink paper into 3 strips 7 cm wide. </li><li>  From the first cut 4 petals 7.5 cm wide. From the second - 6 pcs.  5 cm each, and from the third - 8 petals 3.7 cm each. You can use templates for this, but it‚Äôs easier to fold each ribbon several times and immediately cut several petals of the right size. </li><li>  Pull the upper edge of each petal with scissors, making semicircular movements from the bottom up, so that it arches.  In addition, it is necessary to slightly stretch each petal in the center so that it takes a natural look. </li><li>  Next, you need to form a bud.  To do this, wrap the ball on the skewer with a narrow petal and fix it with a thread.  It is better to take threads strong and close in color to paper.  To keep the paper well on the workpiece, it is enough to make several revolutions around the skewer, while pulling the thread well.  In this way, it is very safe, and most importantly, to quickly fasten the petals.  They must be laid in a spiral from smaller to larger, each wrapping with thread. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: rose 2" class="if uuid-2369732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369732.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cut a sepal blank from green paper, pull out the edges with scissors.  Glue is best used in the form of a pencil.  It glues corrugated paper well, while it does not get wet, as from PVA.  It must be applied along the folds so as not to deform the material ahead of time. </li><li>  Glue the sepals to the bud, remove excess paper.  If you need to hide the edge of the corrugated paper, then it is better not to cut it off, but to tear it off, and not very evenly, and glue it well. </li><li>  Wrap the skewer with a strip of green paper.  To do this, glue should be applied to the tape, tear off the beginning, and then glue in a spiral to the base, gradually pulling out the paper.  Break off the remaining edge and secure. </li><li>  Fluff the rose, if necessary, stretching the petals from the inside at the base.  Rose is ready. </li></ol><p>  Instead of a napkin for the base of the bud, you can use round-shaped candies wrapped in foil.  It will not only allow you to fix them on a skewer (like caramel on a stick), but also protect the candy from the high temperature in the room.  A bouquet or composition of such handmade flowers from paper will become an original replacement for a classic box of chocolates. </p><h2>  Pion </h2><p>  Peony symbolizes a happy wedding, respectively, it is used to decorate precisely these events.  The process of making this flower with your own hands for beginners will be easier than roses, since the shape of the bud depends not only on the skills of working with corrugated paper, but on the number of layers. </p><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper for a bud 50 x 25 cm; </li><li>  green paper 10 x 15 cm; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  skewer; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue stick; </li><li>  napkin. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: peony" class="if uuid-2369730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369730.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Roll a ball from a napkin and fix it on a skewer. </li><li>  Cut corrugated paper into strips of 7 x 25 cm, 3 times 10 x 25 cm and 13 x 25 cm. </li><li>  Cut 12 petals on the first tape, 8 pieces on the second and third, and 6 pieces on the remaining. </li><li>  Pull the top 1/4 of each petal with scissors. </li><li>  Use your fingers to stretch the petals in the area 3/4 of the height closer to the base. </li><li>  Wind the ribbon with petals around the ball on the skewer, securing the thread. </li><li>  If necessary, stretch the petals again. </li><li>  From green paper cut a sepal and strip 1 x 15 cm. </li><li>  Glue the sepals, wrap the skewer with green paper. </li><li>  Fluff a flower. </li></ol><h2>  Pink tulip </h2><p>  The technique of making a <span>flower from corrugated paper</span> is similar to creating a tulip from ribbons.  This is not to say that some method is simpler or more complicated.  A flower made of paper holds its shape better, but looks rougher, and it is more difficult to form a bud than ribbons, which, on the contrary, are easily bent and look more natural, however, they hold the shape poorly. </p><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  pink corrugated paper 15 x 20 cm; </li><li>  green 10 x 15 cm; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  skewer; </li><li>  glue stick. </li></ul><p>  Manufacture: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Step by step photo: tulip" class="if uuid-2369731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369731.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Cut 2 leaflets from green paper, pull out the ends with scissors so that they bend a little. </li><li>  Leaves attached to the skewer using thread. </li><li>  Cut a strip of green paper 15 x 1 cm, grease with glue.  Wrap, gently pulling the tape, the stem, tear off excess paper. </li><li>  From pink (or any other) paper cut 3 strips 5 x 20 cm. </li><li>  At each lane, outline the middle, folding in half.  Twist the sheet 360 ¬∞ along this line and fold it in half again. </li><li>  Attach the resulting petals to the stem.  To do this, each segment must be laid with the overlap down, pick up the upper part, thread the thread to the stem. </li><li>  Raise the petals up, with your fingers pull out at the base, giving the shape of a bud.  If necessary, fix the petals together with glue or using a hot gun. </li></ol><h2>  Big flowers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="m.kantu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hall decoration with paper flowers" class="if uuid-2369690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369690.jpg"></div><p>  One of the modern trends in fashion is decorating the premises with large-sized flowers.  They are used both in festive and everyday decor.  In addition, with the help of such flowers at a photo shoot you can feel like a real Thumbelina! </p><p>  You can make such flowers with your own hands both from fabric and from paper.  The technique of their manufacture is similar to the creation of ordinary flowers, however, in this case, you need to pay attention to the glue.  It should be strong, and its quantity should be sufficient, since the weight of each part due to size will be significant. </p><p>  For making large colors of fabric with your own hands, it is better to take a material that is sufficiently dense, but not heavy.  In order for such a flower to keep its shape better, wire can be sewn into the edges of the petals, the fabric can be well starched or the finished work can be fixed with a large amount of hair spray. </p><p>  It‚Äôs easier to make large flowers out of paper with your own hands.  A simple Whatman paper always holds the desired shape well, and with such dimensions even thin corrugated material will not lose it much, and growth flowers from it are obtained especially delicate and airy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="appleface-studio.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://appleface-studio.com/%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A9%E5%A9%9A%E7%B4%97pre-wedding-sofia-%E7%B4%99%E8%8A%B1%E5%89%B5%E4%BD%9C/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Big flower made of paper" class="if uuid-2369718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/2369718.jpg"></div><p>  A person who creates a flower with his own hands always leaves a part of his soul in it.  That is why, regardless of what the craft is made of, what size, shape or shade, the flower will bring joy to people, keep warm memories.  Such flowers will become a good holiday decoration, room decor or a gift to a dear person. </p>
