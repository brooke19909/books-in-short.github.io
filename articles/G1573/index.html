Model Xperia XA1 Dual - the second instance in the XA line.  It was presented in 2017.  Unlike its predecessor, it has characteristics that correspond to the middle segment.  But which ones, let's take a closer look. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xa1 dual specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074135.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance, controls, sizes </h2><p>  Buyers are presented with several options for the Sony Xperia XA1 Dual: white, gold, black and pink.  The case has a clear rectangular shape with rough corners, which is consistent with the style of this brand.  The upper and lower ends have a chrome finish, due to which attention is focused on a small thickness.  Dimensions of the gadget - 145 √ó 67 √ó 8 mm.  Most of the body is made of plastic, but the ‚Äúsides‚Äù have a metal finish. </p><p>  Users enthusiastically responded to the presence of an oleophobic coating.  Now there is no need to constantly wipe the screen.  The back panel has a matte surface.  Unfortunately, fingerprints always remain on it, which can only be combated by wearing a case. </p><p>  As for the functional elements, they are all located in ordinary places, so there is no need to dwell on them in detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen and camera features </h2><p>  The middle segment corresponds to the <span>characteristics of the Sony Xperia</span> XA1 Dual.  To work in the gadget, a screen with a diagonal of five inches is installed.  It is based on the IPS matrix.  Colors on the display are realistic, viewing angles are wide.  When tilting the smartphone, you can notice a decrease in contrast and brightness.  The pixel density (294 ppi) is enough to not see the "squares" on the screen.  Resolution - HD. </p><p>  Of particular note is the main camera, which has a 23-megapixel Exmor RS ‚Ñ¢ sensor.  Hybrid AF.  There is a quick start option.  The lens is wide-angle.  High-quality pictures taken with the main camera are obtained even in low light (ISO 6400).  To zoom in on the subject, a fivex zoom is provided. </p><p>  The front camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  It is based on the Exmor R sensor. Pictures are obtained in good quality even in low light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xa1 dual reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074136.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sony Xperia XA1 Dual: performance features </h2><p>  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone is the productive chipset Helio P20 TM MediaTek.  It is based on the computing elements of the Cortex-A53.  There are eight of them.  The platform works like 4 * 4.  The first half of the cores can accelerate to 2300 MHz, the second operates at a lower frequency - 1600 MHz.  There should be no problems with the graphics display, since the Mali-T880MP2 video card is installed in the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The power of the gadget is enough to perform all tasks, without exception.  Even ‚Äúheavy‚Äù games run without problems.  Of course, the amount of RAM is of great importance in the performance parameter.  The developers installed 3Gb, which by modern standards is quite consistent with the middle segment.  The size of the internal memory is 32Gb.  The system is occupied by about 10. If there is not enough remaining, you can use an external drive. </p><p>  The device is running a fresh version of the OS.  The seventh "Android" is supplemented by a proprietary Sony interface.  There are practically no distinct differences between a ‚Äúclean‚Äù operating system and a shell, with the exception of some ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  For example, unlocking is performed by swiping up or to the left, the search for programs is started by moving down. </p><h2>  Terms of autonomy </h2><p>  An important criterion for a mobile device is the battery life.  In this regard, the specifications of the Sony Xperia XA1 Dual are hardly impressive.  The battery installed in the phone has a small capacity.  Unfortunately, only 2300 mAh is provided for everything.  Accordingly, it makes no sense to expect high results.  With an average load, you can expect no more than 20-24 hours.  If you transfer the smartphone to austerity mode, you can increase the battery life to two days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia xa1 dual white" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2074137.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sony Xperia XA1 Dual: reviews </h2><p>  This model went on sale only in 2017, however, users have already identified the strengths and weaknesses of the smartphone.  The advantages clearly include an excellent display, original design, the quality of the materials used, body assembly and, of course, the main camera. </p><p>  There were also shortcomings in the Sony Xperia XA1 Dual.  Battery performance is rather weak for such a "filling".  A large number of reviews say that after several months of operation at the edges, the sensor stops working.  Many also noticed that the device really lacks a fingerprint scanner. </p>
