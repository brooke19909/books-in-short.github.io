Tourists here expect picturesque landscapes, beautiful architecture and a high level of service. </p><h2>  Resort History </h2><p>  Gorki Gorod (reviews are given in the article) is a fairly young resort.  Even before the Olympics, the administration of the Krasnodar Territory decided to create and develop a modern ski complex called ‚ÄúMountain Carousel‚Äù.  When Sochi was chosen as the venue for the 2014 Olympics, a project was developed to build a media village.  It should have housed absolutely all the media whose task is to tell the whole world about competitions.  The center of cultural and sporting life was also supposed to be in this place.  The choice fell on the ‚ÄúMountain Carousel‚Äù for a reason, because at present the complex is the largest ski resort in the whole Krasnaya Polyana.  Only this complex had such a vast territory that it was possible to build an entire city and enable participants in the Olympics to live in 3,000 rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roller coaster city reviews" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1706320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to the guests, the rooms have excellent equipment, they have everything that you might need while relaxing in the Gorki Gorod complex.  Apart-hotel 3 * (reviews are given in the article) is convenient in all respects: from the location to the service.  The hotel staff is attentive to guests and tries to help in all matters. </p><p>  But cleaning is the issue regarding which guests express completely opposite opinions, which gives reason to doubt the quality of room service of the Gorki Gorod 3 * hotel.  Guest reviews are quite contradictory, although most people are incredibly satisfied not only with the rooms, but also with the cleaning and quality of service.  Cleaning complaints are apparently related to the human factor.  After all, the complex consists of many buildings, each of which serves its staff.  Apparently, not everyone was lucky with the maids. </p><p>  According to guests, the hotel is located in an area with excellent infrastructure.  Nearby there are entertainment venues, a supermarket with reasonable prices (the cost of food is not overpriced), shops and restaurants. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  In the cold season, tourists have a great opportunity to pamper themselves and their children with a trip to the most beautiful water park.  Gorki Gorod (guest reviews confirm this fact) is good because it has a wide variety of entertainment on its territory, which are available at any time of the year and in any weather. </p><p>  The water park with the beautiful name ‚ÄúBeach in the Mountains‚Äù allows you to instantly find yourself in a hot summer atmosphere and enjoy water attractions.  At the same time, raising your eyes up to the transparent dome, you can admire the snow-capped peaks.  Such a striking contrast makes the rest even more interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel roller coaster city Krasnaya Polyana reviews" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1706337.jpg" width="600"></div>
