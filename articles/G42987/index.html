Perhaps more often than in other places, music can be heard in a passing car.  Any motorist with great pleasure will create an additional musical background for his trip, but not all cars can boast of the presence of modern media systems equipped with a set of ports and a drive for CD-ROMs.  The situation will help fix a simple device called an FM transmitter. </p><h2>  FM transmitter is ... </h2><p>  Outdated technologies and the so-called crutches are always a compromise that consumers, in particular motorists, often have to make.  This happens due to the lack of more modern and advanced solutions in their cars.  A transmitter is a radio electronic device that allows you to play audio files in various extensions and broadcast them to a nearby radio receiver.  Such a gadget has become a partial replacement for cassette players.  At the junction of technology, when flash cards were already gaining popularity, and Bluetooth players were not there, another invention came into play - the transmitter.  Radio receivers are rarely equipped with a full set of functions, especially those that come in the basic assembly of a car, so a similar workaround has become a necessity. </p>

    <h2>  FM Transmitter Description </h2><p>  The FM transmitter for cars is a small device that connects to a car cigarette lighter.  In most cases, the gadget is made of plastic.  It has a hinged body for more comfortable interaction and playback control.  Often devices of this category are equipped with a display that displays information about reproduced data or content loaded into the transmitter‚Äôs memory.  On some models, full-fledged controls are installed, including remote options.  The transmitter remote allows you to switch, rewind tracks, adjust the volume level, and also select the playback order (for example, make the transmitter play music in random order). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important to know: the vast majority of cars delivers voltage of 12 volts, which is enough for the gadget to work.  On-board systems of more massive <span>diesel-powered</span> cars usually have a voltage twice as high, as a result of which FM transmitters designed for 12 volts burn out. </p>

    <h2>  The principle of operation of the FM transmitter </h2><p>  So, we found out that the FM transmitter is a device for reproducing data.  Why is it needed when there are replacements in the form of CDs and flash drives?  Actually, this solution is for those who do not have one or simply prefer to use a phone or a Bluetooth player as a music storage. </p><p>  In the transmitter housing, depending on the model, there are a number of communication elements: </p><ol><li>  USB port  For connecting flash drives, iPhone smartphones and iPods. </li><li>  MicroSD / MMC slots.  For connecting more compact flash drives. </li><li>  Bluetooth  To broadcast an <span>audio signal</span> from a phone or player. </li></ol><p>  The FM transmitter in the course of its activity analyzes the contents of the connected storage for the presence of audio files in <span>MP3 format</span> and others.  After that, the process of converting digital sound into an electrical audio signal begins.  The transmitter sends a signal to the radio air, the power of which is enough to be picked up by the radio receiver built into the car.  Actually, it is the receiver that amplifies the signal, relaying it to the speaker system installed in the passenger compartment.  Surrounding people, in turn, hear music from media connected to the FM transmitter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Important: the instructions of the transmitter (regardless of model) state that the gadget must be tuned to an unoccupied frequency so as not to interfere with other programs, create unnecessary interference and, in principle, function correctly. </p><h2>  FM transmitter Ritmix FMT A705 - the most affordable option </h2><p>  A very worthy and at the same time completely inexpensive FM transmitter, perfectly coping with its main task and having a number of implicit advantages. </p><p>  In addition to the extremely low price (only about 350 rubles), one of the important advantages of the device is a universal battery, which works great with both 12-volt on-board systems and 24-volt ones.  There is a simple equalizer to achieve acceptable sound.  The device works with flash drives of all types, supports massive file systems up to 32 gigabytes in size (a rarity for transmitters of this price niche). </p><p>  Speaking about the shortcomings, one cannot but mention the monolithic case, which does not allow adjusting the position of the display, as well as the lack of support for any additional audio formats other than MP3. </p>

    <h2>  FM transmitter Rolsen RFA-100 </h2><p>  Another representative of the budget segment of FM transmitters, which is suitable for not too picky users. </p><p>  First of all, this device is ergonomic and has a good arrangement of controls.  Even in poor lighting it is not possible to mistakenly press.  At the same time, the case looks stylish and attracts attention.  There is a soft, very pleasant display backlight that does not strain the eyes of the driver.  The price tag is also pleasing, you can buy this gadget for a modest 500 rubles.  Included is a remote control.  Users note the high quality of signal transmission even when working in parallel with other devices, which often have a negative impact on sound quality (for example, video recorders). </p><p>  Of the minuses, a limited amount of supported flash drives (no more than 4 gigabytes) can be distinguished. </p>

    <h2>  Mystery FM Transmitter MFM-80BCU </h2><p>  Great multifunctional device.  Perhaps one of the best, if not the best Bluetooth transmitter that can reward any radio with advanced, seemingly unattainable functionality. </p><p>  The gadget is capable of receiving a signal via the Bluetooth wireless protocol, which means that the user will no longer need to worry about the presence of a flash drive and its filling.  Moreover, the driver is entitled to use this FM transmitter as a headset.  Management can be carried out using two control panels.  One of them is full-fledged, equipped with a digital unit, allows you to dial numbers and make phone calls.  The second remote control is simplified, mounted directly on the steering wheel, allows you to switch tracks, stop and start playback. </p><p>  The device also boasts proprietary Clear Voice Capture technology for transmitting high-quality sound without significant losses and additional interference (echo, rattle, and other radio signal conductors). </p><p>  Another important attraction of the transmitter is a large display with a diagonal of 1.4 inches. </p>

    <h2>  FM transmitter Intego FM-105 </h2><p>  When looking at a solution from Intego, the first thing that comes to mind is thoughts about a road navigator or mini-communicator.  The reason for this is the atypical display for devices in this category.  Actually, such a large screen is installed in the gadget for a reason, it is one of the few transmitters that supports video playback.  The decision is ambiguous and is unlikely to find a sufficient number of supporters. </p><p>  Speaking about the Intego FM-105, one can not remain silent about the fact that this FM transmitter for cars has very impressive sound quality. </p>

    <h2>  Is the game worth the candle? </h2><p>  The FM transmitter is a very specific device, which, in addition to the obvious advantages described above, also has serious disadvantages.  First of all, of course, very low sound quality.  This fact will greatly affect those who rarely listen to the radio and prefer to enjoy their music with high bitrate. </p><p>  An additional discomfort is created by the lack of support for massive hard drives, this limits the people sitting in the cabin, and does not allow you to bring along any playlists and albums.  This problem can be avoided by buying a Bluetooth transmitter, but then the sound quality will drop even lower. </p><p>  As a result, fans of FM transmitters are forced to compromise, always losing something.  In the dry residue, the only objective advantage of the FM transmitter over a modern radio is cheapness. </p>
