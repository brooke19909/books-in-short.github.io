  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Origami technique or how to make an envelope out of paper</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Children begin to introduce the origami technique to children from early childhood.  Such skills help to create a creative imagination, develop hand motor skills and spend time in an exciting way.  But it should be noted that this activity can be fascinating not only for children.  Adults also will not be more likely to resort to the origami technique and not in order to teach their kids, but also in order to learn for themselves. </p><p>  The easiest way to work with paper is to create an envelope.  Everyone knows how to make <span>an envelope out of paper,</span> but not everyone knows that it is actually possible to create a unique work of art by using the origami technique and folding an envelope, for example, for a postcard. </p><p>  Let us take a step-by-step instruction on how to make an envelope out of paper with orientation for <span>Defender of the Fatherland Day.</span>  Everyone knows that this is a holiday dedicated to men, so we will write how to make an envelope out of paper for a card for the holiday of men.  The technique of decorating envelopes, as well as albums and other items is called scrapbooking.  We will use this technique to <span>decorate the envelope</span> for the holiday. </p><p>  1. Take a sheet of paper, measure the dimensions of the postcard and fold the sheet so that it is possible to glue the side edges with a thin strip of glue, and also leave a small free piece on top so that the resulting pocket can be closed. </p><p>  2. Now that the sides are glued together, you can start scrapbooking.  To do this, you need to think about how best to decorate the received envelope.  To do this, you can draw <span>an associative series</span> with what characterizes men, which can be attributed exclusively to the strong half of humanity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. Suppose the weapon is most suitable for men.  How to make weapons out of paper can be found on the Internet.  To make the envelope look textured, the origami technique is most suitable with which you can, for example, not only learn <span>how to make a sword out of paper,</span> but also create a beautiful, powerful blade that will enchant any defender of the Fatherland.  So, it was decided to decorate the envelope with a powerful origami sword, as well as bright armor that can be made using foil or chain (just choose a chain easier). </p><p>  4. Next, following the instructions on how to make an envelope out of paper, as well as design it in a single style, you need to create a harmonious composition and glue all the elements into a single whole.  In no case should you forget about the inscriptions, because they allow you to diversify the overall picture and fill it with life.  The envelope for the man to whom the envelope will be addressed is signed in ancient letters of the medieval style. </p><p>  Such work will be highly appreciated by anyone, because everyone knows how to make an envelope out of paper, but not everyone can create a unique work of art filled with the most tender feelings. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the above techniques are perfect for any occasion, while you can add fabric, sparkles and rhinestones to the envelope to be designed and surprise everyone around with the beauty and brightness of the work presented. </p><p>  Every connoisseur of aesthetic beauty will be struck by such a manifestation of feelings and attention.  And there are no difficulties in creating and making envelopes.  You just need to feel the desire of the person who will be presented with such a present, surrender to the will of feelings, emotions and imagination, spend time creating the beautiful and receive a worthy reward for the work done. </p><p>  From childhood, a person is inculcated with unique abilities that can give a good mood every day, but not everyone seeks to use the acquired abilities in adult life, where there is so little entertainment for children. </p>
