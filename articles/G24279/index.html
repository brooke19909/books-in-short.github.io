Sights and memorials of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  20 kilometers from Berlin, on the banks of the Havel River, lies the ancient city of Potsdam.  The sights of this area are the continuous residences of the Prussian kings, monarchs and other persons who have played and are playing an important role in the life of Germany.  On the territory of the city there are a huge number of palaces, parks, gardens.  At any time of the year it is very picturesque and beautiful.  Therefore, we will not hesitate and right now we will go on a virtual tour to this exquisite province. </p><h2>  Brandenburg Gate </h2><p>  The most beautiful arch, which is located in the city center and is its symbol, boasts not only Berlin, but also the city of Potsdam.  They have been standing here since 1770 and are a symbol of the end of the long seven-year war that unfolded in the vastness of Europe at that time.  Two architects were engaged in the construction of this building at once, which, by the way, is very noticeable.  Apparently, during the development, they did not coordinate their projects, because on the one hand the arch is crowned with massive doors, and on the other there are columns made in the antique style.  It is also worth noting that near this arch there is a very beautiful fountain.  It is especially interesting to watch it in the dark, when the backlight turns on, and a fabulous atmosphere is created around. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Potsdam attractions" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/556398.jpg" width="468"></div>

Potsdam, whose sights are mostly dated to the 16-19th centuries, also has later buildings.  Of these, the Glienicki Bridge, which is a crossing over the Havel River, deserves attention.  It was built in 1907, since the wooden bridge in its place could no longer cope with the load in the form of new vehicles.  During the first and second world wars, there were meetings of representatives of various states.  This place was considered a feature that separates Eastern and Western Europe.  Today the bridge is an example of architecture of the early 20th century.  Its frame is made of metal and concrete, but at the same time the integral composition looks very elegant.  It is especially beautiful here in the evening.  The bridge is favorably highlighted, which creates a romantic atmosphere around. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Potsdam map with landmarks" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/556402.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main attraction of the city </h2><p>  In the must see category on this tour we have the famous Sanssouci palace and park ensemble.  Potsdam began to be built up from ancient times, and it is he who is one of the oldest structures that can be found here today.  The park previously belonged to Frederick the Great, and it is generally accepted that the king himself developed this project, working it out to the smallest detail.  Since then, to the present day in the park there are several beautiful palaces, the main of which is considered to be of the same name - Sanssouci.  Attention of tourists also deserves the ancient <span>temple, the Church of</span> Friendship, the Chinese tea courtyard and the chic greenhouse.  No less important property of this region are considered natural beauty.  Lush vineyards, roses grow here, gardens and picturesque alleys flaunt, where you can walk freely at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in Potsdam" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/556399.jpg" width="600"></div>

Earlier on this place was the village of Aleksandrovka, in which Russian immigrants lived.  At the beginning of the 19th century a very beautiful temple was built here, which has been preserved in its original form to the present day.  Since the church is not just a monument of architecture, but an operating religious institution, services are held here every Saturday and Sunday.  You can get to them absolutely for free.  All tourists who visited this unique temple note that it is distinguished by its extraordinary beauty.  The walls are painted in pale pink, and four domes flaunt over the building itself. </p><h2>  Central catholic temple </h2><p>  As you know, the center of the city is distinguished by its special beauty and splendor.  Potsdam, whose attractions have been built over the centuries, can be proud not only of several palaces and alleys.  Truly a magnificent and sacred monument of architecture is the Church of St. Nicholas.  It stands out among other urban buildings due to its emerald dome.  On one of the upper tiers of the building there is an observation deck from where a stunning view of the entire district opens (entrance fee is 5 euros).  This place is especially interesting for lovers of choral concerts - here they are held regularly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="san sushi potsdam" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/557204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  New Garden - New Style of the City </h2><p>  To visit this natural and architectural reserve is simply necessary for every tourist who decided to go to Potsdam.  Sights of this charming place are not as grandiose as many other monuments of the city, but their sophistication, charm, uniqueness, compensate for everything.  This park was built by King Frederick William the Second.  Unlike his uncle, who created Sanssouci, this ruler no longer piled on every smallest detail.  As a result, two palaces grew in the greenery of the gardens - Marble and Tsetsilienkhov.  The palaces look very harmonious in an ensemble with nature.  Everyone who has been here notes that the atmosphere is extremely peaceful and relaxing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Potsdam" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/556400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  If you are going to Germany ... </h2><p>  The town we talked about, of course, is very small.  But still, in order not to get lost and not to lose sight of anything, you will need a map of Potsdam with the sights that are available here.  So it will be more convenient for you to draw up your route in advance and plan the time. </p>
