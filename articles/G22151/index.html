Many tourists after the first trip to this country tend to get into it again.  However, it must be remembered that all the positive emotions from excursions to local attractions and relaxing on luxurious beaches can be spoiled by a bad hotel.  For this reason, his choice must be approached with particular care.  Hotel Kamelia 2 *, located in Tivat, is very popular among Montenegrin guests. </p><h2>  Tivat - location and climate </h2><p>  Tivat is a town in Montenegro, located next to <span>the Bay of Kotor.</span>  Picturesque resort gives the beautiful Adriatic coast park, created at one time by sailors who brought here exotic plants from all over the world.  The Tivat city park is also famous, on the territory of which mimosa, palm trees and many other plants grow.  5 km from the city there is an airport with links to many cities of different countries, so guests of the Kamelia 2 * hotel do not have to spend a lot of time on the way to the place of rest. </p>

    <p>  Tivat is famous for a large number of sunny days - about 200 a year.  Once this resort was the resting place of the aristocracy, and today on its territory there are many museums and galleries dedicated to those times.  There is also a large port in the city, from where comfortable liners depart, on which everyone who lives in various Tivat hotels, including Kamelia 2 *, can take a boat trip.  Montenegro has on its territory many interesting cities that can be visited just during such a mini-cruise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information about the hotel Kamelia 2 * and his photo </h2><p>  Kamelia 2 * is an economy class hotel located near the sea and consisting of several buildings with two or three floors and a large territory.  The distance from the hotel to the center of Tivat is no more than 1.5 km.  It is worth noting that we are talking about the Montenegrin hotel Kamelia 2 *.  Bulgaria also has a hotel with the same name on its territory, therefore, when planning a summer vacation in Montenegro, it is important not to confuse them. </p><p>  On the territory of Kamelia there is an outdoor pool, a bar, parking, as well as a lot of greenery, which can be seen in the photo a little lower.  Relaxing by the pool, guests have the opportunity to enjoy magnificent views of the sea and mountains.  Very often, ‚ÄúCamellia‚Äù is chosen by families with children for their holidays, so do not be surprised at excessive noise.  If you prefer a very quiet vacation, then it is better to refuse to stay at this hotel. </p>

A diving center and a boat pier are nearby. </p><p>  The beach offers many opportunities for water sports and just water activities.  Among them are banana skiing, sailing, single or double kayak, single canoe, water skiing, etc. If you wish, each vacationer can go on a sea or bus excursion, since in Montenegro there is every opportunity for this.

    <p>  Guests respond positively about food.  Despite the fact that it is only two-time, there are always delicious and varied dishes on the table.  By the way, in half board, some tourists see many advantages: firstly, it‚Äôs cheaper, and secondly, there‚Äôs no need to run headlong for lunch, being in a completely different place.  This type of food is excellent for vacationers who do not like to spend all their time at the hotel and on the beach, but prefer to get acquainted with the sights of the country, which are quite a lot in Montenegro. </p><p>  As for the negative reviews about the hotel, most of them relate to the rooms.  Tourists complain about both the poverty of the situation and the mess.  The rooms are said to resemble army barracks more than hotel rooms.  Cleaning is very rare and not very thorough: dust in distant corners and cobwebs can remain intact for days.  However, everyone enjoys the presence of a balcony, from where you can enjoy magnificent views of the sea and the surrounding nature. </p>
