    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Tourists, judging by their reviews, were very pleased with this item.  So, according to them, the Garden Sea View Hotel (Pattaya) has a very large territory of its own.  Which, I must say, is not so common in Thailand.  There are a lot of greenery, there are places for walking.  True, some of our compatriots say that they have never seen a gardener work in a hotel during their entire stay.  Therefore, all the vegetation looks more natural than well-groomed.  However, this did not cause any inconvenience to any of the vacationers.  By the way, the presence of a spacious private territory with lots of trees and flowers for many travelers has become one of the key points in choosing a hotel.  After all, it is much nicer to leave the room to be in the garden than on a noisy city street. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The overwhelming majority of vacationers in their comments indicate that they were very pleased with the location of the hotel.  So, it is located far from the noisy center.  In addition, the sea and the beach are literally around the corner.  It is not difficult to get from the hotel to the city center of Pattaya.  Garden Sea View is a ten-minute walk from the street, where tuk-tuks ply for quick access to Walking Street and the waterfront.  Some travelers reached the center of Pattaya even on foot.  According to them, they were very pleased with the opportunity to make such walks.  If you don‚Äôt want to <span>walk a</span> lot <span>,</span> you can always use a taxi or rent a car or motobike.  Also in their reviews, many tourists note the delight of having the Temple of Truth near the hotel.  This magnificent building can be admired directly from the hotel.  You can get to it by taxi or on foot.  You will be charged 200 baht for entry.  Here, according to our compatriots, there is a Russian-speaking guide who will gladly give you an entertaining tour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel garden sea view" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1310962.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, as already mentioned, guests staying at the hotel were satisfied.  However, there were some complaints.  So, judging by the reviews of tourists, the Garden Sea View hotel would have a higher, if higher, if the rooms here were in better condition.  According to our compatriots, most of the housing stock needs to be renovated and updated.  This is especially true of rooms in the bungalow, which many former guests do not advise to settle.  As for the furniture, it is, according to vacationers, although not new, but high-quality and in good condition.  The same goes for technology.  Many liked the availability of a kettle and kitchenware in the rooms, so you can always prepare your favorite drink without leaving the room. </p><p>  A number of complaints of guests regarding plumbing.  So, some complained about a not very comfortable shower (the watering can is fixed on the wall and it is impossible to remove it), others were unhappy with the leaking toilet.  For these reasons, a number of guests lowered their ratings for the hotel.  Tourists hope that soon such shortcomings will be eliminated. </p><p>  Otherwise, there are no complaints about the numbers.  So, they seemed to the guests quite spacious.  Many also note large balconies where you can sit comfortably and have a cup of tea or a glass of wine and enjoy the surroundings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Garden Sea View Pattaya Thailand" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1310963.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Staff, service </h2><p>  Our compatriots had no particular complaints about the work of the Garden Sea View employees.  So, according to the guests, the rooms were cleaned every day.  True, she was not very thorough, but none of the guests delivered any particular inconvenience.  Maids also regularly replenished supplies of personal hygiene and drinking water.  If suddenly they forgot to bring something, then you can always call the reception and ask to fix the error.  As for the change of towels, they were updated every other day, and bed linen - a couple of times a week. </p><p>  As for the other hotel staff, in general, as our compatriots note, everyone here is quite friendly and welcoming.  You will always be helped to resolve any issue. </p><h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  The Garden Sea View Hotel (Pattaya), the photo of which can be seen in this article, offers its guests meals based on the "breakfast only" system or half board.  Also, some tourists chose not to pay in advance for meals at the hotel.  So, according to them, in the mornings they could have a cup of coffee in their room and have a snack, for example, with cereals bought in a supermarket, and eat fully later in the city or on the beach.  Those who ate in the hotel restaurant in the morning claim that, despite the fact that breakfast continues until 10 in the morning, it is advisable to arrive early, at 7-8.  The fact is that despite the fact that cooks always try to replenish the ending dishes, by the end of the meal you may no longer get the tidbits. </p><p>  As for the menu, almost all the guests were satisfied with it.  So, for breakfast you can eat eggs cooked in different variations, bacon, sausages, fresh pastries, sweets, fruits and vegetables.  Also, of course, you will be offered several Thai dishes.  Moreover, you can choose them in accordance with your taste - sharp or not. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, the selection of dishes is also very diverse.  According to our compatriots, there are excellent cooks at Garden Sea View Resort (Pattaya) who do not get tired of delighting guests with various delicious dishes of not only Thai but also European cuisine.  If you paid only breakfast or half board, then you can always at any time of the day also eat in the hotel restaurant, but for an additional fee.  As travelers note, the prices on the menu here, as they say, do not bite.  Basically, many tourists still preferred to eat outside the hotel.  After all, both in Pattaya itself and in the rest of Thailand, there is no shortage of cafes and restaurants.  Moreover, they cook almost everywhere well, and the prices are very reasonable.  In addition, experienced travelers are advised not to ignore the shingles (mobile food stalls) on the streets.  Also be sure to visit the grocery markets where you can buy fresh fruits and seafood, which you will be prepared here for a small surcharge. </p><p>  Garden Sea View also has several bars with a wide selection of drinks for every taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Garden Sea View Pattaya photo" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1310964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Garden Sea View Hotel (Pattaya, Thailand) has everything you need for a comfortable stay and pastime.  So, on its territory there are two outdoor pools.  Next to them are equipped with sunbathing terraces with a sufficient number of sun loungers and parasols for all guests.  The largest of the pools also has a jacuzzi.  According to vacationers, he himself is quite large, with different depths.  So it will be comfortable for both confident swimmers and those who prefer to feel the bottom under their feet.  There is also a section for children in the pool. </p><p>  Some guests complained that in the water you can often see fallen leaves and flowers.  However, most of the vacationers were not embarrassed.  After all, next to the pool there are trees that give the shadow, which is so necessary on a hot day.  Therefore, most tourists did not bother a couple of leaves in the water. </p><p>  There is also an outdoor gym on site.  It is equipped only with a roof.  Exercise machines here are far from new, however, a magnificent view of the sea opens from the hall.  Therefore, many vacationers enjoyed visiting it.  And in general, according to experienced travelers, it is difficult to find hotels with a modern large gym in a city like Pattaya. </p><p>  Garden Sea also offers its visitors laundry and dry cleaning services, visit a beauty salon and an Internet cafe, and rent a car or motorbike.  The hotel also has several meeting rooms.  In public areas of the hotel, guests can connect to free Wi-Fi.  However, a number of tourists expressed the opinion that it would be nice to be able to use wireless Internet in the rooms. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of travelers, one of the main advantages of the hotel in question is its location right on the beach.  Not all Pattaya hotels can boast of this.  In addition, the hotel has its own beach, so guests will not have to pay extra for renting sun loungers and umbrellas.  Moreover, the water here, according to tourists, is much cleaner than in other places in Pattaya.  In short, the Garden Sea View Hotel offers its guests an excellent opportunity for a beach holiday. </p><p>  Despite this, many experienced travelers are advised to visit other beaches.  True, in Pattaya they for the most part are not very clean.  But many tourists are happy to visit the nearby islands with magnificent beaches and clear water.  You can get to them from the pier of Pattaya by ferry or boat. </p><p>  In general, most of our compatriots are sure that Thailand is not suitable for a calm and measured pastime.  After all, there is a lot of interesting places that you should definitely visit.  Therefore, do not focus only on beach vacations, but travel, discovering this amazing country!  Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for this.  So, you can rent a motorbike or a car.  You can also always book an excursion to the travel agency or use the services of a taxi and tuk-tuk. </p>
