At first it was called either a re-flight or a re-flight.  She belonged to the uniform of the pilots.  It was a very comfortable hat, which could always be folded and put in your pocket, as well as in your bosom.  In addition to the caps, the pilots had to use heavy helmets.  It was necessary to change clothes quickly.  The cap of the cap fits very well for this.  One movement of the hand - and it is folded and removed.  Comfortable and at the same time elegant, she liked her style and women.  Children, both toddlers and adolescents, were especially praised.  You can sew it yourself in a few minutes, you only need the correct pattern of a military cap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military cap pattern" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/396168.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  How to find a cap </h2><p>  There is one simplest option for cutting caps.  It is only necessary to measure the circumference of the head and outline the height of the future headgear.  Then it remains only to draw everything on paper.  The resulting size of the head circumference should be divided into two and draw a horizontal line.  Next, you need to determine the height.  The pattern of the soldier's cap is different in that it needs to indicate the folds.  Therefore, one more must be added to the planned height.  It is necessary to immediately outline the fold lines.  Round the top of the drawing.  The pattern is ready, now you just need to figure out how to sew a cap.  It will not be difficult to do this, in this headdress there are only two identical parts.  The most important thing is to carefully connect, sweep and grind by car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soldier cap pattern" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/396176.jpg" width="500"></div>

Before work, the entire fabric should be ironed thoroughly so that subsequently the finished product does not shrink.  When the fabric is prepared, then you can start cutting.  It must first be folded in half with the front side inward.  Then he pins with the help of tailor pins a pattern of a military cap, that is, the pattern of the future headgear.  It must be carefully circled in chalk.  Next, you need to draw a second line.  On the sides and on top at a distance of one centimeter, and on the bottom - at one and a half to two centimeters (depends on the quality of the fabric, if it is loose, then more, and vice versa).  Do the same with the lining.  The result should be four details.  Now, probably, it is already clear how to make a military cap at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a cap" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/396183.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We sew a cap in another way </h2><p>  There are different options for sewing caps.  If the first is solid parts, then the second is of several.  There is a military cap pattern, where, in addition to the main side part, you need to make the upper one.  In this case, you also need to measure the circumference of the head and outline the height.  Only now will have to draw two details.  As in the first embodiment, the resulting head circumference should be divided in half.  The resulting size is measured on paper.  Then up hold the height of the future cap.  You should get a rectangle.  Round up and down a little (the drawing should resemble a cropped oval).  To get wrinkles on the cap, you need to cut an oval, that is, the upper part.  To do this, horizontally you need to draw a line equal to half the circumference of the head.  Divide it in half.  From the center, draw a line up to a height of four centimeters.  From the obtained point, draw oval lines at each end of the first mark.  It should turn out to be semi-oval.  Drawings are ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a military cap" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/396186.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cut the second type of caps </h2><p>  After the military cap pattern is ready, it must be cut out.  Next, you need to prepare the fabric.  After steaming, fold the fabric in half with the front side inward.  Pin the patterns with pins on the fabric and circle with chalk.  It should be borne in mind that we have two details.  When cutting the side parts after cutting, you should get two parts.  To cut out the upper part, you also need to fold the fabric in half, only with a straight line to the fold.  After cutting, the upper part should be one piece.  Since the soldier cap is often sewn on the lining, you need to immediately cut it. </p><p>  The pattern of the cap, like any other garment, is the main element.  There is a well-known proverb that it is better to measure once than then cut seven times.  The correctness of the construction of the drawing will determine how the cap then "sits" on the head. </p>
