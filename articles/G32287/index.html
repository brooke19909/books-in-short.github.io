    <h2>  The recreation center "Lyudmila": how to get there? </h2><p>  The village of Vityazevo, where the Lyudmila boarding house is located, is 10 km from Anapa, so first you need to get to this resort city, and then use a taxi, bus, minibus or transfer booked in advance and get to your destination.  Although if you choose the air mode of transport, the distance that you will have to cover from the airport to the village of Vityazevo will be only 5 km, while to Anapa - 15 km. </p><p>  There is a railway station in Anapa, more precisely in the village of Dzhemete.  And since the price of train tickets is the most affordable, most vacationers choose this type of movement.  Residents of cities located at a distance of 300 km from Vityazevo (recreation center "Lyudmila") can also get to Anapa by bus.  However, if the distance is greater, then it is better to refuse this type of transport, since such a road is very tiring, especially in summer.  Arriving in Vityazevo, you should find 4 Serebryanaya Street, where Lyudmila is located. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Upon arrival in Vityazevo recreation center "Lyudmila" makes a positive impression on all its guests.

After all, there is everything that is required for a pleasant pastime - luxurious sandy beaches, quality food, many opportunities for entertainment and so on.  However, there are people who claim that they will never rest in Vityazevo again.  The recreation center "Lyudmila" also receives negative reviews.  Although, as a rule, they complain about the food of the boarding house.  Some vacationers claim that it is too fat, and it is better to eat in other places.  Sometimes people living in economy rooms leave negative feedback about some of the inconvenience caused by the lack of a shower and shared toilets, however, the administration warns about this in advance and you need to think about these nuances before booking a room.  If comfort is very important for you, then it is better to opt for more expensive options, which are many at the Lyudmila recreation center. </p>
