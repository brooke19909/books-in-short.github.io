  <section class="page js-page"><h1>S√£o Paolo Fuori le Mura is one of the four great basilicas of Rome. St. Peter's Basilica</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many centuries, Rome continues to store countless incorruptible Christian shrines, relics, as well as masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture.  That is why the Eternal City is a center of attraction not only for tourists from all over the world, but also for many pilgrims eager to find spiritual wealth. </p><p>  Especially intensively, guests flock to Rome in the Jubilee years - the period when believers receive a gift from the pope of indulgence (absolution).  At this time, applicants for papal mercy must visit the four great basilicas of Rome.  These temples - the Papal Basilica - are under the direct jurisdiction of the Holy See and have the highest rank in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church.  Our article will discuss one of them - the Basilica of S√£o Paulo Fuori le Mura. </p><h2>  How are papal basilicas different from other churches? </h2><p>  To receive the Atonement, or ‚Äúpapal indulgence,‚Äù a repentant confession and a forgiven sinner should partake of and pass through the Holy Doors.  The pontiffs are ordered to open them using a special rite once a century - in the year that the Roman Catholic Church proclaims Holy.  It is the presence of the Papal Altar, in which the pope celebrates the Eucharist with several priests, as well as the Holy Doors and the Papal Basilica differs from other Roman churches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.italy-museum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The great basilica of Rome." class="if uuid-3124492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124492.jpg"></div><h2>  First Great Basilica </h2><p>  The rules for providing indulgences were set forth in the papal bull of 1300.  According to this document, the recipient of the atonement was required to visit two Roman basilicas, in which followers of the teachings of Christ were buried. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the Konstantinovsky Basilica </h2><p>  One of them is St. Peter's Basilica.  The temple was built in the place where, according to legend, the first of the Apostles Jesus Christ crucified by the emperor Nero was buried - St. Peter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viator.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Peter's Basilica" class="if uuid-3124465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124465.jpg"></div><p>  The cathedral is one of the great centers of Catholicism and is known as the largest church in the world.  St. Peter's Basilica is used as a solemn venue for the largest church holidays.  The magnificent church building was erected in the years 1506-1626 on the site of the church, once built by Emperor Konstantin I, so the basilica is called "Konstantinovskaya".  The temple is one of the first places in the list of 7 basilicas of Rome visited by pilgrims.  Several generations of great artists and sculptors took part in its creation: Raphael, Michelangelo, Bramante, Bernini. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tektonministries.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the temple" class="if uuid-3124470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124470.jpg"></div><p>  The basilica seats up to 60 thousand people inside and about four hundred thousand people outside the temple, on its square. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  About St. Paul's Basilica outside the city walls </h2><p>  The second is the church of S√£o Paulo Fuori le Mura.  This temple is also known as the "Basilica of St. Paul outside the city walls."  Its construction began at the dawn of the fourth century, after the decrees of the emperor Constantine were announced, prohibiting persecution of Christians and proclaiming tolerance for their faith.  According to legend, the temple was built in a place where believers revered the memory of St. Paul decapitated in 65 by the emperor Nero - this is in the vicinity of Rome, outside the walls of Aurelian.  Around 324, the church of S√£o Paulo Fuori le Mura was consecrated by Pope Sylvester. </p><h2>  Further history of the main basilicas of Rome </h2><p>  In 1350, Pope Clement VI added the Great Basilica another basilica - the Cathedral of St. John of Lateran.  The temple received the title "Mother and Head of All Churches of the City and the World" and is considered the most important in the Catholic Diocese of the world, since it contains the Department of the Roman Bishop and the Papal Throne.  The construction of the cathedral was laid by Emperor Constantine after the adoption of the Christian faith in 324.  Initially, the temple was called the "Basilica of the Savior." </p><p>  Fourth, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (1390), dedicated to the service of the Virgin Mary, joined the Great Cohort.  This church, located on the Esquiline hill (Monti district), is the only one in which the early Christian structure is preserved.  The temple was erected during the reign of Pope Sixtus III (432-440).  The cathedral building is endowed with the privilege of extraterritoriality and does not belong to the Vatican - it is the territory of the state of Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About small basilicas </h2><p>  It should be noted that there are two more small basilicas.  Although the churches of Santa Maria degli Angeli and San Francesco (Assisi, Umbria) also have a Papal altar, they still hold the status of small, because they do not have Holy Doors.  It is for this reason that the basilicas are not among the fundamental temples that allow you to get "papal indulgence" (indulgence) in the Jubilee year. </p><h2>  S√£o Paolo Fuori le Mura (Rome) </h2><p>  The complex of St. Paul is one of the most beautiful places in the Eternal City.  This can be seen by reading the photos posted in the article.  Despite all the troubles of the noisy centuries, the temple of S√£o Paulo Fuori le Mura is well preserved.  The cultural, historical and spiritual value of this place is undoubted for both local residents and tourists.  In 1980, the temple was inscribed on the World Heritage List. </p><div class="photo" data-original="portal.visitlazio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Statue of St. Paul." class="if uuid-3124481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124481.jpg"></div><h2>  About the history of the temple </h2><p>  This church was erected over the burial of St. Paul, executed by the emperor Nero in 65 AD.  The body of the holy martyr was transferred to Via Ostiense and buried in a necropolis.  For centuries, his grave was a place of universal worship of believers, pilgrims from different countries came here. </p><p>  The Basilica of St. Paul was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I. During the reign of Valentinian I, the building was expanded.  In 386, Emperor Theodosius I erected another temple in this place, higher and more magnificent than the previous one, with four side naves and a nave.  During the reign of Pope Gregory the Great (from 590 to 604), the basilica was reconstructed again: now the altar was located directly above the tomb of the saint.  In the 9th century, the church was significantly damaged during the invasion of the Saracens.  It was restored by John VIII.  In the period from 1220 to 1241, a monastery appeared at the cathedral.  In the summer of 1823 the temple was almost completely burned down.  The basilica was rebuilt in 1854 and consecrated again under Pius IX. </p><h2>  Description of the temple: general view </h2><p>  Outside, the cathedral resembles an ordinary fortress: its appearance is simple and restrained, the main decorations are hidden inside the building.  The length of the basilica reaches 131.66 meters, the height in the highest part of the temple is 29.70 meters, the width is about 65 meters.  St. Paul's Basilica is the 2nd largest in Rome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civitavecchia.portmobility.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General form" class="if uuid-3124474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124474.jpg"></div><h2>  Patio </h2><p>  Kjostro is an unusually beautiful courtyard, preserved during the fire.  He deserves special attention.  Marble columns supporting graceful arches are installed around the perimeter in the courtyard.  The cornice of the arcade is decorated with a mosaic pattern made by artists from the famous Vazaletto family.  Twisted columns and arches remind of the long and difficult history of the temple.  The carvings and stucco molding of the courtyard of St. Paul‚Äôs Basilica are considered unsurpassed masterpieces. </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  Three doors lead to the temple, decorated with fragments from the life of the holy martyrs: Peter and Paul, Jesus Christ, the apostles and the Holy Trinity.  Each of the doors is decorated in a special way.  It is known that plates from the door that stood here until the beginning of the 19th century are inserted in the right.  Nearby is an image of the resurrection of Christ. </p><p>  The interior of the basilica, represented by rich decoration in the style of classicism and neoclassicism, amazes with its luxury and grace.  Inside the temple are five halls.  The central is divided into parts of eighty granite columns.  The ceiling mural and colonnade date from the 19th century.  The ceiling is decorated with carved gilded panels.  The cathedral also preserved part of the construction of the V century - the arch of Galla Placidia, erected in honor of the wife of the emperor of Rome, as well as fragments of mosaics.  Each of the windows is decorated with a unique pattern that transmits the sun's rays and fills the temple with warm light.  Floor mosaic decorations of the basilica represent images of various animals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civitavecchia.portmobility.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple interior" class="if uuid-3124475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124475.jpg"></div><p>  The Gallery of S√£o Paolo Fuori Le Mura presents to its guests portraits of 236 pontiffs located in special medallions.  Only a few of them remained unfilled.  There is a belief that after the death of the last pope, when all the medallions are filled, the end of the world will come. </p><h2>  Sarcophagus with holy relics </h2><p>  In the center of the temple, visitors see the main attraction of the church - a sarcophagus with incorrupt relics of St. Paul.  Above it stands a tabernacle (1285) with Christian and pagan subjects.  And next to it is a five-meter XIII century candlestick.  To celebrate Mass over holy relics is the exclusive domain of the Pope.  There are special openings in the tomb so that visitors can stick pieces of cloth inside that would allow them to touch the shrine.  Not far from the sarcophagus is an altar with a window so that those who wish can confess their sins. </p><p>  The basilica also preserves other imperishable Christian values: a fragment of the Life-giving Cross of the Lord, a part of the staff of St. Paul, with whom the great associate made his trekking tours, the relics of the apostles, martyrs and bishops. </p><p>  It is known that in 2011 the tenth international festival of sacred music was held in St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral.  In the sacred walls of the basilica, the symphony orchestra performed the magnificent music of Anton Bruckner - symphony No. 7. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vinoconvistablog.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomb of the saint." class="if uuid-3124485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124485.jpg"></div><h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  In the south of the transept is a monastery, the building of which is considered one of the most beautiful medieval buildings.  Double columns of various shapes are noteworthy.  Some pillars are equipped with inserts of gold and colored glass mosaic.  The monastery preserves the ancient sarcophagi and parts of the destroyed basilica. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rome-roma.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of the monastery" class="if uuid-3124476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3124476.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  S√£o Paulo Fuori le Mura organizes excursions for guests, giving tourists the opportunity to visit the basilica, monastery, courtyard, museum. </p><p>  The temple is open daily for guests.
