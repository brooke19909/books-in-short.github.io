    <p>  Tourists call both of these hotels the most successful for those who travel by car.  Spacious rooms like holidaymakers, but many notice that they are not very well cleaned.  Someone is delighted with the view of the hippodrome, which is located here next door, but someone generally likes the location of hotels among conifers.  In general, there are much more satisfied tourists, but hotels are not advised for guests with small children, as their accommodation is not provided here (there are no cribs or highchairs). </p><h2>  A piece of Moscow in Kostroma </h2><p>  Searching for a hotel in Kostroma can lead tourists to another rather attractive option in the city center.  We are talking about a hotel called Moskovskaya Zastava, which is located on May Day Street, at number 5. It is located on the very banks of the Volga, within walking distance from it are a <span>monument to Ivan Susanin</span> and Central Park.  Under the windows of the hotel there is parking, where motorists can leave their "iron" horses.  For a pleasant stay, the hotel offers guests to visit two baths, one of which is equipped with a font, and the other has a relaxation room.  There is also a fully equipped conference room, which can accommodate 50 people.  Conference participants are also offered several options for a coffee break to choose from. </p>

    <p>  It offers guests an excellent three-story restaurant with an open veranda, two conference rooms with all necessary equipment, a sauna with a pool.  Throughout the hotel, including the rooms, there is free Wi-Fi, so no one will be left without a connection. </p><p>  Guests choose this hotel for its convenient location and low prices.  However, the impression of the rooms is twofold: everything seems to be cozy and comfortable, but the furniture is quite old, the windows are not plastic in most rooms.  On the whole, there remains a feeling of a return to the USSR, but this does not bother many. </p>
