    <p>  On the <span>Sokolnicheskaya</span> metro <span>line</span> of the city of Moscow between Sportivnaya and Universitet, the Vorobevy Gory station is located.  Its northern part goes to the Khamovniki district, which belongs to the Central Administrative District.  In the south, the station is adjacent to the Western administrative district in the Ramensky and Gagarinsky districts, which belong to the South-Western Moscow administrative district. </p><p>  The first name of the station is ‚ÄúLeninsky mountains‚Äù.  It lasted until May 12, 1999, then it was changed.  Now this place began to be named after the historically famous Sparrow Hills, </p><p>  As you know, a rather unique place is the capital of the Russian Federation, Moscow.  The Vorobevy Gory metro station, in turn, also has a modern design.  It is decorated with <span>bridge piers</span> and walls made of white and green marble.  Passengers walk on the floor of <span>Metlakh tiles.</span>  The walls of the paths are completely transparent thanks to the continuous glazing.  Passengers enjoy the view of the Moscow River and the Sparrow Hills, the new building of the Academy of Sciences and the Luzhniki Grand Sports Arena. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The station attendant sits on the original captain‚Äôs bridge. </p><p>  The open part of this station is the largest, in comparison with the rest.  As much as 284 meters is the length of the corridors and the central hall. </p><h3>  <strong>Section 2. Metro station Vorobevy Gory.</strong>  <strong>Construction history</strong> </h3>

    <p>  On January 12, 1959, ‚ÄúVorobyovy Gory‚Äù began its history.  Initially, it was planned the global construction of the station with the construction of a tunnel under the river.  But the project was too expensive for those times, had to change plans.  They decided to build a station on the bridge, on its lower tier.  The top was given to the movement of cars.  The bridge was built quickly.  All work took 15 months and was completed by 1958.  The rush was not accidental, because the International Youth Festival was approaching.  Too fast construction was not the most durable.  Replacing metal poles with cheaper reinforced concrete has caused many problems.  Winter construction forced workers to add salt to concrete, which made it possible to lower the freezing temperature of water.  But this led to further corrosion of the structures.  Already in 1959, the Vorobevy Gory metro station was completely stopped.  The strongest July rainfall led to the fact that the ceiling began to crumble.  The station was closed for reconstruction only after cracks began to appear in the plates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In October 1983, it was limited for passengers, and after three years no trains even ran through it.  The station was circled on new bridges, standing on durable supports. </p><p>  The reconstruction dragged on for a long 19 years.  This is due to historical events in the country.  December 14, 2002 the station was born again. </p><h3>  <strong>Section 3. Metro station Vorobevy Gory.</strong>  <strong>Characteristics</strong> </h3>

    <p>  From the Sparrow Hills it is possible to visit two <span>banks of the Moscow River.</span>  One of the exits allows passengers to get to Vorobevskaya and <span>Andreevskaya embankments, the</span> second to Luzhnetskaya, as well as to the Luzhniki sports complex, which is a very important attraction of the capital.  The 1980 Olympic Games were held here.  This is one of the largest Russian sports grounds. </p><p>  The Vorobevy Gory Park also greets passengers at the station.  There are several excursion routes.  Attractions can be enjoyed alone or as part of a team. </p><p>  During a walk along the promenade, everyone will be able to see the St. Andrew's Monastery, the Trinity Church. </p><p>  Noteworthy is the observation deck, which has access from the station.  Films were often shot here.  Happy newlyweds, guests of the capital and locals love to come here for a walk and enjoy the beauties of this wonderful place. </p><p>  "Sparrow Hills ... what metro station?  Where is it?"  - Such questions, perhaps, can be heard quite rarely in Moscow.  Why?  Yes, because it is a very visited place, not even hundreds, but thousands of people flock there every day.  Getting lost or getting lost is simply unrealistic - the flow of people will certainly lead you to one of the most popular places in the Russian capital. </p>
