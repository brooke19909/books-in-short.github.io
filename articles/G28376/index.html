    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in the Blue Wave Suite 4 * hotel you may encounter a number of negative points.  They are reflected in negative reviews as follows: </p><ul><li>  the hotel does not give out free beach towels, and so you have to bring your own or buy new ones at the supermarket; </li><li>  the sea is located far from the hotel, despite the fact that this is the first line; </li><li>  there are no catering establishments on the beach, and therefore, to have a bite to eat, you will have to return to the hotel; </li><li>  rather monotonous food, which bothers after a few days; </li><li>  the animation is rather sluggish; </li><li>  It is worth noting that the view from the windows of the rooms facing the courtyard is very unpleasant - garbage cans, fittings, bricks and other hotel vital products; </li><li>  for the use of air conditioning you have to leave an impressive deposit of $ 20; </li><li>  a very small shower, in which it will be inconvenient for people of large physique to bathe; </li><li>  all entertainment after eleven in the evening is paid; </li><li>  very little food that can be fed to babies; </li><li>  old air conditioners can not cope with their task; </li><li>  plumbing requires replacement; </li><li>  a lot of noise from the disco, which is held after dinner; </li><li>  in rooms, wireless internet is very slow; </li><li>  tourists are not informed that only one of the 6 buildings of the hotel has been repaired, and therefore, most likely, you will have to live in not the best conditions; </li><li>  When cleaning maids do not pay enough time to the bathroom (the toilet does not wash and the mirror is not wiped); </li><li>  the entry into the sea is covered with soft sand, but after a couple of meters sharp stones begin; </li><li>  for such a large number of vacationers (about 700 people) the pool is too small; </li><li>  if you are booking a two-room suite, please note that the air conditioner will be installed only in one of the bedrooms, and in the second it will be very stuffy; </li><li>  use of the safe is possible only at an additional cost; </li><li>  stained bath towels; </li><li>  the hotel is quite far from the airport, and therefore the transfer can stretch for several tiring hours; </li><li>  the hotel has an incredibly small area, which is almost completely occupied by buildings and pools (there is nowhere to go for a walk); </li><li>  despite a well-functioning reservation system, the hotel has more guests than the number of available rooms, and therefore some tourists are accommodated in neighboring "triples"; </li><li>  the buffet menu contains very specific Turkish soups, which may not be to the taste of the European; </li><li>  a limit is set for the use of wireless Internet (free of charge 200 MB per day); </li><li>  low-quality powder juices; </li><li>  on the way to the hotel you will have to cross a busy roadway, on which there is no pedestrian crossing; </li><li>  the hotel has very expensive excursions (it is better to buy them from local guides); </li><li>  if you leave the hotel early, lunch box will not be provided to you; </li><li>  huge lines are always lined up to the counter where dishes from the chef are served, and therefore not all guests manage to try it; </li><li>  in the first days of your stay, finding a hotel beach is quite a challenge. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  For most travelers, one of the most favorite tourist destinations is Turkey.  Hotel Blue Wave <span>Suite Hotel 4 *</span> many choose because of affordable prices.  Be prepared for the fact that the road from the airport to the hotel will take you several hours.  Nevertheless, a positive impression of the institution compensates for all the inconvenience.  You will certainly enjoy the elegant interior of the hall, the cleanliness of the territory and the comfort of the rooms.  Speaking of rooms, it is worth noting that, with the exception of the main building, they are quite outdated.  But if you are not going to spend the whole day indoors, then most likely do not pay attention to it. </p><p>  The food in this hotel deserves all praise, despite the fact that it is pretty monotonous - a wide range allows you to constantly experiment.  The hotel is called a real sweet tooth paradise.  This is due to the huge amount of confectionery served in the restaurant.  The only thing that disappoints is not very high-quality drinks.  If we talk about animation, then it is represented by only two employees.  Nevertheless, their energy and enthusiasm is enough to amuse all vacationers.  Speaking of the beach, it is worth noting that it is clean, well maintained and well equipped.  The only thing that spoils the impression is its remoteness from the hotel. </p>
