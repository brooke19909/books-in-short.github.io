The hotel is located three kilometers from the famous Sousse and two kilometers from the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPort El Kantaoui.  It is not so difficult for tourists to get to the hotel, since the airport is only 26 kilometers away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dreams beach tunisia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529705.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel was built in 1988, and its last reconstruction was carried out in 2004.  Its total area is 1700 square meters.  The complex is equally suitable for family vacations and for friendly companies.  Its main advantage is its location - on the seashore.  The hotel consists of one six-story building. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In total, Dreams Beach (Tunisia) has 93 rooms.  All apartments are divided into the following categories: suites, double apartments, family and standard. </p><p>  Since the hotel is an economy class establishment, you should not expect luxury apartments in it.  For example, a description of a standard room.  The apartments are quite spacious.  They are furnished with simple but comfortable and functional furniture.  The rooms are equipped with air conditioning, telephone, bathroom, safe and TV.  Most of them have a loggia.  All apartments are decorated in blue and white tones in tune with the color of the sea waves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The complete set of apartments of other categories is approximately the same as standard rooms. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Dreams Beach (Tunisia) offers its guests breakfast or half board.  What <span>type of food</span> to choose is up to you.  The food is served buffet style.  Breakfast starts at seven in the morning and lasts until nine.  In the mornings, the hotel serves tea, coffee, cereal, eggs, yoghurts, rice porridge. </p><p>  Dinner lasts from seven in the evening until nine.  In the evening, the food on the tables is more varied.  Guests are served salads, fish, meat (mainly chicken), rice, pasta, desserts, which are cakes, puddings and fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dreams beach 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529707.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For dinner, the restaurant does not serve absolutely any drinks, they are not included in the price, so they need to be paid separately. </p><p>  The restaurant and bars offer pizza and other Italian dishes, as well as Tunisian and European dishes.  There is a bar on the beach offering refreshments to tourists. </p><p>  Near the hotel Dreams Beach 3 * there are <span>cafes, restaurants</span> where you can always have a tasty meal, the prices in institutions are quite low, as in all of Tunisia.  In addition, within walking distance there is a supermarket where you can buy products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Dreams Beach 3 * is far from a new hotel.  However, it is maintained in good condition.  The hotel has a small area with a garden.  There are children's and adult pools, near which there is a relaxation area with sun loungers and umbrellas.  The complex has a laundry room, conference room, car rental.  The hotel also has a 24-hour reception, hairdresser, night club, beauty salon, gift shop. </p><p>  On the territory of Dreams Beach 3 * <span>(Tunisia, Sousse)</span> there is a currency exchanger, a tour desk and an Internet cafe.  Wi-Fi is free in the lobby.  For kids there is a mini club and a playground. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The main advantage of Dreams Beach (Tunisia, Sousse) - 1 line.  Not every hotel can boast of such a location.  From the hotel building to the sea - 200 meters.  For those tourists who appreciate a beach holiday, simply can not find a better place.  The hotel has its own beach, equipped with sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas, for which you have to pay, but their cost is low.  There is a drink bar on the coast where you can refresh yourself during the day. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  As we mentioned, the Dreams Beach Hotel (Tunisia) is located between Sousse and Port El Kantaoui.  Tourists always have a choice where to go for a walk.  The center of Sousse can be reached in ten minutes by shuttle bus.  The fare is one dinar (this is about 30 rubles).  Port El Kantaoui is also a short drive away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to the sea 200 m" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529708.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sousse is the most popular youth resort in Tunisia.  It will be interesting to watch it for supporters of entertainment and parties.  The city is filled with discos, thalassotherapy centers, restaurants and cafes.  There is a whole port of pleasure yachts and ships. </p><p>  The town is divided into three parts: historical with medieval medina, central (residential areas) and tourist (numerous hotels have been built on its territory).  Ten kilometers from Sousse is a suburb, which is also a resort area - Port el Kantaoui. </p><p>  In Sousse itself, the sea is not very clear, but there is a lot of entertainment.  Hotels with good beaches are located closer to Port El Cantui.  Hotel Dreams Beach 3 * was built in the same area.  Here you can see many modern complexes from expensive to cheapest, but not one of them is located as close to the sea as the Dreams Beach. </p><p>  In Sousse, tourists can go shopping and buy all kinds of souvenirs for their families.  It offers tourists a large four-story supermarket called Soula Center, which is located near the medina.  Many original items can also be purchased on the market in the old district.  Not to mention the fact that each hotel has its own small shops. </p><h2>  Attractions Sousse </h2><p>  Sousse is full of interesting places that will be interesting to see for inquisitive tourists.  The central historical attraction of the city is the medina, surrounded by a well-preserved fortress wall.  On its territory are old towers, mosques, catacombs with graves of the early Christian era and a market.  The medieval fortress Ribat is the most visited local attraction.  Well preserved its integral part - the 35-meter tower Nador.  Ribat fortress was once built as a defensive structure to counter sea raids.  The soldiers who served here, in their free time from military operations, prayed, studied Islam and preached among the local population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dreams beach tunisia souss 1 line" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529709.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the fortress there is a Great Mosque with minaret towers.  Throughout history, it has been rebuilt many times, although outwardly it does not stand out. </p><p>  To know the life and lifestyle of Tunisian families, it is worth visiting Dar Essid (house museum).  This is an ordinary traditional Tunisian house, built back in 928.  It is probably the most interesting attraction of the city.  A very noble family once lived in this building, and now the descendants organized a museum in the house to familiarize guests with the life of the indigenous population.  The whole room is literally saturated with the spirit of antiquity and luxury, ancient paintings, utensils, jewelry, furniture and even a marriage contract with his wives of the owner of the house are stored here (the document is more than 700 years old). </p><p>  In Sousse you can see the ancient reservoir of Sofra.  It is a large tank (the length of the tank is 30 meters), which goes deep underground, it is not at all easy to find.  It is still not known who built such an amazing structure: either the Romans, or the Arabs.  But it is known for certain that the tank supplied the whole city with water.  Outwardly, the structure is of no interest, but the history of origin is worthy of attention. </p><p>  But the catacombs of Sousse are always of great interest to tourists.  They were found in 1885 and are ancient Christian burials (II-IV century).  The length of the catacombs reaches several kilometers, they originate in the center of the city and go beyond its borders.  Only a small section of them is open for visiting, since the remaining parts are unsafe. </p><p>  Every year, thousands of tourists are attracted by the amphitheater.  The construction of the Roman Empire is included in the UNESCO list.  The theater is often compared to the Colosseum in Rome.  The amphitheater consists of three floors, but it is believed that once there were four.  Next to the building is the Archaeological Museum, which houses a collection of <span>Roman mosaics.</span> </p><h2>  Dreams Beach 3 * (Tunisia, Sousse): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, it is worth paying attention to the reviews of tourists who have been vacationing in it recently in order to form a more real impression.  The three-star complex belongs to the category of economy-class establishments, and therefore it is not worthwhile to initially raise excessive requirements for it.  Many hotels have been built in Sousse, among which there are fashionable five-star complexes and very cheap hotels.  In principle, all resorts and hotels in Tunisia are inexpensive, for which they are appreciated by tourists.  Therefore, lovers of sea holidays, who did not have time to visit such a wonderful country, should think about the fact that there are excellent options for cheap holidays in a country like Tunisia (Sousse).  Dreams Beach is the hotel that can offer a budget holiday on the coast.  Its wonderful location is perhaps the main advantage of the complex.  It is unlikely that you can find a hotel nearby, which would be located the same way by the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dreams beach 3 tunisia souss reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529710.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  According to guests, the hotel is not very new, but kept in good condition and clean.  The lobby, reception and public areas are simple and concise.  There are no stunning interiors, as well as in other complexes of a similar level. </p><p>  The rooms of the hotel are quite spacious, made in oriental style, with simple but good functional furniture.  There is a wardrobe, bedside tables, a bed and a balcony.  It is better to take apartments with sea views.  Tourists are advised to pay extra for such amenities, otherwise the desired number cannot be obtained.  The apartments facing the street are noisier, so they are not so interesting.  The opportunity to watch a beautiful seascape from the windows in the morning is the key to an excellent mood for the whole day. </p><p>  The hotel is cleaned daily, the maids do their job well.  Six towels are given for each room, which are also changed every day.  Vacationers note the well-worn appearance of bed linen and towels, which have long been worth replacing with new ones.  Not all rooms have refrigerators and safes; they can be rented at the reception for a fee.  From detergents they give out only a bar of soap, there are no gels and shampoos. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for nutrition, the reviews regarding it are contradictory, as is often the case.  Some guests note a meager selection of food, especially for breakfast.  Others are generally satisfied, given the three-star level of the hotel.  But the dinners, according to tourists, are quite tasty.  Every evening, new dishes appeared on the tables: salads, soups, several types of side dishes (pasta, french fries, rice), beef, lamb, chicken.  Sometimes a chef spoils guests with lasagna, meatballs, meat casseroles, kidney omelettes, vegetable casseroles, and mutton ribs.  Breakfasts, as a rule, consist of salads, fresh and tasty baguettes, fried and fresh vegetables, sausages, fig jam, butter, yogurt. </p><p>  The restaurant serves creamy and chocolate puddings, cakes with grapes and peaches as desserts.  Drinks are served in the morning, but for dinner they need to be paid separately.  As a rule, tourists take sweets to the room and there they already drink coffee or tea with them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dreams beach 3 tunisia sousse" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is better to come to the restaurant on time, otherwise the later choice of dishes becomes more scarce, food at the buffet is not always replenished. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is an excellent supermarket where you can buy all the necessary products, if you do not plan to eat at the hotel.  The choice of food in it is quite decent.  In Tunisia, excellent local wine is sold.  According to tourists, it is tasty and of high quality, in order to purchase it, it is enough to go to Port al County.  Tunisia does not sell alcohol in every store. </p><p>  There are many cafes and restaurants near the hotel where you can also eat.  It serves local dishes and seafood.  Prices in such establishments, according to vacationers, are quite reasonable.  Which food option to choose is up to you. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the beach, which is impossible not to appreciate.  You can walk to the beach in one minute.  It is equipped with sunbeds, umbrellas, for which you have to pay.  On the shore there is a bar in which there is always soft drinks. </p><p>  The beach is sandy with a shallow comfortable entry into the water.  For children, the bottom is amazingly comfortable.  Tourists who like to swim can simply walk to the depths.  In the mornings, the sea is very clean and transparent, but after lunch a wave appears.  Sometimes algae come to the shore, they are periodically cleaned by hotel employees.  In Tunisia, there is a lot of garbage around, but the hotel's beach is always clean, it is cleaned daily. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  The hotel has a wonderful friendly staff, which can also be considered a virtue of this institution.  The employees of the complex are fluent in Russian, so there is simply no problem explaining at the reception.  Check-in occurs quickly, if there are cleaned rooms available, then you will be handed the keys without any problems long before 14.00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Dreams Beach Tunisia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1529715.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for apartments with a seascape, then you need to pay extra for them, negotiating no reception.  Moreover, the amount of money can be different, apparently, it all depends on who managed to bargain. </p><p>  At the hotel you can exchange money at the reception.  But near the hotel there is a bank branch in which the exchange rate is much more profitable.  Tourists should remember that during the celebration of Ramadan, you can be left without money if you do not exchange the amount you need first.  At such a time, neither exchangers nor many institutions work.  Therefore, such details should be thought out in advance. </p><p>  The hotel has two pools, one of which is for children, and the second for adults.  However, our tourists do not like to use them, because just around the corner is such a beautiful sea.  But foreign tourists often prefer to rest near the pools.  The hotel has a lot of Europeans (Germans, French) of retirement age.  Fans of outdoor activities can book sightseeing tours in the lobby of the complex, and it‚Äôs more profitable to do this with your tour operator.  There are no alternative travel reservations anywhere near the hotel, so hotel guides are the only option available. </p><p>  Vacationers are advised to independently visit all the attractions of Sousse, and then go on an overnight stay in the Sahara.  This amazing trip will not leave anyone indifferent.  It should be carried out in order to meet the dawn in the desert.  In the vicinity of the resort there are many interesting places that are worthy of the attention of tourists. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Dreams Beach, reviews of which are given in the article, is a good option for a budget holiday on the coast of Tunisia.  The hotel will appeal to those guests who are not too demanding on trifles.  If you do not pay attention to minor flaws and adequately understand that the hotel has a three-star status, and therefore you should not expect from it the attributes of five stars, then you can perfectly relax. </p>
