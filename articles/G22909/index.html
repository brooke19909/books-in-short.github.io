    <h2>  Who is this gadget for? </h2><p>  With a small purchase budget and high requirements for the stuffing of the device, the Meizu M2 Note 16Gb smartphone can be an excellent solution in such a situation.  The reviews highlight the stylish design of this device, which has a lot in common with the ‚Äúapple‚Äù solutions of the latest generation, but its cost is much lower.  At the same time, this device does not have obvious shortcomings, and its capabilities are almost completely consistent with the iPhone 6. Perhaps the latter‚Äôs operating system optimization is better.  And the camera, of course, is better.  But, on the other hand, this is not so important for most users.  Therefore, this gadget can rightfully be considered an ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù copy of the <span>iPhone 6,</span> which practically does not lose anything to it. </p><h2>  And what comes immediately in the kit? </h2><p>  A very modest configuration for this gadget, which includes: </p><ul><li><p>  A smartphone with a built-in non-removable battery. </p></li><li><p>  Charging adapter. </p></li><li><p>  Proprietary interface cord. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div></li><li><p>  Brief instruction manual of the device. </p></li><li><p>  Warranty card. </p></li></ul><p>  Certainly this list lacks an external speaker system.  But this approach is fully justified.  Everyone buys exactly those headphones that are best suited for him: either from the standpoint of sound quality, or from the standpoint of cost.  Also, without a protective case and front film, it will be difficult to maintain the original state of the smartphone to the owner.  They are not included in the delivery.  Another important accessory that is not included is a memory card for the Meizu M2 Note 16 GB.  Reviews clearly indicate a fairly small capacity of the built-in drive, and without this accessory it will be quite difficult to fully reveal the potential of this device. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  In terms of design, this smartphone is very similar to the iPhone 6 or 6s.  Most of the front panel area is occupied by a diagonal display, like the iPhone 6s plus - 5 and a half inches.  Above it is the earpiece, a small peephole of the front camera and a number of sensors.  At the bottom, unlike most devices under the Android OS, there is only one mechanical button (another common feature with "apple" gadgets).  Outwardly, it looks more like a mechanical button in Samsung Galaxy S6, but according to the principle of operation, it fully and completely matches smartphones that run iOS.  The remaining mechanical buttons are grouped on the left side of the smartphone.  The volume controls and the power button are displayed here.  On the upper side of the device is a standard wired audio port and a microphone, which provides suppression of external noise during a conversation.  At the bottom is a talking microphone, micro-USB and a loud speaker.  Moreover, the latter, like the latest generation of iPhone, is hidden behind a stylish lattice of round holes.  A slot for installing SIM cards or an external drive is displayed on the right side of the device.  On the back side there is the main camera, the logo of the manufacturer and a single LED (allows the camera to take pictures in low light).  The case of this smartphone can be in the following colors: gray, white, blue and pink.  The most affordable and practical of them is Meizu M2 Note 16Gb Gray.  Reviews highlight its availability (lower cost than in other cases) and resistance to the appearance of possible pollution and damage (with this color of the case they are not very noticeable).  The blue color of the case is aimed at a youth audience, which in this way will certainly want to express its individuality.  Well, white and pink options are perfect for the weak half of humanity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  One of the best mid-range processor solutions is equipped with the Meizu M2 Note.  Reviews give it a fairly high level of performance.  All this is true for MT6753.  This is an 8-core chip with support for 64-bit computing.  All its modules are built on the basis of architecture codenamed "Cortex A53."  This silicon crystal is manufactured according to the standards of the 28-nm process technology.  Its highest frequency can reach 1.3 GHz.  The strengths of this processor solution are multi-threaded tasks.  But even with not entirely optimized software, this CPU feels great.  Therefore, the newfound owner of this device certainly does not have to worry about a lack of performance in the foreseeable future. </p>

    <h2>  Video accelerator </h2><p>  Another strong point is the graphics accelerator in Meizu M2 Note.  The reviews of the owners of this device highlight its decent level of performance.  More specifically, the gadget is based on the Mali-T720MP3 video accelerator.  He does not have any special problems with launching even the most demanding software.  At the same time, the image on the display is displayed in 1080p format and it is certainly impossible to distinguish individual pixels with the ordinary eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Gadget screen </h2><p>  Another indisputable advantage of this mid-range smartphone is a touch screen with a very large diagonal of 5 and a half inches, protected by shock-resistant glass called the ‚ÄúGorilla Eye‚Äù of the latest generation.  It is because of this value that this device can be safely attributed to the class of so-called phablets - devices with a touch screen diagonal of 5 and a half inches.  Its resolution is 1920x1080, and the picture on it is displayed in 1080p format (this was already mentioned earlier).  The pixel density is 403ppi.  The matrix of the display is made by IGZO technology by the Japanese corporation Sharp.  This provides excellent image quality and excellent color reproduction.  Well, the viewing angles of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone are almost 180 degrees. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The impressive capacity of the built-in drive in the basic configuration of Meizu M2 Note is 16Gb.  User reviews indicate that part of this disk space is occupied by system software - about 3 GB.  The rest of the space the user can use to store personal information or to install application software.  You can also increase the amount of internal memory by installing an external drive (its maximum capacity can reach 128 GB) in the smartphone Meizu M2 Note 16 GB.  Reviews in this case highlight one important feature of this device - a second SIM card slot is used to install an external drive.  Therefore, you have to make a choice: either two operators, or increased disk space with one SIM card.  There is also a more advanced version of this device already with 32 GB on board.  But its cost is much higher.  And, as experience shows, the basic 16 GB for most users will be clearly enough for comfortable work.  The RAM in this device is 2 GB.  In this case, after the download is completed, more than half of them are allocated to user applications.  So you can safely run 2-3 simple processes and one demanding toy on this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  In this case, there will definitely not be any problems with the smooth operation and heating of the gadget. </p><h2>  Smartphone cameras </h2><p>  A very good main camera is equipped with <span>a Meizu</span> M2 Note <span>phone</span> .  Reviews highlight the impeccable quality of photos and videos obtained with its use.  She has a 13 megapixel sensor.  There is also autofocus technology and, as previously noted, single backlight.  The viewing angle of the main camera is 300 degrees.  All this in total allows you to get very very high quality photos.  In this case, the video is recorded in 1080p format and then it can be watched without any problems on any modern TV that supports the output of commercials in the format of ‚ÄúFull HS Di‚Äù.  The front camera has a more modest 5 megapixel touch element.  But this is enough for the currently popular ‚Äúselfie‚Äù.  Well, for video calls, these 5 megapixels are more than enough. </p>

    <h2>  Battery: its capacity and capabilities </h2><p>  The Meizu M2 Note phone boasts good autonomy.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  indicate 2 days of reliable operation of the device on one charge with an average load.  For a device with a 5.5-inch display and an 8-core CPU, this is an excellent indicator.  It should be noted right away that the battery in this device is non-removable.  And the case is not collapsible.  So in the event of a battery breakdown, you certainly cannot do without a visit to the service center.  But, on the other hand, the capacity of the complete battery is 3100 mAh, and it is manufactured by Sony Corporation.  Therefore, it is difficult to believe in possible problems associated with its operation.  The battery life will be reduced to 12-14 hours if you run a demanding and resource-intensive toy on the gadget.  Well, in the highest saving mode, you can count on 3 days of work on one charge of the built-in battery. </p><h2>  Software and user interface nuances </h2><p>  As noted, preinstalled system software takes up about 3 GB in Meizu M2 Note 16Gb.  Reviews say that this is the standard amount of preinstalled software.  Like most smart phones today, this device runs on such system software as Android.  Moreover, its version is quite recent - 5.0.  On top of the OS, Meizu's proprietary shell, Flyme OS, is installed.  Her version is 4.5.  all controls are displayed on the desktop in it (this makes it very similar to the latest versions of iOS).  Well, do not forget that many operations in this device can be performed using gestures.  For example, to unlock the gadget, just double-click in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen. </p>

    <h2>  Owners about the experience of using the device </h2><p>  The only significant minus in comparison with its predecessor M1 Note is in Meizu M2 Note.  Owner reviews <strong> </strong>  Allocate the central processor.  The predecessor could boast the presence of MT6752 with a clock frequency of 1.7 GHz and, as a result, a higher level of performance.  Well, in this case, MT6753 is used.  He also has 8 computing modules, but the frequency in them is reduced to 1.3 GHz.  Hence the lower level of performance.  But in most applications today, this difference is not so noticeable.  And for the battery in this case, the load will be significantly lower, and autonomy - better.  It should also be noted that MT6753 supports all existing mobile networks, but its predecessor in the person of MT6752 could not boast of 4G support.  The rest is a great smartphone that will not leave anyone indifferent.  He simply has no weaknesses. </p><h2>  Competitive Price </h2><p>  Now for $ 160 you can buy a <span>Meizu M2 Note</span> mobile <span>phone</span> in the basic gray configuration <span>.</span>  Reviews, in turn, indicate its full compliance with the quality of the device and its hardware parameters.  Other color options of the case will cost a little more.  To do this, you will have to pay an additional 10-15 dollars.  All these prices are fair for gadgets with 16 GB of internal storage.  But the gray version with 32 GB will cost $ 230 already.  Other modifications, as in the previous case, are 10-15 dollars more expensive. </p>

Its performance is not enough for one year, and in terms of autonomy, it can easily give odds to more expensive gadgets with similar characteristics. </p>
