    <h2>  Pre-colonial period </h2><p>  The first traces of life found on the lands of modern Benin relate to the periods of the Paleolithic and Neolithic.  In the 16th century, when Portuguese sailors and slavers arrived on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea, the state of Dahomey existed there.  Locals did not show hostility to Europeans, and already in the XVII century, Portuguese, French and Dutch trading settlements were founded on the Atlantic coast of the kingdom.  Then Catholic missionaries arrived, who opened the first elementary schools. </p><p>  However, interest in the development of ties with Dahomey acquired a large-scale character only in the 18th century, which was associated with its transformation into one of the most powerful states in West Africa at that time. </p>

    <h2>  Slave trade </h2><p>  The kings of Dahomey gladly traded with the Europeans.  The latter were primarily interested in black slaves to work on the plantations of their American colonies.  In addition, they were shocked to learn that the Amazons served in the royal army, who fought along with men and were distinguished by exceptional physical and combat training.  It was these girls who silently penetrated the settlements of neighboring countries, Alladu and Widou, and tried to capture as many prisoners as possible, which were the basis of the "export" of Dahomey. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is enough to say that only in 1750 the then King Tegbesu earned a huge sum of 250 thousand pounds from the time of the slave trade.  He spent part of this money on acquiring weapons in order to keep the neighbors and the population of the occupied lands at bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="People's Republic of Benin" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1703872.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <h2>  In the 19th century </h2><p>  In 1848, Dahomey refused to sell slaves to Europeans.  In 1851, France made a hostile gesture towards this state by signing an agreement with the king of Porto Novo.  The latter was a vassal of the Dagomean king Glele and paid tribute to him. </p><p>  In 1862, Porto Novo was declared a French protectorate, and was later occupied.  In addition, in 1885 a duty was imposed on the slave trade, which was supposed to prevent the transportation of slaves to the West Indies. </p><p>  The last 2 decades of the XIX century, the coast of Dagomei has become the scene of the struggle of European states that wanted to take it under their protectorate. </p><p>  In 1889, the French captured Cotonou and they forced the King of Dahomey to sign a treaty.  According to this document, Porto Novo and Cotonou were recognized as the possessions of France.  In turn, this state was to pay Dahomey 20 thousand francs.  The colony was called French Benin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1892, the king of Dahomey concluded several treaties.  As a result, this country was proclaimed a French protectorate.  In 1894, the Dagomean king was exiled to Martinique, and the country lost even the appearance of sovereignty. </p><p>  By the end of the 19th century, the coastal zone of Benin, Dahomey and the surrounding territories, captured by the French, formed a colony with the capital in Porto Novo. </p>

    <h2>  In the first half of the XX century </h2><p>  In 1904, 55 years before the Republic of Benin was founded, the Dahomey colony became part of French West Africa, and construction of the modern Cotonou port at that time began.  And after 2 years, a 45 km railway was built that connected the new harbor with Widou. </p><p>  The modern borders that the Republic of Benin has today, the colony acquired in 1909. </p><p>  <span>When the First World War began, the</span> French troops fighting on the territory of German Togo used Dahomey as a military base. </p><p>  In 1915, a rebellion broke out in the colony, which was crushed.  Folk performances were held in 1923.  And in 1934 the territory of French Togo was annexed to Dahomey, and in 1937 the country became a separate administrative unit. </p><p>  After 9 years, she was granted the status of the overseas territory of France and the General Council was created - the first self-government body on the lands that the People‚Äôs Republic of Benin occupies today.  It consisted of 30 advisers, who were elected by all adult residents, regardless of gender.  However, in order to have the right to vote, both men and women had to be able to read, write and speak French. </p>

    <h2>  Colonial Achievements </h2><p>  In the first decades of its independence, the Republic of Benin developed on the basis of what was created during the existence of Dahomey.  During the years of colonial rule, hospitals and elementary schools were built there, and a large-scale production of palm oil was created.  Catholic missionaries have also made great strides. </p><h2>  Declaration of independence </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the colonial administration of Dahomey consisted of supporters of the Free France movement.  After its completion, Charles de Gaulle personally contributed to the weakening of the governor's power.  In 1952, instead of the General Council, the Territorial Assembly was founded, and in 1958, the Dahomey was turned into a republic within the French Community. </p><p>  Complete independence from France was proclaimed on August 1, 1960.  The capital of the new state was proclaimed Porto Novo, but its government was located in Cotonou. </p><h2>  Republic of Benin: years of independence </h2><p>  During the first 15 years of independence, several military coups were carried out in the country.  In 1975, the People's Republic of Benin was proclaimed there.  It was led by Major Mathieu Kareku, who came to power in 1972, who proclaimed the construction of socialism as his main task. </p><p>  In 1989, a long-term dictator decided to carry out ‚Äúperestroika‚Äù and removed the word ‚Äúpopular‚Äù from the name of the country.  In 1991, democratic elections took place in Benin.  As a result, the one-party system was destroyed. </p>
