    <h2>  Anezi Tower Hotel Apartments 4 * (Morocco): negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even the best hotel can disappoint travelers with a lot of flaws.  Some flaws are in Anezi Tower Hotel Apartments 4 *.  Reviews note the following points: </p><ul><li>  the televisions in the rooms are old, and the picture quality is disgusting; </li><li>  almost until the morning, pool music plays music that keeps us awake; </li><li>  water in pools is not heated even in bad weather; </li><li>  in some rooms electronic locks are broken, and instead of them, such primitives are embedded that opening them is not difficult even without a key; </li><li>  of the toiletries in the bathroom there is only soap; </li><li>  inflated prices for spa and beauty services; </li><li>  the animation is very sluggish (from entertainment, only games in the pool); </li><li>  it‚Äôs better not to take valuables to the beach (if you are relaxing with the company, it is better for someone to look after them), since there are cases of theft; </li><li>  dirty carpet on the floor (since the maids do not vacuum it, it is better to remove it altogether); </li><li>  despite the fact that the presence of a refrigerator is declared in the room, in fact it is not (this option is available only on request); </li><li>  not all rooms have a hairdryer (but it is possible that you will be provided with it upon prior request); </li><li>  the staff does not understand a word in Russian, and therefore before the trip you need to learn at least a few phrases in English. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Resort Anezi Tower 4 * (Agadir) has its own characteristics and disadvantages.  You should not have too high hopes for it, comparing with hotels in Turkey and Egypt.  Moroccan service is quite peculiar, but this does not mean that it is bad.  Rather, he does not rely on generally accepted quality standards, but on the smile and hospitality of the staff, who will always come to the rescue, even despite the language barrier. <br><br>  The hotel is quite outdated.  The description of the rooms on the official website, in fact, does not carry any information load, because they do not have either a refrigerator, a hairdryer, or anything else.  However, some household appliances are available upon request.  In addition, you should not settle in rooms below the fourth floor.  The higher you live, the more beautiful the view from your window will be and the better your room will be. <br><br>  Thus, the impression of a hotel largely depends on what requirements and expectations you set for it initially.  Morocco is a country for gambling travelers who want to get acquainted with oriental traditions and culture.  This hotel will provide you a comfortable stay, good food, but no more.  There is practically no entertainment here, and all additional services are too expensive.  Therefore, before planning a trip, be sure to familiarize yourself with both positive and negative reviews in order to form a realistic picture of living and recreation conditions. </p>
