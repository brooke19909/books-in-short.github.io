  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much does a sailor earn? The average salary of a sailor in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A sailor is a person working in maritime transport.  Salary in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity directly depends on the proposed position and work experience.  Specialized higher education will also be required.  The man must make the choice of the desired position long before entering training.  After all, each of them involves a special list of skills and narrow-profile knowledge.  The wages and living standards of a sailor will depend on the knowledge gained during training. </p><h2>  Possible professions </h2><p>  There is a certain list of specialties for sailors.  A person can work on a ship: </p><ul><li>  The navigator. </li><li>  The captain. </li><li>  A sailor. </li><li>  Assistant captain. </li><li>  The pilot. </li><li>  The mechanic. </li><li>  Senior mechanic. </li><li>  Kokom. </li></ul><p>  The minimum requirement for obtaining the youngest position on the ship is a naval school diploma.  The maximum advantage for working on a ship will be given to those who have completed higher education and are fluent in English. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.navytimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seafarer training" class="if uuid-3168239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168239.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the amount of earnings </h2><p>  Thinking about how much sailors earn in Russia, it is necessary to take into account many nuances.  Sailors of all positions are divided into different categories related to the scope of the courts.  Fishing is considered the most popular in Russia.  So called fishing on a huge industrial scale.  Pay for work on such ships is quite high.  Another popular area in the homeland is the transport fleet.  He offers lower wages, but shorter flights, which is important if the man has a family and children.  Also, many sailors work in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.  Work on such ships is very honorable and well paid.  Sailors in the state military service receive additional benefits and bonuses to salary for long service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.saga.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="seafarer's payroll" class="if uuid-3168590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168590.jpg"></div><h2>  Complexity of work </h2><p>  For the entire period of navigation, the needs of the sailor are paid by the company, which provided him with employment.  And it does not depend at all on how much the <span>sailor</span> earns <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> applies to food, flights, hotels, as well as other small expenses.  A seafarer's working day usually rarely lasts less than 12 hours, and most often longer than this time.  In addition to the irregular schedule, sailors rarely have a full weekend.  Work on the ship is difficult both physically and morally. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zzap.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sailor salary" class="if uuid-3168594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168594.jpg"></div><h2>  The disadvantages and advantages of the profession </h2><p>  Communication with the family is not easy, due to persistent communication problems.  Of course, a lot depends on where the sailor is located geographically during the contract.  Sometimes ship employees do not have Internet access for months while the ship is at sea.  Work for sailors within the Russian border will involve a shorter period of contract service, and therefore, separation from loved ones will not be tolerated so hard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, family members and friends will always have the opportunity to freely visit the cities in which the vessel will stop during the voyage.  With a contract that provides for swimming outside territorial waters, relatives will have less opportunity to visit another country, since such a trip will involve a long visa, flights and other difficulties. </p><p>  When working on long-range vessels, you should be prepared for the fact that you will have to be at least 6 months outside the home for a calendar year.  However, this drawback is almost completely covered by how much sailors earn for the time spent on the ship.  Their families rarely feel the need, as the money earned by him is enough for absolutely all needs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="meeting the sailor with his family after the voyage" class="if uuid-3168608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168608.jpg"></div><p>  Another advantage of this profession is the ability to travel without breaking away from work.  Those employed on land can count on only one vacation per year and usually spend it on a beach holiday, which is not very diverse.  Long-distance sailors have the opportunity to explore a huge number of countries and cultures during their voyage.  They can communicate with foreigners while the ship is in port, and also learn about the mentality of other nations.  This makes the work of a sailor very interesting and diverse. </p><h2>  Sailor salary on board </h2><p>  Since the monthly income of a sailor depends on many factors, it is necessary to highlight the following nuances regarding wages.  Getting a job as a sailor, you can earn from 50 000 rubles a month.  Of course, subject to the choice of a good and developed company.  The average salary of a sailor is rarely less than 40,000 rubles.  Under the contract on a long-distance vessel, you can earn from 80 000 rubles for one month of work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reykjaviksailors.is" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sailor in Russia" class="if uuid-3168595" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168595.jpg"></div><h2>  Salary of the command staff </h2><p>  The level of the top command staff in the fishing fleet of Russia will be much higher.  Formal employment in a good company will bring in earnings of 130,000 rubles.  Work at sea as a mechanic will provide a salary of 70,000 rubles, and a second mechanic from 150,000 rubles.  Overseas shipowners will provide the seaman with work for a period of 4 to 9 months.  Not everyone will decide to be away from home for such a long period of time, but wages will correspond to all the shortcomings of such a contract period.  Based on the above data, the average salary of a sailor in Russia is about 60,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kauno.diena.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crew on board" class="if uuid-3168604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43892/3168604.jpg"></div><h2>  What affects the level of earnings </h2><p>  The most determining wage factors are: </p><ul><li>  Good company.  Shipowners can have completely different monthly salaries and terms of contracts.  Some ship employees can get an average salary, while others have earnings much higher than this level.  Also, income differs depending on the scope of the vessel and its path.  How much sea sailors earn is calculated by the term of the contract.  The longer it is, the higher the monthly salary will be. </li><li>  Position.  How much a sailor earns depends directly on her.  The ship has a huge number of employees.  Each of them performs his own work and receives a certain salary for it.  The higher the responsibility of the position, the higher the pay to the sailor. </li><li>  Experience.  He plays a large role in employment in state-owned companies: the maritime police, the armed forces, and fishing.  How much a military sailor earns determines his experience.  In such companies, experienced sailors increase their salaries depending on the length of service.  Private ships do not have this practice. </li></ul><p>  How much a sailor earns is quite easy to determine if you know the details of his work, as well as the level and industry of his company. </p><h2>  The nuances of employing seafarers </h2><p>  The advantages of the work of the seafarer are forcing an increasing number of young children to go to study this profession.  Having education, they have increased chances of career advancement and their own full-scale implementation.  However, getting a sailor on a good and promising ship is not so simple.  To conclude a profitable contract, you will have to resort to the services of special crewing agencies.  These specialists are engaged in the selection of personnel in successful companies.  They provide guarantees for the company to pay salaries and protect the rights of the seaman. </p><p>  The independent search for a stable and successful company can last a fairly long period of time.  Some sailors may wait months for a response to their resume.  Therefore, many use the capabilities of crewing agencies.  While searching for it, it is very important not to fall into the hands of scammers, since a good amount will have to pay a considerable amount. </p>
