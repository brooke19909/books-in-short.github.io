Many of our compatriots are well aware of the monasteries of the Moscow Region (including those operating).  All of them are of great historical and architectural value.  This is the Don Monastery, Novospassky, female Alekseevsky, of course, the famous Novodevichy and many others.  However, the one we will talk about today stands apart in the beautiful gallery of works of Russian architecture.  It is located on the Istra River, near the city of the same name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new jerusalem in the suburbs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700228.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <p>  It is usually called the <span>New Jerusalem.</span>  In the suburbs, Patriarch Nikon decided to reproduce the Palestinian shrines.  This made it possible for Russian people to see the holy places of the Resurrection of Christ.  And I must say that every year thousands of tourists come here from different parts of our country. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The construction of New Jerusalem was carried out in two stages.  The first stage lasted from 1656 to <span>1666,</span> when Alexei Mikhailovich Silent reigned.  The work was interrupted after the disgrace of Patriarch Nikon.  Construction was resumed only in 1679 by order of Fedor Alekseevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  New Jerusalem in the suburbs is a cathedral complex.  In 1685, the construction of the Resurrection Cathedral and the church of Constantine and Elena were completed. </p><p>  The creation of the fortress wall and the gateway <span>church of the Entrance of the Lord was</span> completed in 1697, already under Peter I. Construction did not end there.  Unfortunately, the stone tent of the Cathedral of the Resurrection collapsed, not having stood even thirty years.  It was restored until 1761.  This year, the reign of Empress Elizabeth ended. </p><p>  The new tent was built according to the project of the famous Francesco Rastrelli (younger).  The most famous works of this master are well known to our compatriots - Smolny Monastery, the Great Peterhof Palace and the Winter Palace.  The construction was led by the architect K.I.  Form. </p><p>  During the Second World War, <span>New Jerusalem (the monastery)</span> found itself on the territory captured by the Nazis.  Before leaving, they ruined it, destroyed the buildings.  The cathedral bell tower was destroyed, the top of the Cathedral of the Resurrection was burned down, the tents from the towers were demolished.  The complex required serious restoration work. </p><h2>  The monastery after the death of Nikon </h2><p>  When Patriarch Nikon left this world, the monastery was not abandoned.  Its construction was continued.  At the end of the XVII century, the monastery fence made of wood was replaced by a stone one.  Perestroika was carried out according to the project of the famous Russian architect Ya.G.  Bukhvostova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Jerusalem Istra" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700229.jpg" width="360"></div>

After the collapse of the tent over the chapel of the Holy Sepulcher in 1723, Francesco Shot was taken for its restoration.  In further perestroika, M.F.  Kazakov, A.N.  Voronikhin, K.A.  Tone. </p><h2>  Monastery under Peter I </h2><p>  At the monastery walls in 1698 there was a historic battle between the archers and the troops loyal to the government under the leadership of A. Shein.  Sagittarius was defeated, most of them were executed.  This event gave impetus to Peter's reforms.  At this time, the monastery was in decline.  But later it became an important cultural and religious center of the country.  On its territory was one of the richest libraries. </p><p>  Many famous personalities of Russian culture and history of the second half of the 18th century were here as pilgrims. </p><h2>  Ensemble architecture </h2><p>  New Jerusalem in the suburbs is a vivid example of Moscow baroque.  Its towers and walls are built in the form of a hexagon of irregular shape.  They have domestic utility rooms, loopholes and cells of monks.  The towers are crowned with stone tents.  The Resurrection Cathedral is located in the very center of the monastery. </p><h2>  Complex recovery </h2><p>  Restoration work in this holy place has been going on for several decades and continues to this day.  Today the monastery is practically restored, except for the bell tower. </p><p>  Analogies with Jerusalem are seen here in everything - some of the towers of the monastery are named after the gates of Jerusalem - Gethsemane, Damascus, Zion.  There is also a <span>garden of Gethsemane.</span>  A great impression on tourists is made by the patriarch‚Äôs monastery built in 1658 in the New Jerusalem complex.  Istra, on one of the islands of which the monastery is located, symbolizes <span>the Jordan River.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Jerusalem in the suburbs of Moscow" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700230.jpg" width="500"></div>

Find a detailed answer to this question. </p><h2>  <em>Resurrection Cathedral</em> </h2><p>  A unique monument of architecture.  It is located in the center of the monastery.  It is a complex structure, which consists of a temple and adjoining annexes.  On the west side is the chapel of the Holy Sepulcher with a rotunda having an eighteen-meter tent.  On the north side is the <span>Assumption Church,</span> and in the east - the church of Constantine and Elena, deepened into the ground.  Earlier, on the south side of the cathedral was a bell tower, which was destroyed in 1941. </p><p>  The chambers of the cathedral are particularly striving upwards, which is little inherent in Orthodox churches.  Here in the basement is an underground church.  In addition, inside you can see the dungeon, where Christ was awaiting a terrible execution, Kuvukliya - a marble chapel hiding the Holy Sepulcher.  Next to it are thirteen lamps, belonging to the Orthodox Patriarchate, thirteen Armenian, thirteen Catholic and four Coptic. </p><p>  The cathedral is surrounded by refectory and hospital rooms.  Next to them are the abbot's chambers.  Not far from the cathedral you can see the remains of a churchyard with the graves of prominent representatives of the Russian nobility. </p><h2>  <em>Fortress walls</em> </h2><p>  This part of the monastery was built under the leadership of Jacob Bukhvostov (1690-1697).  The fortress walls have towers and a gateway entrance Jerusalem church above the Holy Gates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="New Jerusalem near Moscow excursions" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700231.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <em>Church of the Entrance of the Lord</em> </h2><p>  Another attraction is located in the New Jerusalem complex.  The Church of the Entrance of the Lord was built in the XVII century.  This is a multi-tiered structure.  The Gate Church is a typical church, widely used in Russian church architecture of the 17th century.  In its refined, but simple decor, made of brick, the motifs of the fortress wall are repeated. </p><p>  The tiered temple surprisingly organically fit into the space between the upper floors of the cathedral and the bell tower.  This made the eastern facade of the complex even more picturesque and complicated. </p><p>  On the western side of the temple are the Hospital Chambers, built in 1698, the Refectory Chambers and the Church of the Nativity of Christ, which symbolizes Bethlehem (1692), and the chambers of the Archimandrite (1750).  Here is the palace of Princess Tatyana Mikhailovna (XVII century), as well as the fraternal corps. </p><p>  New Jerusalem in the Moscow Region is surrounded by a unique wall built in 1694.  It unites eight towers - Zion, Gethsemane, Elizabethan Gate (there was no such tower in Jerusalem), David House, Baruch, Efremova, Foreigners, Damascus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new jerusalem monastery" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700232.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Behind the Elizabethan gates of the monastery was the Garden of Gethsemane.  Now he is gone, this is a park in the bend of Istra. </p><p>  Once in this garden there were channels that formed the island.  On it, about three hundred meters from the monastery wall, Patriarch Nikon lived. </p><p>  Skeleton Nikon survived to the present day.  This is a four-story house in which there were two churches (on the first and fourth floors), cells, including Nikon himself, and utility rooms.  The monastery, in addition to historical significance, is a rare example of a house of the mid-17th century. </p><h2>  <em>New Jerusalem Museum</em> </h2><p>  The Museum of Architecture and History is located on the territory of the New Jerusalem Monastery - a magnificent monument of architecture of the XVII century.  The New Jerusalem Museum (Istra, Moscow Region) was founded in 1920. </p><p>  This is an exact copy of the famous temple complex in Jerusalem.  The museum at the monastery will introduce everyone to the ancient Russian art of the 18th - early 20th centuries.  The exhibition presents rare, unique manuscripts, invaluable documentary evidence, church vestments and utensils, antique furniture, and jewelry.

Through the Elizabeth Tower you can go to the park, where the Exhibition Building and interesting monuments of wooden architecture are located - a chapel, a peasant estate, a windmill.  Horseback riding is carried out. </p><h2>  New Jerusalem in the Moscow Region: excursions </h2><p>  Thousands of tourists annually visit the New Jerusalem temple complex.  You will need a map of the Moscow Region if you are planning to come here by car.  The road from Moscow will take about two hours. </p><p>  First you need a sightseeing tour.
