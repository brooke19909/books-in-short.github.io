Users in their reviews talk about the ratio of quality and price of the device positively, as well as the functionality, ease of management of the tablet and the stability of its operation. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Thus, we examined the main line of Lenovo tablets with a 10-inch display.  The corresponding devices may vary in concept, level of supported technologies, and dimensions.  It should be noted that each Lenovo tablet (10 inches) we reviewed is with 3G, all devices support Wi-Fi.  Thus, there will be no problems with access to the Internet if there are appropriate channels, even with the use of outdated brand models. </p><p>  Tablets manufactured by Lenovo are controlled by the most common OS open-source platforms on the market - Android and Windows.  This determines the ease of transition of the user from one device to another.  If a person decides to buy instead of the usual ThinkPad a Lenovo tablet (10 inches) belonging to a different line - the instruction for him will probably not even be needed.  Especially if the corresponding device will be controlled by the same OS as the previous one.  Although the management of tablets and smartphones for Android and Windows is generally unified.  Basic operations with applications are carried out through the same "gestures" on the screen.  The user, working in both OSs, uses the same interface elements.  But if you need instructions for the tablet, you can always download it on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.  The Lenovo company generates detailed and at the same time very logical and easy-to-learn manuals for users of its devices. </p><p>  Of course, the models considered by us are difficult to designate as capable of representatively reflecting all the specifics of the respective rulers.  We studied them only to see the conceptual difference between the solutions from the Chinese brand. </p><h2>  Models of the same line: how noticeable are the differences? </h2><p>  In the market of mobile devices, a situation may well arise when, within the same line of the manufacturer, the differences between the devices will be as significant as when compared with devices of other concepts.  However, as for Lenovo products, there are usually more similarities between tablets of the same row.  Especially in the design. </p><p>  So, for example, the Lenovo 10 inch A7600 tablet is popular within the IdeaTab line.  It can be noted that it is very similar in design to the S6000 we reviewed above, as well as the TAB 2 A10-70, although the second device belongs to a different line. </p>

    <p>  There are also few hardware differences between the A7600 and S6000.  Among the most obvious - in the A7600 model, the front camera has a higher resolution - 2 MP.  It can also be noted that the A7600 tablet costs a little more.  Thus, Lenovo can supply devices with minimal differences in characteristics to the market, however, this adapts specific models to the needs of certain user groups.  There are lovers of mobile devices for whom a high-resolution front camera is a secondary criterion for choosing a device, and they may prefer to save money by acquiring an analogue that is no worse in other indicators within the same Lenovo line. </p>
