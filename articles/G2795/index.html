    <p>  Naturally, the brightness of such a lamp cannot compete with full-fledged lighting; rather, it is intended to replace lighted candles or a night lamp. </p><h2>  What is LED lighting? </h2><p>  The rapidly growing production of LED lighting devices is steadily displacing traditional incandescent lamps, conquering the market with the help of many advantages: </p><ul><li>  Exceptional durability. </li><li>  High quality lighting (brightness). </li><li>  Security. </li><li>  Economical power consumption. </li><li>  Environmental friendliness. </li><li>  Resistance to humidity and temperature changes. </li></ul><p>  The essence of the <span>LED (Light Emitting Diode) of</span> luminaires is the emission of light by a semiconductor material under the influence of electron motion.  The manufacture of such devices does not require phosphorus, mercury or other hazardous substances.  And during operation, burns and <span>electric shocks</span> are excluded <span>,</span> since the lamps do not heat up and consume a negligible amount of electricity (5-9 watts). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How do LED trees look? </h2><p>  The lion's share of the popularity of LED lights can be attributed to their attractive appearance. </p><p>  Luminous trees, whose branches are dotted with numerous sparkling lights, are decorated with flowers, berries or other decor, evoke only the most pleasant associations with fabulous landscapes and films of the fantasy genre.  In addition, the owners of some devices have the opportunity to change the color of the shining lights, turn on the blinking mode, or get a design whose lamps play in several colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself luminous tree" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1120607.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  Depending on the purpose of the lamp and the style of the room or landscape, there are trees with absolutely no decor.  Their lamps are not hidden by floral nozzles, and the barrel is made with a minimum of unnecessary elements, which perfectly fits into the interior in hi-tech style. </p><h2>  Types of LED Trees </h2><p>  Thinking about how to decorate your house or territory with a LED-lamp in the form of a tree, it is worth collecting information on devices of this kind in advance. </p><p>  LED trees <strong> </strong>  can be of various sizes and types: </p><ul><li>  Small ones are designed to be placed on tables and tables. </li><li>  Medium and large are placed on the floor in spacious rooms (large living rooms, offices, trading floors). </li><li>  Street lights are mounted on the site or mounted on living growing trees. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led trees" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1120619.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Some of these fixtures can be purchased fully finished, others need to be assembled and connected.  For lovers of <span>decorating a house with their own hands,</span> there is an opportunity, in addition to buying a factory product, to make a similar device on their own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Glowing trees: price and equipment </h2><p>  Of course, to get a complete picture illustrating the equipment of the interior or landscape with a bright LED tree, you can not do without indicating prices for such devices. </p><p>  For fans of traditional shopping who prefer supermarkets, the purchase of a lamp will cost a little more than when buying in an online store or self-made.  On the other hand, they will have access to such benefits of civilization as professional advice, seller's advice, home delivery and qualified installation. </p><p>  Summarizing the cost proposed by several major manufacturers, you can specify the following prices: </p><ul><li>  Finished luminous trees up to 50 cm in height - 35 euros. </li><li>  Larger models (up to 80 cm) designed for indoor use and having a larger number of lamps - 57 euros. </li><li>  Tree for landscape decoration (1.5 m) - 90 euros. </li><li>  <span>LED strip</span> for decorating growing trees (5m) - from 5 to 18 euros (depending on the frequency of placement of lamps on the tape). </li><li>  Garland for decorating a tree, including all the necessary devices - 135-225 euros (5 threads of 20 m each). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glowing trees Price" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1119282.jpg" width="467"></div></li></ul><p>  The color of LEDs also affects the price of a finished lamp or a garland with lamps.  More expensive are blue, white and yellow lamps. </p><p>  The owners of the ‚Äúgolden hands‚Äù will be able to save money by purchasing individual components, as well as by the independent manufacture and installation of the LED lamp. </p><h2>  Creating a LED tree at home </h2><p>  With even minimal knowledge in the field of electronics, you can quickly make a luminous tree with your own hands.  Although you will have to make some efforts choosing, buying and connecting components, even the most demanding hand-makers will be satisfied with the result. </p><p>  There are two ways to create such a decoration: </p><ul><li><strong> </strong>  Collect luminous trees from prepared elements (a stable base, frame, tape with diodes and decorative flowers). </li><li><strong> </strong>  Solder your own electronic design using separate LED lights, wires and insulation. </li></ul><p>  The first method is much simpler and faster.  It does not require the use of skills to work with a soldering iron and electrical circuits, since you just need to connect the prepared nodes of the device in a certain order.  Here, creativity is manifested in the choice of colors for the future tree and in a unique combination of ready-made elements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luminous trees for the street" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1119329.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Choosing the second method and completely creating a luminous tree with your own hands, the master sequentially performs the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Assembles a frame (pipes of different diameters, wire, wooden bases are suitable for this). </li><li>  Solders resistors to the wires of LED lamps and provides isolation of the joints. </li><li>  Attaches LEDs to branches. </li><li>  Leads the wires to the power supply and fastens them using solder method (using <span>phosphoric acid</span> and tin). </li><li>  It fixes the frame of the tree with lamps on the branches on a stable horizontal basis. </li></ul><p>  Performing such work, you must carefully monitor the observance of the correct polarity (+/-). </p><h2>  LED tree decoration </h2><p>  Luminous trees for the street look great as a single decor or as an element of a vibrant composition (a decorated alley, garden, home). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="glowing trees" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1120710.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <p>  One of the main advantages of <span>LED garlands</span> and lamps is their resistance to mechanical damage and the effects of aggressive weather factors.  That is why they are so often used to decorate personal plots or territories near offices and shops. </p>
