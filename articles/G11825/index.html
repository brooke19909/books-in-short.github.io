You have to wake up early, and endure the stampede in public transport, and listen to the discontent of the authorities.  Such a life does not please at all.  For this and other reasons, many women are thinking about the same question, how can a girl make money on the Internet. </p><h2>  Internet features </h2><p>  All modern people are actively using the Internet.  For each person, a worldwide network plays a role.  For many, the Internet is primarily entertainment.  People watch movies, music videos, interesting videos, listen to music, turn on the radio, play online games. </p><p>  For some, the Internet is an opportunity for education and self-education.  A large number of books are posted on the Internet in electronic form; there are distance learning programs offered by higher education institutions. </p><p>  And not everyone knows that the Internet is also an opportunity to make money.  At the same time, finding a job or source of income is not so simple.  Beginners have a very difficult time, because they often encounter scammers, deceivers who talk about thousands of earnings in 1 day.  When asked how a girl can make money, you can give a few verified answers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.memleket.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet Opportunities for Earnings" class="if uuid-2651070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651070.jpg"></div><h2>  Rewriting and copywriting </h2><p>  If you know the rules of the Russian language well, have perseverance and patience, then pay attention to such a way of earning as rewriting and copywriting.  These terms indicate the writing of texts for various sites.  Rewriting is the rewriting in your own words of an existing article, and copywriting is the creation of a completely original text. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you decide to try yourself in rewriting and copywriting for the first time, then you should register on some specialized exchange.  She acts as an intermediary between the contractor and the customer, serves as a guarantor of all obligations.  There are several well-known exchanges - Advego, Text.ru, Etxt.ru. </p><h2>  Recommendations for future rewriters and copywriters </h2><p>  Exchanges themselves do not deceive their performers, but fraud is still possible on these online resources from unscrupulous users.  You can avoid cheating.  Here are some recommendations on how a girl can earn money on rewriting and copywriting, while not encountering scammers: </p><ul><li>  Do not start writing any article at the request of another user until you receive an order to work with the correct cost indication; </li><li>  Before starting cooperation, always read the reviews written on the user (customer) page; </li><li>  Do not write free trial articles, even if the customer promises you higher paying orders in the future. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pouted.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rewriting and copywriting" class="if uuid-2651026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651026.jpg"></div><h2>  How much can you earn on rewriting and copywriting? </h2><p>  Earnings on rewriting and copywriting depends on several factors - on the volume of executed orders, the cost set for 1 thousand characters, the availability of free time.  At the very beginning, you can try to fulfill several inexpensive orders.  As a rule, when writing the first articles, beginners will learn about all the requirements, rules, programs necessary for checking texts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the future, look for more expensive orders, try to work with third-party customers, requiring an advance payment.  As a result, you can reach a good level of income, but again, it all depends on the volume of articles performed.  Some performers write very little, and their earnings are a couple of thousand rubles a month.  Others cope with large volumes without problems.  Their earnings reach 30 thousand rubles a month, and sometimes even the amount is greater. </p><h2>  Own business on the Internet </h2><p>  Most often, the fair sex think about how to make money for a girl in business.  To create your own business, you need a lot of patience, because not every idea quickly starts to generate income, and sometimes it turns out to be unprofitable. </p><p>  Online business can be different: </p><ol><li>  Create your own website.  Existing online resources earn on ads.  The more visitors come to the site, the higher the income.  However, it‚Äôs quite difficult to earn money on the new site due to the existence of more ‚Äúadult‚Äù competitors, who always gather a huge audience around them. </li><li>  Creation of an online store.  This method of earning is the most difficult, it requires the availability of money, certain knowledge, but it is precisely this that is the answer to the question of how to make a large sum of money for a girl.  With the right approach, the presence of considerable starting capital, people manage to promote their online store very well. </li><li>  Blogging in video format.  This way of earning money is very popular today.  Video format is interesting to Internet users.  You can earn, for example, on some video lessons.  Some girls take off cooking different dishes, makeup lessons, etc. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ilette.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keeping your own blog" class="if uuid-2651041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651041.jpg"></div><h2>  Earnings for needlewomen </h2><p>  If there are any hobbies related to needlework, then you should think about how you can earn money for a girl on maternity leave or just in her spare time from her main job.  Especially for needlewomen, a site called "Fair of Masters" has been opened.  On it, users sell a variety of their creations, ranging from soft toys and dolls to clothing and jewelry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are a lot of masters registered on the site, so in order to achieve certain successes, it is worth considering some recommendations: </p><ol><li>  Try to come up with some unique product that would distinguish you from your competitors.  You can, for example, sew dolls, but try to make them original.  Come up with interesting clothes for them, make facial features unusual. </li><li>  Try to make high-quality and beautiful photos that showcase your work. </li><li>  The most important recommendation - try to do all the work with the highest quality.  The better your creations are, the more reviews you will earn, and a positive reputation, in turn, will attract more new customers in the future. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="decordezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on needlework" class="if uuid-2651035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651035.jpg"></div><h2>  Income from Instagram </h2><p>  Instagram today is a popular social network.  It has registered approximately 25 million users in our country.  The platform attracts not only by the presence of photographs of various people, but also by the opportunity to generate income.  However, in this social network, a girl can either earn a large sum of money or not get anything at all.  In order to receive income from your profile, you need to have a considerable number of subscribers, regularly post new photos. </p><p>  What to do for a girl to earn money on Instagram?  Earnings in a social network are presented in several ways: </p><ul><li>  selling goods and services through affiliate programs; </li><li>  sale of own goods and services; </li><li>  advertising placement. </li></ul><p>  The latter method is the simplest, but it is suitable for promoted profiles with an average of 10 thousand subscribers or more.  Placement of a post with advertising costs on average from 500 rubles to infinity.  Famous stars registered on Instagram set a price equal to several tens of thousands of rubles, and sometimes even hundreds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sole-u.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Instagram income" class="if uuid-2651061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651061.jpg"></div><h2>  A way to make money for female gamers </h2><p>  Gamers tell about how to <span>earn money for a girl</span> and offer to engage in similar activities.  Playing computer games and earning income is an interesting option.  However, it is not as simple as it might seem at first glance.  You need to understand some game, understand all the nuances. </p><p>  First of all, you need to decide what will become a source of income.  For example, you can sell game currency, items, pumped characters, provide various gaming services.  To make such transactions, gamers use forums, specialized sites that protect both sellers and buyers from fraudulent transactions. </p><p>  But the question of how to make money to a girl while sitting at home is another answer - to stream.  Streamer is the person who plays computer games and broadcasts the process to others.  There are such platforms for organizing broadcasts as Twich.tv, GoodGame.ru.  To be a streamer, a girl must look attractive, be able to talk with the audience, that is, during the game, interesting video content for the public should be obtained.  You also need to have a powerful computer and high-quality Internet connection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="compliancex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on computer games" class="if uuid-2651017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651017.jpg"></div><h2>  Income from computer games </h2><p>  On the sale of game currencies, things and characters, it is unlikely to make a large sum of money.  A lot of gamers are engaged in such activities.  A considerable number of people are also involved in streaming, but you can still try yourself in this activity. </p><p>  How do girls make money online on streams?  Earnings include several components - revenue from advertising, paid subscriptions, permanent advertising banners, the availability of donations.  Some gamers reach levels that exceed salaries in the office.  However, to become a popular streamer, you need to provide people with interesting content.  At first, newcomers usually have to stream a lot and often for free, order ads, organize contests. </p><h2>  Work as an online consultant or operator </h2><p>  For those girls who do not have start-up capital and relevant knowledge to create a website, an online store and who are far from copywriting, do not use Instagram and are not interested in computer games, there is a simple way to make money - working as an online consultant or operator. </p><p>  On sites with job advertisements, large companies sometimes look for assistants for remote work.  The average income can be about 15 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Remote Work Example </h2><p>  One of the companies offering remote work is Tinkoff Bank.  The available vacancy is an operator.  Operators fulfill their duties during business hours from 7 am to 10 pm.  Each employee independently plans his schedule.  The payment is decent.  With effective work, good results, the bank pays from 20 thousand rubles.  In order to earn a lot of money for a girl in this way, as a rule, you need to try very hard, not be distracted by social networks, etc. </p><p>  Another advantage of remote work from Tinkoff Bank is that it is official.  From the income of each operator, contributions are made to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="piggybankhelper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work as an online consultant, operator" class="if uuid-2651079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2651079.jpg"></div><p>  So, we examined what a girl can do to make money.  The above examples are only part of all existing methods.  If you find some other source of income, then do not rush to experiment.  Read reviews about your chosen activity, look for additional information so that in the end you do not become a victim of scammers. </p>
