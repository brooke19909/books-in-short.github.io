One such brand is BRIGHT &amp; QUICK (BQ).  The price of Strike Power BQ-5059 and other devices of the line varies within $ 100, so we can say that the company specializes in the production of budget devices. </p><p>  In the spring of 2017, the company introduced three smartphones at once.  Outwardly, it is almost impossible to distinguish them.  Only, each has a corresponding inscription on the back cover: Strike 2, Strike P Easy and Strike P. They differ in each other and in technical characteristics.  The last two models are equipped with capacious batteries, as evidenced by the prefix Power in the name.  But, as for the rest of the "filling", it corresponds to the initial level. </p><p>  The hero of this article was only one smartphone company BQ.  The price of Strike Power BQ-5059 at official points of sale reaches 6 500 rubles.  For this money, the manufacturer offers a universal device that can be used both as a mobile phone with a wide range of functions and a portable battery (Power Bank).  Note that the previous models of this brand did not differ in the long term of autonomy, so this decision was made with enthusiasm.  But what about the other parameters?  In order to answer this question, let's study the technical characteristics of the gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 5059 strike power specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042349.jpg"></div>

It is hermetically sealed in plastic wrap.  Bright packaging design intrigues the buyer.  The box itself consists of two parts.  The first acts as a kind of cover with the presentation of characteristics, and the second directly packs the smartphone itself. </p><p>  A set of accessories pleasantly surprised customers.  In addition to the usual power adapter (5V / 2A), USB cable and documentation, the manufacturer provided headphones.  Note that in the budget segment this is more an exception than a rule.  Many buyers would also like to see a smartphone case in the kit, however it will have to be purchased separately. </p><p>  Each accessory is individually packaged in special bags.  The device display is protected by two films.  One is transparent, the second with inscriptions.  On it, the manufacturer posted information about those characteristics that represent the device from a favorable side.  There is also a ‚ÄúGive Life‚Äù logo.  This action is organized to help sick children.  Looking ahead, let's say that the manufacturer installed a special application on the phone through which you can make a donation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq strike power bq 5059 price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042350.jpg"></div>

The device looks compact thanks to the rounded side edges and corners.  The phone‚Äôs dimensions are 143 √ó 73 √ó 9.9 mm.  The design can be called strict, but not faceless.  A certain "highlight" gives a metal battery cover.  The lineup contains several colors: gray, gold, black and silver.  As for the latter, it is worth changing the tilt a little and the rear panel starts playing in different shades.  Undoubtedly, it looks intriguing. </p><p>  In addition to this cover, the rest of the body is made of plastic.  The difference in the transition of materials is quite noticeable, since it differs in color.  The assembly is made with high quality.  There are no gaps, no squeaking.  The only thing is that when you press the lid you hear a slight crunch.  The device does not slip in the hand.  Its mass is rather big - 177 g, therefore the smartphone feels good in the pocket of any clothes. </p><p>  Most users drew attention to the soiled body.  Unfortunately, fingerprints remain not only on the front panel, but also on the back.  The reason for this was the polished surface of the metal cover.  In order to avoid pollution, you have to buy a case for a smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for smartphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042352.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The gadget's screen is framed by a black frame.  Above and below, it looks quite wide.  This is dictated by the fact that developers had to place a control panel under the display.  It consists of three keys, the designations of which are clearly visible.  Above the screen there is a speaker hole covered with a fine grill, a front camera, a notification indicator and sensors.  The entire front panel is covered with 2.5D glass, which rises slightly above the frame of the case. </p><p>  Somewhat unusual, the manufacturer arranged the communication connectors.  At the bottom end, only a microphone is brought out and closer to the right side there is a special groove that is designed to remove the back cover.  In the comments of users it is said that it fits snugly to the case, and even very, and has fairly strong locks.  This is an undeniable advantage, but until you get used to it, it will be difficult to remove the cover.  For some owners, this procedure took about 10 minutes.  It is recommended that you ask the consultant to install SIM cards and a memory card in the store. </p><p>  The upper end is occupied by two connectors: an audio port and microUSB with OTG.  The volume and power keys are on the right side edge.  There are no functional elements on the left side. </p><p>  Let's pay attention to one feature.  In this model, the battery is non-removable, but the slots for the drive and SIM cards are under the back cover. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Studying the <span>characteristics of the BQ-5059 Strike Power,</span> you need to consider the features of the display.  In this model, the developers installed a 5-inch screen.  It is based on the IPS OGS matrix.  Two-touch multi-touch option implemented.  The picture is displayed in HD quality. </p><p>  What do users say about the screen?  Wide viewing angles and a sufficient range of brightness make the interaction with the smartphone as comfortable as possible.  In the sun there are no special problems.  Especially users highlighted the MiraVision function, thanks to which you can make changes to the display settings, changing the saturation, tint temperature, contrast, sharpness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone bq 5059 strike power" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042351.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  What "filling" is used in the BQ-5059 Strike Power?  The characteristics of the processor can hardly be called super powerful.  The gadget runs on the <span>MediaTek MT6580</span> chipset <span>.</span>  The system row is 32 bits.  Based on four computing elements.  When working with several simultaneously running applications, each of these modules can accelerate to a frequency of 1300 MHz.  For the graphics in the phone there is a video card with two cores - ARM Mali-400 MP2.  In conjunction with these processors, the developers installed one gigabyte of ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù.  About half of this volume is already occupied by system files, so when you launch several applications, the device may freeze.  But the device copes with simple utilities perfectly. </p><p>  What is the size of the integrated storage in the BQ-5059 Strike Power?  8 GB  Unfortunately, this is now too small.  It can be increased up to 64 GB with a memory card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone bq 5059 strike power" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042353.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  <span>Phone BQ-5059</span> Strike Power is running the latest version of the operating system.  Users will be able to enjoy Android 7.0 Nougat.  ‚ÄúOperating system‚Äù is diluted with proprietary applications, new wallpapers for the desktop, shortcuts with which the quick installation is carried out, and other ‚Äútricks‚Äù.  It is important to note that if necessary, all this is easy to remove from the gadget.  The interface looks pretty attractive.  The system works smoothly, which cannot but please the owners. </p><h2>  BQ-5059 Strike Power: Camera Features </h2><p>  Owners of this model can take photos with 13- and 8-megapixel cameras.  On the back there is a one-position flash.  You can improve the settings of the modules using the settings.  The camera menu has a standard set of options: white balance, shooting modes, ISO, exposure, filters. </p><p>  The quality of photos is not above average.  The best results can be achieved only in sunny weather.  When shooting indoors or in insufficient lighting, the frame is not clear enough, the color rendition is frankly lame, there are noises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 5059 strike power 8 gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042354.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  What can be called the strength of the BQ-5059 Strike Power?  Battery Specifications!  The developers installed a capacious 5000 mAh battery in the device.  The gadget lasts up to three days on a single charge under intense load.  During the day you can safely play games, surf the Internet.  And if you use the phone very rarely, then you will have to charge it no more than once a week.  It is these characteristics of battery life that make it possible to forget about many shortcomings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 5059 strike power review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2042355.jpg"></div>

The advantages included a powerful battery, neutral design, screen resolution, a fresh version of the operating system, camera capabilities and low cost. </p><p>  But, as usual, it could not do without flaws.
