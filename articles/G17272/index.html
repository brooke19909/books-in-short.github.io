Users can choose from thousands of models from hundreds of manufacturers.  All of them have a variety of functions and belong to different price categories.  And although each music lover has his own needs and financial capabilities, today acoustics are made with different sets of functions of a wide variety of configurations and prices. </p><p>  First of all, the user must decide which portable column he needs.  You must understand for yourself the purpose of its use, budget, a list of desirable parameters and functionality.  Below are the main criteria for choosing the best portable speakers. </p><h2>  The size </h2><p>  This is the most important factor in measuring portability of speakers.  To select the desired device size, the user must determine where he will use it.  Sound quality also depends on this setting, since a larger speaker comes with a larger speaker with higher output power.  If portable acoustics are required for indoor use and only occasionally for parties, then sizes from small to medium, like the JBL Charge 2 or Sony SRSX55 / BLK, are suitable.  Such speakers are easy to carry and can be used anywhere.  Their sound quality is good enough for a small party indoors or outdoors.  On the other hand, if you need powerful portable speakers of a large size with a rechargeable battery, then the Ion Audio Block Party Live model is a good choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portable speakers DOSS Boombox" class="if uuid-2320965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2320965.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection options </h2><p>  Currently, most portable speakers come with connectivity options such as Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and traditional audio jacks.  Using them is quite simple.  Bluetooth allows you to connect the speaker to any compatible devices, such as smartphones or tablets. </p><h2>  Reception range </h2><p>  This setting is important when playing music using a Bluetooth connection.  Most portable Bluetooth speakers come with a working range of 10 meters, such as Parikaras or Mpow.  This distance is enough to use the speakers indoors.  If you need a larger <span>range of wireless</span> communications for working outdoors, then you can use a waterproof electronic hub with a power of 20 watts eHub Portable or a speaker UE BOOM.  The first of them has a 20-meter range, and the second works at a distance of 15 m. If this is not enough, then there is a choice of several options for portable Bluetooth speakers that receive a signal 30 m from the source. </p><h2>  Power Sources and Battery Life </h2><p>  Although most portable (portable) speakers come with a built-in battery, some large speakers need to be powered from the mains (for example, the Sony GTKXB7BC).  Such devices are suitable for home entertainment or parties indoors with electrical outlets.  If you need a portable speaker to play music on the beach or on a hike, you need a built-in battery.  On average, one charge is enough for 8-16 hours of work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  According to user reviews, this is the most important factor in choosing the best portable speakers.  You should choose a device that can cover a room of 10 square meters.  m. Models with a capacity of 10‚Äì20 W are ideal for rooms and small parties.  As a rule, high-quality, clear bass and loud sound reproduce speakers with passive emitters and Hi-Fi amplifiers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portable speakers AYL SoundFit" class="if uuid-2320961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2320961.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and color </h2><p>  The choice of these options depends on personal preference.  Some like angular speakers, and some like round ones.  Some like blue, while others like black.  Most speakers are available in several color options.  Thus, you can always find a model of your favorite color. </p><h2>  Other functions </h2><p>  Most portable speakers have various additional functionalities, such as a built-in flashlight, the presence of a built-in power supply, audio input, NFC connection, a USB port, etc. Therefore, if portable speakers with certain functionality are required, you need to search online or in the local market. </p><h2>  The brand </h2><p>  For users, the manufacturer‚Äôs brand has always been of great importance, since a well-known brand product always ensures high build quality.  There are several popular manufacturers of portable speakers, such as JBL, Bose, Jabra, UE Boom, Sony, Ion, etc., who have managed to prove themselves well.  You should never choose a Chinese copy or a non-proprietary speaker in the hope of economy, because this does not guarantee high sound quality or a sufficient battery life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of each model depends on its functions, power and brand.
