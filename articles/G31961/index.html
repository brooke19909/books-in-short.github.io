    <h2>  Good to know </h2><p>  If a person is going to Vietnam and wants to stay at this hotel, then he should take into account some of the nuances.  So, firstly, check-in here starts at 14:00.  Check out lasts until 12:00.  It is important to <span>consider this</span> when selecting a flight. </p><p>  Secondly, if you need a transfer from the airport, you need to send a corresponding request to the accommodation facility.  Better yet, contact the property directly by calling.  You need to do this after buying tickets, as you will need to specify the flight data. </p><p>  Thirdly, the hotel can accommodate children, but extra beds are not available for them, and they are counted as adult guests. </p><p>  Fourth, when making a remote reservation, you must indicate your credit card number in the application.  Subsequently, it is presented upon arrival with a passport.  The accommodation facility accepts Visa and MasterCard. </p>

    <h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  It will not be superfluous to talk about prices for tours to Nha Trang from Moscow.  A good ticket from a trusted tour operator will cost about 90,000 rubles for two people.  This price includes: </p><ul><li>  Round-trip airfare for both.  Flights are selected at a convenient time, and, moreover, without transfers. </li><li>  Deluxe accommodation with a balcony. </li><li>  Payment of breakfast for the entire period. </li><li>  Taxes and fees. </li></ul><p>  There are other tours to Nha Trang from Moscow, at higher prices.  For 130,000 rubles, for example, you can buy a similar ticket, but only with lunch and dinner.  In any case, buying a tour is a more profitable solution than planning your entire trip yourself.  At least because the traveler is freed from the main problem - the search for a convenient flight.  They are usually transplants. </p>
