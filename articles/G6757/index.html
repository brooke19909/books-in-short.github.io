  <section class="page js-page"><h1>War in lebanon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The war in Lebanon began with a Palestinian-Israeli confrontation consisting of the seizure by Israel of certain lands in southern Lebanon. </p><p>  In 2000, Israeli troops were withdrawn from southern Lebanon by UN resolution. </p><p>  But Hezbollah demanded a cleansing of the Israeli troops border area called "Shebaa farm."  On the UN map, these lands are marked as belonging to Syria.  But Israel recaptured them as a result of the <span>Six Day War</span> in 1967.  Syria confirmed that these lands belong to Lebanon, and therefore must be freed from Israeli troops. </p><p>  In the liberated territories, Hezbollah fighters were given complete freedom of action.  They began to raise outright threats against Israel. </p><p>  The UN in response issued a resolution according to which Israel liberated Lebanon, and Lebanon disarmed.  But the leadership of the latter refused to comply with Hezbollah‚Äôs requirements. </p><p>  The war in Lebanon began in 2006 with shelling of the Israeli border region by Hezbollah fighters.  As a result of this attack, three Israeli soldiers were killed, two more were captured.  The alleged purpose of this operation was to exert pressure on Israel, as well as divert attention and forces from the Gaza Strip. </p><p>  Hezbollah did not expect to receive a full-scale military operation in response to its actions.  But Israel blocked Lebanon from sea and air, carried out massive air strikes, destroying Hezbollah‚Äôs infrastructure, and then proceeded to a land operation whose purpose was to create a buffer zone along the Lebanese border.  Hezbollah bombarded the northern part of Israel daily in an attempt to preserve the occupied and fortified areas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fire was suspended on August 14 by a UN resolution. </p><p>  The war in Lebanon already by July 19 caused this state economic damage, amounting to $ 2.5 billion.  No less extensive losses were suffered by the other side.  The war in Lebanon affected 70 settlements in Israel, destroyed almost the entire infrastructure.  Total damage was measured in billions of dollars. </p><p>  The 2006 Lebanon war became a matter of international importance.  Many countries and influential organizations had a hand in resolving it.  The United States suggested that a truce in this situation is impossible until the Hezbollah fighters are disarmed.  The United States pointed to the interest of Syria and Iran in the conflict.  France in this situation rejected the possibility of an invasion of NATO peacekeeping forces in the war zone.  Russia also supported the position that the conflict should remain within existing borders. </p><p>  The 2006 Lebanon war required the hard work of the UN.  For two weeks, the Security Council could not decide on this conflict. </p><p>  Towards the end of hostilities, both countries spoke of their victory.  Although independent observers believe that none of the countries came out victorious. </p><p>  October 2006 began with the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and a ceasefire.  Now the southern lands of this state were under the control of the Lebanese armed forces and UN peacekeeping forces. </p><p>  Israeli soldiers abducted at the beginning of the conflict were never returned to their homeland.  The conflict led to a significant decrease in the confidence of the party of Israel, but not a single statesman was dismissed. </p><p>  Israel recognized the conflict as war only on March 19, 2007. </p><p>  One of the indirect reasons for the contradictions with Israel could also be the 1990 <span>civil war</span> in Lebanon, which became an important political motive for the outbreak of hostilities.  That is why the interest in the war with Israel was so high on the part of the entire world community.  The Palestinian-Israeli conflict shows that the situation in the Middle East is still tense, the likelihood of new conflicts is still high. </p>
