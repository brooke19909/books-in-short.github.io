If you don‚Äôt have one, then use a bicycle, just put on the nipple cap.  Before inflating, be sure to rub it in your hands, pull the ends in different directions, so that the rubber is slightly warmed up to avoid tearing with a sharp jolt of air. </p><p>  The ball hole must be pulled onto the pump and inflated object with light movements.  Be sure to leave 10 or 15 cm deflated at the end so that when the figure is twisted, excess air can move into empty places without problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to inflate a long balloon" class="if uuid-2845601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2845601.jpg"></div><p>  If you decide to inflate such an elastic ball with your mouth, then be patient.  Do not forget to warm the rubber in your hands by friction and stretching before work.  Act in parts, covering with your hand every 5 cm of the ball.
