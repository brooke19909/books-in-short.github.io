    <p>  Later we will talk about the parameters of Alcatel POP 2 5042D in more detail, but now we will analyze the fundamental points.  You can say the cornerstones on which this unit is based.  So, for the price of 5 thousand rubles, we get not the newest software shell (‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù 4.4), not the largest amount of RAM (1 GB) and not the best quality screen.  The device will not please us with the battery life either, the battery is designed for only 2,000 milliamps per hour.  But with the communication capabilities of the Alcatel POP 2 5042D, everything is in order.  Nevertheless, who will look at the set of communications if they do not allow the device to be used for a long time?  But first things first. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  It is safe to say that the screen is that part of the smartphone where you come across the most noticeable paradox.  On the one hand, the Alcatel POP 2 5042D is equipped with a TFT-matrix, which today has the worst display quality.  It is easily overtaken by IPS, but you can‚Äôt even talk about AMOLED and S-AMOLED. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main characteristics </h2>

    <p>  So, <span>Alcatel One Touch</span> POP 2 5042D has a screen resolution of 480 by 854 pixels with a diagonal of 4.5 inches.  Estimates suggest a pixel density of 240 dots per inch.  If the manufacturer installed the IPS matrix rather than TFT on the screen, this would be a noticeable progress and could greatly change the rating of the device.  Nevertheless, the TFT-matrix, or rather its installation, here is a kind of reckoning for the low cost of the device.  Actually, there is one more justification for using TFT: low battery capacity.  Such a matrix will consume more charge than the same IPS. </p><h2>  Color rendering </h2>

    <p>  It is pleasantly surprising that the screen does not give off excessively blue tones, as is the case with many budget solutions.  In general, <span>Alcatel One Touch</span> POP 2 5042D is pleased with the color rendering, it is at a good level.  There is almost a crystal clear white color, for which I would like to thank the developers.  And this is even at small brightness levels.  Yes, of course, there were some errors.  For example, in small text you can see blurring of thin lines, and when the device is flipped to a vertical plane, the color gamut will be distorted.  But is there anything else that Alcatel One Touch POP 2 5042D opponents in the same price category can boast of?  Unlikely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Additional modules and functions </h2>

    <p>  Another Alcatel smartphone is equipped with a light sensor, which will allow you to adjust the level of screen backlight in automatic mode.  Considering that not all models for seven thousand rubles have this function (and even for ten thousand rubles, oddly enough), for such a set you can be glad.  By the way, the Alcatel smartphone changes the brightness level without any jerks, doing everything softly, smoothly and gradually. </p><p>  The developers added a rather interesting solution to the device.  Like ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù, the device can be either woken up from sleep mode or ‚Äúdriven‚Äù there using a double tap on the display.  When ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù, the main screen will immediately open, and the lockscreen will be skipped.  The same can be done exactly the opposite. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Alcatel POP 2 5042D, the price of which is about five thousand Russian rubles, is equipped with two cameras.  The main one has a resolution of five megapixels.  The front is more modest, with only two megapixels.  The main module is complemented by an automatic focus function on the subject, there is also an LED flash.  However, making a huge bet on it should not be, because it copes with its tasks (due to low power) very, very mediocre. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Discrepancies </h2>

    <p>  By the way, problems with the front camera were identified.  The earlier information on two megapixels was received from developers and official representatives of the company.  However, multiple tests conducted using special software showed that there is only 0.3 MP.  We won‚Äôt notice any special settings, there are only two of them: activating / deactivating the night mode and creating four photos in a row.  The compression algorithm is not bad, it saves space on the phone.  It is possible that initially the company planned to <span>interpolate the camera</span> from 0.3 to 2 megapixels, but for some reason decided not to.  For those who are not sophisticated in selfies, the result will still remain acceptable. </p><h2>  What about the main camera? </h2><p>  In Alcatel POP 2 5042D, the firmware for which will optimize the operation of the operating system, there is a fairly good main camera.  Despite its five megapixels, in good lighting, it produces really high-quality images.  In parallel with how the level of illumination will fall, the quality will deteriorate, but it looks quite logical.  Auto focus works not only smartly, but also competently, to dig into the process or the results will not work. </p><h2>  Software part </h2><p>  The work of software and hardware, which corrects the <span>white balance,</span> leads to the creation of good pictures.  Even without setting advanced settings, you can take high-quality photos in almost any type of lighting.  When shooting faces, the user can enjoy a slight shift of the spectrum towards warm colors.  This parameter has almost no effect on other scenarios, so it can be evaluated positively.  There is a macro mode.  It will not provide perfect results.  Nevertheless, fans of shooting flowers and other objects can safely count on him. </p><h2>  Macro </h2><p>  What about photos with text?  In principle, boasting of some transcendental achievements is unlikely to succeed.  But the necessary level is still present.  If you take a picture of an A4 page, the text on it will be easy to read even without much scaling.  However, readability will fall in proportion to a decrease in letter size.  Alcatel POP 2 5042D, the characteristics of which are listed at the beginning of the review, makes it impossible to conduct good shooting at night.  Even though he has a flash.  Its only sensible purpose is to use it as a flashlight. </p><h2>  Practical use </h2><p>  If you are an active user, you will definitely have to purchase a cover for Alcatel POP 2 5042D, so as not to damage the case and not wash the spray.  We already talked about the operation of the display, so it makes no sense to repeat.  You can make out the topic of communications, which, probably, will be more interesting for those who are going to use a smartphone for its intended purpose.  That is, actively communicate on social networks, browse the Internet and call up with loved ones. </p><p>  So, in the fourth-generation cellular network, the device works quite fast.  He immediately ‚Äúclings‚Äù to the coating.  Taking into account the price of the device, this is even a bit surprising in a pleasant way, of course.  The signal indicator shows impressive details.  In general, from the third to the fourth generation and back, the device switches very cheerfully.  And it really pleases.  It is clear that in this case there can be no complaints about the quality of data transfer.  There are no problems. </p><h2>  Wireless &amp; Speakers </h2><p>  The sensitivity of the Wi-Fi module is at a high level, there are no complaints about it.  Pleased with the fast and accurate operation of GPS.  There is an A-GPS add-on, which once again facilitates the work with satellite maps of the area.  Together with a good ‚Äúhook‚Äù of the smartphone for covering cellular networks, these parameters provide an excellent opportunity to use the device as a communicator.  The radio part is made to glory, you can not argue with that. </p><p>  As for the sound, this part of the subject of our review today is the very fly in the ointment.  She becomes a kind of rehabilitation.  The multimedia speaker is far from perfect.  Hissing, crackling - these are his main shortcomings.  There is nothing more to highlight, but this ‚Äúsweet couple‚Äù is enough, as they say, for the eyes.  Probably, in this direction, Alcatel should go with an eye on the ingenious solutions of Beeline, where there is no multimedia speaker, and its role is played by the universal auditory one. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, what can people who have purchased this phone model tell us?  Among the shortcomings, they distinguish a not very convenient arrangement of buttons.  It is annulled by the fact that you quickly get used to such nuances.  But you can‚Äôt get used to the fact that the screen is not made as high-quality as you would like.  With the modern stuffing that is presented in the device, the display seems to be something completely inappropriate.  But there are no complaints about the stuffing of the communication plan and the camera.  The communication unit works smartly and efficiently, which makes this Alcatel model an excellent solution for those who like long ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù on the Internet. </p>
