It is a stylish, modern, ambitious and simply beautiful LCD "Newton".  Chelyabinsk is an industrial city, dynamically developing, with a steadily growing <span>population.</span>  Housing here is always in demand, so new large housing complexes are being erected in large numbers.  But their architectural sophistication and design wisdom eclipsed everyone LCD "Newton".  A curious fact: some "discover" Newton‚Äôs new laws, implying not the famous physicist, but this LCD.  "Laws" describe the comforts of life in the future complex and relate to advanced technologies for its construction, quality of work, and improvements in planning.  Others call the LCD "New Tone", hinting that the complex will bring novelty to the architecture of the entire city. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  An enviable plot of land near the city center is allocated for the development of LCD "Newton".  Chelyabinsk is administratively divided into several areas.  The complex is being built in Kalininsky, one of the most prestigious.  At 110 meters from the buildings is located the ice palace "Tractor" with a small park, 400 meters cardiology center.  Literally 300-400 meters from the complex, along the streets of Salavat Yulaev in the 28th microdistrict and Academician Makeev in the 33rd microdistrict there are many shops and supermarkets, the most popular of which are Pyaterochka, Diksi, Magnit.  Schools and kindergartens are also nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Newton Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1616414.jpg" width="495"></div>

The complex will turn out in the form of a wonderful island surrounded by these new roads. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Conveniently located LCD "Newton".  Chelyabinsk is a city in which not only housing, but also transport construction is developing.  So, it is planned to extend tram routes to the cardiology center located next to the LCD.  But now by public transport to the "Newton" can be reached easily.  If you take minibuses No. 98, 128, it is most convenient to get off either at the Cardiocenter stop, and if you take minibuses No. 94, 53, or take bus number 80, you need to get off at the Ice Arena stop.  In addition, many minibuses, buses, plus a trolley stop 10 minutes walk from the complex. </p><p>  For motorists, the location of the LCD is even more convenient, since it will be surrounded by roads on all sides.  Gas stations are 200 meters from Newton, which is also quite attractive.  The only problem you have to face is traffic jams during peak hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex Newton Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1616430.jpg" width="480"></div>

Chelyabinsk, although an industrial city, is relatively clean.  A large role in this is played by the forest and parklands that surround it.  The Kalininsky district, where the complex is being built, is considered the most prosperous, according to the expertise on measuring air pollution in Chelyabinsk.  An additional advantage of "Newton" is its location near the forest zone.  True, in the future, the complex will be surrounded by roads, which will increase amenities, but worsen the environment. </p><h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The developer of the LCD "Newton" is the leader in the South Urals in the segment of housing construction company "Legion".  It was created in 1992 and at first carried out work classified as building mountaineering, then switched to multi-profile building renovation, and since 2003 it began to act as a builder, performing work from the concept stage to the implementation of finished projects.  In her piggy bank - LCD "Svyatogor", "Sunflowers", "Alexandrovsky" and, perhaps, her most grandiose project is the new building of the LCD "Newton".  Chelyabinsk, thanks to the Legion, takes on a more modern and presentable appearance, but some residents of already commissioned facilities have comments on the quality and further maintenance.  ‚ÄúLegion‚Äù tries not to violate the deadlines, which provides it with a high rating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments LCD Newton Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1616423.jpg" width="495"></div>

According to the plan, there will be 10 high-rise multi-sectional houses (numbering from No. 5 to No. 13 and house No. 1).  Cases with a number of floors from 13 to 18 will be located so that they form 4 separate courtyards.  They are planned to be made closed with security and access system.  In the courtyards, the developer promises to build bright multi-functional playgrounds that are pleasant to the eyes and comfortable recreation areas, sports grounds, plant trees, shrubs, flowers, and arrange lawns.  On the ground floors of the buildings will accommodate various commercial facilities, including a shopping complex.  In one of the yards of the complex, the Legion company promises to build a municipal kindergarten. </p><p>  For motorists in "Newton" it is planned to equip 3 underground and several ground parking, both paid.  In total, it will be possible to place 1,500 cars on them.  Important - the entrance to the ground parking will be guarded, and video cameras will be installed along its perimeter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Newton Chelyabinsk prices" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1616397.jpg" width="504"></div>
