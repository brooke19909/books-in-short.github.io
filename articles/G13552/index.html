The organization offers a wide range of services to all its customers.  For example, make money transfers through a mobile device.  Next, we will consider the “Mobile Bank” and transfer through 900 to the card of Sberbank.  What information about these operations is important?  How exactly should you act in this situation?  To answer all this and not only try further.  In fact, even the new client of Sberbank is able to do all the necessary manipulations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="changellenge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank logo" class="if uuid-2488553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2488553.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the Mobile Bank option?  Anyone who is going to deal with this bank should find out about this.  Only with the help of such a service will it be possible to carry out transactions at 900. </p><p>  Mobile banking is a service that allows you to manage banking plastic from a mobile phone.  The client will be able to monitor expenses and income on the account, transfer money from card to card or recharge SIM. </p><p>  In fact, transferring through 900 to a Sberbank card without mobile banking is impossible.  Therefore, you must first connect this service. </p><h2>  Mobile banking connection </h2><p>  What do I need to do?  To use the specified service, you need to do the following operations: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Go to the nearest bank branch and submit an application in the established form.  Have with you - passport, credit card, mobile phone. </li><li>  Call 8 800 555 55 50 and ask the operator for a connection.  At the request, you need to name the plastic number, F. I. O., code word and mobile device number. </li><li>  Use an ATM or Sberbank payment terminal.  The user needs to insert plastic, then select “Mobile Bank”, indicate the service tariff (“Full” for 60 rubles per month and “Economy” - free, but with a limited range of operations), enter the number of the mobile device, confirm the action. </li></ol><p>  Now you can transfer to the card of Sberbank through the number 900. To cope with such an operation is not difficult.  Especially if you follow the guidelines below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Money" class="if uuid-2488556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2488556.jpg"></div><h2>  Single card operation </h2><p>  First, consider a situation in which only one bank card is tied to a phone number.  In this case, transferring money to a Sberbank card after 900 will cause a minimum of trouble. </p><p>  Guidance on translating ideas into reality takes the following form: </p><ol><li>  Open a new message writing mode on the phone. </li><li>  Form a letter in the form: Transfer phone_number amount. </li><li>  Send a message to 900. </li></ol><p>  In response, the person receives an alert with detailed instructions to confirm the procedure.  Usually you need to send a specific code to the previously indicated number.  This is pretty easy to do.  Operations will be free when using the “Full” tariff for mobile banking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The result will not be slow to wait.  In a few minutes, the recipient will receive money in the specified account.  More precisely, on a card tied to the mobile device number written in the message.  Sometimes a transaction is processed for several days.  The maximum waiting period for funds is 5 days. </p><h2>  Several plastics and one number </h2><p>  Translation can be done in a slightly different way.  Consider a situation in which several cards are tied to the sender’s mobile device.  This also occurs.  And mobile banking does not in any way limit the right to make money transfers in such circumstances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stickerapp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone number" class="if uuid-2488559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2488559.jpg"></div><p>  Transfer to Sberbank card via SMS (900 - the necessary number to work while using mobile banking) is carried out as follows: </p><ol><li>  Start writing a new message on your mobile device. </li><li>  Generate a letter according to the previously proposed type, but with some changes.  The message form will be as follows: Translation "phone number" "4 digits from the end of the card number" "transfer amount". </li><li>  Send a message to the previously indicated number. </li><li>  Confirm the procedure. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  After the actions taken, the user will transfer through 900 to the card of Sberbank.  Money will be debited from plastic, the end of which will be indicated by the client of the financial institution. </p><p>  Important: you can use Perevod, translate, perevesti as a code word. </p><h2>  About restrictions </h2><p>  Now it’s clear how transactions are carried out using mobile banking.  Transferring money in this way has several limitations.  We will talk about them further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vectorstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="send SMS" class="if uuid-2488567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/2488567.jpg"></div><p>  To date, there are several binding rules for customers who wish to complete a transaction: </p><ol><li>  For a day from one plastic can not be transferred more than 8 thousand rubles. </li><li>  All operations are carried out only in rubles.  Therefore, the recipient of the money must have a ruble account. </li><li>  Money can not be thrown between your cards. </li><li>  Mobile banking does not work with credit and virtual cards. </li><li>  It is forbidden to make more than 10 translation requests per day. </li></ol><p>  So far, these are all the restrictions that a person should know about.  Transferring through 900 to the Sberbank card will now not cause any trouble.  Even a person who is poorly versed in the services of a bank is able to perform those simple actions that were written about in this article. </p>
