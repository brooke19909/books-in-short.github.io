    <p>  The history of international relations is an interesting course to study in higher education, thanks to which you can learn a lot of useful information.  This discipline is compulsory at the faculties of international economics, international <span>economic relations,</span> as well as management and law.  In our time of globalized globalization of production, it is very important to be able to establish contacts at the international level, since the possibility of achieving the set goal largely depends on this. </p><p>  People throughout their history interacted with each other, and these relations were far from always friendly.  Numerous wars and conflicts often caused large sacrifices on the part of all conflicting parties, however, for the winner, as a rule, these sacrifices paid off with captured wealth and additional human resources.  The history of <span>international relations</span> includes such stages as Antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the New Age, at each of which power passed from one category of society to another. </p><p>  In antiquity, all central authority belonged to the king or pharaoh, who ruled his country with the help of priestly advisers.  After the spread of Christianity, it was this religious area that quickly began to grow stronger, and, in the end, turned into a rigid centralized system of Western Catholicism led by the <span>pope.</span>  In the Middle Ages, despite the presence of kings and nobles, the real power belonged precisely to the church elite, which led, in fact, all international affairs.  The history of international relations contains many examples when it was the church that made the final decision in terms of the development of a medieval state.  It should be noted that in the Middle Ages she pursued a rather aggressive policy, an example of which can be fierce <span>crusades</span> to the east, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fortunately, already in the second half of the 17th century, dogmatic church authority began to weaken, giving way to stronger feudal lords, whose place in the future will be occupied by trading houses (banks).  Gradually gaining strength and power, representatives of the capitalist elite at the end of the 19th century could radically influence the economic system of many countries, contributing to the establishment of international trade, as well as having a direct impact on foreign policy.  As a result, today the history of international relations gives us many examples of interaction between individual subjects of such relations, and many of them can be adopted. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that throughout the entire historical period of the development of countries and states, such interactions changed and, in the end, general norms and rules were developed here.  By the end of the 18th century in Europe, most states came to the conclusion <span>that such</span> relationships between countries should be based on the rule of law and mutual respect for each other.  Today, the systemic history of international relations teaches us how to conduct international negotiations and trading activities, as well as cooperation in the joint development of technical innovations.  Due to the unification of norms and bringing everything to uniform principles, embassies and consulates of all states can interact with each other on the basis of the law and guarantee the inviolability of diplomats and their representatives. </p><p>  If we talk about our country, then the history of international relations and <span>foreign policy of Russia also</span> includes the legacy of the USSR.  All previous ties of the empire with foreign countries were preserved and today entered a phase of close cooperation with leading states.  Numerous meetings of diplomats and party leaders with foreign missions once again prove the close cooperation of our country with highly developed states, so I hope that someday we will reach a decent level of development and be proud of our country. </p>
