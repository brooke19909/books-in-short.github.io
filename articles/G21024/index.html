    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The largest city of Porto in Portugal is the second.  It is the center of the municipality and district of the same name.  Porto is located on the banks of the Douro River, 270 km from Lisbon. </p><p>  The city is inhabited by 240 thousand people.  Porto and its surrounding suburbs are a major metropolitan area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater Porto. </p><h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  Long before the Roman era, there was a settlement on these lands.  The Romans built a city here and named it Portus Cale.  It was first mentioned in chronicles dating back to the 5th century.  The name later changed.  He began to be called Portucale. </p><p>  Until the VIII century, the Moors owned these lands.  In 982, Portucale became a Christian settlement ruled by Heinrich of Burgundy. </p><p>  The city of Porto dates back to 1123.  Its economic heyday began in 1237.  By the 15th century, it had become the main center of shipbuilding in the country. </p><p>  The rebellious nature and freedom of love have always been distinguished by the people of Porto.  In 1209, its inhabitants opposed huge taxes and kept the episcopal residence under siege for five months.  The Inquisition did not take root in this city - with tremendous difficulties, it lasted 4 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto portugal city" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/717269.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is a symbol of the city and the highest tower in the country. </p><p>  In fact, it is the bell tower of the <span>Catholic Church of</span> Clerigos.  It is visible from anywhere in the city.  For a long time, it was a guide for sailors. </p><p>  The church is built in baroque style.  Its interior is decorated with marble and skillfully decorated with carvings.

It is also made in the Baroque style. </p><p>  An observation deck is equipped on the sixth floor of the bell tower.

    <p>  The bridge spans are installed on a steel arch structure, the length of which is 172 meters.  In addition, there are 5 bridge pylons.  In this unique building, two steel spans were created - the upper one, which is located at a height of 62 meters, a length of 174 m, and the lower one (172 m) at a height of 10 m. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The author of the project of this bridge is engineer Teofilo Seyrig, who was a student of the great <span>Gustav Eiffel.</span>  For its construction, 3000 tons of steel were needed.  The bridge was put into operation at the end of October 1886. </p><p>  Today, the metro line runs on the upper span, and the lower structure is used as a highway, pedestrian pavement and narrow gauge railway. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Tourists from different countries come to the city of Porto with pleasure.  Its sights are diverse.  Here everyone can see the monuments of history, culture, architecture, etc. </p><p>  It is believed that once the center of Porto was the Cathedral, and a city was already being built around it.  The temple is located on a high hill and is visible from anywhere in Porto.  Without a doubt, this is the most popular place where tourists like to visit. </p><p>  The cathedral was built in the 13th century.  It looks stern and impregnable.  The fact is that it was rebuilt from an old fortress.  Toothed thick walls testify to this.  They were necessary for protection from the Moors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto city photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/718788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The church continued to be completed until the XIX century, so the cathedral complex is a combination of a wide variety of styles. </p><p>  Of particular value is the unique silver altar.  800 kilograms of pure silver were used to create it.  In 1809, he was miraculously saved from French soldiers - the city residents quickly walled up the altar niche.  We recommend you to inspect the patio.  It is lined with Portuguese Azulejo tiles. </p><p>  In June, the cathedral attracts attention every year.  At this time, traditional celebrations are held in honor of St. Antonio. </p><h2>  Episcopal Palace </h2><p>  It is the current residence of all the bishops of Portugal.  It is located next to the Cathedral.  The Episcopal Palace has architectural features: it harmoniously combines two styles - Rococo and Baroque. </p><p>  The construction of this grandiose structure was conceived by Bishop Juan Rafael de Mendons.  He ordered to demolish the old palace, which stood on this site, and begin construction of a new building.  The construction lasted several years, and the author of the idea did not see his creation. </p><p>  It should be noted that many elements of the initial plan were radically changed.  Some fragments were completed in a hurry.  This violated the structure of the building. </p><p>  The palace was erected in the XII century, but only the stylistics of the windows and some elements of the facade remind of the Romanesque style.  Later, it was rebuilt and reconstructed many times. </p><h2>  Porto Calem Port Museum </h2><p>  This unusual museum is located on the territory of one of the country's oldest wine enterprises.  The Porto Calem trademark began its history in 1859.  All this time there were produced port of the highest quality.  The museum introduces the history of this ancient production. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto portugal city photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/717273.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, you can take part in a tasting of this noble drink or buy wine in a local shop so that you can enjoy its aroma upon returning home. </p><h2>  Crystal Palace Park </h2><p>  Often, tourists who come to the city of Porto begin to see the sights from the Park of the Crystal Palace.  Residents of the city are very proud of this amazing place. </p><p>  Music lovers will enjoy concerts held in the main pavilion building.  Architecture experts will appreciate the harmony of the building.  Paradise and Eden merged here into a single whole. </p><p>  A crystal clear lake surrounds the palace.  Flower beds with strange flowers, palm trees, peacocks - the park has everything you need for romantic walks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="porto city in portugal" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/717274.jpg" width="600"></div>
