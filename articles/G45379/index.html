  <section class="page js-page"><h1>City Minden, Germany: description, attractions with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For the first time this wonderful German town was mentioned in the so-called imperial chronicles in 798.  In them he was listed as the seat of the imperial assembly of Charlemagne.  Around 800, the emperor founded a bishopric in this city.  In 977, the settlement was granted customs law, the right to a coin charter and free trade.  Today this city (population 84 thousand people) is the center of the East Westphalian region, as well as the historical and political center of the land of Minden. </p><p>  The article provides information about the small town of Germany - Minden: photos, description, attractions. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="52.2964919" data-lng="8.894920599999978" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/4/4/2/18442.png"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  At this point, <span>the Weser River</span> erupts between the low ridges of Vienna and Weser, and then leaves this mountainous country, after which its waters enter the territory of the North German Lowland.  Minden is located just north of that breakthrough. </p><p>  The city of Germany, Minden, extends on both sides of the flat part of the Weser, but its southern regions (Ducen, Heverstadt and Haddenhausen) occupy the northern slopes of the Vienne ridge.  The city center is located about five kilometers north of the mountains, on the border of the Middle Weser Valley and the Lubbeck Loess Plain.  The section of these two natural complexes is clearly expressed in the relief of the city.  He divides it into lower and upper Minden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city is located 40 kilometers from Bielefeld, 55 kilometers from Hanover, 60 km from Osnabruck and 100 km from Bremen.  The highest point in Minden (Germany) is in the Haddenhausen area (180.5 meters above sea level), and the lowest is in the Leteln region (40.3 meters).  The 42.2 m mark is indicated on the town hall. Minden has often been and is still being flooded due to its location on the Weser floodplain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.kudoybook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Streets of Minden" class="if uuid-3260501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3260501.jpg"></div><h2>  About the name of the city </h2><p>  The German town of Minden has a name a bit similar to the names of other settlements.  Initially, he was often confused with M√ºnden (located in the Elector of Hanover), also located on the Weser River. </p><p>  In order to distinguish between these cities, some clarification was introduced: M√ºnden became known as Hannover-M√ºnden (there is also Preisch-Minden in Prussia). </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Minden (Germany) was founded around 800.  Before the Peace of Westphalia, it was, as noted above, the center of the Catholic Diocese of Minden.  Subsequently, Minden became ruled by the Principality of Brandenburg-Prussia and expanded to a fortified city.  At the same time, it turned into the administrative center of the Principality of Minden, and in 1719 received the status of the center of the Minden-Ravensberg region.  Minden became the center of the administrative district of the same name in 1816. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Currently, the city is famous not only for historical monuments, but also for its unique bridge, thrown at the intersection of the canal of the Central German River Weser.  There are also numerous buildings in the Minden era of the Weser Renaissance, as well as a cathedral, which is an important architectural landmark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pdc.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Minden Town Hall" class="if uuid-3260515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3260515.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of Minden </h2><p>  Germany as a whole is rich in ancient architectural monuments.  The center of Minden is decorated with colorful houses of merchants and burghers, as well as medieval churches.  There is a Prussian museum (former barracks) at Zim√©onplatz, as well as a former food warehouse at St. Martin's Cemetery.  These buildings date back to the era of the Prussian architects Jilly and Schinkel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prussian Museum of Minden" class="if uuid-3260532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3260532.jpg"></div><p>  The city center is characterized by historical buildings, including the oldest town hall with a Gothic gazebo (13th century) and a 1,200-year-old cathedral, and half-timbers for the Upper Town.  All this testifies to the turbulent history of the city. </p><p>  Magnificent Renaissance buildings and the Mindinsky Museum are located in the old part of the city.  The region is also unique in the ship-mill, which has its own pier on the banks of the Weser River and was commissioned in 1998. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pizzatravel.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mindena Water Bridge" class="if uuid-3260520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3260520.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most unique structures in Germany and Minden is the water bridge, which is 370 meters long and is the second longest in Europe (the first in Magdeburg).  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that the Central German Canal flows directly through it, and it throws it across the Weser River. </p><p>  It should be noted that nowhere in Germany there is so many varied mills.  Fields, meadows and parks between the Wiengebirge mountains, the Weser river and Lake.  Dummer strewn with them.  These mills were intended not only for grinding flour for baking bread, but also for grinding oats for the production of the famous local beer, which was also known during the heyday of the Hansa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mills of Minden" class="if uuid-3260523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3260523.jpg"></div><h2>  Cultural and sports facilities and events </h2><p>  The city of Germany Minden is located on the path of one of the most popular cycling routes - Weserradweg.  Thousands of tourists and cyclists visit it annually. </p><p>  The city is famous for its cultural diversity.  Not only museums of local history, history and local folklore, but also the city theater, attracting many visitors, are of great importance for the entire region.  Minden is the center of jazz music. </p><p>  The city has a wonderful cultural center, an open-air stage, a theater on Weingartan and a beach.  Minden is also athletic.  Many clubs offer conditions for practicing a variety of sports: canoeing and kayaking, upscale handball, archery, baseball and more.  Dr. Blaue Band der Weser is one of Europe's largest events in water sports, which is held here every 2 years. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The city of Germany Minden can offer its guests many interesting sights.  At night, the picturesque streets of its central part sparkle with lively cafes and bars. </p><p>  Due to the many roads, bus and train routes in Germany, getting to this economically developed and prosperous cultural center is quite easy. </p>
