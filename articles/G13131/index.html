    <p>  In the very first years of the spread of mobile phones, manufacturers had to make a reservation when positioning such gadgets as mobile.  The fact is that they were mobile and remain only conditionally, since there is a dependence on the cable of the charger.  Remove all the conventions of this designation of mobile phones and smartphones allowed wireless charging. </p><p>  How does this device work?  All technologies on which such charges are based are based on the principles <span>of electric power transmission</span> from a distance.  It is important to note that the proliferation of wireless technology and information transfer has long been not something new and surprising.  Radio signal modules, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensors, network access points - all this to one degree or another allows transmitting information signals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the novelty and fundamental difference of precisely <span>chargers</span> with a wireless principle of operation lies precisely in the possibility of transmitting energy from a distance to power the batteries. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The most common design of such devices involves the presence of induction coils in the filling.  In fact, they serve as receivers, as well as translators of electrical signals.  When the charging itself is connected to the mains, a voltage is formed, after which a magnetic field is also formed - around the transmitting coil.  Actually, after entering this phone field, wireless charging is also activated. </p><p>  How does recharge work?  Due to the conversion of electromagnetic waves that pass into the battery already as electricity.  At the same time, the target for power can be not only a phone or smartphone.  Developers are guided by the wide standards of rechargeable batteries and batteries, which also include some models of tablets, cameras, players and other equipment. </p>

    <p>  Depending on the model of the device and its characteristics, different conditions for maintaining charging are possible.  For example, to understand how <span>Samsung's wireless charging</span> works <span>, you</span> should familiarize yourself with the Qi power transfer standard.  Such a transmitter is able to replenish the battery capacity at a distance of 3-5 cm, that is, a practically mobile device should be in contact with the charger. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wireless Charging Security </h2><p>  The ability of the charges to transmit energy over distances rightly raises questions regarding their safety for users who, in any case, will be in the range of the induction coils.  However, manufacturers claim that such devices do not cause any harm to health. </p><p>  Examples include electric shavers and brushes that work on the same principle of electromagnetic fields as wireless charging for the phone.  How does the charging panel work in contact with other equipment and does it harm it?  This question is also being raised, but manufacturers deny a similar danger. </p><p>  The fact is that the maximum power at which such devices operate is no more than 5 watts.  This is not enough to have a negative effect even on devices sensitive to electromagnetic fields. </p><h2>  Devices from Samsung </h2>

    <p>  One of the most successful developments in the Korean wireless charging segment is the Wireless Charging Pad.  This is an optimized version of the base family, in which the common problems of most of these first-generation devices have been fixed.  One of the main advantages of this model is the ability to interact with the phone‚Äôs battery, regardless of its position relative to the functional area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In its present form, this version is represented by wireless charging for the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6,</span> which supports the WPC standard.  This technology is different in that it is suitable not only for Galaxy smartphones, but also for most other Samsung phones.  In addition, as the manufacturer notes, charging can replenish energy by half the capacity in just a few minutes. </p><h2>  Apple devices </h2>

    <p>  I must say right away that ‚Äúapple‚Äù products do not support wireless charging technologies.  Nevertheless, the manufacturer is looking for alternative ways to provide this feature to its users. </p><p>  In particular, he recommends the use of accessories in the form of covers from the company Duracell.  Therefore, the question of whether wireless charging works through the case will have a positive answer in the case of iPhones.  If this method does not suit you, then you can use the iQi format receiver card.  It connects through a special Lightning connector and also hides under a standard smartphone case. </p><h2>  Devices from Cota </h2>

    <p>  Interesting offers are being developed by Cota employees.  They do not just master the concepts of specialized charging panels for mobile devices, but strive to maximize the range of their field of action.  For example, in addition to phones and tablets, wearable electronics can be filled with energy with such a device.  And for this, it is not necessary to bring the device close to the active panel. </p><p>  A small apparatus the size of a bread box works at a distance of 10 m. The question arises: "How does wireless charging with such a radius work? Is it efficient enough?"  And here it is worth returning specifically to wearable technology, among which are: smart watches, bracelets and wristbands, since it is in working with these gadgets that the device demonstrates the most impressive indicators.  Obviously, the <span>maintenance of batteries</span> from phones and smartphones requires more time. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of wireless charging </h2><p>  Like all technologies that radically change approaches to the use of technology and electronics, wireless charging devices have many disadvantages.  Of course, the user gets a significant advantage, since he does not have to bother with wires and connectors, but the filling efficiency of the power supply with this method is noticeably reduced. </p><p>  Most devices provide a charge for a longer period of time compared to the classical method.  In addition, there are ergonomic inconveniences, which modern wireless charging cannot yet get rid of.  How does a wired charge system work?  It requires connection to the device, after which it can be used by those same 30-60 minutes required to replenish energy.  However, in the case of wireless technologies, not only does the charge time increase, but the possibility of using the device during this period is also excluded. </p>

    <h2>  Directions for further development </h2><p>  Actually, all directions of development of chargers working without wires are focused on eliminating the above-mentioned shortcomings and, on the whole, improving basic characteristics. </p><p>  Also a big problem remains the considerable weight of such devices.  In the middle segment, an ordinary device is a platform that can hardly be called mobile.  However, it is worth noting here how the Samsung S6 wireless charging and devices for the younger versions of the smartphone from the Charger Kit line work.  These are panel charging accessories that are fixed to phones by the type of protective devices and covers.  This configuration of the interface minimizes the dimensions of the charging infrastructure, but at the same time does not differ in high efficiency. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  This is not to say that the advent of wireless charging has caused a stir in the market of accessories for mobile devices.  Despite the novelty of the concept, the distribution of these products is hindered not only by ergonomic shortcomings, but also by the cost at which wireless charging for the phone is implemented. </p><p>  You can make a similar device with your own hands at lower cost.  To do this, it is enough to organize a blocking generator with the function of an energy transmitter.  As experienced craftsmen note, such a circuit will require only a home-made copper-based coil and one transistor with an accompanying wired infrastructure.  Another thing is that in terms of reliability and security, such a device will noticeably lose to the same proprietary models from Samsung. </p>
