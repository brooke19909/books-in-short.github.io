The camera announced in May 2015 became a new branch of the line, although in many respects similar to the X-T1, especially after the latest firmware updates.  <span>Fujifilm X-T10,</span> whose price is $ 650, refers to mid-range devices. </p><h2>  Elite filling </h2><p>  Fujifilm X-T10 has the same 16-megapixel X-Trans-sensor X-T1 (and other latest models) and mount for any lens with X-mount.  The image processor provides the same quality as the best camera in the series.  In the center of the sensor there are many built-in AF points, thanks to which you can be sure of continuous focusing - until the object leaves the phase detection area.  In addition, the Fujifilm X-T10 demonstrates the new AF zoning capabilities introduced with the latest firmware update. </p><p>  The screen has the same resolution and tilt mechanism as the X-T1.  The viewfinder, albeit with a smaller increase, but with a flagship OLED display.  The speed of continuous shooting depends on the used memory card, photographing conditions and the number of frames, and ranges from 3 to 8 fps.  Full HD video is recorded at 24, 25, 30, 50 or 60 fps.  The minimum shutter speed is 1/32000 s, there is built-in Wi-Fi. </p>

    <h2>  Fujifilm X-T10 Design Review </h2><p>  The device is a compact retro-style camera that resembles a slightly smaller version of the flagship X-T1.  Its dimensions are 118 x 83 x 45 mm and its weight is 381 g with a battery.  This makes the Fujifilm X-T10 or Olympus OMD EM10 Mark II one of the smallest interchangeable lens cameras and an outstanding upward viewfinder in the style of DSLR devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When comparing dimensions and weights, optics must be taken into account.  The camera is usually sold in two sets of Fujifilm X-T10 Kit: with a cheaper XC 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 lens, which adds 62 mm to the depth and brings the total weight to 576 g, and with a more expensive XF 18-55 mm f2.8-4, which increases the dimensions by 70 mm and weight up to 691 g. </p><p>  The Fujifilm X-T10 loses the comparison with the EZ 14-42 mm optics kit for Olympus, because the folding design of the latter adds only 23 mm to the size and brings the weight to 483 g. </p><p>  Obviously, the Fujifilm X-T10 camera with optics is the largest and heaviest device of this class and will not fit in your coat pocket.  But still, the device is much smaller and lighter than comparable DSLR cameras, and non-folding optics provide the best quality of photography. </p><p>  The standard grip on the camera is small, and a user with big hands will probably prefer something else.  But do not get upset, as you can additionally purchase and install a grip of a suitable size.  Of course, it will be less convenient than with higher-end devices. </p><p>  Not a single mirrorless or mid-range SLR camera is waterproof.  To do this, have to invest in a semi-professional case, such as the X-T1.  Nevertheless, according to reviews of users who tested the camera in harsh conditions, there were no problems. </p><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  In terms of control, the Fujifilm X-T10 camera shares the X-T1 philosophy, albeit with a number of adjustments and even improvements.  Like the flagship, the mode dial is missing.  Instead, the device implements the approach of old film cameras with a shutter speed control in the upper part of the body, combined with the aperture ring on the lens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The exposure mode is determined by the position of these two adjustment dials.  If both are in position A, the X-T10 switches to program mode, in which the shutter speed and aperture are set automatically.  If you leave the shutter dial on A and turn the focus ring, priority will be given to the aperture.  If you do the opposite, then exposure will benefit.  If both discs are in a position other than A, the camera will switch to manual adjustment. </p><p>  This is familiar to everyone who worked with old SLR cameras, but users of digital devices will find the lack of a mode dial unusual.  They also note that the shutter speed dial between 1 and 1/4000 s has divisions in 1EV increments.  If you need longer shutter speeds (up to 1/32000 s) or shorter ones (up to 30 s), or you need 1/3 EV divisions, then you need to set the closest value on the shutter scale and then use the front control dial.  Photographers find it too complicated and call this solution ‚Äúretro for retro‚Äù.  Does the shutter disk really simplify the job, or is it just a tribute to style and nostalgia?  Perhaps the owners of the X-T1 are happy with this decision, but the users of the X-T10 are a completely different contingent. </p><p>  Fujifilm made the camera more user-friendly for beginners by setting a switch that puts the camera in full automatic mode. Photographers find this very convenient, especially when you need to quickly take a picture or transfer the device to another person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To the right of the shutter dial on the X-T10 is the exposure compensation wheel with a range of +/- 3EV.  It looks like a disk in the X-T1, only a little smaller and harder to rotate, which, according to users, solved the problem with a random shift in the flagship.  The shutter release is located between the two discs, but, unlike the X-T1, has a thread for connecting the cable.  The old guard, perhaps, will appreciate this curtsy to the past, which is doubtful in relation to modern photographers, since the photocable today is almost impossible to get.  Instead, you can use a USB port or Wi-Fi to remotely control the camera. </p><p>  To the left of the viewfinder build-up on the X-T10 is a DRIVE adjustment dial with a lever that pops out the built-in flash.  This means that there is no ISO disk present in the X-T1, but you can easily adjust the button on the rear panel to gain access to sensitivity.  The drive mode selector lets you choose continuous shooting options, including panoramas, bracketing, and special effects. </p>

    <p>  The X-T10 rear control panel exactly matches the X-T1 in layout and functionality.  Users are pleased that the buttons are now a little more issued than before, which allows better control of the click.  Trifles like this ultimately add up to a big difference.  You can configure the function of the four transverse keys, along with the highlighted function button at the bottom right, as well as the video button on the top panel. </p><p>  The DRIVE disc and rear control dial are now able to be pressed, which gives them more flexibility than the X-T1.  If the thumb knob is reserved for focus, the action caused by pressing the front dial can be customized ‚Äî for example, used to set the <span>ISO speed.</span> </p><h2>  Viewfinder and rear panel displays </h2><p>  Pressing the Q button brings up 16 settings.  You can configure what parameters are presented here and in what order, which allows you to quickly find the right one.  Users are advised to add the face recognition option here for faster access to it than through the regular AF menu. </p><p>  These 16 on-screen buttons simply require a touch screen, but unfortunately Fujifilm is resisting the adoption of this technology.  Users call this situation shameful. </p><p>  The X-T10 is a 3-inch 920k-dot LCD panel that can be tilted vertically up 90 ¬∞ and down 45 ¬∞. </p><p>  The electronic viewfinder uses the same 2360k-dot OLED display as the flagship X-T1, but its increase is lower - 0.62x.  The X-T10 viewfinder inherits the X-T1 trick: when the camera rotates for portrait shooting, the parameter information moves to the bottom of the display with a 90 ¬∞ rotation.  Users find this very convenient, especially when most of the frames are shot in this orientation.  It is so obvious and useful that it is not clear why so few cameras offer such an opportunity.  And at the same time, the information on the rear panel for some reason does not change the orientation. </p><p>  The X-T10 shooting information is no different from the X-T1.  You can turn on the <span>electronic level, which</span> displays the line of the virtual horizon, a histogram, an indication of the focal length, the framing frame and focus.  All of them can be displayed in the viewfinder or on the screen, and the DISP button allows you to easily clear the screen if desired.  The sensor located below the viewfinder allows you to automatically switch between it and the screen, or you can force the display to be activated using the View button to the right of the viewfinder. </p>

    <h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  If we talk about ports, the X-T10 is equipped in the same way as the X-T1 - a USB 2 port, a 2.5 mm jack and an HDMI micro-connector are located on the left side panel of the case behind a removable cover.  Like the X-T1, the 2.5 mm jack can be used to connect an external microphone or cable, and the RR-90 remote shutter can be connected to the USB port.  A 2.5 mm jack for an external microphone is not ideal, since most of them use a 3.5 mm jack, which will require an adapter, although video recording on Fuji cameras is unlikely to interest anyone.  In addition, the X-T10 is equipped with Wi-Fi, which also allows you to use your device with iOS or Android as a remote control. </p><p>  Users note that connecting a Triggertrap cable to a USB connector, unlike the XT1, does not lead to flare.  The Fujifilm X-T10 Body is better protected against light, even when the terminal cover is open.  This was confirmed by long exposures in bright daylight. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The battery is NP-W126, the same as the models XT1, XE1, X-Pro1, XE2, XM1 and XA1, which allows the use of spare parts of any device in the line.  According to Fuji, its capacity should be enough for 350 shots.  This is confirmed by many users with the caveat that video and Wi-Fi are not involved. </p><p>  The X-T10 is equipped with a traditional AC charger, although users would like to be able to recharge via USB, as is the case with Sony cameras.  It would be convenient, if there is no nearby outlet, recharge the battery using portable USB-batteries, car adapters, or simply through a laptop port. </p><p>  The location of the SD-slot and the battery next to the tripod mount on the Fujifilm X-T10 camera is said to be uncomfortable, as the tripod blocks access to them.  This applies to a few, but still ... </p>

    <h2>  Two sets of optics </h2><p>  The camera is equipped with a Fujifilm X-mount, which, with an APS-C sensor behind it, has a 1.5x magnification of field of view.  With the Fujifilm X-T10 Kit XC 16-50 mm and XF 18-55 mm kits, the image scale is changed with an equivalent field of view of 24-75 mm and 27-83 mm, respectively. </p><p>  The camera comes in two sets of lenses - with the budget Fujifilm X-T10 16-50mm f3.5-5.6 XC and the more expensive XF 18-55 f2.8-4.  In its lenses, the manufacturer uses the LMO optics modulation optimizer, which corrects image blur caused by diffraction when shooting with a small aperture, and also corrects softening to the edges and corners of the frame.  LMO is the default, but only for JPEG.  It does not affect the RAW format.  According to users, this kind of smart balanced processing makes Fujifilm cameras the best in the industry in terms of compressed image quality. </p><p>  Both lenses allow optical photo stabilization. </p><h2>  Fujifilm X-T10: Overview of Shooting Modes </h2><p>  The camera does not have an exposure mode dial.  Instead, like previous devices with an X-mount, the system for adjusting old SLR film cameras is recreated in it.  The shutter speed dial is located on the body, and the lenses are equipped with aperture rings.  If both drives are set to A, then the camera enters program mode. </p><p>  There is a separate button for the same purpose.  It is convenient for beginner photographers or for quick exit from unusual settings.  One click puts the camera in full automatic mode, and re-returns the previous settings. </p><p>  Available exposure values ‚Äã‚Äãare from 1 s to 1/4000 in 1EV increments.  The minimum flash sync speed is 1/180 s, for which a special position on the disk scale is highlighted.  Shutter speeds that fall outside the specified range or manual mode can be adjusted in increments of 0.3EV.  If you set the exposure to T, then using the front dial, you can choose a shutter speed from 1/4000 to 30 s. </p><p>  Also on the shutter disc there is option B for manual exposure, which can last up to 60 minutes while the shutter-release button is held down.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to remotely set the exposure for more than 30 seconds using the smartphone application, even in manual mode. </p><p>  Fujifilm X-T10 also has an electronic shutter.  The function is added by updating the firmware.  If it is turned on with the mechanical one, the X-T10 uses the latter for speeds up to 1/4000 s, after which it switches to electronic for values ‚Äã‚Äãup to 1/32000 s.  An impressive shutter speed, since the maximum that analogues can do is 1/16000 s. </p><p>  As with all electronic shutters, skew problems can occur if the camera or subject is in horizontal movement.  But under normal conditions, high shutter speeds can be used with bright apertures without the need for <span>ND filters.</span>  The mechanical shutter is quite quiet, a little quieter than the OMD EM10 II, but not by much. </p><p>  Automatic bracketing (AEB) is available, but surprisingly modest, offering only three frames in increments of 0.3;  0.6 or 1EV, which makes it a little more useful than simple shooting.  HDR is missing.  The only positive aspect is that the entire 3-frame AEB sequence can be called up with a single press of the shutter button or self-timer.  This allows the camera to capture all frames without additional clicks.  Users are unhappy about the lack of 7-frame bracketing Olympus OMD EM10 II and Panasonic Lumix G7. </p><p>  ISO bracketing, film simulation, dynamic range and white balance are also available, but the X-T10 disables RAW recording, leaving only JPEG.  This is strange, as other modes allow RAW or RAW + JPEG shooting. </p><p>  Multiple exposure allows you to take two pictures and combine them. </p>

    <p>  ADV mode allows you to apply one of eight additional filter effects: </p><ul><li>  lomography </li><li>  thumbnails </li><li>  color highlighting </li><li>  light tone </li><li>  dark tone image </li><li>  dynamic tone </li><li>  soft focus and </li><li>  partial color with six sub-options (red, orange, yellow, green, blue or purple). </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the effects, you can achieve an unusual result, but you can‚Äôt apply them to video.  It‚Äôs annoying, but when using advanced filters, the X-T10 RAW file does not record. </p><p>  At the end of the DRIVE disc is Panorama mode, which allows you to select its length with panning in any of four directions.  To capture a panorama on the Fujifilm X-T10, instructions explaining the procedure will appear on the screen at each stage of the process.  During shooting, the camera will capture several images and merge them into one.  The process works quite well, the seams between the images are invisible. </p><p>  Rummaging through the menu, you can find an interval timer that allows you to save up to 999 frames with an interval of one second to a day.  In addition, a delay of up to 24 hours can be set before shooting.  True, the camera does not allow you to collect the shot in the video, like in Olympus and Panasonic.  This function would not hurt users, because competitors offer such an opportunity as a standard, with a <span>resolution of 4k</span> and a speed of up to 30 <span>fps</span> . </p><p>  Another set of effects is available with the film modeling function, which serves to simulate the effects of different types of film.  Provia default color mode is set to provide a good balance of contrast and color without being too bright or saturated.  To achieve greater contrast and saturation of the palette, you should choose the Velvia option, which, according to users, is best suited for shooting landscapes.  The more restrained Astia option enhances skin tones and is recommended for portrait shooting in natural light, like Pro Neg Hi and Standard.  To create good vintage frames, the Classic Chrome option, Sepia, or one of four monochrome modes, three of which use yellow, red and green filters, are suitable.  Users are advised to use the option "Monochrome + Red Filter" to darken the blue sky and detail the structure of the clouds. </p>

    <h2>  Focus and continuous shooting </h2><p> Fujifilm X-T10 is equipped with the same hybrid AF system as the flagship X-T1, which uses technology based on contrast and phase detection.  Depending on the shooting mode, the AF system is divided into 49 or 77 zones throughout the frame, and the phase detection area, consisting of 9 3x3 points, is concentrated in the center. </p><p>  The X-T10 also displays on the screen or in the viewfinder the distance to the marked subject in the form of a strip that resizes to indicate the effective depth of field depending on distance, focal length and aperture.  It is interesting to use. </p><p>  In the AF settings menu, you can choose between three modes: </p><ol><li>  "One point" allows you to manually assign one of the 49 points of the AF grid size of 7x7. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúZone‚Äù and ‚ÄúWide / tracking‚Äù modes use an array of 77 points 11x7 in size.  In this case, the first option groups them into small autofocus areas of 3x3, 5x3 or 5x5 in size and across the entire field of the frame - this is convenient for focusing the camera on a particular area, allowing automatic selection within the permitted limits. </li><li>  The third mode transfers the right to choose the AF area to the camera software. </li></ol><p>  The face detection function is activated in the focus options menu.  After that, you can set the eye detection option with a choice of left, right or nearest eye.  If a face is not detected, the X-T10 switches to the previously selected AF mode, which made it easier to work with the camera compared to the original X-T1 firmware. </p><p>  Autofocus options can be changed using the small drive on the front of the chassis. </p><p>  Single-frame AF when using the complete X-T10 lenses is fast, captures the subject in good light with minimal pause.  In low light, it will take 1 s to focus.  This is inferior to Panasonic and Olympus cameras, but closer to them, which was a huge step forward compared to previous X models. </p><p>  Continuous AF can give very good results, but it largely depends on the position of the subject in the frame, the AF area mode and the lens used.  X-T10 has 9 AF phase detection points centered on the center of the frame.  They are activated automatically when you select this option with the option of quick shooting. </p><p>  Users note that the best result for moving objects is achieved using the zone mode.  Even when one AF area was within the subject, the X-T10 often tried to capture more than the required number of frames.  A wide mode is able to track the movement of an object throughout the frame, but if it goes beyond the points of phase AF, the camera has difficulty focusing.  Switching to zone autofocus, although it improved the result, from a series of 10 frames, only 6-8 were focused. </p><p>  Optics also have a big impact on image quality.  Users get better results with XF rather than with fixed focal length lenses.  It is significant that Fujifilm, while promoting the capabilities of the X-Series AF, invariably uses the XF 50-140 mm f2.8, and the XT1 and XT10 user manual recommends only zoom lenses. </p><p>  Manual focus mode, completely inherited from the XT1, is one of the best among analogues.  By pressing the center of the rear control dial, you can call up ‚ÄúManual Focus Help‚Äù.  At the same time, XT10 enlarges the selected AF area to the full screen for immediate confirmation.  Repeated pressing returns the previous state. </p><p>  While holding the button, you can choose one of two options - focus peak selection and digital image splitting. </p><ul><li>  The first highlights the focused objects, which is especially useful when used in combination with the magnification when you press the help button again. </li><li>  The second bifurcates the image, like film SLR cameras.  The X-T10 has a small window in the center of the frame with a black and white picture divided into five stripes.  When the picture is out of focus, the stripes are shifted relative to each other, showing the object in a slightly distorted form.  As the focus strips are aligned. </li></ul><p>  The option works well when the image contains clear lines, and on more homogeneous objects it is often difficult to understand if the lines are aligned or not.  Users find the highlighting of focused objects more useful, especially when combined with frame enlargement. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  Fujifilm XT10 is equipped with Wi-Fi, which allows wireless image transfer and remote control of the camera from a smartphone with iOS or Android.  After launching the application, 4 options are offered: remote control, receiving and viewing images, and geo-tagging. </p><p>  Thanks to the remote control, you can view the image, shooting information and access the control buttons.  Clicking anywhere on the frame changes the autofocus area, which somewhat compensates for the lack of a touch screen on the camera itself. </p><h2>  Sensor and Processing </h2><p>  The Fujifilm X-T10 is equipped with a 16-megapixel Advanced X Trans II CMOS sensor, exactly the same as the X-T1.  It uses a unique color filter that avoids the moire effect and eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter, providing enhanced image clarity, and the APS-C format and modest resolution mean low noise at high sensitivity.  Version II refers to the built-in AF points. </p><p>  Sensitivity ranges from 200 to 6400 ISO with an extension of the range from 100 to 51200 ISO.  Like the X-T1, the increased range is available only in JPEG format. </p><p>  Users using the minimum sensitivity for maximum exposure are unhappy with the lack of RAW at 100 ISO, as they have to be content with white balance and processing options embedded in the camera. </p><p>  In general, the camera in question is an ideal solution for those who want to possess the characteristics of the X-T1, but they cannot afford it.  Compared to the Fujifilm X-T10, the flagship price is 60% more. </p>
