It is the capital of the region, where oil is produced on the right bank of the Irtysh.  Previously, a settlement was located in this territory, which was under the control of the Prince of Ostyak Samara.  To the north of the city you can see the Ob floodplain, stretching for many kilometers.  In the south is the Irtysh.  We learn a lot of interesting information about this city later in the article. </p><h2>  Demographic situation </h2><p>  At the time when the filling of this paragraph with people began, the population of Khanty-Mansiysk was no more than 10 thousand people.  When the period of perestroika came, it increased approximately three times.  Further, the trends were also positive, since there was a migration of the external and internal type. </p>
