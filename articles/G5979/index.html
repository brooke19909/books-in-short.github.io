The town is located on the coast of the Gulf of Salerno, 60 kilometers from Naples, at the source of the Regina Mayor River. </p><p>  Historians have not yet come to a consensus about when the city was founded.  Opinions of experts differ.  Some claim that Majori (Italy) was founded by the Greeks, others by the Romans, and still others mention the mythical prince Sicardo.  The only thing that is reliably known is that the city traces its history from ancient times.  When it was one of the most important ports of the Amalfi Republic.  In the Middle Ages, it was here that the headquarters of the fleet and the arsenals of the whole republic were located.  Due to its favorable geographical location, Majori flourished at all times.  He was even called the "Royal City."  And in the last century, Maiori (Italy) was recognized as an international class resort.  Now the city boasts a beautiful modern promenade, beautifully equipped beaches and fashionable hotels. </p>

A direct bus runs between the cities.  In addition, you can take a train to Salerno and transfer to one of the suburban minibuses Sita, which will cover 25 kilometers.

This option is more preferable.  But if you decide to fly to Rome, you will still have to get to Naples by domestic flight.  Or from Rome to get to the resort by bus or train. </p><h2>  Resort Hotels </h2><p>  There are no problems with accommodation at the resort, since the city has a sufficient number of facilities for tourists.  There are places even during the high season.  The hotels of Maiori (Italy) are quite diverse, so resort guests always have an extensive selection.
