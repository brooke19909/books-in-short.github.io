In bygone times, conquerors from Africa left a huge mark in the history of this territory, and the French presented a knowledge of the most beautiful language to the people of this area.  Each year, the former French colony welcomes a huge number of tourists from both far and near abroad.  Tunisia is very popular due to the fact that the island has a great many clean beaches with white sand and unusually blue waters of the sea. </p><h2>  Hammamet Resort </h2><p>  At a distance of 65 kilometers from Tunisia itself is Hammamet, which is its cultural capital.  A huge number of thalasso centers have been built in Hammamet.  The city has a rather rich historical base, and the local mood just has to relax and enjoy the surrounding landscapes.  The atmosphere of general peace and tranquility here is successfully combined with the unbridled fun that comes with the advent of darkness.  When planning a trip to the resort, it is better to take care of accommodation in advance.  Your attention is invited to a description of one of the most popular hotels in Tunisia. </p><h2>  Yadis Hammamet 4 * (Hammamet) </h2>

    <p>  From the airport, the hotel can be reached in minutes.  This is his first positive side. </p><p>  The complex itself is not large.  But on its territory there is a pool with a two-meter depth.  In the past, the hotel had a club name due to the fact that there is a golf course.  There is also a tennis court.  All accessories for the game can be taken on bail.  From sports entertainment, there is also a fitness center with a set of simulators, but their use is at an additional cost.  There is also another pool. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned every day.  Sometimes staff need to be reminded to add shampoos and other accessories.  But when reminded, they deliver a double dose.  An in-room safe is available for a nominal fee.  It will also be necessary to make a deposit for the key, which is returned upon eviction. </p><p>  It is better to spend dinars right away, since you can change them to another currency only at the airport.  In other exchangers you can only buy dinars.  The hotel can also exchange currency at the normal rate. </p><p>  The room has a minibar, but you must fill it yourself.  TV is useless here, as there is nothing to watch except for one religious channel. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is extremely successful.  Both the sea and the center are within walking distance.  Also nearby are shops with everything you need.  Do not worry if you forget something at home.  The center is a 7-minute walk away.  There are many gift shops.  But it‚Äôs better not to drop in a lot here.  From camels, which are used as cabmen, an unbearable stench is in the air. </p><p>  The hotel is mainly inhabited by Europeans, almost no Russians.  Tunisia is a colony of France, therefore they speak mainly French.  They speak English at the initial level, but as such, there is no language barrier. </p><p>  The best time of the year to visit Tunisia is summer.  Even in its midst, the temperature here does not exceed 30 degrees.  The water in the sea is very warm. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Yadis Hammamet 4 is an 8-minute walk from a chic, spacious beach surrounded by white sands.  The beach area is very clean.  Sand is cleaned of garbage with a special tractor, which regularly travels along the beach area.  There is also a bar with a bit overpriced.  Perhaps it‚Äôs cheap for Europeans. </p><p>  Beach type.  There are practically no people here, but there are a lot of free sun loungers.  There are also water activities (parachute flying, banana, tablet, scooter).  The atmosphere is very comfortable.  A cool breeze almost always blows here. </p><p>  The hotel restaurant is very clean with a comfortable atmosphere.  There are always free places.  The food is tasty enough.  Daily available seafood and a large selection of sweet ripe fruit.  Sweet tooth here is a real paradise.  Serve slowly.  It is better to take care of the drinks yourself, as the staff is not particularly in a hurry to serve you.  Moreover, almost all drinks in the hotel are diluted with water, and wine and beer are generally impossible to drink.  Stronger drinks were served only in the hotel lobby. </p><p>  Breakfast is very tasty and hearty, however, some dishes can not wait, as they are served at the very end, when it is time to go to the beach. </p><p>  Especially delicious grilled dishes.  Everything is natural and of good quality.  You can go for the supplement several times. </p><p>  From entertainment, guests were offered animation.  It all starts with a children's program, then everything smoothly turns into rampant fun for adults.  After such walks it is very difficult to recover. </p><p>  From excursions you can go to Carthage and visit the ancient ruins of the Mediterranean. </p><p>  Tunisia is a wonderful resort, but vacationers are treated with some lethargy.  It is constantly necessary to ask for something and take care of our own comfort.  Strange, but everything is paid.  But all the inconvenience of local service hides the unsurpassed climate of the resort.  Much can be forgiven for the warm sea and the gentle sun.  In addition, the prices here are quite low, in comparison with other resorts of a similar level. </p>

    <p>  According to the advice of tourists, most of the time it is better to spend at the hotel and on the beach.  Since outside it you can encounter unpleasant odors and not very impressive local flavor.  At the same time, some indifference of local residents to tourists is striking.  Perhaps they are already accustomed to such an influx of tourists and do not go too far for tourists to visit their country again and again.  After all, they will do it anyway, because Tunisia is really beautiful. </p>
