One of the resort <span>cities of Turkey,</span> which is always in high demand among holidaymakers, is Kusadasi.  If you are interested in this place, then you need to choose for yourself a good hotel option.  In this regard, Omer Holiday Resort HV 1, which at one time was awarded four stars, can perfectly suit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="omer holiday resort hv 1" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580429.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The facade of the building and the color scheme of the hotel </h2><p>  Every day in Turkey there are more and more hotels.  Each of them is trying to attract the attention of visitors thanks to the bright colors of their facades.  In this regard, the Kusadasi Omer Holiday Resort hotel tries to adhere to strict colors.  Looking at him from the side, you can‚Äôt say that he is a four-star.  The two-story hotel building is hidden behind the dense crowns of trees planted nearby.  The facade of the hotel building itself is very interesting.  Designers did not come up with any unnecessary features and gave the hotel severity and attractiveness due to the combination of two primary colors: white and beige.  Perhaps such minimalism is the key to the success of the hotel?  Indeed, from year to year there are practically no empty numbers in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kusadasi omer holiday resort" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580428.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We are going to the hotel </h2><p>  Omer Holiday Resort 5 HV is located in one of the most popular resort cities in Turkey.  Like many other resort cities, Kusadasi does not have its own airport.  Therefore, in order to get to the hotel, you must fly to the city nearest to it.  These are Izmir and Bodrum.  If you choose the option with Izmir, then get ready to go from the airport to the bus station of the city, since there is no direct connection between Kusadasi and Izmir airport.  In the case of Bodrum, everything is a little easier.  The city itself is smaller than Izmir.  Therefore, the trip to the desired bus will take less time.  Moving from Bodrum to Kusadasi itself will take a little less than 3 hours, and at the same time you will have to spend 8 euros per person.  If the option with a trip to the bus station, and then a three-hour drive to Kusadasi is scary, then the Omer Holiday Resort offers its guests a transfer service directly from the airport.  Before ordering this service, you need to immediately determine which city is more profitable to fly through, because a taxi in Turkey costs much more than the same bus.  The advantage of the option with a transfer is that there is no need to look for a bus station, and then expect the necessary bus.  Yes, and get to the hotel Omer Holiday Resort HV 1 will be much faster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="omer holiday resort 5 hv" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580431.jpg" width="600"></div>

And many hotels in <span>Kusadasi (Turkey)</span> are located in close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea.  This is not an exception.  Having settled in it, you can watch the stunning seascape, as well as enjoy the beautiful view directly on the city itself.  Izmir Airport is closer to this hotel than <span>Bodrum Airport.</span>  Only 70 kilometers away.  In other words, when using the transfer service, you can reach the hotel within one hour.  The only negative location of the Omer Holiday Resort HV 1 should be called its great remoteness from the city center.  In order to get to the central part of Kusadasi, it is necessary to overcome a path of 4 km, and this can be done in no less than 40-50 minutes. </p><h2>  What services are provided at the hotel </h2><p>  Once in the Omer Holiday Resort Shark Hotels, you will appreciate the wide range of various services that can please you in this hotel.  The first type of service is transport.  It includes not only a transfer from the airport to the hotel and back, but also the possibility of renting a car for the duration of your stay at the hotel.  Also, the hotel provides for the availability of vehicles, which every now and then send tourists on certain tours of the city.  Another very convenient service within the hotel is an exchange office.  It allows you to freely change your monetary currency to the one you need.  It is better to immediately exchange your money for <span>Turkish Lira,</span> because almost all goods and services in the city are sold precisely for the national <span>currency of Turkey.</span>  If you do not have time to buy gifts for yourself or your loved ones, then do not worry, because the hotel has its own gift shop, where you can find a large assortment of all kinds of figurines and magnets.  Other services provided by the hotel include the safe storage of luggage if necessary, as well as the availability of a safe for important things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="omer holiday resort shark hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580425.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sports and recreation </h2><p>  Many hotels in Turkey try to beat their competitors due to the presence of a wide variety of sports and entertainment complexes.  Kusadas Hotel also tries not to face its dirt.  And to diversify their services in this regard.  If you are a fan of tennis, you can rejoice, as in this four-star hotel there is the opportunity to practice this sport.  You will be provided with all the necessary attributes, so you can safely go to the court and start the game.  If tennis does not appeal to you, then you can try your luck at the table.  In addition to tennis, darts or canoeing can be enjoyed on site.  For those people who came to the hotel to rest and relax, other types of entertainment are provided.  One of these types is billiards.  Also, if you wish, you can go to a Turkish bath and step back from all the problems that haunt you in your hometown.  People who want to keep fit and improve their health can go to the fitness room, which has a large variety of equipment.  In addition to all of the above, the Omer Holiday Resort HV 1 has a large swimming pool, which changes water every day. </p><h2>  Food and nutrition </h2><p>  In terms of food, this hotel does not lag behind its competitors.  If necessary, you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Breakfast at the Kusadasi hotel is offered as a buffet, that is, each settler can take for himself those dishes that he liked the most.  In order for as many people as possible to have dinner at the hotel, hotel workers arrange amazing show programs that cannot leave guests indifferent.  But if suddenly there was a desire to go somewhere outside the hotel and have dinner there, then not far from the hotel you can always find a large number of all kinds of cafes and restaurants where delicious dishes are prepared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel omer holiday resort" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580426.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has a fairly large number of rooms of various classes and categories.  The cheapest option is a standard room, which includes a medium-sized room with a shower room, TV and free Wi-Fi.  Deluxe rooms differ from standard ones in that they contain more expensive furniture and appliances, and the size of the room itself is larger.  Luxury rooms are almost the most expensive in this hotel in the resort of Kusadasi (Turkey).  A photo of this type of room is presented below.  They have the best and most expensive furniture, exclusive linens, and also offer stunning sea views from the balcony.  In all rooms of the hotel, you can find a clean bath towel, bathrobe and hairdryer.  If necessary, food can be ordered to the apartment by telephone, which is also present in absolutely every hotel room. </p><h2>  Apartment prices </h2><p>  The cost of a room at the Omer Holiday Resort depends on what initial conditions the guest chose, how many people are accommodated, as well as the room category.  The cheapest option is a standard twin room with breakfast included.  This number will cost $ 100.  A deluxe double room will cost $ 140 for one night.  If you want to check into a suite, you must be ready to part with the amount of 205 US dollars.  These rates are not the cheapest, but at the same time there are hotels in Kusadasi that offer rooms at much higher prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kusadasi turkey photo" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580427.jpg" width="455"></div>

    <h2>  What is interesting around the hotel </h2><p>  If you are in Kusadasi, then you have a unique opportunity to go on a sea expedition to various ancient cities of Turkey.  Among these cities, Ephesus, Didim and Miletus should be highlighted.  In each of them there is a large number of ancient monuments of architecture and art that have been preserved here since the time of the ancient Greeks.  If there is no desire to go on an excursion, then you can go to Pigal beach, where payment for each type of product is made not with money, but with special beads and pebbles, which makes tourists feel like natives.  Young people will be interested to go to a large park, which is located just five kilometers from Kusadasi.  Here you can find a wide variety of slides and pools that will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kusadasi hotels Turkey" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/580430.jpg" width="600"></div>
