  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Floor height is not a guarantee of ceiling height</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the construction of multi-apartment buildings, projects indicate the <span>height of the floor.</span>  Usually this concept is used by builders or architects.  It is used to calculate the consumption of building materials.  Designers and non-construction people talk about ceiling heights. </p><h2>  Do not confuse terms </h2><p>  The term "floor height" includes the distance from the floor surface of one floor to the floor surface of the next.  That is, the thickness of the floor is added to the height of the room itself.  When studying projects of multi-storey buildings in search of your future apartment, do not forget about it. </p><p>  The declared design 3.3 m height actually turns out to be only 3 m to the ceiling of the living room without finishing. </p><p>  When choosing a home, they are usually interested in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment.  Much less often pay attention to the height of future possessions.  Somehow she falls out of sight.  Everything seems to be clear: we take a tape measure and measure along the wall from bottom to top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newfreedomremodeling.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New housing" class="if uuid-2252331" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2252331.jpg"></div><p>  You need to know that the height of the room can significantly decrease when changing floor or ceiling coverings. </p><p>  The difference can reach 25-30 cm, depending on the thickness of the materials and technologies used.  Suppose a suspended or suspended ceiling "eats" about 20 cm of the height of the room.  And leveling the floor can take another 20 cm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And instead of the acquired remarkable 2.8 m, you already have a modest 2.5 m. </p><h2>  Ceilings in different climates </h2><p>  Building norms and rules (SNiP) do not establish one, absolutely correct height of the room.  There is no exact figure. </p><p>  Housing is being built in different climatic regions.  If in winter in Krasnodar the temperature is about zero degrees, then in Yakutia frosts reach minus fifty. </p><p>  This determines the requirements not only for building materials, but also for the structural features of buildings. </p><p>  The temperature in the room, other things being equal, depends on the height.  The greater the height of the building, the greater part of it warms up the sun.  In this regard, construction rules link the height of the ceilings of multi-storey buildings with their location in the climate region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vidaeestilo.terra.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction is in full swing" class="if uuid-2246732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2246732.jpg"></div><p>  In cold northern regions, the rules establish that the ceilings in living rooms and kitchens must have a height of at least 2.7 m. </p><p>  In other regions of Russia, their minimum height according to the norms is from 2.5 m. </p><h2>  Floor height </h2><p>  Modern projects are trying to provide for the height of floors in a residential building no more than 2.8 m - 3 m. In panel buildings, rooms are usually low - 2.6 m. In brick new buildings, floors are up to 3 m high. In old "stalins" built in 50-60 years, they are even higher - up to 3.5 m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not all floors in the house will be the same.  For example, if a store is designed in a residential building, its ceilings will be higher than in apartments. </p><p>  In an apartment building, technical floors are designed in which engineering equipment and communications are located. </p><p>  These utility rooms are located between the aboveground floors, at the bottom of the house or at the top.  Building codes and regulations from 2009 establish the minimum height of the technical floor at 2.1 m. </p><h2>  The opinion of real estate agents </h2><p>  Practicing agents with statistics for 12 years gave their recommendations on the height of various types of housing.  In 2013, the document ‚ÄúUnified classification of multi-unit residential new buildings‚Äù was published.  It was prepared by the Russian Guild of Realtors. </p><p>  The classification helps to understand the terms ‚Äúeconomy class houses‚Äù, ‚Äúhousing comfort‚Äù, ‚Äúbusiness class apartments‚Äù, ‚Äúelite buildings‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ofdesign.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ceiling Height in Elite Housing" class="if uuid-2246661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2246661.jpg"></div><p>  The designs of multi-storey buildings provide for the next height for residential real estate. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Property class </p></td><td><p>  Economy </p></td><td><p>  Comfort </p></td><td><p>  Business </p></td><td><p>  Elite </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Ceiling Height (recommendation) </p></td><td><p>  from 2.7 m </p></td><td><p>  2.7 m - 2.75 m </p></td><td><p>  2.75 m - 3 m </p></td><td><p>  above 3 m </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  If the developer‚Äôs project includes a comfort class new building, and the ceilings reach only 2.64 m or even 2.55 m, this does not mean that you are being deceived.  Look carefully, perhaps this drawback is made up for by the other characteristics of the apartment. </p><p>  When comparing housing of the same class, its height is almost irrelevant to the cost. </p><h2>  Surprise new buildings </h2><p>  When buying real estate at the project stage, the buyer sees only advertising and project documentation.  Therefore, there is a risk of buying an apartment that is not quite what was planned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loversiq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The interior of a multi-story building" class="if uuid-2246681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2246681.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the floor can be read in the project, and the height of the ceilings is usually not prescribed in the contract.  The cost of housing is determined by its area.  Cubature is not taken into account in the price.  So, you can only guess about the height of your future apartment.  And square meters are not completely put down, indicating that the area is specified when measuring the BTI.  This happens after putting the house back. </p><p>  It is better to immediately decide on the question of the height of the new building with the developer.  True, still do not forget that the law allows the change of design documentation unilaterally, without agreement with the buyer. </p><h2>  What height is needed for happiness </h2><p>  Most people find high ceilings a must for expensive luxury housing.  They are the subject of desire.  Indeed, business class apartments usually have three-meter ceilings. </p><p>  However, interior designers warn: if the room is small, a high ceiling in it is inappropriate.  Its height should correspond to the proportions of the room. </p><p>  Therefore, standard apartments are usually a little higher than 2.5 m. It is quite comfortable for a person with a height of 1.8 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.golarank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior with low ceilings" class="if uuid-2246693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67477/2246693.jpg"></div><p>  Using the techniques and rules of organizing a residential interior, you can visually increase the height of the room. </p><p>  When the walls are the same color with the ceiling, they seem to merge, creating a feeling of infinity. </p><p>  The verticals on the walls will help visually raise the ceiling.  This can be a strip on the wallpaper, curtains on the windows. </p><p>  It turns out cozy home interiors.  This distinguishes living rooms from public spaces, the height of which, according to building codes, should not be lower than 3 m. </p>
