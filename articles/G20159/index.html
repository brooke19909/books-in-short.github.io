    <p>  Due to the abnormal geological features, a person here feels an otherworldly effect, expressed in hallucinations and prophetic dreams.  The cape is completely uninhabited, because not a single settlement has lasted here for a long time.  According to beliefs, this cursed place took away all its strength, and a man was literally aging before his eyes.  Again, the settlers spoke of luminous objects near the surrounding area.  Scientists believe that earth faults interact with solar energy, which is why not a single vessel stopped nearby.  And on boats daring to approach, all equipment was out of order. </p><h2>  Baidinsky Caves </h2><p>  Another interesting places on Lake Baikal, endowed with the status of archaeological sites, are located a couple of kilometers from the lake.  For thousands of years, water streams flowed through limestone cracks, forming 2 caves.  Large in shape resembles a triangle, inside it are 2 halls that are connected by a tunnel.  Archaeologists found clay dishes, bone knives, birch bark and other objects of the Iron Age culture under a layer of ice.  Inside a small cave located nearby, there is only one hall and 4 dead ends.  In it were found traces of ancient sites of local residents who took refuge from the cold in winter, and human bones.  And still caves are of great interest to archaeologists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places to visit Baikal" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1072750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mount Ehe Erdoi (Erd) </h2><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that the most interesting places in Lake Baikal are saturated with the spirit of mysticism.  Well, the famous mountain, located a few kilometers from the deepest lake, has been playing a huge role in the life of indigenous peoples for thousands of years.  It was rightfully considered sacred, because long since the locals held rituals there.  Ritual dances, which lasted about a week, were arranged near a hill of unnatural origin of an ideal dome-shaped form.  The cult center gathered a lot of people who held hands and thus closed the circle.  The ancient peoples believed that through a sacred place they communicate with their gods, and they, in response to actions, send universal grace to the earth.  If there were few people, and the circle did not close, it was believed that the year would be extremely unfortunate for residents. </p><h2>  Volcano valley </h2><p>  Speaking about the interesting places of Lake Baikal, one should not forget about the local attractions - the Valley of volcanoes, located far from civilization.  Now it is a huge field covered with frozen lava remaining after the eruption.  This amazing landscape, reminiscent of the landscape of an alien planet, for a long time remains in the memory of everyone who visited this edge of the earth.  You can even climb into the craters of two now inactive volcanoes overgrown with trees.  However, guides warn that this is an inaccessible and unusually difficult route that tourists overcome with experienced guides. </p>
