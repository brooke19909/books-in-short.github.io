    <h2> <strong><br></strong>  Beaches of Donuzlav </h2><p>  Someone, not afraid of big words, will say with confidence: this is the best that is in the Crimea.  And partly it will be true.  But it is worth saying that sandy deposits not only contribute to the fact that people come there to rest, they also protect the coastline from collapses.  For this simple reason, it is forbidden to use this sand as a building material.  It is from here that the best beaches of Crimea originate.  There are many vacationers here in season, however, free space can be found without problems.  It will be useful to say that this beach stretches in two directions.  On one is Evpatoria and Saki, and on the other is Olenevka and the Black Sea.  If you want a more relaxing holiday, then feel free to go along the second route, if you like youth relaxation, then go the way to Yevpatoriya. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The best <span>sandy beaches of Crimea</span> for families with children </h2>

    <p>  If you came to rest with your child in the Crimea, you should know that the place should be not only clean, but also warm.  <span>Kalamitsky Bay is</span> well suited <span>,</span> where the water is clear and warm, and the beaches are made of clean sand.  Evpatoria is also a good option, since the beach descends to the water gradually, without sharp cliffs, and this is what we need.  Of course, you can relax with children in other places, but safety will be lower, and parents should be constantly on the alert.  It can hardly be called a complete rest.  You can still visit Saki, where also for the most part shallow and well-warmed beaches. </p><h2>  Green holidays in Crimea </h2><p>  If you like kiting, windsurfing or diving, we recommend staying in Olenevka or Mezhvodnoye.  Here you will find not only solitude, but also a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãextreme adventures.  The local beaches are famous for the white color of sand, which appears due to various oxidative processes.  Here you can engage in gathering, as on the banks, and in the water too, you can find a lot of interesting gizmos, for example, beautiful shells and pebbles, mollusks and much more. </p>

    <p>  Here you can also take sand baths useful for the whole body, because the sand warms up well under the influence of sunlight.  Another of the most popular beaches on the western coast of Crimea is the Black Sea.  Here you can enjoy not only the purest water, but also natural sand baths, steppe air and delicious fruits.  All this will allow you not only to have a good rest, but also to do it for the benefit of the body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The symbol of the resort city of Feodosia </h2><p>  Many probably heard that in Crimea there is a Golden Beach.  It is located in Feodosia, about six kilometers from the city center.  Why gold, you ask?  Yes, everything is simple, in the sun it has such a bright yellow color as that of real gold.  Many tourists come here to relax under the warm rays of the sun on the clean sand.  The width of the sand line is more than 200 meters, and the length is more than 3 kilometers, this is it, Golden Beach.  Crimea is a very large peninsula, and there are plenty of places to relax, and, of course, this is the place where you must visit at least once in your life.  Here you will rest from the hustle or bustle of the city, you will find here only a lot of vacationers.  Golden Beach is public, you can get here for free.

Although this does not mean at all that in other places of Crimea something is worse.  Healing sand baths are one of the advantages that should make you come to Saki or Yevpatoriya.

    <p>  Of course, there are also contraindications.  For example, if you have insufficient blood circulation and heat treatments are contraindicated, it is strongly recommended not to abuse such treatment, although a few minutes in water and in the sun will not interfere with you.  The procedure itself is extremely simple.  You need to lie on your back and fall asleep in the sand.  The layer should be 5-7 cm, the heart is left uncovered.  In about ten minutes you can take a sea bath, the duration of which is about 10 minutes.  The procedure is repeated several times a day. </p><h2>  Crimea Hotels with Private Beach </h2><p>  If you are confused by a large number of people, then you need to find a hotel.  Fortunately, in Crimea this is quite simple.  In order for the hotel to have its own beach, it must be located on the first line, that is, in close proximity to the sea.  One of these places is located on the Black Sea coast, in Alushta, and is called Porto Mare.  In addition to the spacious sandy beach, there is a park area. </p>

    <p>  In Alushta there is a hotel with the interesting name ‚ÄúFrigate Santa Maria‚Äù, which has its own beach.  Although not sandy, it is clean and large enough.  In principle, there will be plenty of options, no matter where you stay, it will be Olenevka or Chernomorskoye, Alushta, Sevastopol or any other place.  It is recommended to book rooms in advance, because at the height of the season it is very difficult to find a good hotel. </p><h2>  The Golden Blade, or Sary-Bulat </h2><p>  This nice beach Crimea can offer all its vacationers.  It is located near the village of Portovoe.  A very long time ago this place was called Sary-Bulat, which means ‚Äúgolden blade‚Äù.  There is a shallow bay, which is protected on all sides by small islands.  That is why it is constantly quiet and calm.  The sand is golden in color, due to the small inclusion of iron in its composition.  The <span>Tarkhankut Peninsula</span> itself is very large, its sea coast stretches for 120 kilometers, but only a quarter of the beaches are suitable for swimming.  This place is suitable for a romantic evening, since there are often found the so-called "pocket" beaches - secluded and clean.  With proper luck, you can find a medieval well, which, despite the time, has survived to the present day.  There are underground lenses with fresh water. </p><h2>  Rest on the Bakal Spit </h2>

    <p>  In recent years, much more people have begun to relax in this place.  It has a very spacious and clean beach, which partially covers a shallow bay.  It is noteworthy that already in mid-May the water temperature reaches 18 degrees Celsius, and by the end of the month you can bathe children here, as the water warms up very well.  Lovers of outdoor activities come here, as high waves very often rise in this place, which reach 3 points.  Of course, the <span>resorts of Crimea</span> with sandy beaches on the north-western and western sides have many of their features.  For example, the water, although very salty, is rather warm.  You can go almost knee-deep into silt.  But if you decide to go to Bakalskoe Lake, be sure to brush yourself with healing mud, the main thing is not to overdo it, since this activity can do more harm than good if you use the wrong approach.  As you can see, it‚Äôs not at all a problem to find a good beach on the peninsula.  Crimea offers many free and paid options for every taste. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Perhaps you now know exactly where the best beaches in Crimea are.  There are a lot of them, and they are all good in their own way.  There are both shallow and deep steep beaches where it is better not to go with children.  There are also quiet places, but there are noisy ones. </p>
