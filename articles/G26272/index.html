  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best place for outdoor activities - resorts, hotels of Krasnaya Polyana</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Few foreigners know that Krasnaya Polyana is a cozy, wonderful and unusually beautiful mountain village in Sochi, near the city of Adler.  The town is located at an altitude of 550-600 meters above sea level, surrounded by mountains on all sides, but thanks to the vast terrace on which it lies and, for the most part, the Krasnaya Polyana hotels are located, you can observe magnificent landscapes of the surrounding slopes from any corner or window. </p><p>  Rest in this place is something completely unusual - a resort like Krasnaya Polyana in terms of beauty and originality does not exist in the world.  This town, hidden in the mountains, creates ideal conditions for lovers and lovers of skiing.  The resort is perfectly protected from the winds by the powerful mountains of Aibgi, Achishkho, Chugush and Asser, which allow the snow to lie on the slopes almost all year round, and for beginners or professional skiers to enjoy their favorite pastime.  And after active recreation and sports, you can return to the cozy and comfortable hotels of Krasnaya Polyana. </p><p>  Here everyone can relax as he wants.  The holiday season lasts from the beginning of May to the end of October (and at the highest points - in January-March and November-June) - and all this time you can enjoy the magical mountain-sea climate, ski runs of varying complexity and, of course, the most domestic , a comfortable and complete rest, which can only be offered by hotels of Krasnaya Polyana.  For example, a vacation at the Peak Hotel - the oldest, almost lost among the mountain peaks, offering its guests a choice of 102 rooms and several villas that stand separately.  Some consider this location of the complex very convenient, allowing you to immerse yourself in a romantic vacation, in which strangers do not interfere.  Some, on the contrary, come to the <span>mountains of the Caucasus</span> to have an active, fun holiday, designed to meet new people, compete and exchange experiences, so they necessarily mention the inappropriateness of such accommodation, giving reviews about Krasnaya Polyana hotels in general, and about the Peak Hotel in particular. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Returning to the advantages, which are undoubtedly more, it is worth saying that the guests of this hotel receive the widest possible selection of services and services at a very high, almost European level.  Individual guests' requests that can use round-the-clock service in their rooms, order any meal from local restaurants, or leave their kids for several hours at the Shlyapa Kids Club, where they will play with professional educators and experienced nannies, are of priority importance for all staff. . </p><p>  "Peak Hotel", like many other hotels in Krasnaya Polyana, offers its guests the organization of city tours or delivery to the starting points of the ski slopes, giving them the opportunity to use their fleet.  Some of the advantages of this complex are the ability to pre-book rooms, order a transfer from the <span>airport to the</span> hotel, in general, do everything for organizing a first-class holiday. </p><p>  The expensive and elite rest provided by the Krasnaya Polyana hotels is presented primarily by the Four Peaks Club Hotel.  Here, guests receive the most comfortable conditions, the highest class service and a lot of various entertainments.  Having settled in one of 12 beautiful and comfortable local rooms, tourists get the opportunity to go to the mountainsides (there is a ski lift near the hotel) or climb the observation tower to take part in a traditional Chinese tea ceremony.  In addition, guests are offered such activities as jeep safari, hunting and fishing, in winter - snowmobiling, in summer - paragliding and hiking, and, of course, almost all year round - mountain puddles and snowboarding.  The leisure program at the club-hotel is very rich, but, unfortunately, it does not suit romantic couples or families with children - there will be nothing to do in this category of the population in the ‚ÄúFour Peaks‚Äù.  As for all the others, then in this hotel all possibilities for versatile and active recreation are maximally concentrated. </p>
