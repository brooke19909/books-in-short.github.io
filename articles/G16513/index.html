The most famous sights of the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Coliseum originates in the 1st century AD.  e.  It is full of bright events and facts.  This grandiose building has survived to our time almost in its original form.  The Colosseum itself, its rich history, interesting facts and events will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Colosseum History </h2><p>  The Colosseum in Latin means "colossal, enormous."  It is also known as the Flavian Amphitheater (dynasty of Roman emperors).  The Colosseum is a monument of ancient Roman architecture and one of the many attractions that Italy is famous for. </p><p>  It is built between the Tselievsky, Esquilinsky and Palatine hills.  The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 (I century AD).  During the reign of <span>Emperor Vespasian, the</span> founder of the Flavian dynasty.  Eight years later, in 80, <span>Emperor Titus</span> consecrated the amphitheater, which was built on the site of a pond belonging to the famous complex of the <span>Golden House of Nero.</span> </p><h2>  Reasons for the construction </h2><p>  To be more precise, the history of the Coliseum began in the year 68.  That year, the <span>Praetorian Guard</span> changed the oath to the emperor, supporting the rebellious Senate.  This led to the fact that Nero, after 14 years of dictatorship, committed suicide in a country estate near Rome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turbosquid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reconstructed Colosseum Model" class="if uuid-2598485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598485.jpg"></div><p>  His death led to a civil war that lasted for 18 years.  In 69, the war was over; Titus Flavius ‚Äã‚ÄãVespasian, the founder of the emperor‚Äôs dynasty, won it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Vespasian faced the task of reconstructing the center of Rome, not only in order to restore it, but also to strengthen his own power and cult, to eradicate any mention of his predecessor.  The big problem for the construction of the Colosseum in Ancient Rome was the palace of Nero, which was called the Golden House.  The palace itself and the adjacent plot occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 hectares in the very center of Rome. </p><p>  Vespasian reconstructed most of the buildings, and those located near the palace of the lake fell asleep, building the Colosseum in their place.  All this large-scale event was quite symbolic, because the land that Nero used now began to serve the common people. </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  The antique amphitheater was erected at the expense of funds received after the sale of military trophies.  According to historians, more than 100 thousand slaves and captured soldiers were delivered to Rome for the construction and reconstruction of the entire complex of buildings.  They were used to perform the most difficult work, for example, in the extraction of travertine in the quarries of the Roman suburbs of Tivoli.  They also transported stone from the quarry to Rome; on average, the road was more than 20 miles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dom-sweet-dom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of the Colosseum" class="if uuid-2598477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598477.jpg"></div><p>  Large groups of architects, builders, decorators and artists performed their tasks, erecting an ancient amphitheater.  However, Emperor Vespasian was not destined to survive until the completion of the grandiose structure, he died in 79.  A year later, his successor Titus consecrated the Colosseum during its opening. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  general description </h2><p>  Like all other amphitheaters of Ancient Rome, the Colosseum amphitheater is built in the shape of an ellipse, in the center of which is the arena of the same shape.  Around the arena there are concentric rings with seats for spectators.  From all other structures of this kind, the Colosseum is distinguished by its impressive dimensions.  The length of the outer ellipse of the Colosseum is as much as 524 meters, the major axis is about 188 m, and the small axis is almost 156 m.The amphitheater arena reaches a length of about 86 m and a width of almost 54 m, the height of the walls of the Coliseum ranges from 48 to 50 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foundtheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colosseum in Rome" class="if uuid-2598449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598449.jpg"></div><p>  The basis of the design are 80 directed radially pillars, fortified with walls, as well as bearing arches and ceilings.  The Colosseum is so massive that for its construction it was necessary to make a foundation, reaching 13 meters in thickness.  Outside, the building was finished with travertine, which was delivered from Tivoli. </p><h2>  The facade of the amphitheater </h2><p>  The architecture of the Colosseum is majestic and grandiose, it still impresses with its splendor.  In the outer wall of the amphitheater, which reaches a height of almost 50 meters, there is a two-stage basement, and the facade of the building is divided into four tiers.  The three lower tiers are arcades (several arches of the same size and shape that rest on columns or pillars).  This technique in architecture was very popular in the 1st century AD. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="animalszooguru.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colosseum Arena" class="if uuid-2598489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598489.jpg"></div><p>  The arches of the lowest floor have a height of just over seven meters, and the supports supporting them reach a width of almost 2.5 m and a depth of about 2.8 meters.  The distance between the supports is 4.2 meters.  Columns with a Doric order are built in front of the arches, however the entablature (upper part) is created in a different architectural style. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that 76 of the 80 tiers of the lower tier were numbered.  Four were left without numbers, which were at the ends of the axes; they were the main entrances to the Colosseum. </p><h2>  Top of the facade </h2><p>  The columns located on the second tier of the Colosseum amphitheater rested on an attic (decorative wall), which was located above the entablature of the initial tier.  The arcades of the second tier differ from the arcades of the first in the height of the columns, as well as in that they have not an Doric, but an ionic order.  The entablature, the attic, which served as the basis for the columns of the third row, were also smaller than in the first tier. </p><p>  The height of the arches on the third tier is slightly less than on the second, and is 6.4 meters.  The main difference between the arches of the second and third tier was that in each opening there was a statue.  On the third tier, the walls were decorated with Corinthian-style pilasters.  A window was made through each pair of pilasters. </p><h2>  Name of facility </h2><p>  Many people ask the question: "Why was the Colosseum called the Colosseum?"  It is worth noting that it was originally called the Flavian Amphitheater, since this dynasty of emperors was engaged in its construction.  The name of the Coliseum, this building received much later, it appeared in the VIII century.  It denotes the colossal nature of this amphitheater; there were no buildings of this size in the entire Roman Empire. </p><p>  However, there is a version that the Colosseum was so named because there was a colossus (statue) of Nero standing next to it.  It was made of bronze and reached a height of 37 meters.  Subsequently, Emperor Commodus redid it, replacing the head of the statue.  It is now difficult to say in honor of which the Flavian Amphitheater was renamed the Colosseum, however both versions are quite wealthy, and historians still have not found a refutation to them. </p><h2>  Colosseum Destination </h2><p>  The Colosseum in Ancient Rome for the common people and for the patricians was the main place where various entertainment events were held.  Mostly there were fights of gladiators, who at that time were very popular.  They also conducted animal persecution and navachia (sea battles).  For naval battles, the Coliseum‚Äôs arena was filled with water, after which the battles began. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quotesgram.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basements Found" class="if uuid-2598493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598493.jpg"></div><p>  During the reign of Emperor Makrin, in 217, the Coliseum building was seriously damaged by fire.  But under the next emperor, <span>Alexander North, the</span> Colosseum was restored.  In 248, in this building, Emperor Philip celebrated the millennium of Rome on a grand scale.  And in 405, at the Coliseum, gladiatorial fights were banned by Emperor Honorius.  This was due to the spread of Christianity, which later became the main religion of the Roman Empire.  They continued to carry out animal persecution, but after the death of Emperor Theodorich the Great, in 526, they stopped. </p><h2>  Colosseum in the Middle Ages </h2><p>  The history of the Coliseum in the Middle Ages was not the best.  The barbarian invasions brought into decline not only the amphitheater, but also Rome itself, gradually the Colosseum began to collapse.  In the VI century, a chapel was added to the amphitheater, but this did not give a religious status to the entire structure.  The arena, where gladiators used to fight, pitted animals and staged sea battles, turned into a cemetery.  Arcades and vaulted spaces were converted into workshops and dwellings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bigfoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ruined side of the coliseum" class="if uuid-2598465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598465.jpg"></div><p>  From the XI to the XII century, the Colosseum became a kind of fortress for the Roman nobility, who disputed from each other the right to rule over ordinary citizens.  However, they were forced to cede the amphitheater to Emperor Henry VII, and he subsequently granted it to the Roman people and the Senate. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 14th century, local aristocrats organized bullfights in the Coliseum, and from that time on, the building began to gradually collapse.  In the middle of the XIV century, a powerful earthquake became the cause of the collapse of the building, its southern side suffered the most. </p><h2>  Colosseum in the XV-XVIII century </h2><p>  Since the Colosseum at that time was not one of the most famous attractions in the world, it was gradually begun to be used as a building material.  In addition to taking the stone from the crumbling walls, it was specially dragged from the Colosseum itself.  From the XV to the XVI century, from here, by order of various pontiffs, a stone was taken for the construction of the Venetian palace, the Palazzo Farnese and the palace of the office. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehistoryhub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coliseum stands" class="if uuid-2598495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2598495.jpg"></div><p>  Despite this barbarism, a significant part of the Coliseum survived, but part of the structure was disfigured.  Pope Sixtus V wanted to use the surviving amphitheater as a cloth factory, and Clement IX made a nitrate plant from the Coliseum. </p><p>  Only in the 18th century did pontiffs begin to relate properly to this ancient majestic structure.  Pope Benedict XIV took the Colosseum under his protection and began to consider this a place of memory of Christians who fell during the persecution by Rome.  A huge cross was erected in the center of the arena, and several altars were placed around it in memory of Christ's path to Calvary. </p><p>  In 1874, the cross and altars were removed from the arena of the Colosseum, and the new pontiffs continued their care for the construction.  By their order, the amphitheater was not only kept intact, but those walls that could collapse were strengthened. </p><h2>  Coliseum today </h2><p>  Currently, the Colosseum is under state protection and round-the-clock protection.  The surviving fragments of the amphitheater, where possible, were put in place.  The arena was decided to explore, and archaeological excavations were carried out on its territory.  Surprisingly, scientists found basements under the arena.  Presumably they were used as a kind of backstage for people and animals, before they entered the arena. </p><p>  Despite almost two thousand years and hard trials, the remains of the Colosseum without interior and exterior decoration and now make an unforgettable impression on the person who is here.  Even in this state, it is quite easy to imagine exactly what the Colosseum was in its best times.  The monumentality of architecture is striking in its scale, at the same time an exquisite Romanesque style is visible.  The Colosseum is deservedly considered one of the most famous attractions in the world. </p><p>  Today, it continues to gradually collapse due to rainwater and atmospheric pollution.  The Italian government has developed a program to restore and preserve this amazing monument of history and architecture of Ancient Rome.  In the near future it will be implemented.  During this period, tourists coming here from all over the world will no longer be allowed into the Colosseum. </p><p>  This building has become one of the symbols of Italy, as well as the Leaning Tower of Pisa or the Trevi Fountain.  The Colosseum today claims to be one of the new wonders of the world.  Among the traditional seven, the following attractions are known: </p><ul><li>  Pyramids in Egypt. </li><li>  Statue of Zeus in Greece. </li><li>  Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. </li><li>  Mausoleum in Halicarnacus. </li><li>  The Colossus of Rhodes. </li><li>  Alexandrian lighthouse. </li><li>  Hanging Gardens of Babylon in Babylon. </li></ul><p>  However, of all the listed attractions, only pyramids have survived to our time.  The rest can only be found from myths and legends.  The Coliseum can be admired today, despite the fact that this building is almost 2 thousand years old.  If you find yourself in Rome, then be sure to visit this unique historical and architectural monument. </p>
