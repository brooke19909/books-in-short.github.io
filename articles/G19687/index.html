It is great for family walks, allowing you to not only look at the animals and birds that live here, but also learn a lot of interesting and entertaining facts about themselves and their lives. </p><h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  The zoo opened in Yekaterinburg in mid-1930.  At that time he was small, and only 60 individuals were represented in it.  Today, the zoo has more than 380 species of animals and birds from around the world, which is approximately 1,200 individuals. </p>

    <p>  In a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe zoo there are pavilions with birds, predators, monkeys, elephant, exoterrarium.  In open enclosures there are animals that can easily tolerate cold (predators from the northern regions, animals living in Russia, large birds of prey, bears).  A separate pavilion was built to house Amur tigers. </p><p>  Today, the zoo is home to more than 70 species of unique animals from the International Red Book, as well as the Red Books of Russia and the Middle Urals. </p><h2>  What has changed after the reconstruction? </h2>

After her, the collection of animals and birds grew and became more diverse.  The list of animals of the Yekaterinburg Zoo is regularly updated with new species of animals, birds and fish.  Lemurs and galagoes settled in the newly built pavilions, the smallest marmoset monkeys, tamarins, foss and mongoose in the world found their home there, as well as a collection of fish and animals living in the water.  For the first time in the history of this zoo, inhabitants of the seas and oceans appeared in it. </p><p>  In recent years, work has begun on creating pairs of rare and endangered animals to increase their population.  The zoo in Yekaterinburg collaborates very productively in this direction with many Russian and European zoos.  So, in 2006, as part of this cooperation, a male white tiger was acquired.  At the end of 2007, he was brought in a pair of the beautiful tigress from the Spanish white tiger nursery. </p><p>  Every year, many zoo inhabitants bring posterity.  For the first time in the history of Russian zoos in Yekaterinburg, they managed to get offspring from such exotic animals as purple turaco, kinkaju honey bears, Prevost squirrels, aardvarks.  In the summer of 2003, fosses arrived from the Czech zoo to Yekaterinburg - mammals that are rarely found in nature, which are still not found in any other Russian zoo, as well as Egyptian herons and ibises. </p>

    <p>  In 2004, for the first time in a single enclosure, a hippo, ibis and Egyptian herons began to live.  In the summer of 2007, the Indian elephant became a zoo inhabitant.
