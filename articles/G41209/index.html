  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sigismund II August: biography and results of the reign</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, in our time, not even every historian will be able to remember who Sigismund II Augustus was, what he did for his people, where he ruled and in what years.  But this is really an outstanding person who has done a lot for his country, in fact creating a powerful monolith from disparate parts.  Therefore, to learn more about it is useful to every erudite person. </p><h2>  Who is that </h2><p>  To begin with, Sigismund II Augustus was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, as well as the King of Poland.  It was under him that such a powerful state as the Commonwealth appeared, which for many years fought not only against the Ottoman Empire, but also against the powerful Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="His Majesty Sigismund II" class="if uuid-2581671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2581671.jpg"></div><p>  During his reign, many important reforms were carried out, affecting both the economic side of the life of his subjects and the social.  He did not live a very long life, but left a serious mark in the history of Europe. </p><h2>  short biography </h2><p>  Sigismund II was born on July 1 (according to other sources - August 1), 1520.  His father was the Lithuanian and Polish prince Sigismund I old, and his mother was Bon Fortsa, an Italian princess. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alchetron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mother Sigismund II" class="if uuid-2583605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2583605.jpg"></div><p>  The combination of circumstances led to the fact that in 1529 he became the Lithuanian prince, and soon the king of Poland at the age of nine! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, in the first years he possessed this title only nominally.  In fact, his mother rules - a woman who is extremely cruel, domineering, not used to sharing influence with anyone on her son and country. </p><p>  He was married three times, but not one of the marriages brought him happiness. </p><p>  His first wife was Elizabeth of Austria (daughter of Ferdinand I himself) in 1543.  But she died two years later.  According to some sources, this happened from an attack of epilepsy, and according to others it was poisoned by Sigismund's mother. </p><p>  Soon he married a second time, secretly from his mother and the entire ruling elite, to Barbara Radzivil - the heiress of the Gashtold clan.  Despite threats and persuasion, he refused to break the marriage.  Alas, his second wife passed away a year later.  Historians believe that here, too, could not have done without the insidious Bona Forts. </p><p>  The third marriage was concluded in 1553.  Moreover, the new wife of Sigismund was the first sister of his first wife - Catherine of Austria.  However, this time the king did not find happiness.  Soon they parted, going through an extremely difficult divorce procedure in those days. </p><p>  He died in 1572, at the age of 51, and never left any heirs.  However, during his life he managed to do a lot for the country.  First of all, the king united the Principality of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland into a single state - the Commonwealth. </p><h2>  The need for agrarian reform </h2><p>  The king, although he was prescribed indecision and gentleness, was not at all stupid.  In the middle of the sixteenth century, a real stream of gold and silver from the New World poured into Europe.  As a result, agriculture and industry in many countries fell into decay.  Why work if you own kilograms of gold and tens of kilograms of silver? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="civilization-v-customisation.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sigismund II in a computer game" class="if uuid-2581672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2581672.jpg"></div><p>  However, the country of Sigismund did not participate in raids in the New World.  Therefore, the right decision was made: to increase the number of agricultural products.  Moreover, against the background of cheaper precious metals they sharply rose in price in Western Europe. </p><p>  Therefore, agrarian reform was carried out by Sigismund II Augustus in 1557.  For the first time in the history of the state, the rights and obligations of peasants were legislated. </p><p>  For example, it was prescribed there that every farmer who received a piece of land from the state had to work not only on his own land, but also on the royal one.  For two days every week he worked for the good of the state and his overlord. </p><p>  Previously abandoned lands were put into circulation, the triple field became mandatory (a third of the land was planted with ordinary crops, a third - winter crops, and a third left under the steam - the land rested, restored fertility).  They banned fishing during spawning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="numimarket.onebid.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sigismund II on Thaler" class="if uuid-2581673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2581673.jpg"></div><p>  Some historians believe that all this was done in the interests of exclusively feudal lords, and the rights of ordinary peasants were even more oppressed.  However, thanks to reforms, the efficiency of agriculture increased significantly, both feudal lords and peasants began to live richer. </p><h2>  Association of two states </h2><p>  The king‚Äôs most important reform was the signing of the Union of Lublin in 1569, shortly before his death.  As a result, two relatively weak states were united in the Commonwealth.  It lasted until the end of the eighteenth century, representing serious economic and military power in Eastern Europe. </p><p>  However, the signing of the Union of Lublin was almost frustrated.  The union did not like many nobles, and especially representatives of the Catholic Church.  They did not want to unite with the Principality of Lithuania, whose religion was Orthodoxy. </p><p>  As a result, a new coin resembling the Lithuanian currency was issued at the mint in Tykocin, where the Sigismund II August thaler was issued.  On the obverse a chase scene was depicted, and on the reverse an inscription from the Bible was carved: "He who lives in heaven will laugh, the Lord will reproach them."  By this they wanted to say that everyone who goes against Catholicism will be punished by God. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.numisbids.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A coin that nearly destroyed the union." class="if uuid-2581675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2581675.jpg"></div><p>  Because of this, the very possibility of creating an alliance was in danger. </p><p>  Only by signing universals prohibiting the re-minting of such coins, Sigismund II August was able to calm the Lithuanian elite and persuade them to join the new state. </p><h2>  Introduction of a number of transformations </h2><p>  The king also carried out many reforms.  One of the main ones was equalizing the rights of Catholics and Orthodox - irreconcilable enemies who now had to live in a united state. </p><p>  It is important that peasants were more evenly distributed on the territory of modern Belarus.  Prior to this, they lived in small plots, while vast lands were empty, not bringing benefits to the people and treasury. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, Sigismund II August left a significant mark in the history of his state.  Very few monarchs can boast the same number of reforms that have managed in a relatively short time to improve the lives of ordinary people and at the same time increase the economic power of the country. </p>
