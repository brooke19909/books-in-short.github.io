    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  If you want to deactivate the ‚ÄúYou called‚Äù service (MTS), then the first option for the development of events can be considered a personal visit to the office of your mobile operator with a similar request.  As a rule, the rejection of many additional services connected on the SIM card occurs precisely when you visit the operator.  Take your mobile phone and passport with you (just in case), and then go to the nearest MTS cellular office. </p><p>  Now go to the operator and say that you would like to disable the ‚ÄúCall You‚Äù (MTS) service.  Here you can be asked for a passport - after all, SIM-card service, as a rule, is possible directly only in the presence of the owner and his approval of all the manipulations.  Now that the employee has verified your rights to the number, hand him the phone.  Sometimes, however, it is possible to deactivate the ‚ÄúCall You‚Äù (MTS) service even without transmission - through a computer.  It depends on the professionalism of each particular operator with whom you spoke.  A few minutes of waiting - and all problems are resolved.  You have completed the task. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, many users prefer to use other scenarios.  Which ones?  Let's try to figure out what's what. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable the service you called mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866469.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Operator call </h2><p>  The following approach is presented to your attention for the rejection of MTS services (Russia).  "Calling you" to disconnect is actually not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  For example, if you don‚Äôt really want to go to mobile phone offices of mobile operators, then you can simply call technical support in order to realize the idea. </p><p>  Remember that calls will be absolutely free.  Dial 0890, and then wait for the operator to respond.  Let him know that you would like to disable the ‚ÄúCall You‚Äù (MTS) service on this number.  Further, as in the case of a personal visit, you may be asked to provide passport details, including registration.  After that, you can wait for an answer. </p><p>  As a rule, after the end of the conversation, you will receive an SMS notification within 10 minutes, which will inform you that you have successfully refused the "Call You" service.  In addition, a command will be indicated there that will help return this add-on to the number.  But there are other scenarios.  Which ones?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS Russia called to disconnect you" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866468.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  SMS message </h2><p>  <span>How to deactivate the</span> ‚ÄúCall you‚Äù service on MTS?  There is another rather interesting option that helps most customers.  An SMS request will come to your aid.  As a rule, it is this approach that helps users to cope with all the problems that arise. </p><p>  The thing is that the main problem is that few people know which text to write and to which number the generated text should be sent.  We will try to help such users. </p><p>  Type in the message "211410" in the message, and then send it to number 111. After that, you will have to wait a while.  You will receive a notification reply about the successful processing of the operation and the disconnection of the service.  As a rule, they tried to "call you" just this way.  But not all.  Some very advanced users prefer other scenarios.  Which ones?  Now we will figure it out with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to deactivate the service they called you on mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866475.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Teams </h2><p>  For example, to cope with the question posed before us today, a special team dialed on the phone can help.  USSD commands are what we need now. </p><p>  Take the phone and put it into dialing mode.  Now it‚Äôs enough to ‚Äúprint‚Äù the combination * 111 * 38 #, and then click on the ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  To be honest, this method is not very popular.  All this is due to the fact that its processing, as a rule, takes quite a long time.  That is, the team is sent quickly, but the time spent directly on the task is a long process. </p><p>  However, there are also cases when you will very quickly receive an SMS notification that will notify you of the successful processing of the operation.  As you can see, you can refuse the service with such not very difficult, but very long methods.  Nevertheless, these are far from all options for the development of events.  What else can be done?  Let's try to figure out what's what. </p><h2>  Internet assistant </h2><p>  For example, you‚Äôre tired of the ‚ÄúCall you‚Äù option (MTS).  You can disable it by the methods already listed.  Nevertheless, if you consider them insufficiently correct or suitable, you can safely use the Internet.  After all, it is he who will help you cope with the task. </p><p>  The first thing we may only need is to log in to the MTS official website.  To do this, use your username (number), as well as the password that you came up with during registration.  Now you have access to the so-called personal account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS Kirov called to disconnect you" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866466.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, go to the "services" section.  Here you have to find the connected features.  Look carefully at the generated list, and then find the function you need there.  Click "Call you" - "disconnect".  That's all.  Now you will receive an SMS notification about the successful refusal to provide this feature.  Nothing difficult or supernatural, right?  Nevertheless, this, too, is far from all options for the development of events.  We have another way.  Which one?  Now we will deal with you in this difficult matter. </p><h2>  Help application </h2><p>  Well, every MTS client can take another interesting approach.  Which one?  Let's try to deal with you with this difficult question.  The thing is that each client on the phone when using the MTS SIM-card installs a special application.  It is precisely this that will help us in solving our difficult task. </p><p>  The first thing that we only need is to find the program in the installed applications.  Now click on it, and then select "services."  Look for the connected features in them.  In them, find "you called."  Next, click on this option, and then select "disable" in the menu that opens.  As you can see, nothing is difficult.  It remains only to wait for an alert about the successful processing of the request - and all problems will be resolved. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned how to turn off the ‚ÄúCall You‚Äù (MTS) service.  As you can see, you can resort to many methods that will help you cope with the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option you called pay disconnect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866465.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To be honest, the most popular approaches here are a personal visit, as well as the use of a personal account on the Internet on the MTS official website.  Although the first method is not particularly convenient for many customers.  All this because of the long waiting time in line.  Choose the approach that seems most attractive to you, and then try it.  Indeed, the MTS (Kirov) company ‚Äúcalled you‚Äù allows you to disable many options.  And not only in Kirov.  They are available throughout Russia and even beyond. </p>
