One of the best hotels in this country is Sandunes Beach Resort 4, which has already been visited by many of our compatriots. </p><h2>  What do we know about Vietnam </h2><p>  The days when Vietnam was mentioned in connection with the long American war, napalm and exorbitant human sacrifices have long been a thing of the past. </p><p>  <span>The Indochina Peninsula,</span> on which Vietnam is located, is washed by the South China Sea, and the closest neighbors are China, Laos and Cambodia.  The form of government is a republic, and the Communist Party rules everything. </p><p>  The Vietnamese are hardworking, welcoming and friendly.  They treat everyone who speaks Russian with special warmth, recalling the Soviet Union with a kind word. </p>

    <p>  Sandunes Beach Resort 4 operates year-round, and even out of season there are plenty of services that give you good health and good mood. </p><h2>  Resort Phan Thiet </h2><p>  Almost all of Vietnam is stretched on the coast of the sea, so the preferred form of relaxation here is beach.  Phan Thiet is located in the south of the country, and between it and the village of Mui Ne there is a part of the coast on which all the best hotels are concentrated.  From here, the capital of Ho Chi Minh City is only 200 km away. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort are a constant topic of discussion.  Some do not like the fact that the sand is very fine, palm trees are far from the shore, and the water is unclear from the waves, while it does not annoy others.  All that distinguishes the weather of different months from each other is the amount of rain.  It is always warm here, on the coldest night + 25 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><h2>  Hotel Sandunes Beach Resort 4 </h2><p>  In fact, the correct name is Sandunes Beach Resort ****, a figure put for convenience.  A hotel with 4 "stars" is classified according to the European system.  This is a high category because there are no more than 5 stars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The international <span>driver‚Äôs license</span> is not valid, but for a small amount you can rent any transport.  It‚Äôs not worth breaking local rules, because the law is on the side of your country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Vietnamese behave like children: directly and curiously.  They examine everyone who leaves the tourist zone with genuine curiosity, point a finger and discuss among themselves.  It is necessary to prepare for the fact that you have to always be in sight.  No aggression - just curiosity.  If you learn a few words and start talking, a warm welcome and sincere friendliness are provided. </p>

    <p>  Bargaining in Vietnam is mandatory, because visitors are called the price 3 times higher than the local one.  For a Vietnamese, a European is just a wallet that you need to be patient with. </p><p>  For many visitors, the acclimatization process is quite unpleasant.

    <p>  It is best to relax here for couples with children, since the main advantages of the resort are beaches, peace and the warm sea. </p><p>  Those who are afraid of local sand fleas should better calm down: finding a real insect on the beach is not so easy.  <span>Sand flea</span> lives in slums and wild places, and on the beach sand is constantly watered and cleaned.  The insect is extremely uncomfortable there, and there are practically no cases of bite of people on civilized beaches.  But there is a mass of comfortable sunbeds and clean towels on them for a comfortable stay.  In fact, there are midges and small mosquitoes, but they are harmless. </p><p>  Sandunes Beach Resort 4 has gathered all the local exoticism on its territory. Reviews of tourists say that here you can go surfing, ride along the sand dunes, as well as try Vietnamese cuisine, which is absolutely unusual for us.  And there is also a magnificent spa-salon where you can completely relax and forget about everyday life. </p><h2>  Where does it all begin </h2><p>  From the first minute the tourist is surrounded by attention.  The design is quick, they give a <span>watermelon fresh,</span> all the necessary cards, they introduce the location of the restaurant and all structures.  All that is needed for a beach holiday - slippers, bathrobes, sunbeds, hygiene products - is provided by the hotel.  You can turn on the air conditioner or leave the window open at night. </p>

    <p>  Bungalows by the sea have <span>green roofs,</span> on top similar to an open leaf of a water lily.  Comfortable beds, soft chairs, tropical flowers, a view of the sea outside the window, colorful bright textiles - everything pleases the eye.  Hotel Sandunes Beach Resort 4 Vietnam (Phan Thiet) is also nodding from the wind palm trees, the air melted by the sun, the azure expanse of water, a lot of chic greenery and quiet comfortable trails to the sea. </p><p>  Nothing prevents rest, it is quiet and calm.  For those who like noisy parties, it's even too quiet.  With the onset of darkness, everything calms down, nightly fun is not accepted here.  This is surprising for a hotel, but all staff after 21 hours sleep most often. </p><h2>  Reviews of hotel Sandunes Beach Resort 4 </h2><p>  The hotel is on the first line, built in 2013.  The rooms in the building and the bungalow are similar, but the bungalow is closer to the sea and it is somehow more comfortable.  There are non-smoking rooms, there are a total of 141. There are two restaurants, with local and European cuisine.  The bar is accessible from the pool.  There is a kids club, animation and a gym.  You can call a doctor, but this service is paid. </p><p>  For those who miss the bustle of the city, there are two buses to Mui Ne from the hotel, you can use the services of a round-the-clock taxi.  The prices are ridiculous: $ 1 = 21,000 Vietnamese Wong.  The staff is friendly, all requests are fast.  They try not to notice some rude guests, at least they do not make comments. </p><p>  The food is delicious, plenty of seafood, lots of fruits, sweets and vegetables.  Impressions remain the cutest.  Almost all guests come back here, their number is growing. </p>
