  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Turkish Sultan Ahmed I</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sultan Ahmed I was a very decisive person, he showed independence from the first days of his reign.  So, during the ceremony, at which the nobility brought him the oath of allegiance, he did not wait until he was seated on the throne by the viziers, and he sat on it without any hesitation. </p><p>  At another ceremony, which is an analogue of the coronation, he independently encircled himself with the sword of Sultan Osman I, while, according to the rules, this should have been done by a high-ranking clergyman.  Another example of decisiveness is the removal from power of the Safie Sultan, his grandmother, whom he eventually sent into exile in the Old Palace in Edirne.  Next, we consider the history of Sultan Ahmed in more detail. </p><h2>  Family of the future Sultan </h2><p>  Ahmed was born in 1590, his father was the future Sultan Mehmed III, who ruled at the beginning of the 17th century, and his mother was Handan Sultan, the concubine of the ruler’s harem.  According to historians, Mehmed was particularly intolerant of adherents of the Christian religion.  He was passionate about art and loved poetry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ka.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Ahmed I" class="if uuid-2816134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2816134.jpg"></div><p>  It is assumed that Ahmed's mother was Greek or Bosnian, and her name was Elena (Helen).  She was presented to Mehmed by his aunt.  With the assistance of his mother, she managed to become the favorite of the heir to the throne.  The boy’s grandmother by father, Sophia Sultan, was a very strong-willed woman and took a direct part in politics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the reign </h2><p>  Mehmed III died at the end of 1603, and his son came to the throne at a very young age.  Moreover, his mother for two years was the Valide Sultan, that is, regent.  She stood at the head of the harem and participated in political affairs.  However, by virtue of his firm character, Ahmed listened little to her advice and acted at his discretion.  He went into conflict with his mother over the fate of Mustafa, his younger brother. </p><p>  However, soon the Valide Sultan died.  This happened in 1606 and greatly influenced Ahmed I, undermining his strength.  He arranged a magnificent funeral and distributed a large alms in the form of food and money to calm the soul of his mother.  After that, he temporarily left his residence and left for Bursa. </p><h2>  Empire of Sultan Ahmed </h2><p>  It was called Ottoman and was inherited from its ancestors, who during the war of conquest in Asia Minor over the course of three centuries significantly increased its territory.  They, among other things, began to belong to the lands that previously belonged to Byzantium, and its capital, Constantinople, was renamed Istanbul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aroundbluemosque.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Ahmed I" class="if uuid-2816098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2816098.jpg"></div><p>  The founder of the dynasty was Osman I Gazi.  He ruled in the XIII century in the territory on which Turkey is located today.  The empire he founded existed until the 20th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The sword of Osman I passed from one ruler to another from generation to generation, serving as one of the attributes of the power of the Sultan.  The ardor and audacity of the young ruler were matched by the history of his family.  From the first years of his reign, Ahmed I continued military campaigns against Austria and Persia.  In addition, he took part in the fight against the rebels in Anatolia, which began during the reign of his father. </p><h2>  Failure in war </h2><p>  In the hostilities, Ahmed I was often unsuccessful.  His troops, having been defeated, left the enemy the territory of present Azerbaijan and Georgia.  Subsequently, the Sultan repeatedly tried to return these lands, but always unsuccessfully. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Ahmed Mosque" class="if uuid-2816128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2816128.jpg"></div><p>  On the territory of modern Hungary, Sultan Ahmed fought against the Austrian Empire.  At first, luck seemed to accompany the Ottomans.  They seized and held the fortress Esztergom.  However, after several political mistakes made by the Sultan, he signed a peace treaty with the Habsburg dynasty, which recognized their rights to the disputed territories. </p><h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  Ahmed enjoyed great sympathy among the country's population, as he did a lot for its citizens.  He played a large role in improving the appearance of Istanbul.  Under him, the Blue Mosque was built - the main one in the capital.  In addition, a library, two saunas, and other buildings were added to the Topkapi palace complex on his instructions.  In 1606, Ahmed I managed to show his courage in peacetime.  Then in the capital, severe fires raged, and he personally took part in their elimination, while receiving burns.  This further increased his popularity with his subjects. </p><h2>  Personal life and death </h2><p>  The children of Sultan Ahmed were born from two concubines.  In total, he had 12 sons and 9 daughters.  From the first of them, whose name was Mahfiruz Khadija Sultan, who bore the title of wives and concubines of the Turkish sultans - Haseki, the future Sultan Osman II was born. </p><p>  Another concubine, also bearing the title of Haseka, Kesem Sultan, became the mother of two Ottoman rulers - Murad IV and Ibrahim I. When her sons ruled, she bore the title “mother of the Sultan” (Valide Sultan) and was one of the most influential figures in the Ottoman Empire . </p><div class="photo" data-original="aroundbluemosque.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medieval harem" class="if uuid-2816116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2816116.jpg"></div><p>  She was also a grandmother to Sultan Mehmed IV, and at the beginning of his reign she belonged to the honorary title “Grandmother of the Sultan” (Buyuk Valide).  In total, she remained in power for almost 30 years.  According to historians, she influenced Ahmed I in terms of preserving the life of his brother and heir, Mustafa I. Thus, the order of inheritance in the Ottoman Empire was changed.  She was killed by supporters of her daughter-in-law - Turkhan-Sultan. </p><p>  Sultan Ahmed, who had previously contracted smallpox, contracted typhus and died in 1617.  He was buried in a mausoleum located near the Blue Mosque. </p>
