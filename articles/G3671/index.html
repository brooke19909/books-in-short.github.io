The carpet on the wall, and opposite the "wall" - a huge closet, occupying an area - yes, the entire wall.  This picture is familiar, I think, to many.  And after all, such interiors are still common in the CIS countries.  What are the features of these interiors, how can you use the Soviet style in the interior further, but how should you not do it? </p><h2>  Interior </h2><p>  To begin with, we‚Äôll try to figure out what the concept of interior includes.  This word is of French origin and denotes the interior design of the building, including architectural and artistic features.  The internal structure of the living room can tell a lot about the life of a person, or even a generation.  It is not for nothing that, for example, writers pay a lot of attention to the living space of their hero.  How vivid was the description of the house of Ilya Ilyich Oblomov ... As for the Soviet interiors, they can show in detail the life of a simple Soviet person.  Even now, there are probably few people who did not find the echoes of the Soviet era in the interior.  First, let's turn to history, because it is historical events that form the space for human life. </p><h2>  A bit about the interiors in tsarist Russia </h2><p>  Before the revolution, most of the population lived in villages.  The apartments of the intelligentsia, in turn, were quite large, spacious, luxurious.  In such apartments, one could often see genuine works of art.  In addition, the apartments had many rooms, living rooms, dining rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="humus.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="General's apartment" class="if uuid-2713363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713363.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, it was possible to live as a poor student of Raskolnikov ... But it was precisely the intelligentsia‚Äôs apartments that went into public use after the revolution and to some extent became the starting point for the formation of Soviet interiors, at least as a denial of such luxury. </p><h2>  Revolution, the formation of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  The beginning of the 20th century was tense for Russia.  The foreign policy of the Russian Empire in recent years has not been successful: the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the country's participation in the First World War, brought the people nothing but troubles, deaths, hunger.  Dissatisfaction with power grew, the people raised uprisings.  In 1917 there were 2 revolutions: the February one, which led to the abdication of the Emperor, and the October one, which resulted in a civil war and the subsequent formation of the Soviet Union under the leadership of the Bolshevik party. </p><h2>  Ideologists </h2><p>  The young, newly formed state did not have enough housing for newly-made citizens.  Everything that was in the Russian Empire was rejected, including the way of life with the desire to decorate apartments.  Ideal at that time were considered bare white walls, windows without curtains, furniture without extra decorations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Communal apartments </h2><p>  The problem of housing shortages was solved as follows: the apartments of the bourgeoisie were transferred to the ownership of the communes.  Living space was saved as much as possible - kitchens and bathrooms became common.  5 square meters were allocated to the tenant.  At the same time, representatives of the intelligentsia left the country, leaving all their property - objects with artistic and historical value could not be exported abroad.  As a result, furniture also became the property of ordinary people.  It was a real confrontation of beautiful furniture, luxurious interiors and elements of everyday life of rural life.  The society that settled in the apartments was not ready to accept the culture of life in the city.  How not to recall here the conflict between Professor Preobrazhensky and Schwonder?  The work of Mikhail Afanasevich Bulgakov very accurately conveys the spirit of that era. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="PvEFG1TcWSA" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEFG1TcWSA" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/7/3/2/5/7325.jpg"></div><h2>  Soviet interior of the 40s </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the country was not up to the interior.  Truly tragic events set their priorities.  The postwar years also did not favor a thorough home improvement.  Pre-revolutionary furniture was still preserved in the interior, which was often ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù with improvised household items.  And yet, 20 years of existence have allowed to form their own prerequisites for a special interior of the Soviet era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  50s interior </h2><p>  Although the country was closed, Western trends leaked into it.  Making an apartment look like a western dwelling was what was in fashion.  But material and physical capabilities rarely allowed to fully realize this.  The ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù apartment was also made by the presence of household appliances in the house: a telephone, a radio, and maybe even a TV!  But if it was real, albeit difficult to acquire Soviet equipment, then you could only look at American. </p><h2>  60s trends </h2><p>  The 60s brought Soviet citizens the opportunity to purchase real European room and kitchen sets, small in size.  After all, the problem of a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing still remained, and minimalism was absolutely functional.  And most importantly, headsets were made in Europe!  Abroad!  Here is the destiny of dreams! </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.m-dec.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headset" class="if uuid-2713553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713553.jpg"></div><p>  European design also favored some aesthetic standards.  Now people began to think about what color to choose for the headset for walls, what other objects to choose for the room so that it looked harmonious ... After all, the apartment has become much more modern.  Although still the Soviet people could not afford luxury, and more bought something as needed.  It was in such conditions that the Soviet interior was gradually formed.  The proliferation of music education has made the piano a must-have item. </p><h2>  What became the interior in the 70s </h2><p>  The 70s became the heyday of the Soviet style in the interior to which we are accustomed.  It was during these years that the legendary carpet appeared!  It could be anywhere: on the floor (where it should be in general), on the wall, and even on furniture.  Carpet in the Soviet interior was a luxury item - pleasure was not cheap. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.m-dec.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet 70s" class="if uuid-2713571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713571.jpg"></div><p>  Household appliances are becoming more modern.  The more Western the Soviet-style interior, the better. </p><p>  But in addition to the West, there was its own culture.  But, unfortunately, they fled from her, she was shy.  Only true connoisseurs, educated people or people with an innate taste did not follow the path of imitation.  But, as practice shows, there are usually not many of these - a few. </p><h2>  The 80s arrived </h2><p>  The last period of the Soviet era finally consolidated the tendencies of an entire era.  Apartments of this period cannot be imagined without a wall.  Big, no - a huge headset, in which there are a lot of shelves, and they are stuffed with the most necessary things that are used very rarely, in special cases, for example, crystal glassware.  Perhaps it was not even worth adding a photo of the Soviet interior of this type?  I think this view is familiar to many without photographs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet wall" class="if uuid-2713662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713662.jpg"></div><p>  And the picture gallery (in addition to the carpet) was replaced by photo wallpaper.  Why go out and enjoy the views surrounded by mosquitoes?  Here he is - a beautiful view of the forest in full size ... I went into the room and enjoy the scenery. </p><p>  And what masterpieces were the chandeliers.  Huge, with numerous ornaments, and even with "pendants" of crystal.  In severity, they could only compete with the amount of dust that they collected on themselves. </p><p>  Home libraries were popular.  Nevertheless, this is the dignity of the Soviet era.  People read.  After all, the book was the only source of information. </p><h2>  Modern Soviet interior in apartments </h2><p>  The Soviet era left us a huge legacy in the form of interior items.  And indeed, apartments with a carpet on the wall, or even two, are not uncommon.  Huge floor-to-ceiling cabinets are still preserved.  And what can we say about the walls?  It is difficult to part with this subject not only from nostalgia for bygone times, but also because there is simply nowhere to put everything hidden inside it.  And it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get such a mountain of furniture out of the apartment.  (How did they get her there? ..) </p><p>  What can be done with such a rich heritage?  How to use Soviet furniture in a modern apartment to keep up to date? </p><h2>  How not to use elements from the past in a modern apartment </h2><p>  Sometimes apartment owners try to recreate the unique flavor of the Soviet apartment in its original form, in which we can see it in films or in the photo.  "Soviet apartments", the interiors of such a plan are now somewhat ridiculous.  And perhaps, in such dwellings, simply no one wants to change anything.  I admit, the author of the article was horrified by such a sight ... No matter how reliable Soviet furniture may be, it nevertheless becomes worthless.  It will soon be 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in fact many things were acquired during its heyday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maxim-nm.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet cuisine" class="if uuid-2713706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713706.jpg"></div><p>  What a striking contrast!  Brand new plastic windows and a radiator are clearly superfluous in this atmosphere of Soviet cuisine.  But it is they that testify to the fact that the interior of the Soviet era migrated during modern times.  This kitchen has very little space, but there are cupboards, lots of cupboards.  It would be better if there was a place where you can comfortably cut something, and it would be possible to wash the dishes without hiding behind the refrigerator.  And it‚Äôs good that the latter is located in the kitchen, because now there are those who put this household appliance into the corridor, where it has absolutely no place. </p><p>  In the modern interior, the Soviet wall (or its semblance) also does not look very appropriate.  It is too big, takes up too much space in the room.  And most importantly, it is often filled with those things that are not used. </p><p>  It is unlikely that the room will add space, light and a carpet on the wall.  Perhaps it‚Äôs nice to fall asleep, looking at endless rhombuses or floral patterns, but, probably, there is still a place for such a miracle in a bygone era. </p><h2>  Elements of nostalgia in a modern apartment </h2><p>  Although in aggregate all these objects cannot represent a modern interior, their separate moderate use can not only save money on buying new furniture, but also bring a unique charm to the home, give an atmosphere of light nostalgia (rather than total immersion in an era with all its difficulties and problems).  Sometimes some elements can create additional comfort. </p><p>  Such an example is, of course, a carpet.  It is not necessary to use it as a tapestry on a wall.  In the end, Shvonder who doesn‚Äôt wear galoshes (and therefore doesn‚Äôt take off) will not come into your apartment, the carpet will not get dirty, even if it is Persian.  For example, in the Scandinavian style, ultramodern furniture is very harmoniously combined with some vintage elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realty.tut.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="carpet in a modern interior" class="if uuid-2713561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713561.jpg"></div><p>  Bright, clean room.  And there was a place for a carpet.  But how cozy and warm it is - precisely due to the Soviet carpet in the modern interior. </p><p>  Another detail that will save money, time and effort is not a piece of furniture, but a Soviet Christmas tree parquet.  After all, a wooden floor in good condition is not cheap.  Anyway, a complete replacement of the floor is a hard task.  If the boards have maintained a good condition, they can always be restored, and then varnished or painted.  Updating without updating as such is also able to give something already familiar more comfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.houzz.ru" data-author=":  , " data-source="https://www.houzz.ru/photo/28495189-portfolio-skandinavskiy-stolovaya-moskva"><img itemprop="image" alt="floor parquet" class="if uuid-2713787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713787.jpg"></div><p>  Harmoniously selected modern furniture will qualitatively complement the modern interior. </p><p>  Such restoration can be done not only with the floor.  With any imagination, any piece of furniture can be turned into modern design things.  On the one hand, this will allow you to express your individuality, create what you would like.  After all, it is far from always possible to completely choose one or another thing to your taste.  And ordering new designer pieces of furniture "for yourself" is not a cheap pleasure.  On the other hand, this will help preserve the once expensive thing, which carries, perhaps, some positive memories.  And the very idea that a new life can be given to any element of the Soviet interior is pleasant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.houzz.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet armchair" class="if uuid-2713783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2713783.jpg"></div><p>  It would seem that the shape of this chair (photo above) is traditional, Soviet.  But the new, bright casing breathed such freshness into it that it is difficult to distinguish it from a new one, bought or ordered.  This chair is worthy of the most honored guest in the house.  So you can use Soviet furniture in a modern interior. </p><p>  The Soviet era left a lot of interior elements to remember.  How to use them now - everyone decides for himself.  You can, of course, leave everything as it is.  Suddenly, future generations will want to see what our country lived half a century ago, what hopes and dreams, what difficulties it faced.  You can simply get rid of all things and run: run for fashion, for Western traditions, not paying attention to the bygone Soviet era.  And you can leave only some elements of the Soviet decor as a pleasant nostalgia, but at the same time competently work with them so that they do not look redundant in modern life. </p>
