Formed in 1638, it has changed over the past centuries with the country.  There are a lot of such small villages with a population of about 5 thousand people in Russia.  But <span>residents of Ulyanovsk,</span> hunters, are well aware of it, because the Bazarnosyzgan State Hunting Reserve is nearby.  And how is he still famous? </p><h2>  The history of the village </h2><p>  Simbirsko-Karsunskaya Zaseka was built in the 17th century.  With this construction begins the history of many settlements of the current Ulyanovsk region.  Yes, and Ulyanovsk itself (Simbirsk) is a serf fortification.  On the territory of the city and the region, sections of earthen ditches and ramparts of that time were preserved. </p><p>  At the beginning of the century, the devastating raids of nomad tribes: Bashkirs, Kalmyks, Nogais, made devastating raids on the Moscow state.  They captured Russian people, took carts with looted goods.  Then it was decided to create a line of defensive structures in this direction - spotted.  This type of defense was successfully used on the borders of Russia from the XII-XIII centuries. </p>

Archers who came from Moscow served here.

People who settled in this place began to lead a more peaceful lifestyle.  It was then that the modern name appeared: Bazarny Syzgan, obviously characterizing the direction of life of the population. </p><h2>  Village development </h2><p>  The settlement, being on the postal route of the Moscow-Penza direction and becoming a station on the Ruzayevka-Syzran railway line, by the beginning of the 20th century had become one of the commercial and industrial centers of the region.  By this time, more than 4 thousand people lived here. </p><p>  Two churches were built in the village: Vsesvyatskaya, established in 1868 at the local cemetery, and Dmitrievskaya.  The first wooden church was not preserved.  The stone Dmitrievskaya church, built at the expense of the local merchant A.K. Shcherbakov, has been standing since 1875 until today.  It is a landmark of the modern Bazaar Syzgan of the Ulyanovsk region, as well as historical and architectural value. </p><p>  For 1913, the Belousov cloth factory, the Shcherbakovs paper station, three sawmills, a distillery and a soap factory, two steam mills worked in the village.  In addition, two schools were built here, a hospital and a post office.  Fairs were held once a year, and bazaars once a week. </p><h2>  Revolutionary movement </h2><p>  The history of Bazarny Syzgan also knows this page in the life of Russia.  The protest movement appeared here with the emergence of the proletariat.  But the first propaganda work here was conducted by P.P. Viktorov, who later became a well-known psychiatrist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Having settled down as a tutor for merchant children in Bazarny Syzgan, he conducted propaganda among the workers of the Shcherbakov factory.  The case was dismissed for lack of evidence, but Viktorov was declared unreliable.  Subsequently, he was an active revolutionary.

    <p>  In 1905, the Bazarnaya workstations not only took part in the revolutionary movement, but also led it along the Inza ‚Äì Syzran line.  Workers from local factories and factories also joined them. </p><p>  On the eve of the revolution of 1917 there was a speech by the peasants of the county, who burned the estates of the landowners.  To pacify them, troops were brought into the settlement. </p><p>  Active fighting in 1918 was accompanied by an attempt to liberate Simbirsk by the <span>Iron Division.</span>  Battles took place in these places.  At the railway station there is a mass grave of the Red Army soldiers who died in those battles.  An obelisk is installed on their grave. </p><h2>  Soviet workers' village </h2><p>  In the 30s of the last century, Bazarny Syzgan received the status of a working village.  To the nationalized enterprises of the city was added the educated collective farm "Testament of Ilyich."  Thus, industrial and agricultural production were successfully combined here.  During the war years, the Red Metalworker factory was evacuated here from Gomel.  Residents of the village, who did not go to the front, fought for victory in the rear: at the machine tools and in the field. </p>

Already in the 21st century, the ‚ÄúGun of Victory‚Äù and a monument to Vasily Dmitrievich Avdeev, a local native who died in Odessa during the Second World War, were installed.
