Partner Banks in Russia and Europe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many money transfer systems in the world: Western Union, Privatmani, Union Express, Unistream and others.  Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages.  A client who does not yet have experience in sending money should know exactly which bank can receive a Unistream transfer or another transfer (if another system is selected). </p><h2>  Receiving money transfers </h2><p>  How to choose a transfer system so that the recipient does not have a problem picking up money?  Be sure the sender must know in which community they will receive the money.  The second step is to see which banking institutions are represented in this city or town.  Then the sender goes to the sites of these banks, looks, is there any information about Unistream.  Transfers, addresses of bank branches in each locality will be necessarily displayed on the websites of institutions.  This information will help to avoid misunderstandings. </p>

    <h2>  In which bank can I receive a Unistream transfer in Russia? </h2><p>  The Unistream money transfer system is widely represented in Russian financial institutions.  The Unistream service system in Russia covers about 185,000 points (these are bank branches and self-service terminals in shopping centers, at bus and <span>railway stations).</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The base bank of the system is KB Unistream.  The central office of the financial institution operates in Moscow, and branches are located throughout Russia; there are also bank representative offices in Ukraine and in <span>neighboring countries.</span>  In addition, the Russians will be able to send and receive money through Unistream in the following banks: AKB Uniastrum Bank, OJSC Binbank, AKB Invest Bank.  The partners of the system also became: PTB, CB Druzhba, OTP Bank (as you know, this is a large system international financial institution), CJSC Industrial Savings <span>Bank, Moscow Credit Bank</span> and other banks. </p><h2>  The specifics of partner banks in Russia </h2><p>  OTP Bank has a very good <span>regional network.</span>  Bank branches are located in 44 cities of the country.  These are both regional centers and large cities that do not have regional status.  A client at OTP Bank will not pay any commission for receiving a transfer, and sending will cost only 2% of the amount (the transfer amount is not more than 100,000 rubles) and 1.5% of the amount (if more than 100,000 rubles are sent). </p>

    <p>  JSCB Uniastrum Bank, as a purely Russian financial institution, has more branches than OTP Bank.  Where can I get Unistream transfer through this bank?  The answer can be found on the website of the institution.  Its branches are located in 70 Russian cities, starting from Moscow and ending with the Far Eastern Khabarovsk.  Receiving a transfer at the cash desk or terminal is free of charge, regardless of the currency in which the money transfer was sent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As already mentioned, Binbank OJSC also works with the Unistream system.  Transfers (the addresses of points are on the bank's website) can be either sent or received.  You can pick up a transfer sent to another cashier in another city instantly.  Payment of the transfer, of course, is free of charge.  Sending money to customers will cost only 1-1.5% of the payment amount.  The bank is represented in most regions of the country. </p><h2>  Getting money for Unistream in Ukraine </h2><p>  We have already said that the translation system we are considering is international.  In which bank can I get Unistream transfer in Ukraine?  Most large Ukrainian banks work with this system, so there are absolutely no problems for those who want to send or receive a transfer. </p><p>  The Ukrainian Oschadbank (translated into Russian as Sberbank) has been working with the Unistream system for more than 10 years.  Although this bank has the widest network of branches in the country (more than 6,000), not all points work with money transfers.  But this inconvenience will not prevent people wishing to conduct a money transfer operation even in a small district center. </p>

    <p>  The largest system bank in Ukraine is Privatbank, which also has branches in Russia, Georgia, Latvia, Cyprus and Portugal, is also a member of the Unistream system.  It is easy to receive transfers with Privatbank, because it is not even necessary to contact a bank branch.  You can receive the transfer either through an ATM or self-service terminal, or through the Privat24 Internet system.  Fans of traditional banking services can contact the bank cash desks. </p><p>  Experts also recommend Ukrainian citizens to send or receive transfers through Ukreximbank and Raiffeisenbank Aval.  The wide network and favorable rates of these institutions have always attracted customers! </p><h2>  Unistream system: transfers in which <span>banks of Europe</span> can I get? </h2><p>  In Europe, receiving and sending Unistream transfers is also possible.  We have already talked about OTP Bank in the context of Russia, about Raiffeisenbank Aval in the context of Ukraine.  But these same banks are present in the <span>financial markets of</span> leading European countries!  In addition, the French group <span>Credit Agricole</span> collaborates with this system <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  We hope that now everyone will be able to quickly figure out which bank can receive the Unistream transfer.  This is one of the most respected international money transfer systems, so every client is always confident in the reliability of the system. </p>
