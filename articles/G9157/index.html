    <h2>  What you need to create a tulle skirt </h2><p>  Such magnificent bundles are suitable for the smallest girls, and for teenagers, and for adult girls.  Depending on the age of the girl, as well as taking into account the length and purpose of the product, a certain amount of tulle (or mesh), a wide elastic band for the belt and sharp scissors will be required.  A needle with thread for sewing gum and attaching decor is also useful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tulle tutu skirt" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1254826.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are several options for how to <span>sew a tutu skirt-pack</span> .  This article will describe the simplest method that does not require special sewing experience or special devices. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Experienced craftswomen recommend using American nylon, which has softness and at the same time perfectly retains its shape.  This material can be found in coils or rolls.  Its width is usually about 20 cm. However, many craftswomen note that it is not sold in all cities.  Therefore, a skirt-pack of tulle can be sewn from the material that is available. </p><p>  Most stores offer several types of tulle.  Too soft will not hold the shape, and the hardest can scratch the baby.  So the material of medium hardness can be considered optimal. </p><p>  A do-it-yourself tulle skirt can be made of a large number of ribbons attached to a gum belt.  The length of the elastic should be equal to the waist circumference of the child.  You will have to overlap it with an overlap, so it will become a little shorter and hold tight. </p><p>  <span>Satin ribbons</span> and bows, which are attached to the belt, are most often used as decoration for tutus.  Also, some ribbons sew beads or beads. </p><h2>  Material calculation </h2><p>  To get a tutu skirt for the smallest children, you need from 40 to 60 strips of tulle 15 cm wide and 50 cm long (for a product 24 cm long). </p><p>  If you use material with a width of 160 cm, then from one running meter you get 20 strips.  Consequently, cutting out 60 strips will require at least three meters of tulle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To calculate the <span>fabric consumption</span> before stitching a skirt-pack of tulle longer, you can according to the following algorithm: </p><ul><li>  Determine the length of the skirt. </li><li>  Add 5-6 cm, which are necessary for the formation of the node. </li><li>  Decide how lush the pack will be.  On average, an adult requires at least 60-80 bands.  If you need a very fluffy tulle tutu skirt, it can take up to 120 stripes. </li></ul><h2>  Cut tulle </h2><p>  Most types of tulle are conveniently cut, even if they are folded in several layers.  Therefore, you can not be afraid of the formation of uneven stripes and scissors moving off, but feel free to cut 3-5 paintings at once. </p><p>  When marking the material, it is better to determine the start and end points of the cut, as well as several points between them.  The optimal way to cut a perfectly even strip is to carefully draw a cut line with a chalk or a piece of soap.  Otherwise, you may encounter the fact that the strip at the end will be narrower or wider than at the beginning.  An uneven cut line is also possible. </p><p>  After the required number of strips is ready, you should measure and cut the elastic for the belt.  Its edges need to be laid on each other and very tightly sewn.  If there is a sewing machine, you can use it, but with your hands you also get a pretty reliable seam. </p><h2>  How to make a tulle skirt </h2><p>  To fix the first strip on the belt, the gum needs to be stretched a little.  Craftswomen use for this the legs of an inverted chair or their own knee.  There are two ways to tie a knot: </p><ol><li>  The ribbon is tied around the elastic with a regular double knot so that its edges are the same and the knot is located in the center of the belt.  The strip tied with this method will be very puffy, so in this case a very magnificent tulle skirt will be made of tulle with your own hands. </li><li>  Each strip is first folded in half, the loop is wound for an elastic band. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a pack of tulle skirt" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1254827.jpg" width="209"></div>  Then the free ends are pulled through the loop. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="skirt tutu tutu master class" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1254829.jpg" width="209"></div>  The knot is tightened, and as a result, both edges of the strip look at the floor. </li></ol><p>  An important point: the ribbons should be tied so that they do not pull the gum, but also can move freely on it.  To withstand this middle ground, you can put a ruler or thick cardboard of the same width as the belt.  After several nodes are ready, the lining can be pulled out. </p><p>  In the described way, you need to tie all the strips, placing them very tightly to each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a skirt a pack of tulle" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1254831.jpg" width="280"></div>  Gum should not be visible.

    <h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  In fact, the product is ready.  If necessary, the lower edge can be trimmed with scissors to get a neat tulle skirt-pack.  The master class describes the manufacture of a framework that you can decorate as you wish. </p><p>  As an option for decoration, consider cutting sharp corners at the ends of each strip.  True, at the same time, the skirt will lose a little in splendor. </p><p>  Also interesting are the products in the manufacture of which different color strips of material were used.  They can be placed on an elastic band in a chaotic manner or alternated according to some system. </p>
