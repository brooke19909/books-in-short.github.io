    <h2>  Case Design Samsung C3560 </h2><p>  If an inexperienced buyer comes across a Samsung phone - the C3560 clamshell - it may seem to him that this is a touch phone.  However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the gadget allows itself to be revealed.  It weighs about 84 g, dimensions - 9.5x4.7x1.7 cm. It can easily fit in any pocket of completely different clothes, because the phone is quite thin and compact.  The dark gray tint (Samsung clamshells often have exactly this color scheme) gives rigor, modesty, and thanks to it, the phone seems to be made in a classic style. </p><p>  The case is made only of plastic, there is no metal.  It‚Äôs hard to find many functional details in the front: there is no button that controls the volume, but there is a headphone jack (3.55).  Here you can see a special place for the cord. </p><p>  On the right side of the case is a USB connector.  It is covered with a special plug.  The top of the case is made of plastic with a glossy surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Characteristics Samsung C3560 </h2><p>  The screen is 2 inches, which is a good indicator for such a Samsung clamshell.  Unfortunately, the image disappears in the sun, plus viewing angles are pretty bad.  The brightness changes in the settings.  A high level will help to avoid the occurrence of ‚Äúblind spots‚Äù. </p><p>  Elements that are located on the desktop can be changed depending on the desires of the consumer.  It is possible to display applications such as calendar, time, missed calls, etc. Working with deleting or adding shortcuts is quite simple, it is easy to understand.  All such manipulations can be performed in the file manager. </p><p>  This phone, like many other Samsung clamshells, supports memory cards (up to 16 GB).  Most likely, acquiring microSD is the best option, since there is practically no own memory (only 40 MB). </p><p>  Folders can be either transferred and copied, or deleted, or renamed.  <span>The file manager</span> allows you to listen to music, watch videos, photos, send them to the Internet, via MMS or transfer to other phones. </p>

    <h2>  Case Design Samsung E2530 La'Fleur </h2><p>  Such a model as Samsung Fleur (folding bed) is designed only for the beautiful half of our society, that is, women.  No exception will be the E2530.  He at his price looks quite solid, which gives a sense of spectacularity.  And most importantly, at first glance at it, you can hardly say that this device costs less than 10 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The outer casing has two functions: decorative and functional, since there is an additional screen.  He "comes to life" when a message arrives or someone calls on the phone.  The highlight of this female device was the flower - the Fleur line logo.  Of course, this immediately reduces the circle of consumers who could purchase a phone.  Like other Samsung clamshells, the E2530 has a pleasant appearance, although it has strict features, but rounding makes it ‚Äúsoftened‚Äù.  There is no particular choice in terms of color options - the device is presented only in red. </p><p>  The phone weighs 86 g. It will be convenient to put it in a clutch bag, because it will not take up much space, and will fit into any small pocket of your handbag.  This will help the unassembled girl find the phone on the first try. </p>

    <h2>  Features Samsung E2530 La'Fleur </h2><p>  It was already mentioned above that the E2530 Fleur (the next female clamshell from Samsung, all of whose models are the same line) has two screens.  What are their differences? </p><p>  The first screen is mirrored and small in size.  Its diagonal is only 1 inch.  In fact, it is practically without functions.  All he can do is display small service messages.  The second (2-inch diagonal) is the main one.  All possible manipulations are carried out here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The menu is a regular matrix.  Icons have a pleasant color and overall appearance, make a fairly strong impression on girls and women.  A plus will be the fact that their design can be changed at your own discretion in the settings.  There is no need to dwell on the analysis of the menu, since it is standard, the same as in other phones.  So the E2530 Fleur is Samsung's regular clamshell.  All models, like this one, have basic firmware without any special implementations. </p><h2>  Case Design Samsung Z540 </h2><p>  Samsung Z540 - a classic clamshell in black.  The phone weighs 95 g. Many people who bought this phone say that it is similar in design to the Razr.  This model can be worn in pockets and on a special strap.  It is easy to hold in your hand, it is convenient, comfortable and does not slip.  Thanks to the material, it is almost impossible to scratch the case, and if defects remain, then they are almost invisible. </p><p>  Quite often, Samsung‚Äôs mobile phones (clamshell) are equipped with a camera, which is located, which is logical, on the external case.  The Z540 is no exception.  The camera here is 1.3 megapixels. </p><p>  Under the screen, the user can find the buttons responsible for the player.  There are three of them, and this, judging by the customer reviews, is enough for comfortable listening to music.  Many people write that they fully cover the player‚Äôs functionality, so there‚Äôs no need to go into it to switch, stop or twist the melody.  On the left side of the phone is the volume. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics Samsung Z540 </h2><p>  The Z540 model has two screens: main and child.  The latter has a diagonal of 1 inch and does not bear any special functional load.  This display has a more decorative function than an additional option.  The screen is well made, in direct sunlight the text is quite readable. </p><p>  The menu is represented by icons that can be arranged in a horizontal or vertical list, at the discretion of the user.  Manipulations with them are performed using the special key responsible for this, or from the ‚ÄúQuick Start‚Äù subsection. </p><p>  For convenient listening to music, the manufacturer installed a player on the phone.  It has features such as "random order", "mix", "play sequentially" and others.  To transfer new tunes to the Z540, you will need a wireless connection or a USB cable.  Unfortunately, in the background, music is not played, but thanks to the buttons under the additional screen, you can control the player directly from there with the phone closed. </p><h2>  Briefly about Samsung GT-E2210 </h2><p>  Reviews about the next Samsung clamshell are everywhere only positive.  In the past, it was this company that was the leader and leading "ruler" of the world in the relevant market.  Due to the fact that the corporation dictated the design conditions of certain phones, there was a stereotype that Samsung is suitable only for women.  Although there were young people who were happy to accept such a phone as a gift.  In 2009, the GT-E2210 was born.  At that time, it was an ideal in which value, quality and functionality corresponded to each other. </p><p>  The design of the model shows that the phone belongs to the <span>budget line of the</span> range.  It is small, weighs only 85 g. The case is made exclusively of plastic, there is no metal here.  It was surprising that on the upper part of the body in the center there is a vertical rib.  This is what became the key to the success of the phone in the market. </p><p>  Like many other models, there are two screens.  Their diagonal is 1 and 2 inches respectively. </p>

    <h2>  New in the world of technology: Samsung Galaxy - clamshell smartphone </h2><h2>  clamshell smartphone </h2><p>  The mobile market was blown up by a special ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù of the world's largest technology corporation.  Samsung's new clamshell smartphone runs on Android.  In fact, there was a combination of the inner shell of smartphones with the design of the once-leading clamshells.  The reviews of people are very mixed.  Some do not understand how to combine heaven and earth, but for others, on the contrary, the model seemed very interesting and even funny. </p><p>  The gadget, due to its shape, as if "sticks" to the face during a conversation, which is very convenient and comfortable.  This is clearly better than applying a huge shovel of 15-20 cm to the face. </p>

Built-in memory is 16 GB, the device also supports memory cards (up to 128 GB). </p><p>  It is unlikely that anyone will remain dissatisfied, given similar technical characteristics.  Therefore, if it is possible to purchase this particular device, then the Samsung clamshell smartphone will surprise the owner with its contents, because it is much more interesting than the appearance of the device. </p>
