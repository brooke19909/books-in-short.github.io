According to the French, there are no ugly women in the world, but there are women with unkempt hair.  You can be in a simple dress, but if the hairstyle and shoes are on top, you are guaranteed success. </p><p>  Today, the market for hair care products is represented by a variety of means.  The counters are full of shampoos of various companies: famous and not so.  But it happens that after trying many different shampoos, you still remain unsatisfied with the result.  The reason for this is the incorrect determination of the type of your hair and, therefore, the wrong choice of shampoo.  There are no universal shampoos suitable for all types of hair without exception, but there is the opportunity to make a shampoo at home that will suit your hair, and it‚Äôs not so difficult.  And it is likely that this time the result will exceed all your expectations! </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs easier to go to a beauty salon and entrust your hair to professionals.  But this does not always work out due to a number of reasons: lack of time, money, and sometimes both of them together.  It is known that natural substances are much more useful in their properties to all other substances.  And if you pamper your hair by replacing a regular shampoo with a homemade one, you will feel the difference.  But not immediately, but with systematic, competent care.  So, we make shampoo at home! </p><p>  Shampoo recipes at home in Russia have long included natural remedies such as decoctions and infusions of herbs and various oils, depending on the type of hair.  Let's consider some of them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Prepare a shampoo at home for dry hair.  We need: 2 yolks, 50 ml (a quarter cup) of water, 100 ml of vodka and 5-8 ml of ammonia.  The mixture is applied to wet hair, evenly distributed over the entire length, lightly massage the scalp and rinse off well with warm water. </p><p>  The following shampoo is also suitable for dry hair: mix 1 egg yolk with 1 teaspoon of castor oil and 1 teaspoon of <span>shampoo for dry hair.</span>  Divide the resulting mixture into 2 parts, add water of room temperature to each of them.  Apply the first portion of the mixture to wet hair, grind and rinse.  Then apply a second portion of the mixture and massage the scalp lightly for 3-4 minutes.  Rinse hair with warm water. </p><p>  To prepare shampoo for normal hair, we need 1 egg mixed with a small amount of water and a pinch of borax (sold in pharmacies).  The mixture is applied to wet hair, evenly distributed and slightly rubbed.  Then it is washed off with warm water.  It is very important not to use too hot water when washing, as it dries out the hair.  It is ideal to wash your hair with water close to body temperature. </p><p>  To wash oily hair, a pulp of rye bread with bran will be required, in which <span>milk serum</span> must be added in advance <span>.</span>  Rinse hair with massaging movements with this composition.  Rinse with warm water.  To remove the smell of dairy products, you can rinse with warm water with the addition of dry mustard. </p><p>  Here is another recipe <span>for oily hair shampoo.</span>  It is necessary to take 2 tablespoons of dry mustard, dissolve it in a small amount of hot water.  Stir constantly, add 1 liter of hot water.  Wash hair and rinse with warm water. </p><p>  For sensitive scalp it is recommended to use the following shampoo: one and a half tablespoons of chamomile flowers, 250 ml of boiled water, 60 ml of liquid glycerin soap, 1 teaspoon of castor oil, 3 drops of essential oils of rosemary, sage and tea tree.  In the prepared infusion of chamomile add liquid soap, castor and essential oils.  Mix well and shake the mixture.  Shampoo is ideal for frequent use.  It can be stored in the refrigerator for a week.  Wash your hair with a warm mixture, as usual, rinse well with warm water. </p><p>  We hope that these simple and affordable homemade shampoo recipes will help you keep your hair healthy and beautiful. </p>
