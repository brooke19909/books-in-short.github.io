    <p>  The hotel is famous for its good service.  Travelers do not complain about the rudeness or incompetence of employees.  Russians often praise the staff at the reception desk and information.  Our compatriots gave excellent marks to the work of the cooks in the restaurant.  True, there were comments regarding the assortment of dishes that were served for breakfast as part of the buffet food system. </p><p>  They say that the menu was monotonous and rather meager.  Every morning they made eggs, a couple of kinds of soups, rice, noodles, chopped vegetables and fruits.  Sometimes sausages and sausages were prepared, but they were soy.  Hot compotes, coffee and milk were poured. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  If for the first time you yourself go to the beach, focus on the Pineapple shopping center.  It is located next to the sea.  Hotel guests are not advised to eat in small cafes, which abound in a lively area.  They are dirty, the furniture is old, and workers do not comply with sanitary standards. </p><p>  A modest lunch for two adults in an institution with a higher rank costs 500 rubles.  If you go to a decent restaurant, you will have to pay 1,200 for a meal. It is more profitable to change money in Russia, and not in China. </p><p>  Going to Sanya, you need to remember that the streets of the city are always noisy.  Smoke everywhere.  The food is very salty and peppered.  Prices in stores and markets are indicated not for the whole kilogram, but for its half.  Sellers do not like to bargain. </p>
