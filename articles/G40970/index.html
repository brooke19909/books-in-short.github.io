Sights of Berdsk</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many people, including residents of Russia, the word "Novosibirsk" says little.  This is somewhere in Siberia - that's all that can answer.  But the mysterious name Berdsk generally stands beyond understanding.  However, today the southern part of Siberia is being built up and populated at such a speed that not only Novosibirsk itself, but also its satellite towns have become very popular for moving.  Today we want to talk about the tiny Berdsk.  This is already a practically <span>sleeping area of</span> Novosibirsk, which is rapidly growing and developing.  We want to tell readers about the sights of Berdsk.  Especially useful information will be for those who plan to move to these parts in the future. </p>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  You can find many reviews about this town.  For some, it is tiny and boring, but for others it is very cozy and more suitable for life than a metropolis.  In fact, it grows and blooms.  Well-groomed streets and squares, lots of greenery and luxurious flower gardens - all this makes the city very nice.  Sights of Berdsk are not outstanding, in each city there are historical monuments and special places.  But let's talk about everything in order. </p><h2>  To a modern look </h2><p>  The city was founded back in 1716, but today you cannot find a single old building here.  However, natural beauty more than compensate for this shortcoming.  The fact is that the waters of the <span>Ob reservoir</span> absorbed the old city.  But today, their vast expanse is the best decoration.  In the summer, many citizens and guests of the city rest on the banks of the reservoir.  Speaking about the sights of Berdsk, you can not ignore this amazing reservoir.  You are waiting for the most beautiful places and protected pine forest, resorts and holiday homes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of the city of berdsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1471007.jpg" width="599"></div>

It stretches along the entire settlement, but it is the spit that is the most favorite place for tourists.  At any time of the year you are guaranteed stunning landscapes and excellent outdoor recreation.  The spit coast stretches for 80 km, here everyone will find a place to taste.
