Moreover, our compatriots are attracted not only by low prices for accommodation and services, but also by magnificent beaches, historical and natural attractions, as well as the hospitality of the local population.  In fact, the cost of rest on the Turkish coast is acceptable for tourists of all categories, and even in deluxe hotels you can stay at pretty affordable prices.  So, for example, for the same money (3,368 rubles per night) that you need to pay for a stay in a three-star hotel in Italy or even Greece, you can live in a five-star Turkish hotel, for example, in Oz Hotels Side Premium (Side / Turkey).  At the same time, such a high-quality service is unlikely to be found in any other Mediterranean country.  Of course, some of the Turkish resorts are more popular than others.  However, in almost all you can find the perfect combination of "price-quality".  This is also the case at Side, where the aforementioned Oz Hotels Side Premium is located.  It was recently built and offers tourists a freshly renovated apartment with a beautiful design and rich decoration.  Plus all the necessary conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oz Hotels Side Premium (Side /" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/570493.jpg" width="600"></div>

This small town is called Side.  It is located 75 kilometers from Antalya.  Its attraction to tourists lies in the fact that it is not only a magnificent seaside resort, but also a unique open-air museum.  After all, here is the main historical and archaeological zone of Turkey, which is under the protection of the country's Ministry of Culture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Oz Hotels Side Premium." class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/570501.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest in Side </h2><p>  As already noted, this resort is very popular among tourists, not only Russian, but also the CIS countries, Europe and other continents.  Therefore, numerous <span>hotels in Side</span> in high season are constantly crowded.  Most of the hotel complexes are located in the west of the resort, where there are magnificent sandy beaches.  Fans of a relaxing family vacation in this area are unlikely to like it, but in hotels located on the outskirts of the resort there are fewer people, which means they are calmer.  The five-star Oz Hotels Side Premium, the photo of which you see in this article, is completely young and quite calm.  On the beaches of the resort there is a wide selection of water activities: skiing, parachuting, surfing, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  If you chose ‚ÄúPremium 5 *‚Äù, which is located in the resort of Side, for recreation, then you will have to fly to <span>Antalya airport</span> first <span>,</span> and then go to Manavgat by bus.  But from there on dolmush or bus you can get to Side, and the second is more convenient, because right next to the hotel there is a parking of this type of transport.  However, if you value your comfort, then it is better for you when you buy a tour to pay for the transfer to the hotel and not think about the means of transportation anymore.  As soon as you are at the airport, you will be met either by a tour operator representative or an employee of Oz Hotels Side Premium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oz Hotels Side Premium, photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/570500.jpg" width="600"></div>
