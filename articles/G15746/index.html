    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  MegaFon and translations </h2><p>  How to transfer one or another amount of money from a phone to a Sberbank card?  It all depends on the specific mobile operator.  Consider the most common and large firms. </p><p>  In the case of MegaFon, it will be necessary to implement the task as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open megafon.ru website. </li><li>  Log in to your personal account. </li><li>  Select the "Money Transfer" function. </li><li>  Click on the line "To a bank card." </li><li>  Indicate the phone number from which funds will be debited. </li><li>  Enter the operation confirmation code.  He will come in an SMS message. </li><li>  Prescribe the number (16 digits) of the bank card where you want to transfer funds. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  Done!  In a few minutes, the money will be transferred to the specified bank account.  This technique is not used so often.  It requires certain costs.  It's about commission.  It amounts to 7.35% and fixedly 95 rubles if the citizen decided to transfer no more than 5,000 rubles to the Sberbank card from the phone.  Otherwise, the surcharge to interest will be 295 rubles. </p><h2>  Beeline and translations </h2><p>  But this is only the beginning.  How to transfer <span>funds</span> from a phone to a Sberbank card <span>?</span>  The next operator in line is Beeline. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer from phone to sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2146003.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The order of operations is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Go to the mobile operator page in the browser. </li><li>  Log in to the service. </li><li>  Click on the item "Pay from phone account". </li><li>  Select "Money Transfer". </li><li>  Indicate the payment system.  In our case, this is Sberbank. </li><li>  Enter the bank card number, the phone number of the sender, as well as the amount due to be credited. </li><li>  Click on the "OK" button. </li></ol><p>  Done!  Now we know how to transfer a certain amount of money to a Sberbank card from a Beeline phone.  The commission in this case is also charged, but it is less than that of MegaFon - only 5.95% and 10 rubles extra.  The transfer will be completed within 5 days.  A transaction usually takes several hours to process. </p><h2>  MTS to help </h2><p>  Next in line is another large company providing mobile access - MTS.  Many residents of the Russian Federation work with this operator. </p><p>  Transferring money to a Sberbank card via a phone with a MTS SIM card is not difficult.  Here comes the "Internet Assistant."  It is also called the "Personal Account" of the subscriber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer sberbank from phone to card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2146004.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The manual on transferring funds from phone to card is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to mts.ru. </li><li>  Log in to your personal account. </li><li>  Go to the "Payment Management" item. </li><li>  Open "Money transfers" in the "Easy payment" tab. </li><li>  Click on the line "Transfer to a bank card." </li><li>  Enter the data requested by the system.  Usually this is the number from which you will have to charge money, as well as the amount and number of the destination card. </li><li>  Put a mark near the item "From the MTS phone account". </li><li>  Click on the "Next" button. </li><li>  Confirm the process. </li></ol><p>  As in the previous case, finances will be transferred within 5 days from the date of sending the request.  The commission for such transfers at "MTS" is not the highest - only 4% of the payment amount. </p><h2>  Tele2 and bank plastic </h2><p>  How to transfer this or that amount of money to a Sberbank card via Tele2?  To crank up the business, you must do the following: </p><ol><li>  Open in tele2.ru browser. </li><li>  Click on the line "Payments and transfers". </li><li>  Select the command "To a bank card." </li><li>  Indicate the beneficiary bank.  In our case, this is Sberbank. </li><li>  Enter the phone number of the sender and the card number of the recipient. </li><li>  Prescribe the amount due for transfer. </li><li>  Enter the transaction confirmation code in the designated field. </li></ol><p>  The commission "Tele2" for the operation under study is 5.75%.  Money can be transferred to the indicated account up to 5 working days, but this is a huge rarity.  As a rule, funds are transferred to the card in a few hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money to a sberbank card via phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2146006.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  SMS to help </h2><p>  Money can be transferred to the Sberbank card from the phone using SMS requests.  Each mobile operator has them.  The subscriber just needs to form a message and send it to one or another short number. </p><p>  It is recommended to pay attention to the following queries: </p><ul><li>  Card_number of the card_month and year of validity_amount, sending to number 3116 - "MegaFon"; </li><li>  Card_number plastic_sum, sending to 7878 - Beeline; </li><li>  the previously proposed message form sent by number 159 - "Tele2". </li></ul><p>  That's all.  Only on this, the possible ways of transferring money do not end there.  There are some pretty interesting tricks. </p><h2>  Mobile Bank </h2><p>  We are talking about using the option of Sberbank called "Mobile Bank".  With its help, you can transfer money from card to card via phone.  This option is also sometimes considered by citizens. </p><p>  How to transfer money through mobile banking?  To start, you have to connect the option.  This procedure is done in absolutely any office of the bank, as well as in a payment terminal or ATM.  Once the service is connected, you can use the following commands: </p><ol><li>  <em>Transfer, number, amount</em> , where "number" is the recipient‚Äôs mobile.  The request must be sent to 900. In this case, funds will be transferred from the sender's card to the plastic attached to the specified mobile device. </li><li>  <em>* 900 * 12 * number * amount #</em> - a similar transfer between cards via mobile communication.  The difference is that this is a USSD request that you just need to ‚Äúring‚Äù. </li></ol><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how to act in this or that case.  Transferring funds to a Sberbank card from your phone is not difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer to a sberbank card via phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2146002.jpg"></div>
