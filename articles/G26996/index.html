But how much do we sometimes overpay for the "first line"?  The Germans and French, who also love a comfortable stay, but are used to not littering with money, have long carried out this calculation.  After all, you can find the same luxury and a high level of service and cheaper if you consider the options of the second and third lines.  Don't want to part with your calories for breakfast?  Usually in such hotels provides a free shuttle to the beach.  Let's look at such remote hotels from the sea using the example of Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; <span>Spa 5 *.</span>  This hotel opened only at the beginning of the holiday season two thousand and sixteen.  Therefore, there are not so many reviews about it.  But those who have been here in the summer and fall speak about the hotel exclusively in enthusiastic colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514611.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location of the resort complex Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa 5 * </h2><p>  Bogazkent - this is the name of the small resort village in which the hotel described by us is located.  A more or less large town located nearby is Belek.  It is ten kilometers from the hotel.  But this distance, assure reviews, is not a problem, since dolmushi minibuses often run between Bogazkent and Belek.  Antalya International Airport is forty-five kilometers from the village.  If you have a transfer in your tour package, the journey will not take more than an hour.  Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa is located on the third line from the beach.  Finding her is easy.  The hotel stands on 65 Alparslan Street. Nearby is a public transport stop with links to the center of Belek.  And now we will consider, what compensates for the distance from the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfour hundred meters?  Reviews of tourists assure that this hotel is the cheapest offer among the ‚Äúfives‚Äù not only in Bogazkent, but throughout Belek. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514618.jpg" width="600"></div>

But all the services and services on its territory are located compactly, functionally, you do not have to go far.  The hotel consists of several five-story buildings.  They stand in such a way that from the lion's share of the rooms you can see the pool, located in the form of a lagoon between the buildings.  All reviews are praised by architects and landscape designers.  The impression of the hotel is amazing.  Modern amenities, oriental luxury, hi-tech and Ottoman style - all mixed in the design of the buildings under blue and white domes.  Tourists note that the hotel has a very spacious sun terrace.  And if you want to spend all days by the pool, you do not need to take a sunbed at six in the morning - there are plenty of them.  The spacious lobby of the hotel is stunning with luxury and sophisticated style.  It should be said that the main contingent of vacationers in this hotel are the British, French and Germans.  This also affects the quality of rest at the VIP-class hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa 5 Bogazkent" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  The Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa (Turkey) has four hundred guest rooms.  The lion's part (three hundred and thirty-four numbers) belong to the Standard category.  All these en-suite bedrooms with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã36 square meters have spacious balconies.  Tourists are surprised to note that the double room has a matrimonial and single bed.  The hotel also has a Family Room.  These rooms with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãforty-eight square meters consist of two bedrooms and a bathroom.  The real pride of the hotel are the "Suites".  There are five of them.  One of them is the Royal.  The suites have a lounge and a spa bath.  The remaining rooms have showers.  Reviews warn: the rooms are dominated by high-tech style.  Therefore, the bathroom from the bedroom is separated by a transparent wall.  Do not forget to close the blinds, especially if the light is on - unless, of course, you want to be seen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensitive Premium Resort &amp; Spa reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1514613.jpg" width="600"></div>

A free bus takes him to his guests every half hour, and those who do not want to wait for him can reach the sea in ten minutes in an unhurried step.

Sunbeds, umbrellas, a beach bar are free for hotel guests.  There are several swimming pools in the hotel: a large swimming pool in the fresh air, indoor, children‚Äôs and one where vacationers descend from the water slides of the water park.
