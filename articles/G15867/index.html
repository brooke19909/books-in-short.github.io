    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This 3-star hotel is located just 500 meters from the center of the resort town of Alanya (Turkey).  Thus, for its guests the entire infrastructure of a major tourist center will be, as they say, at hand.  Just 150 meters from the hotel is the famous "Cleopatra Beach".  The nearest air harbors are in Antalya (about two hours drive) and in Gazipasa (about half an hour drive).  However, the last airport only accepts domestic flights.  Therefore, if you plan to leave Russia directly to Alanya, then your path will go through the air harbor of the main resort city of Turkey - Antalya.  So get ready for a two-hour drive to the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists about the location and territory of the hotel </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the hotel in question has a very convenient location.  So, it is located in the very center of Alanya.  To "Cleopatra's beach" from here you can walk in just five minutes, and to discos and nightclubs - in 10-15 minutes.  Also near the hotel there is all the necessary infrastructure: cafes, shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, etc. In addition, there are bus stops near Glaros Hotel where you can go to neighboring settlements.  Nearby is an excellent water park, which is recommended to visit by almost all vacationers. </p><p>  As for the territory of Glaros Hotel 3 * (Turkey), then, since this is a city-style hotel, its own area is very small.  So, in addition to the residential building, there are two swimming pools and a sun terrace.  Therefore, experienced travelers advise those people who prefer to spend almost their entire vacation at the hotel to find another place to stay. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  According to tourists, both the building itself and the rooms of the hotel in question are decorated quite simply, without frills.  However, here you will find everything you need.  Hairdryer and air conditioning in the rooms are working properly.  As for the plumbing, several guests complained about the fact that pipes leaked a little in the bathroom.  However, this did not become a problem, since all the water went into the drain on the floor, and no puddles formed.  Therefore, guests simply did not pay attention to this trifle.  As for hot water, according to our compatriots, it is always there, without interruptions.  Clean the rooms here every day.  Towels, according to the guests of the Glaros Hotel 3 *, change if dirty ones are thrown to the floor.  Also, experienced travelers recommend paying attention to the fact that single beds in the rooms cannot be moved when checking in.  Therefore, if necessary, immediately ask for a room with a double bed. </p>

For lunch and dinner, you can taste a variety of dishes from meat, fish, salads, fresh fruits.  Please note that the meat is given in portions.  If, for some reason, food doesn‚Äôt seem enough for you, you can always go to one of the restaurants, which have a lot of food near the hotel.  As for desserts, they, according to tourists, are offered very few.  However, many guests were only happy with this fact, since, in their opinion, it is already difficult to come home from vacation without a couple of extra pounds.  Drinks in Glaros Hotel 3 * vacationers found quite high quality, especially beer and wine.  Also, if you plan to skip breakfast, lunch or dinner (for example, go on an excursion), you can always ask to pack your food with you. </p><h2>  Opinion about the hotel staff </h2><p>  According to most vacationers, the Glaros Hotel has a very friendly, responsive and attentive staff.  Administrators almost always try to check in guests immediately after arrival.  If you arrive during breakfast or lunch, then first you will be asked to go eat, and then they will give you a room.  By the way, guests are not wearing bracelets here, they remember everyone by sight.  According to our compatriots, several of the staff speak Russian, so you can always explain if necessary. </p>
