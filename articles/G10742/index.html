However, it cannot be said that he is less beautiful or interesting.  The sights of Tivat and its environs are more modest, but have the same ancient history, originating in the third century BC. </p><p>  The city is largely associated with a nearby international airport of the same name with regular workloads.  As a matter of fact, for this reason, many tourists are familiar only with the name of the village.  Its history and the few, but very interesting monuments of architecture and history, believe me, deserve attention.  In the article we offer you a description of Tivat with the most famous sights. </p><h2>  About city </h2>

    <p>  Located on the Vrmac peninsula, Tivat is surrounded by the eponymous mountain range and the Adriatic Sea.  The town is small, covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã46 square meters.  km, the population of the municipality is just over 13.5 thousand people.  Historians are of the opinion that Tivat was founded around the 3rd century BC, its name came from the name of the Queen of Illyria - Teuta.  Fertile lands and a favorable geographical location have always attracted people to these places.  The Middle Ages for the city were marked by the domination of patrician families from neighboring Kotor, who had vast estates on this territory.  In the 14-15 centuries, the ancient <span>Tivat (Montenegro), the</span> sights and history of which are closely interconnected, became the center of Orthodox Christianity.  This is due to the fact that since 13th century the residence of Metropolitan Zeva has been located on the island of flowers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Subsequently, the city came under Venetian rule until 1797, then the period of the reign of the French, Austrians (until 1918) and the stay in Yugoslavia followed, until its collapse. </p><p>  A favorable climate with moderately hot summers and mild winters, the proximity of the international airport, the clear sea and beaches are the three main factors that attract tourists to Tivat.  The sights of the city, however, should not be written off, although they are not numerous, they are interesting. </p><h2>  Tivat Captain (Marine) Park </h2><p>  That‚Äôs what the luxurious city park is called.  Holidays at sea are suitable for hiking in the shade of oleanders, olives and palm trees.  The air here is cool and fresh even in the most intense heat, the park gives the impression of a green oasis.  The natural site is under protection.  The captain‚Äôs park was nicknamed thanks to its founder, the Austro-Hungarian admiral Maximillian von Sternek.  To equip him, he ordered all the captains of his fleet to bring seedlings and seeds from their voyages.  Thanks to such efforts, the park really became more like a botanical garden with rare and valuable species.  He is rightfully the pride of the city of Tivat.  Sights of this kind are always interesting and enjoyable. </p><h2>  Bucha Palace </h2>

    <p>  The massive structure of the 17th century with the characteristic features of the medieval style once combined immediately two functions - a defensive castle and a summer residence of the Bucha and Lukovits family.  Perhaps this is the main attraction of Tivat, located in the central part of the city, so getting to it is not difficult.  Currently, the complex houses a cultural center in which exhibitions are regularly organized and various events are held.  To do this, the restored castle has everything you need: a summer stage, an art gallery, a garden, an indoor cinema and a theater. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flower island </h2>

    <p>  The incredible beauty of nature, combining mountain ranges, centuries-old forests and the gentle sea - this is what Montenegro can be proud of.  Tivat sights of this kind also did not go around.  In the immediate vicinity of the city, in the Bay of Kotor, there is a small peninsula (length and width are 300 and 200 m, respectively), during a high tide it becomes an island.  It got its name in those days when its surface was covered with thickets of greenery, palm trees and olive trees.  His condition was largely influenced by the military conflict.  Now about a hundred people live in private bungalows on the peninsula, there is a good beach and, of course, its central attraction is the monastery of the Archangel Michael.  The last long period is under restoration. </p><p>  By a small bridge you can get from the city to the island and back to Tivat.  Sights are best viewed on their own.  The town is small, and you can easily get around it during the walk. </p><h2>  Church of St. Sava </h2>

    <p>  This is the largest church of the six functioning in Tivat, and it is dedicated to one of the most revered holy Orthodox Serbs.  She can not boast of ancient history, but it is very beautiful and made in the Neo-Byzantine style.  The laying of the first stone took place in 1938, but soon the construction was postponed due to the war.  The work was completed only in 1968. Now the church is operational, and everyone can visit the service. </p><h2>  Marina Porto Montenegro </h2><p>  An amazing and unique place - the result of the creation of human hands.  This luxurious project has developed on the basis of the former naval base and shipyard.  At the moment it is not finished yet, however, the scale and beauty are amazing.  And this is not surprising, because it is financed by businessmen from several countries at once.  The huge marina, designed for 630 yachts, transformed the city and provided it with an additional flow of tourists. </p>

    <p>  It is planned to turn it into a kind of city in a city with its own hotels, restaurants, shops, museums, golf courses, etc. A construction of this scale could not fail to attract attention, numerous protests by local residents took place.  However, the townspeople eventually looked at what was happening differently, noticing how Tivat was transformed. </p><h2>  Attractions: what to see in the area? </h2><p>  A long vacation on the Adriatic coast can also be devoted to exploring the surroundings.  Perhaps there is nothing more exciting than exploring the country yourself by traveling through it. </p><p>  Near Tivat there is a small village - Gornya-Lastva.  As the name implies, it is located in the mountains.  Especially it will be interesting to lovers of antiquity.  It is here that you can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the country, its national flavor.  Neat stone houses with a tiled roof and covered with ivy, paved streets, an old medieval church and a magnificent view of the bay make you forget about time and small flaws in the form of dilapidated buildings. </p>
