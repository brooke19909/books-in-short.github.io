In 1892, he petitioned for the construction of a church in Peterhof, as there were few churches, and they could not accommodate all parishioners.  First, this request came to the Minister Vorontsov-Dashkov, and through him - to the table of Alexander III.  The emperor satisfies the application and personally determines the place of construction - the coast of Tsaritsyno Pond.  Thus begins the story of a magnificent Orthodox church, which today quite clearly reflects the original Russian style. </p>

    <h2>  Peter and Paul Cathedral (Peterhof): the history of construction </h2><p>  The emperor also personally selected architects.  When Nikolai Sultanov, along with other candidates (Benoit, de Rochefort and Semenov) presented his drawing, Alexander III chose his project, because according to the plan the temple was supposed to hold up to 800 parishioners.  In addition, the talented (and today there is no doubt, just look at the building) Sultanov clearly thought out the appearance and interior decoration.  The construction of the temple was not just beautiful, but also convenient for priests and visitors.  There are separate rooms for burial services, baptisms and confessions, canopy wardrobes, and even indoor galleries, which are used on rainy days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Peter and Paul Cathedral (Peterhof) began to be built in 1894.  First, they dug a pit, then they created temporary buildings for workers to live in and began to erect.  The first stone was laid by the initiator - Yanyshev, this was in 1895.  The architect Kosyakov directed all construction affairs.  The Imperial Court was sponsoring.  For four years, they managed to build the building, then they were engaged in plastering, heating and ventilation works, which lasted at least three years.  Then they began to <span>paint the temple</span> and equip the iconostasis.  It lasted 2 years.  At the same time, they set up a garden around the cathedral and built a parish school, power station and boiler room. </p><p>  The Cathedral of the Holy <span>Apostles Peter</span> and Paul (Peterhof) was consecrated on June 12 (25 in the new style) in 1905.  The solemn event was held by John Yanyshev.  The whole imperial family was present at this peculiar holiday. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural appearance </h2><p>  The temple has the shape of a pyramid.  It is crowned with five chapters with gilded domes and tent towers.  The largest of them is located at an altitude of 70 m. This cathedral is the best example of Russian architecture of the late XVI - early XVII centuries.  It was built of light yellow and dark red bricks using irrigation tiles, and as decorations we took columns of sandstone, also with tiles.  On the facades installed icons of patrons of the imperial dynasty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Surrounded by amazing beauty, the Cathedral of Peter and Paul (Peterhof) is an indoor gallery.  There are many different rooms, including rooms for lighting Easter products.  Each entrance has a walk-in closet.  On the side facades are stairs leading to the choirs.  The main entrance is decorated with an arch portal, surrounded by 2 porches, a chapel and a tent-shaped belfry. </p>

    <h2>  Interior and decoration </h2><p>  Inside the temple was decorated by masters Safonov and Kolupaev.  They painted the interior, and Palekh icon painters dealt with icons.  The main iconostasis was made in the likeness of what is in the <span>Greek church of</span> St. George in Venice.  The central part of the cathedral is occupied by an arch with a wide tax and a silver crucifix.  Other iconostases, for example, in the chapel, are made of snow-white <span>Carrara marble.</span> </p><p>  The Cathedral of Peter and Paul (Peterhof) suffered greatly twice: first - from the revolution, and then - during the Great Patriotic War.  However, all necessary measures were taken to restore the architectural monument for the millennium of the Baptism of Russia.  The consecration in the late 1990s was performed by the Moscow Patriarch.  To this day, restoration work is periodically carried out to preserve the external and internal appearance of the most beautiful example of the neo-Russian style. </p>

    <h2>  Address </h2><p>  The cathedral is located in New Peterhof, on the banks of Tsaritsyno Pond (now called Olginogo), on 32 A St. Petersburg Avenue. In close proximity is the Peterhof ensemble, which consists of palaces and parks. </p><p>  And on the most gloomy days, this magnificent architectural creation decorates and illuminates the city with its distinctive bright beauty like a ray of light.  Being here, you must visit the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Peterhof to appreciate the true <span>Neo-Russian style.</span> </p>
