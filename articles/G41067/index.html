A man tamed a dog, learned to cultivate the land, using primitive tools.  Gradually, the industry developed, a new tool for plowing, which replaced the hoe, allowed the person to switch from hoe to slash-and-burn agriculture, increase yields and facilitate the hard work of the first plowmen. </p><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  The most ancient hoes were two sticks, one of which was tied at the bottom of the other crosswise.  Thus, man received the prototype of a modern tool of labor.  It was not easy for them to work, so gradually men began to engage in farming (this is precisely the reason for the transition from matriarchy to patriarchy).  It took a lot of time to cultivate a piece of land, and a person understood: something needs to be changed. </p>

    <p>  The female harrow, a plowing tool that replaced the hoe, is an ordinary stick with many knots.  At first it was simply dragged along the ground, thus lifting the lower layers of the soil.  A little later, something like ropes began to be tied to the base of the stick, with which it was much easier to pull the harrow.  The type of agriculture has also changed: now people not only raised the lower layers of the soil up, but in a special way prepared a plot for cultivation.  A relatively flat plot of land was selected in the forest, then it was cleaned of trees.  Felled trunks were burned, and the soil was fertilized with ash, only after that they began to sow crops.  Usually, two or three crops were received from such an allotment, and then they simply threw it, starting all over again in another area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But this person did not stop there.  New tools for plowing, which replaced the hoe and harrow-sucker, replaced the slash-and-burn method of agriculture. </p><h2>  Arable farming </h2><p>  Livestock farming also developed in parallel with agriculture, so using livestock in agricultural work was a matter of time.  The horse tamed by man was originally only a means of transportation; it began to use its force in plowing much later.  The next step in the development of agriculture was another tool for plowing, which replaced the hoe and harrow-bitch, - a light wooden wound.  At first it was a stick to which two smaller sticks were attached, which loosened the ground.  One end of the ral was attached to the animal, and the farmer held on to the other.  Naturally, the use of livestock greatly simplified the process of plowing, and a similar method of tillage improved productivity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what tools for plowing replaced the hoe" class="if" height="197" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29201/677352.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Impact on society </h2><p>  Now it doesn‚Äôt matter what tools for plowing, which replaced the hoe, <strong> </strong>  used by man.  It is important how they influenced the development of society.  Initially, the matriarchy dominated the human collective, the cult of a woman who was considered the foundation of everything on earth.  But with the evolution of agriculture, it became clear that the weaker sex could not do all the work, so the transition to patriarchal relations gradually took place.  In the new society, the man played the main role.  And until now, mankind has retained these foundations, which owe their existence to the transition from hoe to more complex types of agriculture. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The role of various devices in the development of agriculture can be discussed for a very long time.  But one thing is certain with certainty: the plowing tool, which replaced the hoe, was able to fundamentally revolutionize the ideas about the producing economy and about the human collective.  So the female harrow and the wooden railing are much more than just devices for digging the earth, they are steps in the development of society and civilization. </p>
