The main specifications of such devices and recommendations on the selection of such routers will also be given.  In addition to this, the basic requirements for choosing the installation location of various network nodes will be given.  All this will allow the potential buyer to choose exactly the solution that will most closely match his needs.  Also, with the help of this material, a novice specialist will be able to configure the computer network properly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="us.dlink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi router setup" class="if uuid-2338547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338547.jpg"></div><h2>  General characteristics of routers.  Recommendations for selection.  Equipment </h2><p>  Any modern router is a universal solution that is able to create both a wireless segment and a wired section of a computer network.  Also, some of these most advanced devices are equipped with a USB port.  In this case, the router can perform the functions of an archive server or documentation.  Also, in addition to the same port, you can install an external modem and use it to implement the backup connection technology to the global web. </p><p>  For home use, a router that has four LAN ports with a speed of 100 Mbps is enough.  With two antennas for creating a wireless network, the transmission speed is already limited to 300 Mbps.  But in the case of the office, it is recommended to purchase more advanced solutions that have an additional 2 USB ports and an increased transfer rate in the wireless segment of the computer network. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In most cases, the configuration of such network nodes includes the following: </p><ol><li>  Router </li><li>  Power Supply. </li><li>  A disk with software. </li><li>  An extended user guide that details the features of such a device.  Also, in some cases, it describes in stages the setup - Mi WiFi router from Xiaomi, for example. </li><li>  Communication wire for reconfiguring a network device. </li></ol><h2>  Types of Routers </h2><p>  Conventionally, WiFi-enabled routers can be divided into two large groups.  The first of these is universal devices that are not tied to the equipment of one particular provider.  They have a higher cost, and they need to be configured properly.  For example, setting up a Tp-Link WiFi router can be done either using the wizard or using the WEB interface.  It is easier for beginners to apply the first method.  But for professionals, the second of them is more suitable.  By the way, it is recommended that <span>Xiaomi</span> be configured with the second method also. </p><p>  The second large group of routers includes specialized solutions.  They are sold by providers to their customers.  Such devices are already initially configured to work as part of the computer network of a company.  But such routers will not work with the equipment of other providers.  In this case, you only need to switch the device on and on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="us.dlink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi router setup" class="if uuid-2338549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338549.jpg"></div><h2>  General tuning algorithm </h2><p>  In general, the WiFi router is configured as follows: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Unpacking the device.  Installation of antennas in case of their separate execution.  In some cases, they are not removed, and there is no need to install them. </li><li>  Choosing an installation location.  The supply of communications. </li><li>  Network node switching. </li><li>  Turn on the router.  Correction of the software shell of the device.  Its reboot. </li><li>  Health Check. </li></ol><h2>  Training </h2><p>  At the preparatory stage, the WiFi-router should be removed from the shipping package along with the documentation.  The latter is recommended to study in detail.  It is also necessary to inspect all the stickers on the device and find the name of the network and access code for it. </p><p>  Another point is the contract with the provider for the provision of services for connecting to the global web.  It indicates the parameters that must be entered into the software shell of a network device.  This is the type of connection, this is the login, and a special password, and the type of addressing, and DNS.  All these data are recommended to be written separately on a blank sheet and then used in the process of reconfiguring the network node. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.signalboosters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setup xiaomi wifi router" class="if uuid-2338551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338551.jpg"></div><h2>  Choosing an installation location.  General recommendations and wiring </h2><p>  Setting up a WiFi network starts by choosing the right place to install the router.  The first important condition is that the network access point should be located as close as possible to the center of the room.  If there is not enough coverage, then it is necessary to additionally acquire the so-called repeaters and already use them. </p><p>  Another important point is metal surfaces.  Near the router, they simply should not be.  If this condition is not met, then the level of the received signal and the quality of the coating will significantly deteriorate. </p><p>  Also, in the installation site of the network node should be a socket for the organization of its power.  The second important point is the ability to supply twisted pair from the provider to the installation location of the router.  It is based on these conditions, and we choose the installation location of the router. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dlink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="d link 300 wifi setup" class="if uuid-2338553" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338553.jpg"></div><h2>  Commutation </h2><p>  The next step is to start connecting the network node.  To do this, the power supply is installed with the built-in plug into the outlet, and the cord from it is inserted into the device‚Äôs socket.  Then we connect the twisted pair cable from the provider company to the port marked WAN or Ethernet.  It is usually blue. </p><p>  Further, if necessary, a wired part of the computer network is created.  Using twisted pair, the ports of various devices are connected to the LAN connectors.  As a rule, there are 4 such nests in routers and they are yellow. </p><p>  In some cases, at the final stage, the MFP, printers, additional <span>network drive</span> and modem are connected to the USB port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="businessinformationgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setup wifi router tp link" class="if uuid-2338554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338554.jpg"></div><h2>  Reconfiguring the network host shell </h2><p>  If the router is provided by the provider, then its shell is configured, and there is no need to make any changes to it.  It is only enough to carry out switching and turn on the device. </p><p>  Well, in the case of using a conventional router, you must properly adjust its parameters.  To do this, after turning on the network point, you need to connect any wireless device to it.  In this case, the access code and SSID can be specified on the sticker from the router. </p><p>  After establishing a connection, launch the browser and go to the address of the router.  This is usually 192.168.1.1.  But there may also be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.10.1.  In any case, this information, like a password with a login to gain access to the parameters of the router, can be clarified in the instruction manual.  After navigating to the address of the network point, we enter the previously specified values.  Next, in the interface that opens, you need to set the following parameters: </p><ol><li>  WAN / Ethernet Tab: Connection Type, Address Assignment Method, and Subnet Mask. </li><li>  WiFi tab: the new name of the wireless network, the connection code to it and the type of encryption WPA2. </li></ol><p>  After each change, the parameters must be saved.  Actually, on this, the WiFi D-Link 300 setup, and not only, is over.  Now you can exit the network point configuration interface. </p><h2>  Testing </h2><p>  At the end of the software configuration of the network node, it is necessary to check its operability.  To do this, activate the WiFi transmitter on any device, wait for the connection to be established and launch the browser on it.  After that, open any information resource from the global web in the last window. </p><p>  If after this the site appeared, then everything is in order.  Otherwise, it is necessary to additionally check the switching and parameters.  After that, re-check the operability of the created computer network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sts.wustl.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="setup wifi router tp link" class="if uuid-2338558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338558.jpg"></div><h2>  User Feedback </h2><p>  Setting up a WiFi router is a very simple task, and even a novice user can handle it.  The widespread appearance of such devices has fundamentally changed life.  Most owners of mobile systems can no longer imagine their life without a global web.  The Internet is gradually replacing television, radio, newspapers and magazines.  In any case, the future lies with him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.startech.com.bd" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.startech.com.bd/mi-router-3"><img itemprop="image" alt="setting mi wifi router" class="if uuid-2338559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2338559.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this little material, general instructions for setting up a WiFi router were provided.  By following its recommendations, you can configure most of these network devices without any problems.  Moreover, any specialist is able to cope with such a task. </p>
