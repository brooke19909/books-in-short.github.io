And even if the product for an adult look does not quite resemble the declared object, children's imagination easily makes up for such a trifle.  There are many ideas that children will surely like and which they will be able to realize on their own.  One of such wonderful ideas is a sheep made of cotton buds. </p><p>  There are several options for creating this cute animal, which allows you to use exactly the material that is available in your work.  For such crafts, you can take cotton buds or cotton wool, cardboard, glue or plasticine, clothespins or simple twigs from a tree.  Once the necessary material is selected, it is very easy to create a wonderful toy through simple manipulations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton swine sheep" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/362126.jpg" width="561"></div>

    <h2>  Option one </h2><p>  To make a sheep from cotton buds, you will need glue, hygienic sticks, cardboard and a felt-tip pen from the listed list.  First, an oval frame is made, which is abundantly lubricated with glue, and on it, starting from the edge of the body, fill the entire space with cut cotton balls, filling the wooden edges with glue.  Moving to the neck of the future sheep, the circle is closed.  Then a small oval for the face is cut out of the cardboard, ears and a forelock are attached to it.  On the blank draw a mouth, eyes and nose and stick the head to the base.  After the main part has dried out well, it is turned over and halves of wooden clothespins are fastened from the wrong side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Second option </h2><p>  Craft "sheep" from cotton buds can be made in another way, namely with the help of plasticine.  This option is suitable for the smallest masters.  The essence of this work is that instead of glue, plasticine is attached to the frame and shortened hygienic sticks are inserted into it.  This process contributes to the <span>development of fine motor skills of the</span> hands, which positively affects the mental development of the baby.  By the same principle, the ears are attached to the frame of the muzzle and the parts are combined.  From the wrong side, with the help of plasticine, wooden sticks are molded, which serve as the legs of the animal.  A lamb from cotton buds made in this way turns out to be a little rough compared to glued crafts, but the process takes much less time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a sheep from cotton buds" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/362129.jpg?1396069060543" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Third option </h2><p>  For creativity, you can use not only sticks, but also ordinary cotton wool.  Such a sheep will come out very fluffy and tender.  For such work, many small balls are made of cotton wool, which are glued with PVA glue to the oval frame.  A head with a painted muzzle is attached to the finished body of the animal.  For legs, you can use either twigs or stripes of brown cardboard. </p><h2>  Where to use the craft? </h2><p>  <span>A cotton swab sheep</span> can be used for the most unexpected purposes.  On a child‚Äôs birthday, such a cute little thing is great for plates with guests' names arranged on plates, so that all the guests are seated in their places.  At the end of the holiday, everyone will be able to pick up such a craft as a memorable gift. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="craft of a stick of cotton buds" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/362131.jpg?1396069371043" width="600"></div>  Also, a lamb from cotton buds can be used to decorate a Christmas tree.  In this case, you need to stick a ribbon to it to use the product as a pendant.  In addition, the manufacture of such crafts can be a good entertainment for children at the holiday.  However, in order to craft a little, a special occasion is not necessary.  The creative process is so enthralling that, having created a new toy pet with your own hands, you can start a house and a feeding trough, because these attributes will be needed for an interesting game.  And if we develop this topic further, then the child may have a desire to create his own toy farm.
