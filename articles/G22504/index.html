The construction of modern residential complexes equipped with all necessary infrastructure is underway.  In addition, they are also located in ecologically clean areas. <br><br>  In demand <noindex>  <span>sale of new buildings in the queen</span> </noindex>  , about a third of the territory of which are squares, parks and green recreation areas.  If you are concerned about your child’s education, then in the city, in addition to more than thirty-five kindergartens, there are nineteen schools and several higher educational institutions.  In addition, there are three stadiums and six pools, children can professionally engage in football and mountain climbing.  You can get to Moscow either by minibus, or by bus to the VDNH metro station, or by the Sputnik high-speed train. <br><br>  Literally a few kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road and Elk Island, the Golden Gate residential complex was rebuilt.  In high-rise buildings - from seventeen to twenty-five floors - one-, two- and three-room apartments have an improved layout, equipped with balconies and loggias, garbage chutes, devices for disinfection and washing, as well as high-speed elevators.  The windows are equipped with double-glazed windows. <br><br>  Near the houses are sports fields, as well as secure parking.  The adjacent area is decorated with lawns and flower beds.  Outdoor lighting in the dark turns on automatically. <br><br>  No less promising is now considered the LCD "Belaya Dacha" in Kotelniki.  The nearest metro station is ten minutes away by bus or taxi.  Nearby is the Kuzminsky Forest Park.  In complex <noindex>  <span>white cottage apartment for sale</span> </noindex>  It is invariably in demand, as in the first floors of houses there are household services, shops, beauty salons and fitness centers.  Monolithic brick buildings are perfectly adapted for life: the apartments have high ceilings, spacious kitchens and bathrooms.  The area of ​​housing varies from eighty-five to one hundred and thirteen square meters. <br><br>  Developers offer to buy one-, two- or three-room apartments at prices significantly lower than the capital.  At the same time, the level of comfort is several times higher than some areas of Moscow.  Since the construction of houses in the residential complex is still ongoing, parallel with it is the improvement of house territories: playgrounds are being equipped, flowerbeds and lawns are being destroyed. </p></div></article>
