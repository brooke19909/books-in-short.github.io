What did the creation of economic councils lead to?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Soviet Union has undergone many changes in all spheres throughout its existence.  Take, for example, the fact that the emergence of the USSR is a consequence of reform: thinking, the worldview of the population, the reorganization of behavior and the perception of one's own position.  Since at the time of the emergence of the new state, most of the inhabitants were simple peasants and workers, the main changes concerning the life of the countries as a whole concerned the national economy. </p><p>  The stages of creating economic councils did not always go smoothly.  Also, their continued successful existence was not logical.  This is confirmed by the repeated introduction of this body, its constant restructuring and, as a result, the annulment of this institution completely, up to our time.  Although now the authorities are again thinking about returning to such a practice, the truth is, under a different name. </p><h2>  What are economic councils </h2><p>  <span>These are the tips of the national economy</span> that were created for local government.  They first appeared after October 1917 and were subordinate to the Supreme Economic Council under the SNR, which, in turn, in 1918 was under the control of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the <span>Council of People's Commissars of the</span> RSFSR.  The main task of the committees of the economic council was to ensure the policy of the Supreme Economic Council on the ground.  Such bodies were created in provinces, regions and even districts.  Since the creation of the economic councils, it included elected workers, party members, whose candidatures were approved at the respective meetings. </p>

In addition, he monitored the implementation of plans and assignments in the underlying organizations, determined the necessary amount of raw materials, fuel for each individual district.

Each of them consisted of 14 branches, which dealt with the settlement of issues of various types - from practical (for example, minerals and metal processing) to organizational (for example, bank issues). </p><p>  The economic councils were able to strengthen their influence through a nationalization policy.  This meant that the more enterprises on the balance sheet of the state, the more resources are at the disposal of this authority. </p><p>  But after a couple of years, the creation of economic councils turned out to be practically meaningless, in view of the course towards decentralization of management.  Such a clear hierarchy, led by the Supreme Economic Council, was no longer necessary. </p><p>  Most of the districts were liquidated, and the regional ones were reorganized and renamed into people's commissariats. </p><h2>  Second wave </h2><p>  After liquidation for the first time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãre-creating the economic councils comes to Nikita Khrushchev.  It is worth noting that this general secretary is generally considered one of the main reformers of the Soviet Union.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrestoring the structure arose with the aim of improving the organization of construction and industry management. </p>

In fact, this was a new form of management, therefore its appearance raised several important issues, namely: <span>legal status</span> and legislative base, hierarchy and structure of the body.

In most cases, the territory of the hotel region was identical to the borders of the region. </p><p>  There was one industry in the competence of an individual economic council, which made it possible not to disperse the attention of one organ to several types of industry. </p><h2>  Board structure </h2><p>  Economic councils had a sectoral nature of activity.  That is, their competence did not go beyond the framework of a separate industry or construction, agriculture, trade, and so on. </p><p>  This body was not subordinate to any departmental body, although it largely depended on the State Plan of individual republics and the USSR as a whole.  Funding for the functioning and creation of economic councils (the year it appeared - 1957) was fully provided by the state.  Although often some expense items covered enterprises that were directly controlled by the organization.  But this was decided at the state level. </p><p>  In order to attract workers to the management of industry, it was decided to create councils as an advisory body.  The beginning of the creation of the economic councils was marked by the active participation of the workers. </p>

    <h2>  Workers Council </h2><p>  It would seem that the stream of <span>rationalization proposals</span> from ordinary employees is good, but any idea required weighty arguments and research.  Otherwise, she risked being left without a real embodiment.  Then it was decided to include scientists in the council first.  This led to the fact that decisions taken at the meeting were always considered by higher authorities.  Accordingly, they were positioned as more authoritative. </p><p>  As a result of this, some Councils at enterprises became famous and a new type of competition arose - the battle for the best rational offers.  Those ideas that were approved by their superiors were implemented in production facilities across the country with a mention of the author or team.  The portrait was hung on the honor board, and the worker became a certain celebrity.  Although there was no material incentive as such and could not be at that time in view of the popular egalitarianism. </p>

    <h2>  Liquidation of ministries </h2><p>  The creation of economic councils year after year diminished the role of ministries, and some of them were hastily liquidated.  Management of the economy was now carried out on a territorial basis, based on the distribution of borders between regions on the basis of many natural factors.  Borders of regions coincided most often with the boundaries of regions and economic regions. </p><p>  The liquidation of ministries and the creation of economic councils ensured an increase in the role of a separate republic in the all-Union economy. </p><p>  In addition, this distribution of power made it possible to quickly solve many problems on the spot and bring management closer to production directly.  Despite the fact that the second time the creation of economic councils and provided good results, the program did not last long - only 8 years.  One of the reasons for the abolition of such an organization of the economy was the <span>resignation of Khrushchev</span> in the 64th year.  Along with this, many other reforms were canceled. </p>

    <h2>  Sabotage reform </h2><p>  Decentralization of power was designed to ensure that the positions and capabilities of regional committee secretaries were to increase several times.  The stronger the small link is held, the more the chain will withstand.  In addition, Nikita Khrushchev himself gained more control over industry, which meant strengthening his own positions. </p><p>  Many people's commissars openly opposed the introduction of reform.  Such as Kaganovich did not comment on the situation at all, but simply openly ignored it. </p><p>  This is due to several facts.  First: the liquidation of branch ministries and the creation of economic councils meant the dismissal of many high-ranking political figures.  Second: the people's commissars and other party elite sought to control the secretary general and manipulate him in every way.  The same Nikita Sergeyevich for a long time did not take seriously, considering almost a court jester. </p>

    <h2>  Successful Implementation: Reasons </h2><p>  Despite obstacles, a program was introduced.  And its normal functioning was ensured thanks to the system of punishments and rewards.  Simply put, the creation of economic councils has taken the first step from derogatory equalization to justice.  Each enterprise was given a supply plan and the required <span>production rate.</span>  If the necessary minimum is not met, then radical measures were taken - dismissal.  It is worth considering that such methods were not always objective. </p><p>  If <span>good reasons</span> affected the disruption of the plan <span>,</span> then the culprit suffered. </p><h2>  The abolition of economic councils </h2><p>  The main reason for the liquidation of this body lies in the irrational use of resources.  Some areas tried to knock out as many funds from the center as possible by submitting applications with a description of the fact of non-existent difficulties. </p>

It‚Äôs like a separate food position: there are separate products in different plates.  But for salad they need to be mixed.  So it was in the industry of that time: the delay of one material due to errors in the leadership of the region led to the suspension of work in another.  Example: an episode from the movie ‚ÄúQueen of the gas station‚Äù, when they could not collect the necessary materials for the construction of the bridge.
