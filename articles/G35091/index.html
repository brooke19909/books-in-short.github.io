Shopping along with ordering services on the Internet has long become a part of modern life.  And here you can not do without plastic and already familiar to all Visa cards, and, in addition, Mastercard.  The main thing to know about shopping planning is how to use them correctly.  You need to be aware of where the special code for security is located.  Actually, it is entered to confirm the operation online, as well as when conducting a banking transaction on the network (whether it is a money transfer along with the issuance of quick loans and so on).  Not everyone knows where the security code is on the map. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mcall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="security code on the mastercard where is located" class="if uuid-3178255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178255.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  The security code indicated on the plastic card is needed in order to verify its authenticity in the process of purchasing goods or ordering services on the Internet.  This three-digit secret code has better-known names - CVV2 or CVC2.  What is its location on the cards of different payment systems? </p><p>  With various names, its purpose is always the same - it is an additional security element that ensures the safety of payments in the network or in any other remote way (without the presence of the card and its owner during payment). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This special cipher was specially designed to confirm whether the person is the owner of the card, and whether he really performs the operation.  It also identifies it in the banking system, where information appears on the holder of the corresponding plastic, its validity period, and the absence of restrictions on operations. </p><p>  Where is the security code on the Visa card?  You need to know that it is not always on plastic.  It is not applied to some type of cards, because they simply are not intended for operations on the Internet.  When it comes to Visa, then the code is only on Gold, Classic.  For MasterCard, it needs Standart plastic, as well as cards with a higher status.  Often there are contentious issues when payment on the Internet is impossible due to the lack of a three-digit code. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the security code on the bank card" class="if uuid-3178248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178248.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the security code on the map? </h2><p>  In fact, everything is very simple.  The discussed digital code combination is located on the back of the payment instrument, in the zone of the signature field of the holder.  The decryption in this case speaks for itself: Card Verification Value.  Such symbols were added to easily verify plastic cards for authenticity.  This is another way to protect against fakes, theft and the use of personal savings without the knowledge of the owner of the credit card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  More specifically, CVV is designed to protect any ongoing cashless transactions.  There is an additional security guard to guard online transactions.  It's about CVV2 code. </p><p>  There is a myth that CVV is available only on credit cards, but this is not at all.  It will always be possible to find the treasured three digits on credit or debit plastics, which belong to all payment systems: Mastercard, Visa, Maestro and so on. </p><h2>  Where is the security code on the card of Sberbank? </h2><p>  This information is requested mainly during the execution of operations remotely (via the Internet).  Customers often confuse passwords and security codes.  Of course, because of this, the operation is rejected. </p><p>  The PIN code is not a security symbol for Visa or Maestro cards.  Confusing them is strictly not recommended.  Such an error can lead to the discovery of the necessary information for attackers. </p><p>  So where is the security code on the bank card?  Each type of plastic from Sberbank has its own personal codes, which are also located on the back of the payment instrument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.barclays.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the security code on the sberbank card" class="if uuid-3178250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178250.jpg"></div><h2>  Visa and Mastercard </h2><p>  Customers often ask where the security code is on the Visa card. </p><p>  The encrypted three-digit code is generated using special programs (in this case, a complex algorithm of a random combination of numbers is used).  It is applied in the form of codes CVC2 and CVV2. </p><p>  They are usually located on the back in the upper right corner or a special magnetic tape is applied, where the signature of the holder is displayed.  The code is printed on a white box at the end of the strip, immediately after the digital combination of the plastic itself.  Sometimes there is only a security code. </p><p>  VISA International prints the so-called CVV2 on its plastics.  And MasterCard protects payment documents with CVC2.  Note that these two ciphers, in fact, do not differ in anything from each other, the difference is only in the name of the identifiers.  By the way, the CVC2 and CVV2 security technologies in the world are recognized as one of the most reliable, since they are not inferior to many banking identification systems by the owner and card verification algorithms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.questionmaroc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the security code on the map" class="if uuid-3178251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178251.jpg"></div><p>  Where is the security code on the Mastercard?  In the same place as the "Visa" system. </p><h2>  What to indicate during purchases and banking operations: PIN or CVC2? </h2><p>  It should be understood that even bank employees cannot require a customer to name payment plastic pin codes.  For purchases and financial transactions, only the security code is required.  It is worth paying attention that even on sites it is entered in the form of a cipher (we are talking about black dots).  This was done for added protection, so that the information in the browser‚Äôs memory is by no means saved. </p><h2>  Do not use dubious resources </h2><p>  Do not enter security codes on dubious resources whose connections are not recognized as reliable.  If the client is required to scan the card, it is necessary to cover the code position field with paper, otherwise the person risks that they will take up pleasant shopping instead. </p><div class="photo" data-original="epiphany29.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="security code" class="if uuid-3178252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178252.jpg"></div><h2>  Safety rules for the use of bank plastics </h2><p>  Many cardholders have already experienced the activity of fraudsters in the field of electronic payments.  A fairly large number of attackers use the most sophisticated methods designed to steal payment data.  Such people are usually almost invisible, and also do not stand out from the crowd.  Use the card very carefully when withdrawing cash or in the process of paying for purchases in stores.  Consider the main rules for safety of use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.unicreditbulbank.bg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the security code on the visa card" class="if uuid-3178253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3178253.jpg"></div><p>  You should never tell outsiders the information indicated on the plastic.  This rule applies especially to security codes.  But some Internet services and payment systems (for example, WebMoney) legally require cardholders to send a scan of a copy of the front side of the plastic, where there is no security code, but the number and validity period are displayed.  In this case, the basic protective information does not fall into the hands of attackers and you need to know about it. </p><p>  The security code, just like a scan of the inside of the card, cannot be passed on to anyone, even in situations where the interlocutors appear to be bank employees (fraudsters often do this). </p><p>  We examined where the security code is located on the map. </p>
