    <p>  The device has a long handle, on one end of which there is an engine, and on the other - a cutting mechanism.  There are two types of trimmers: gasoline and electric.  To find out which trimmer is better, you need to familiarize yourself with the characteristics of each type. </p><p>  What is an electric trimmer, easy to guess.  It can operate from the network, produces little noise, does not require fuel, is considered an environmentally friendly device, since it does not produce <span>exhaust gases.</span>  But it is strictly forbidden to work with him in the rain or after rain so that there is no <span>electric shock.</span>  In this case, the electric trimmer has a small power.  He should be given more rest to avoid overheating, and the engine must be constantly energized or recharged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which trimmer to choose" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9039/15072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is a gas trimmer, you can find out by carefully studying the instructions.  This device works autonomously, only you need to refuel it.  Gasoline trimmer has many nozzles, which expands its capabilities.  At the same time, it is very noisy and has harmful exhausts.  When choosing a gas trimmer, you should consider that for it you need a supply of fuel and good engine care.  Which trimmer to choose is up to you. </p><p>  Before starting the mechanism, you must read the instructions.  If you follow the rules of operation, the tool will last a long time.  After use, the trimmer must be cleaned and stored in a dry place where there is no dirt and dust. </p><p>  Trimmers differ from each other by cutting heads.  There may be a knife or fishing line at the end.  There are also trimmers with alternate use of a knife and fishing line.  The handle is T-shaped and D-shaped.  The T-shaped is used for mowing in large spaces, and the D-shaped is very convenient for working in hard-to-reach places, along paths, near bushes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which trimmer is better" class="if" height="271" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9039/15071.jpg" width="600"></div>
