In the tourism business, a similar nuance is often encountered when the location of a provincial hotel is distorted.  In reality, Ipsos Hotel 3 * is located not in Kemer, but in the village of Beldibi, 30 km away from it.  Unfortunately, some young tourists who want to relax in the noisy, club, disco Kemer, having arrived at the hotel, are surprised: ‚ÄúBut he is in the province!‚Äù </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ipsos hotel 3 kemer" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1454439.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such a small cheat is used in their work by tour operators in order to attract more customers.  They consider it normal.  The laws of business are often incomprehensible.  Today we‚Äôll talk in more detail about the Ipsos Hotel 3 * hotel (Turkey, <span>Kemer, Beldibi).</span> </p><h2>  Who is convenient for the hotel complex? </h2><p>  According to its spa specialization, Ipsos Hotel attracts families with children or elderly people with the possibilities of a calm, measured, predictable and comfortable stay.  The hotel complex can be classified as corresponding to the economy class.  The price of the tour for a couple staying in a double room for 7 nights is about $ 440. </p><p>  The terrain here is mountainous, overgrown with pine trees.  The village got its name from the four-kilometer small river Beldibi, which, by the way, dries up in the hot Turkish summer.  The beaches in the vicinity of the hotel complex are pebble.  Although hotel owners bring sand here before each holiday season, this cannot change the nature of the beaches, and we continue to observe the pebble coastal strip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, the surroundings of Beldibi are picturesque due to the work of its residents who have grown orchards here.  And the hotel under consideration has its own know-how.  In the neighborhood with him, his owners are holding a farm.  So in the mornings, hotel guests hear roosters singing.  Therefore, if the owner of Ipsos Hotel decided to choose an emblem for his business, then this loud morning singer would surely be depicted on it. </p><h2>  About the holiday season in Kemer </h2><p>  Tourists in the vicinity of Kemer are attracted by romantic mixed mountain and sea landscapes, fresh air, drier than the classic sea.  Kemer as a resort operates from April to October, but is most favorable for us, residents of temperate latitudes, in the velvet season.  At this time, during the day, the air temperature warms up to an average of 24 ¬∞ C during the day, and water - up to 21 ¬∞ C. For the locals who are accustomed to heat, it is cold, but for us it is just right, especially this time is suitable for children and the elderly.  Weather in Kemer in the month of October is not the only trump card of the velvet season. </p>

    <p>  October is attractive for tourists in October for another reason.  Turkish stores in the second month of autumn hold an action - reducing prices for summer assortment.  Many tourists take the opportunity to buy good-quality products of light industry at <span>bargain prices.</span>  However, it is wise to buy a tour to these places not for a full month, because the weather <span>in Kemer in October,</span> in its last decade, becomes rainy, windy, non-resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, a vacation in these places in mid-May also has its charms.  At this time, local citrus and <span>pomegranate gardens</span> bloom <span>.</span>  They are fragrant, they are beckoning.  A lovely pastime will be a tea party in a flowering garden. </p><h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  The three-story hotel building of the third-line hotel, comprising 45 rooms, is located on a landscaped area of ‚Äã‚Äã1000 m <sup>2</sup> .  The interior and exterior decoration of the building is dominated by white and pastel yellow. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are quite different, there are compact single, double and even triple.  However, as practice has shown, at the request of a vacationer, he will always be moved to a more spacious room.  Two outdoor outdoor pools of the hotel (for adults and children) are always tidied up and the water in them is purified.  Dining at Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Kemer) is made in the hotel restaurant and partially in the bar. </p><p>  Client rooms are furnished according to the principle of minimalism.  Wide windows provide ample natural light.  They are provided with necessary appliances. </p><p>  The hotel restaurant is stylish and affordable.  She is very comfortable. </p><p>  The hotel's public areas - restaurant, reception, terrace - are neat and tidy.  The restaurant is located both inside the building and in the pavilion attached to the building. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2><p>  Beldibi settlement is geographically close not only to Kemer.  However, the distance from it to the city center of Antalya is about the same - 25 km.  Its central street is tidy and smart.  There are shops and cafes.  However, even a few blocks away, the gloss of the resort disappears and the peeled walls of the houses and piles of garbage appear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The hotel's hotel business is a family business, and it has its own characteristics in terms of food.  If you have not forgotten, a tourist pays a little over $ 200 for a weekly stay at the hotel.  Accordingly, basic nutrition is more suitable for lovers of vegetable dishes.  We wrote a similar warning about this hotel after a careful analysis of tourists' notes about its visit.  Obviously not intended for lovers of "eating pounds" hotel Hotel Ipsos 3 *.  Reviews characterize him with the words "safe", "comfortable" and "home".  This hotel is not famous for the abundance of meat and fish in portions.  Also, strong drinks are not served here.  However, chicken, turkey, fish are always there.  Abundantly on the menu there are vegetable dishes, side dishes, fruits.  Nobody is hungry. </p><p>  If you are satisfied with this criterion, then the menu of the Ipsos Hotel 3 * hotel (Kemer) will suit you.  If you are interested in gastronomic delights, pay extra and buy a tour at a more expensive hotel.  Well, if you still consider yourself a gourmet of meat and fish dishes, then you can organize lunch for yourself in Beldibi cafes without any special expenses.  The average price of a serving of soup or side dish is $ 3, shawarma costs $ 2, barbecue - $ 5, a glass of pomegranate fresh - $ 1. </p><p>  The classic Turkish menu can be enjoyed in the Lotus Restaurant, the Barbecue Cafe will pleasantly surprise its visitors with variety and seasonings, the Sunset Restaurant is good for its fish dishes. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Among tourists there are always those who prefer to relax in small private hotels to stay in the averaged conditions of standardized multi-star hotel complexes.  In fact, in a large hotel, you may be served a large piece of meat on a plate, but there, by and large, nobody needs you.  Another thing is a provincial hotel, where each client is treated like a guest who came to the house, where the staff radiates goodwill and takes part in you. </p>

    <p>  And the tea party in the orange garden evokes emotions that are not comparable to being under a painted canvas umbrella with a plastic cup in hand.  Undoubtedly, the Ipsos Hotel Beldibi 3 * hotel has its own aura.  He has his regular customers - tourists who come here season after season. </p><p>  From Beldibi it makes sense to go on excursions.  Not far away lie the ruins of the Lycian city of Phaselis.  The ramparts and towers of the ancient port have been preserved.  Ancient legends say that somewhere here Alexander the Great is buried. </p><p>  Not far from Beldibi is another resort village - Goynuk, buried in pomegranate and orange gardens.  A river flows past him, forming a picturesque canyon.  There are many great cafes here. </p><p>  The picturesque landscape forms one of the highest mountains in Turkey - Tahtalƒ±. </p><h2>  Territory, beach </h2><p>  A true decoration of the hotel is the citrus garden, adapted for walking around it.  Resting, tourists enjoy fruit trees (lemon, tangerine, orange), chic palm trees, bright flowering shrubs.  The hotel‚Äôs own pebble beach is two hundred meters from it.  It is equipped with serviceable and comfortable trestle beds and umbrellas. </p><p>  The road to the beach is picturesque.  She walks past the orange and pomegranate trees.  Pebble beach Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Turkey) is not large.  Children run around it, frolic - you can‚Äôt catch up.  The debate about what is best for health - sand or pebbles - is eternal.  It's no secret that tourists traditionally prefer sandy beaches, but therapists at this time talk about the benefits of massaging pebbles of the feet, which positively affects the internal organs of a person. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The number of negative reviews written about the rooms of Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Turkey) is surprising.  The most interesting thing is that this is a clear lie.  The hotel complex really corresponds to the three-star level.  It is designed for various categories of vacationers.  In addition to single and double, there are also 3 * triple rooms in Ipsos Hotel. </p>

    <p>  The spacious rooms have new furniture, fresh towels, a hairdryer, a TV with Russian channels, and good air conditioning.  Beds, bedside tables, mirrors are quite modern, not worn out.  Cleaning is done thoroughly and daily.  Beds and towels are replaced every five days. </p><p>  The bathroom is clean, equipped with toilet paper, liquid soap.  Hot and cold water available around the clock. </p><h2>  Separately about Wi-Fi </h2><p>  Paid pleasure (1 hour - 1 dollar) is Wi-Fi in the Hotel Ipsos 3 * hotel.  Reviews of experienced tourists, however, suggest how to "get this misfortune" to get around and enjoy the World Wide Web for many hours.  The technology is simple: after you have paid a ‚Äúvan dollar‚Äù, a hotel employee will enter you a secret password.  As practice shows, he does not uncheck the box in the "Remember password" field.  Therefore, having returned to the number and rebooting your PC, you again find yourself on the Internet.  Thus, your free Wi-Fi service fee will be $ 1 for the entire tour. </p><h2>  Politeness as the key to a comfortable stay </h2><p>  We immediately notice one small detail.  If you have already had a rest in a family hotel, you know a small sign: if you want your vacation to really be a success, make some efforts to build friendly relations with your owners.  First, smile and respect their work.  If you are used to treating the people serving you as purely consumer, to walk past them with a stone face and, for the slightest reason, throw a scandal, then Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Kemer) is not suitable for you. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, although the majority of Beldibi residents speak and understand Russian well, they like their native greeting more.  Say them ‚Äúmerhaba‚Äù (more formal) or ‚Äúselyam‚Äù (friendly, informal), ‚Äúgunaydin‚Äù (‚Äúgood morning‚Äù), ‚Äúiyi akshamlar‚Äù (‚Äúgood evening‚Äù).  With such a vocabulary you, of course, earn the respect of the bartender.  And you will become almost a VIP client when you exchange with him the phrases ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù (‚Äúhow are you‚Äù) and ‚Äúiiyim‚Äù (‚Äúnormal‚Äù).  By the way, a pleasant feature of the hotel is the absence of theft. </p><h2>  The car is not a luxury, but a means of saving </h2><p>  Your excursion program will become more saturated if you rent a car while living in Ipsos Hotel 3 *.  Hotel parking is quite safe and also free. </p><p>  Judge for yourselves: a two-day excursion ‚Äúon its own‚Äù will cost your entire company $ 150, while everyone will pay $ 100 for a two-day bus ride.  Thus, you can visit both Pamukkale and Cappadocia.  There are options for fans of club nightlife.  Young people from this quiet, family-run hotel leave in the evenings to hang out at the Inferno and Crystal clubs in Kemer, in the evening to admire the Burning Mountain, take a swim on Cirali beach next to outlandish turtles. </p><h2>  Where do hotel guests go most often? </h2><p>  In a word, the guests of Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Kemer, Turkey) are frequent guests of Kemer, a city of luxurious boarding houses and cozy family hotels, a seaport, a focus of youth clubs, shops, restaurants.  Here you can visit the dolphinarium, the oriental bazaar, shopping centers, jewelry shops on Ataturk Street. </p><p>  In a place of amazing nature, the Ipsos Hotel 3 * (Turkey) is located.  Its guests are happy to use the bike rental service.  In the area are planted chic pomegranate, orange, lemon orchards.  When the fruits ripen on them, a cyclist should take a backpack with him. </p><h2>  The vicissitudes of trade in Beldibi </h2><p>  The trade of Beldibi village is concentrated on Ataturk street.  However, despite the wide range of jewelery, fur coats, souvenirs, most of them are fakes.  Sellers are frankly cheating, overpricing. </p>
