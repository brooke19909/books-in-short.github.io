Beautiful places of Bashkiria</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Small, but possessing natural charm, Bashkiria is able to surprise the most experienced traveler.  As if there are few mountains, lakes and rivers of extraordinary beauty, the second largest spring in the world (the Red Key) is located here.  The first, Fontaine de Vaucluse, is located in France and consumes 17 m <sup>3 of</sup> water per second, while its Bashkir "brother" is only a few cubic meters behind (14.3 m <sup>3</sup> / s). </p><p>  Thousands of tourists come to it every year to see the power of a spring spurting from an unimaginable depth, since there are still breathtakingly beautiful natural monuments nearby. </p><h2>  Rich in area attractions </h2><p>  The Nurimanovsky district of Bashkiria was distinguished by several natural monuments, each of which is unique in its own way.  For example, a rare relic Ural <span>water nut,</span> listed in the Red Book, grows on Lake Upkankul. </p><p>  In fact, it was made rare, as always, by people.  At one time, he was so mercilessly destroyed for the sake of delicious white pulp that they did not think about the consequences.  Today this lake is the only place where it grows.  To protect him, places with walnut thickets are fenced, and he makes sure that they are not disturbed, by a forester, for whom a hut was built right on the shore. </p><p>  The leaves of the water nut look very much like birch, and they cover the water surface with a dense carpet.  At the end of August - September, the nut ripens, which sinks to the bottom, and in the spring takes root and grows a long stem to the very surface. </p>

    <p>  Lake Upkankul is very rich in fish, therefore, as in many other beautiful water places of Bashkiria, a path is trodden here by fishermen, and its shore is rarely empty.  For this, a forester is needed, who strictly monitors that there are no violators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The spring of Krasny Klyuch in the Nurimanovsky district could overshadow all other natural monuments in its uniqueness, as it combines several wonders at once. </p><h2>  Spring </h2><p>  Not every karst funnel formed by the <span>failure of the soil</span> due to undermining of groundwater, causes the formation of a source. </p><p>  The spring of Krasny Klyuch (Bashkortostan) originates immediately from under two powerful <span>karst funnels</span> connected to each other.  The depth of one of them is 38 m, the second is 20 meters, and the length and width of the lake located in them, which feeds the key with its waters, are 170 and 190 m. </p><p>  There, underground, over the course of 60 km, the Yaman-Yelgi River flows, which, having taken its origin on Mount Karatau, ‚Äúhides‚Äù most of its waters underground, then to bring them to the surface along with the waters of the <span>karst lake.</span>  Water boiling is impressive, and cavers can only dream that the river deepened even more or changed its course, then they would get the longest underground corridor in the world. </p>

    <p>  The waters that erode the soil and come to the surface like the spring of the Red Key, carry the rocks and minerals that make them up, which makes the water drinking and healing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Water composition </h2><p>  Scientists who studied the water of the unique key were not too lazy to calculate that every second it brings to the surface 1 kg of limestone, although in its composition it is hydrocarbon-calcium.  A large amount of lime gives it a whitish hue, so from ancient times this source of drinking water was called the White Key until Soviet power came to these places.  Its representatives did not like the name, reminiscent of the White Guard counter, and therefore the source was renamed Red in 1917, although it has nothing to do with this color. </p>

    <p>  Despite the abundance of lime, the water at the source is tasty and healthy, and proof of this is its bottling at the mill, opened on the site of a paper mill, closed back in the 70s.  It is sold in stores under the name "Red Key" and is well known in Bashkiria. </p><h2>  Rest on the spring lake </h2><p>  The spring of Krasny Klyuch is located in a picturesque area and is surrounded by hills and forests, which makes it attractive for picnics and camping.  Although the constant water temperature of +5 degrees does not favor swimming, the crystal clear surface of the spring, the clear air, the presence of berries and mushrooms in the forest and the absence of numerous tourists make it truly interesting for outdoor recreation. </p><p>  Here in August every year divers ‚Äôcompetitions take place, as diving to its bottom requires effort and training.  According to divers, at a depth of 40 meters begins a very strong head of water.  This is the Yaman-Yelgi River tearing out from underground imprisonment.  Along with the flow of water towards the divers, stones are carried that pose a serious threat to life, so diving into the spring of Krasny Klyuch is a serious test, which the judges of the competitions evaluate. </p><p>  If you stop to rest in a tent on the banks of the spring, the sunsets will leave the greatest impression.  It is at this time of day that light fog settles on the spring, completely transforming the terrain. </p><p>  In winter, it is also worth coming to these beautiful places of Bashkiria.  The fact is that the source never freezes, and with it below its mouth and <span>the Ufa river</span> remains free of ice for as much as 13 km. </p>

    <p>  This allows local ducks not to fly to warmer climes and winter at home.  They respond extremely gratefully to top dressing, so bird lovers have the right place here. </p><p>  Only 120 km from Ufa, on the left bank of the river of the same name, is located the spring of Krasny Klyuch.  How to get to it by car?  It will not be difficult.  Route - Ufa ‚Äì Shaksha ‚Äì Iglino ‚Äì Krasnaya Gorka ‚Äì Chandar ‚Äì Krasny Klyuch settlement.  It can also be reached by bus. </p><h2>  Pavlovsk reservoir </h2><p>  Visiting the Nurimanovsky district for the sake of the Red Key, you can at the same time see the sights closest to it.  For example, the Pavlovsk reservoir is the favorite resting place of the Bashkirs.  With its length of 150 km and a width of 770 to 1750 m, there is enough space for everyone: those who like to live outdoors in a tent, and fishermen, and lovers of diving and spearfishing. </p>

    <p>  The banks of the Pavlovsk reservoir are rugged, many of them are rocky, but you can quite comfortably settle in the forests surrounding it, which also will not disappoint lovers of mushrooms and berries.  In the reservoir there are bream and tench, pike perch and ide, catfish and pike, perch, chub and burbot. </p><h2>  Sarva Spring Lake </h2><p>  Another spring lake in the Nurimanov district is called Sarva.  It is very small, only 60 m long and 30 m wide, but deep and cold.  Sarva is also of karst origin and is very beloved by divers who want to uncover the secret of its origin. </p>

    <p>  Around the lake for many tens of kilometers are truly wild places in which people do not live.  The only company operating next to it is engaged in the bottling of its mineral waters under the Sarva brand. </p><h2>  Ski base "Red Key" </h2><p>  This base is located in the village of the same name and is still unfamiliar to skiers, although its only route has a level of rather high complexity.  Developed infrastructure, an interesting slope with turns and swings give hope that in the future this young ski slope will become more popular. </p>
