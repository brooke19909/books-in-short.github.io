    <p>  Where did such diversity come from?  Modern technology is currently being created for various needs.  For example, it is difficult to estimate the mass of a pinch of salt or ground pepper with mechanical devices.  This will help electronic scales designed to weigh products up to 1 kg, for example.  Unfortunately, there are practically no universal models, you have to choose specifically for your needs.  As for the appearance, form, the presence of various additional functions, here too there are some nuances.  Let's look at good models for the various needs of the hostess. </p><h2>  Round scales Rolsen KS-2914 </h2><p>  Often, housewives ask the question: ‚ÄúWe need a kitchen scale (electronic).  Which are better? ‚Äù  The reviews are given in this article in the form of descriptions, this will help to save a lot of time on studying the material.  We recommend taking a closer look at the Rolsen KS-2914 model.  Why?  Because it is simple in itself, there are no additional functions in it, only weighing, and the quality remains at its best. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic kitchen scales which are better reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1240128.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is perfect for weighing in containers, as there is a tarp compensation function. </p><p>  It should be noted that the platform of the scales is glass, this makes it possible to easily wipe the surface of the device with a damp cloth or a rag at the end of work.  There are touch buttons on the control panel, so be careful. </p><p>  The maximum weight of the product is 5 kg.  There is an overload indicator.  As for the accuracy of the measurement, then, as the manufacturer assures, the error can be no more than 1 gram.  You can measure the volume of fluid. </p><p>  Powered by AAA batteries. </p><h2>  Rectangular scales Bauer KS 48 </h2><p>  If you are not satisfied with round scales, then look at another option: rectangular.  The characteristics are almost the same: the same glass platform, the same measurement accuracy.  The products are measured using electronic scales up to 5 kg, just like the Rolsen KS-2914 model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what good electronic scales" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1240124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If the housewife needs beautiful scales with an interesting design, then she can make a choice in favor of this model, since there are options for different colors, even with drawings.  Many noted the aesthetics of the design. </p><p>  We add that this model is more overall than the previous one: width - 24 centimeters, depth - 18 centimeters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Redmond RS-721 - an unusual model </h2><p>  What is the difference between this model and the previous ones?  First of all, with dimensions: a long rectangular platform.  The weighing limit is 10 kg, many housewives have noted this advantage.  Measurement accuracy is similar to previous models.  The surface of the platform is plastic, non-removable.  The control panel with the display is separate from the platform. </p><p>  What is the difference between this model?  The fact that you can weigh not only food.  Often the owners want to weigh their little pet - a cat or a dog, but square or round scales are not suitable.  The Redmond RS-721 is ideal for such activities. </p><p>  Any household scales (electronic, mechanical) can measure the mass of not only food products, but also various materials, for example, building materials.  Of course, Redmond RS-721 are still kitchen, but if you cover the platform with light film or cellophane, so as not to stain, you can even weigh alabaster. </p><h2>  Stadler Form Scale One SFL.0011: All-in-One </h2><p>  Have you ever dreamed of such a scale that transforms into a watch and a home weather station?  Such a device exists.  Meet the Stadler Form Scale One SFL.0011. </p><p>  So, what does the manufacturer give in the kit?  Of course, in the box there are electronic scales themselves, an instruction manual and settings, a warranty card.  The device is <span>powered</span> by <span>pinky batteries.</span> </p><p>  The maximum weight for which they are designed is 3 kg.  It is possible to consistently weigh products.  There is a timer. </p><p>  The case material is glass, which allows you to wipe the device without problems and hang it on the wall as a clock and weather station upon completion of work.  Mistresses note that it is very convenient to know what temperature and humidity are in the kitchen, what time is it. </p><h2>  About the scales with the Vitesse VS-601 bowl </h2><p>  Some housewives making blanks for the winter weigh a large amount of food.  In such a situation, they ask: ‚ÄúWhat good electronic scales with a bowl can I choose?‚Äù. </p><p>  Let's look at the Vitesse VS-601.  This is a scale with a stainless steel bowl.  The case is also steel.  The volume of the bowl is 2 liters, and the maximum weight of the products should be no more than 5 kg.  There is a clock and a timer on the scale, as well as indications of battery charge and overweight. </p><p>  Not every scale model has a unit conversion.  In this, you can measure products not only in kilograms, but also in pounds.  Those who use English-language sites as a source of recipes appreciated the advantage. </p><h2>  For professional chefs Soehnle 67080 Page Profi </h2><p>  The home-based culinary profession of custom-made cakes is now becoming popular.  As a rule, they are baked in different sizes, but if you need a wedding?  Of course, you should choose the appropriate overall model of the balance.  Let's look at the household electronic balance Soehnle 67080 Page Profi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic scales up to 5 kg" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1240126.jpg" width="443"></div>

    <p>  The maximum model limitation is 15 kilograms.  The platform is quite wide (more than 20 cm in width and depth), which allows you to place the finished cake. </p><p>  The surface of the platform is glass, there are three color options: black, silver, coffee. </p><h2>  About spoon scales </h2><p>  Very small spoon-shaped models are also on sale, which are also called "electronic kitchen scales".  Which are better?  Reviews, unfortunately, are negative.  What is the matter?  As the owners of such spoon-weights write, their measurement accuracy is insufficient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="household electronic scales" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1240127.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Very often, a spoon shows different values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a few seconds.  If you are not a chemist, and you do not need to measure micrograms, then it is better to purchase ordinary electronic scales up to 5 kg. </p><h2>  Calorie Counter Redmond SkyScales 741S </h2><p>  If you are the owner of a smartphone or tablet with Android OS, and you also like to count calories, then this model is ideal for you.  It is enough to download a special application on a smartphone / tablet and establish a connection between the scales and the gadget. </p><p>  Redmond SkyScales 741S has the following characteristics: measurement up to 5 kg, a glass platform and a plastic case, a large display, touch control. </p><p>  So we have examined electronic kitchen scales.  Which are better.  Reviews mark the merits of each model.  Only rating products on the Russian market are presented here, but you need to choose according to your needs. </p>
