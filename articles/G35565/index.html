Most of it is occupied by parks and forests, but the southern coast is reserved for tourists.  Hainan is known as a medical resort.  Local motels offer a variety of water treatments.  The island enjoys no less popularity among divers, since it has long gained fame due to the presence of countless coral reefs in the South China Sea. </p>

    <p>  Mo Blue is a wonderful restaurant where tourists can enjoy the best of Hainan cuisine.  The 24-hour Genoa offers inviting Chinese and Asian food.  But in the Charming Aroma bar, guests can enjoy wines and taste delicious Mediterranean desserts.  There is also a lobby bar. <strong></strong></p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Hotel Wyndham Sanya Bay 5 * has its own beach, but it is not very close.  You can get to him on the shuttle, but, unfortunately, he goes only three times a day, and he should be booked in advance.  This is not entirely convenient.  Therefore, many hotel guests prefer to visit the public beach.  It is located quite close, the only drawback is that on the way to it you have to pass by the cemetery. </p><p>  On its own beach there are only twelve deck chairs and six umbrellas.  In general, it doesn‚Äôt matter where to go swimming, since the coastline is simply huge.  Everywhere the coast is clean.  The water in the sea is almost crystal, algae and jellyfish are extremely rare.  The beaches are good for children, because it takes a very long time to go in the water to get to the depths.  Swimming is comfortable and convenient. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Resting in Wyndham Sanya Bay 5 * (photos are given in the article), you should definitely visit the sights of Hainan Island. </p><p>  The island is considered one of the best resorts throughout the Middle Kingdom.  And once Hainan was a place where they sent to the link of objectionable nobles.  Currently, many have heard of him as a well-known health resort.  Many residents of Siberia and the Far East have long chosen a resort and treat their ailments here.  Do not underestimate the beneficial effects of the warm waters of the South China Sea. </p>

    <p>  Traditional Chinese beaches are very beautiful: azure water, white sand and wonderful palm trees.  But not only the beauty of the coast attracts many tourists here.  Hainan has long been chosen by divers from all over the world.  And the reason for this is the rich underwater world of the South China Sea.  Visibility is twenty meters, and diving is possible throughout the year due to the good mild climate and the complete absence of strong currents.  Very rarely echoes of severe storms reach the island, and then divers relax on the shore, and surfers come to replace them in the sea. </p><p>  <span>Tourists, resting on the</span> island, certainly want to get souvenirs.  The hallmark of Hainan is pearls of various colors.  Also, silk, tea, rhinestone, wood carvings, porcelain are brought from the island. </p><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  Vacationers should visit the Xinglong Valley of Radon Springs.  It is located a hundred kilometers from the town of Sanya.  Since the island is of volcanic origin, an amazing number of thermal springs formed on it.  All of them have temperatures from 45 to 65 degrees.  Such radon sources are very useful for people with diseases of the respiratory system, skin and musculoskeletal system.  In the valley, tourists can also visit the garden of amazing tropical plants.  Sources are surrounded by coconut groves and tea plantations.  The whole valley is filled with chic SPA centers and hotels, medical centers where you can visit wellness treatments. </p><p>  Monkey Island is a favorite place for vacationers.  It is located near the city of Sanya.  The reserve is somewhat unique, as it is the only place in the world where a huge number of monkeys live in natural conditions.  Tourists can reach the island by cable car or boat. </p>

    <p>  No less interesting place for vacationers is the "Butterfly Gorge".  The reserve is located in Yaluvan bay.  On its territory you can not only see a huge number of butterflies, but also admire exotic flowers and plants.  The uniqueness of this place is that there is a rare collection of insects from around the world. </p><h2>  Wyndham Sanya Bay 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I would like to turn to the reviews of tourists who visited it.  In their opinion, the complex is a good place to relax.  It features luxurious, spacious rooms with nice furniture and unusual d√©cor.  Staff clean the apartment daily, updating supplies of detergents. </p><p>  The huge territory of the hotel deserves special praise.  On it you will find three pools, between two of them, in the center, is an island with wonderful lush vegetation, in the shade of which there are three hot tubs with mineral hot water.  And not far away there is a whole mineral pool.  Immersing yourself in hot mineral water after cool ordinary water is an amazing pleasure.  Before breakfast, you can safely swim in complete solitude, enjoying the beautiful magnolias.  Throughout the hotel - luxurious lawns, between which there are paths under the canopy of tropical vegetation.  There is also a real pond with loud frogs, flowering water lilies and goldfish.  You can go to the beach via the underpass. </p><p>  Breakfast is served in several large restaurants.  The food is quite varied, there is a lot of food.  Most of it is focused on the Chinese, but this is not so important, because there is always something to choose.  In addition, there is a supermarket nearby, on the ground floor of which you can buy ready-made food. </p>

    <p>  The complex has a gym, tennis courts, as well as rooms for table tennis.  The hotel rests a lot of Chinese.  Not all of our compatriots are satisfied with their neighborhood, emphasizing their excessive noise. </p><p>  The hotel has attentive and helpful staff, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Hotel Wyndham <strong> </strong>  Sanya <strong> </strong>  Bay 5 * is located near the city.  The center can be reached by the eighth bus (stop - next to the complex).  And there, at the service of vacationers - countless cafes and shops.  Experienced tourists are advised to use the services of local taxis for sightseeing trips.  It is very convenient and practical.  On the island, all taxis are municipal, with fixed prices.  So here you will not be deceived. </p><p>  Particularly noteworthy is the coast with wide beaches.  It is very beautiful in here.  The local waters are rich in wildlife, which is why there are always many divers.  Getting to the beach at the transition is very convenient and fast. </p>

    <p>  Many tourists come to this hotel to undergo procedures in neighboring medical institutions, but even the hotel has its own Jacuzzi and mineral water pool. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Wyndham <strong> </strong>  Sanya <strong> </strong>  Bay is a cheap five-star hotel located on the coast.  What distinguishes this complex from many similar hotels is the beautiful and well-groomed green area, where you can always walk.  The hotel can be recommended as a place to stay on Hainan Island for those people who value comfort, but at the same time do not want to overpay. </p>
