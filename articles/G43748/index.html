But if you want to get complete peace and relaxation, then there is probably no better place for this. </p>

    <p>  Here the family and the <span>couple in love,</span> and the hermit man who is tired of the bustle of the big city, will rest.  Many people who visit the Palmira Beach Resort Spa call its villas a paradise.  Maybe there really was a garden of Eden somewhere here? </p><p>  By the way, most visitors to this hotel claim that they liked everything.  We recommend visiting this resort! </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Phan Thiet is a resort town where you can find all the conditions and entertainment to your taste.  It‚Äôs usually quite a long time to get to it (9‚Äì11 hours of flight from Moscow plus 5 hours by bus), but it's worth it.  The opportunity to enjoy the ocean is worth the wait.  And the matter is not only in the beautiful landscape, there is everything here - and food, and a calm, not crowded beach, and the shade of trees.  Nature disposes to complete alienation from civilization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Palmira Beach Resort Spa is located in the tropical area.  It is never cold here.  They say that clothes do not dry completely on the body or during drying.  It‚Äôs impossible for any of the tourists to get used to it. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The boarding house itself consists of four villas.  They differ in their position relative to the ocean: there are rooms that look directly at the surface of the water, and there are those that overlook the courtyard, where the garden and pool are located. </p><p>  It should be noted that the two villas are new and have a more modern repair and appearance in general.  There are also two old villas that can serve as more refuge for the night than a place of relaxation.  But the numbers in them are cheaper.  In addition, it all depends on what goals pursue vacationers. </p>

    <p>  The price includes an extensive list of features: Wi-Fi in the room and in many public places, round-the-clock access to the pool, long-term parking, a clean private beach, a sunbed, an umbrella and, of course, a children's area.  Everything on the list is completely free. </p><p>  But what‚Äôs paid at the Palmira Beach Resort Spa is spa treatments, bowling and the ‚ÄúOld Sailor‚Äù bar, decorated in the appropriate style.  All seafood dishes are included in the room rate.  Prices in Vietnam for such food are incomparably low, and especially in Phan Thiet province (due to the proximity of resource extraction).  Residents of the peninsula often say that they are fed up with tiger shrimp.  But not for vacationers, agree? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Every morning at 8:00 a cleaning service is available.  Therefore, lovers of sleep at this time of peace should not wait.  It‚Äôs better to go for a swim and take a break.  If before this was a stormy night, only the ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù sign will save. </p><p>  A special feature of the entire Mui Ne Peninsula is sunset and the time after it.  They say that the beauty of a moonless night and its rhythmic sounds can be enjoyed until morning without noticing time. </p><p>  In the afternoon, it is easy to get lost among the areas of tropical plantations, which occupy about 20 thousand square kilometers.  This reserve is quite young: it is a little over 10 years old, but it can reliably hide from all external sounds.  And neither the roar of the motorcycle engine, nor the sound of the car will be heard among the trills of birds and the symphony of the ocean. </p><h2>  Room Amenities </h2><p>  The level of comfort corresponds to a three-star mark, so all rooms at Palmira Beach Resort Spa 3 * have either a balcony or access to the courtyard.  There is a shower, a bathroom is in superior rooms.  An oversized double bed will perfectly decorate moments of relaxation in the room. </p><p>  You will definitely enjoy a minibar, satellite TV, air conditioning and free bottled water.  All rooms are equipped with toilets.  All rooms of the boarding house are divided by partitions. </p>

    <p>  Here it is possible to share a person in a room at half price.  And this means that you can not necessarily go together or three together (with a child).  You can go on vacation and alone. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned every day, and towels are changed.  There can be no claims to cleanliness! </p><h2>  Spa treatments </h2><p>  The list of procedures is so long that it may seem endless.  I would like to try everything several times. </p><p>  Massage is available everywhere where it is possible to take a lying position: <span>on the beach,</span> in the room, and in the SPA center.  The procedures are both relaxing and deeply warming, and healing.  Hot stone massage and Thai are also available. </p><p>  Several types of treatment procedures, such as hydrotherapy and reflexology, are performed here.  Available sauna, hammam, spa or mud bath, steam room.  In addition, many cosmetic procedures are performed: manicure, pedicure, peeling, and more. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  In addition to spa treatments, there are several more pleasant entertainments in the territory of Palmira Beach Resort Spa.  This is a separate bowling club, where there is enough space for all vacationers, namely 10 tracks, and loyal prices.  There are three bars on the territory: two on the beach, one near the pool.  There are also two restaurants. </p>

    <p>  And for those who prefer a quick snack and a variety of drinks, the already familiar to us is the ‚ÄúOld Sailor‚Äù.  Its design will make you feel like a real sailor. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Directly on the private territory of the resort, all types of water sports are available: diving, surfing, windsurfing, kayaking, <span>water skiing</span> and a bike - everything you need for positive and adrenaline.  But those who are interested in long walks and historical monuments should get into the city on their own, although a lot of field trips are organized on the spot (at the hotel).  And quite often, the Palmira Beach Resort Spa receives positive reviews precisely because amazing places and activities are available here, thanks to which you can decorate your vacation for a loyal price. </p><p>  White dunes, surrounded by a freshwater pond and a white lake, are covered with low trees.  The lake earned its name due to the flowering of lotus on its surface.  The unique combination of blue and white colors will create a breathtaking backdrop for photos.  And the opportunity to ride a quad bike will slightly warm the blood. </p><p>  The fabulous creek Suoy Tien is a small river that flows along a miniature grand canyon with red and yellow layers.  The main attraction on this excursion is just the waterfall with which the river ends, splashing with myriad drops and forming several rainbows around.  Such a landscape will bring only peace. </p>

    <p>  Climbing Mount Taku is another option to have a good time.  The summit is a sacred place for Buddhists.  Well, for the lay people there is a cableway and a safe climb lasting 10 minutes. </p><p>  An amazing trip to the rainforest, where at a height you can hear the creak and the noise of trees, as if these are the sounds of their growth, you cannot but like.  On the mountain is a statue of a sleeping Buddha, which the whole world seeks to touch.  Touch you too! </p><h2>  Prices and reviews </h2><p>  The level of the complex Palmira Beach Resort Spa is 3 stars, but the comfort of the new villas brings the level closer to a four-star one.  You must agree that the visitor must rate the hotel.  Often on the intermediary sites for booking rooms you can find information that the hotel Palmira Beach Resort Spa - 4 stars.  This is not a mistake, it is one and the same place of rest. </p><p>  Of course, the level of comfort directly affects the room rate.  The price of an economy class in high season will be 75 y.  e. in one day.  But there are last-minute offers, implying even lower prices.  In Vietnam, you can relax for 45 y.  e. per day. </p>
