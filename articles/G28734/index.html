The battle for the city of Stalingrad (as it is now called, probably outside of Russia and not everyone knows), the success of which was received by the Red Army, turned the tide of the war.  He deservedly bears the title of a hero city. </p><h2>  City of Stalingrad: as it is now called and as it was called before </h2><p>  At the time of the Paleolithic, on the outskirts of the city there was a parking of <span>primitive people,</span> which was called the Dry Mosque.  In the 16th century, in historical sources, this area is associated with the presence of representatives of the Tatar people.  Since in the memoirs of the English traveler Jenkinson, "the abandoned Tatar city of Meskhet" is mentioned.  In the official royal documents, this city was first mentioned on July 2, <span>1589</span> under the name Tsaritsyn.  So it was called until 1925. </p>

    <p>  As you know, in the 1920s and 1930s, cities were mainly called the names and surnames (pseudonyms) of Soviet leaders and party leaders.  Former Tsaritsyn for 1925 was the 19th city in the USSR by the number of inhabitants, so his fate of renaming could not pass in any way.  In 1925 the city was renamed Stalingrad.  It is under this name that he is best known because <span>the Battle of Stalingrad</span> went down in world history as the most important event of the Second World War. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1956, the debunking of the Stalin cult began.  The party had a lot of work in this direction, therefore, party leaders got to the renaming of the city only in 1961.  Since 1961 and to the present time, the settlement has the name that very accurately describes its location - Volgograd <span>(a city on the Volga).</span> </p><h2>  A brief history of the city from 1589 to 1945 </h2><p>  Initially, the city concentrated on a small island.  Why is it founded here?  Because before this time people lived here, and the place was convenient for trade.  The location on the Volga gave the village good chances for dynamic development.  Real changes in the city began to take place in the 19th century.  The <span>first school</span> for noble children was opened, the first gymnasium, in which 49 children studied.  In 1808, a doctor came to the city, who did a lot to develop medicine in it (she was the first local doctor). </p><p>  With the development of <span>transport infrastructure</span> (Volga-Don and other railways) since the end of the 1850s, industry and trade in the city have been developing very strongly, the well-being of residents is increasing. </p><p>  The first three decades of the 20th century, the territory of Stalingrad expanded.  New industrial facilities, residential buildings, public places of recreation are being built.  In 1942, the Germans came to the city of Stalingrad.  What is this time called now?  An occupation.  1942 and 1943 became the most terrible in the history of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Our time: the city is booming </h2><p>  Stalingrad - what city is it now?  Volgograd.  This name fully reflects its essence, because the river is one of the main trade routes.  In the 1990-2000s, several times Volgograd acquired the status of a millionaire.  The city is actively developing industry, services and recreation, sports.  The football team of the Volgograd "Rotor" has played in the major league of Russia for more than one season. </p>

    <p>  But nevertheless, the settlement played the most important role in history under the name "the city of Stalingrad" (as it is now called, you should also not forget, because the old name is unlikely to return). </p>
