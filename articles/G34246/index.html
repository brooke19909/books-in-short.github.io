Many of our compatriots prefer to spend their holidays at sea, without leaving the country.  For many years, the welcoming Krasnodar Territory has been accepting tourists not only from Russia, but also from Europe.  Many people buy tours to expensive hotels and pensions, which are quite a lot on this part of the Black Sea coast.  But there are those who prefer a cheaper vacation.  They choose <span>mini-hotels, guest houses.</span>  In Adler and, in general, throughout the region, every traveler can find accommodation for himself to taste and at a convenient price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guest houses in Adler by the sea" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Adler </h2><p>  This resort, often called the "gateway to the Black Sea", is a suburb of Sochi.  Relaxing here, you have the opportunity not only to swim in the sea or sunbathe on the beach, but also get acquainted with a rich excursion program.  Judging by statistics, the most popular type of accommodation in the Krasnodar Territory is guest houses.  In Adler, on the seashore in recent years, quite a lot of such objects have been built, offering both deluxe rooms and economy rooms.  A great advantage of such a residence is their convenient location relative to the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Many tourists, choosing <span>Sochi, Adler</span> for a vacation, often face a dilemma: which accommodation option should I prefer?  This is not a problem today.  Comfortable luxury hotels are built around Adler; there are also hundreds of guest houses.  This, of course, is not a hotel in the sense that was supposed before.  Guest houses are small mansions or cottages in which from two to ten or twelve families can simultaneously live. </p><p>  Staying at this mini-hotel you will have a great vacation.  Having agreed with the owners, you can solve the problem with food.  Many guest houses have small dining rooms where tourists can eat their own cooked food, and use the menu, which only has homemade food.  The latter option, according to many, is very beneficial, since prices will be significantly lower than restaurant prices.  At the same time, quality and taste are much better than catering dinners.  And the rest becomes full, because you do not need to think what to buy for the preparation of breakfast or lunch. </p><h2>  Norm for a Russian tourist </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Caucasus, in Sochi and its suburbs, choosing such guest houses for living, has already become a very common type of vacation for our compatriots.  Staying in a small cozy house by the sea, for example, in Adler, it turned out to many Russian tourists a more attractive option than living in a room on a high floor in a fashionable hotel.  Here you can simply relax without the many conventions that are characteristic of upscale hotels.  In such mini-hotels, according to many Russians with an average income level, you will spend your vacation not only much cheaper, but also calmer and even more interesting.  This is especially true for those who go to sea with small children.  Guest houses in Adler by the sea will appeal to all visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  A significant part of the private sector hotels are located within a five or ten minute walk to the beach, and taking into account the even terrain it takes very little effort to walk to the coastline.  The pricing policy in this town is the same as in any other resort: the closer the private <span>guest houses of Adler, Sochi</span> from the sea, the higher their cost.  Of course, expensive rooms are also offered on the outskirts, but there are not so many of them.  But such guest houses <span>at the Adler resort</span> have more spacious areas.  They can offer a price, which includes food.  In addition, the owners are trying in conditions of fierce competition in almost all respects to surpass their competitors located in the center or on the shore. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Private guest houses of Adler Sochi" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216480.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price categories </h2><p>  Rest in guest houses of Adler near the sea is possible at any time of the year.  The resort welcomes guests year-round.  In summer, everyone goes here to swim and sunbathe, and in winter - to ski.  Therefore, guest houses in Adler - by the sea or on the outskirts - work throughout the year.  And if in the winter there are many long-term rental offers at comparatively lower prices, then in the summer everything changes dramatically.  Geographically, Adler guest houses can be conditionally divided into three groups: those located in Kurortny Gorodok, in the central and district of the Southern Cultures park.  In each case, the residence has its pros and cons.  For example, in terms of infrastructure necessary for recreation and entertainment, the center and the resort town are more preferable.  But the park area is calmer, and the prices here are significantly lower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, such guest houses in Adler on the seashore as ‚ÄúATikA‚Äù, ‚ÄúSunny Beach‚Äù, ‚ÄúAir Em‚Äù will cost tourists in the high season - in July and August - 1700 rubles for a self-catering room.  In May, prices go down to a thousand rubles.  Many owners offer breakfast, lunch and dinner for an extra fee.  I must say that this type of accommodation is chosen by many tourists coming to Adler.  Guest houses in economy class Adler, such as Marinka, Margarita, Adler, mini-hotels Valencia, Agave, etc., located quite far from the sea, will cost significantly cheaper: from two hundred and fifty person or up to a thousand rubles per room in high season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Guesthouses in Adler" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216479.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The quality of rest primarily depends on the living conditions - on how comfortable the conditions the owner offers, are there all the necessary components for a normal life.  Many guest houses in Adler - on the seafront or located at a sufficient distance from the beach - are modern buildings with all the components required for a carefree vacation.  The cost of living is determined on the basis of several factors at the same time: location, category and area of ‚Äã‚Äãrooms, quality of repair, the presence of a courtyard, the proposed infrastructure, etc. </p><p>  All these characteristics become fundamental when tourists give preference to guest houses.  In Adler, on the seafront, you can choose an option in the private sector where guests can use a washing machine and iron, cook their own meals or dine in a cafe or restaurant that are in close proximity, quickly reach the beach, have the opportunity to use the Internet, etc. etc. All these characteristics are offered by such guest houses in Adler by the sea as ‚ÄúSunny Beach‚Äù, ‚ÄúKarina‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrchid‚Äù, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler guest houses in Adler economy" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Comfortable conditions </h2><p>  Many people prefer to live in the private sector in houses with a large green courtyard, pool and other infrastructure.  For example, the Eco-Garden mini-hotel, located a minute's walk from the beach, offers vacationers both deluxe rooms and cheaper economy rooms.  This guest house is located on the seafront.  Adler is a resort that has many places to go on vacation.  For example, you have the opportunity to visit the water park, dolphinarium, etc. And their location within walking distance is another plus when choosing a guest house. </p><p>  Another advantage is the nearby shops and cafes, as well as public transport.  It's nice to sit in the courtyard in the green arbor in the evenings or cook barbecue on the grill.  I must say that today many people prefer just such a vacation.  Adler guest houses on the seashore or those located some distance from the coast, offer just such conditions.  Here, every tourist will find what he likes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mini-hotels guest houses in Adler" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216475.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The private sector in Adler today offers a large selection of guest houses, mini-hotels and other accommodation options.  For those who come to the resort for the first time, a lot of feedback from experienced visitors helps a lot.  It is for them that you can choose the option with the most successful location and, of course, with the most comfortable living conditions.  For example, those who rested in the guest house "Rita" very warmly remember their vacation.  They liked the location - in the center of Adler, very close to the sea.  A comfortable room, all the amenities, friendliness and friendliness of the owners were also appreciated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in guest houses of Adler near the sea" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1216476.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The Russians who lived in Agave say they barely noticed the cons.  They had the opportunity to use air conditioning, a personal refrigerator, stove, iron, TV, etc. However, they did not like the fact that by the rules they were not allowed to bring guests to this guest house, and not all rooms had dryers.  But in general, most were satisfied with their stay.  In general, many in their reviews speak very warmly about the goodwill of the owners, believing that their stay was almost carefree.  And express hope to return here more than once. </p>
