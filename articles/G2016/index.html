    <h2>  Sochi Breeze Spa (hotel): reviews of vacationers </h2><p>  All people are different, and it is impossible to please every client.  Therefore, even the most positive institution will have at least one negative review.  G. <span>Sochi, the Sochi</span> Breeze Spa <span>Hotel</span> , its attendants, food and accommodation were not liked by everyone who rested there. </p><p>  The first thing that frightened the guests was the repeated presentation of dishes on the buffet, there were even sour stewed fruit.  The food is monotonous and tasteless, but they say about beer and wine that they were diluted with water.  The bar has prohibitive prices for drinks, so many tourists are advised to buy the same juices at the nearest supermarket.  The second is thin walls, and therefore everything that happens in the corridor and the next room is clearly audible.  Third, an old and noisy air conditioner, from which air blows with an unpleasant odor.  And finally, the fourth - unfriendly staff at the reception and in the restaurant. </p><p>  But there are also positive points.  Some tourists write that they are fed with dignity and delicious.  Smiling and polite maids regularly do their job - wipe off dust and change bed sheets.  Many mark the price in their reviews, calling it the best for Sochi and good in relation to quality.  The pool is heated, near it, as in general on the territory of the hotel, is always clean.  The location of the hotel also pleases guests, as there are many interesting places nearby. </p>
