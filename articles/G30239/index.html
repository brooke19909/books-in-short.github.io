    <p>  When conducting <span>psychological diagnostics, a</span> specialist must adhere to ethical rules, which are reflected in the international code of practical psychologist.  The principle of social morality includes both the responsibility of the psychologist for the quality of the diagnosis, and ensuring the person being examined is in a positive state both during the study and in further practical work based on the results of the diagnosis. </p><p>  In the course of studying psychodiagnostics, students of psychological specialties, first of all, study what the principle of objectivity and reliability is, because  the quality of the research result depends on the quality of the selection of diagnostic methods.  The objectivity of psychological diagnostic methods is achieved through their development by groups of scientists, testing them on a large number of subjects and published in scientific journals with an indication of the key to the test results. </p><p>  The principle of social morality presupposes a diagnosis as a result of conducting a psycho-diagnosis by the number of points received as a result of answering questions, choosing judgments that are most valuable to the subject, or by the number of significant signs that relate to a particular state of the subject.  Therefore, the measurement principle is additionally used when, when studying non-physical objects, digital symbolization of the properties being studied is used.  So, for example, when studying child aggression, the researcher conducts the ‚ÄúFrequency Counting‚Äù method, when the object is monitored for several days with the calculation of the observed phenomenon in the child‚Äôs behavior.  This will make it possible not only to calculate the number of aggressive acts, but also to analyze in which situations and under what conditions the observed situations occur. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important for any specialist to understand what the principle of confidentiality is, which is the main <span>ethical principle</span> when conducting psychological, as well as pedagogical, and social diagnostics.  If a person himself turns to a specialist for diagnosis, then the results are reported only to him, and not to his relatives or work colleagues. </p><p>  Even for scientific research, <span>moral principles</span> are used <span>that</span> hide names, professions, and other information about subjects who could be used to guess who the information was about.  In <span>scientific work,</span> each subject is indicated by a letter or number, and the rest of the information is stored by the researcher in the archive. </p><p>  Diagnostics, in addition to its research function, should carry a formative effect, i.e.  give the individual new knowledge that helps the researcher to better understand their characteristics without harming themselves and their mental state.  Diagnostic results should not be used to collect files on a person, to justify his incompetence in the profession.  On the contrary, any diagnostic procedure should be used for the purpose of personality development. </p><p>  Each specialist must constantly improve their qualifications, undergo coursework in order not only to replenish knowledge of new techniques, but also to increase their competence, to navigate what is the principle of non-damage or voluntariness, or the principle of scientific validity. </p><p>  Education specialists undergo training courses in order to confirm or improve their professional qualifications.  The psychologist can enter the certification earlier than the scheduled time if he developed his own program, project or diagnosis, which he successfully applied in practice, if positive results were obtained in teaching and raising children.  In his <span>analytical report, the</span> psychologist can describe what the principle of professional cooperation is when the diagnosis is developed, tested and improved by a group of colleagues.  It is such collective cooperation that allows psychodiagnostics to remain socially moral, moral, objective and reliable for all participants in the research process. </p>
