    <h2>  Origin of the lake </h2><p>  The history of the reservoir is rooted in antiquity.  Scientists attribute the origin of Lake Chany to the end of the Ice Age.  The age of the reservoir is more than ten thousand years.  According to researchers, people settled on its shores from ancient times.  So, archaeologists have discovered traces of settlements dating back to the sixth-seventh millennium BC.  e. </p>

Most of them arise as a result of movements of the <span>earth's crust</span> or <span>volcanic eruptions.</span>  If you describe Lake Chany, the origin of the basin of this reservoir is tectonic.  This explains its heterogeneous depth (in general, it is shallow - up to two meters, but there are also deep sections - up to seven to nine meters).

The first birch trees on the banks of the reservoir began to grow only 5 millennia ago.  Now it is in the forest-steppe zone.  Chany Lake is characterized by noticeable fluctuations in water level.  They are caused by climatic changes, which cause dry and wet seasons.  But, even taking into account these changes, scientists have established that the area of ​​the lake has been decreasing in the last two centuries. </p><p>  At the end of the 18th century, a record area of ​​12 thousand square kilometers was noted.  At the beginning of the next century, it totaled eight thousand square kilometers.  Since then, the area of ​​the reservoir has declined rapidly.  Already at the end of the XIX century, it was only 3170 square kilometers.  And about half a century ago, the area of ​​the lake has already decreased to two thousand square kilometers. </p><p>  The beginning of the active settlement of the shores of the reservoir dates back to the 16th century. </p><p>  The first records of the reservoir appear in the 17-18 centuries.  They date back to the <span>development of Siberia.</span>  And the first description of the reservoir belongs to the geographer Pallas, who in 1786 made a trip to the lake. </p>

    <h2>  Short description of the reservoir </h2><p>  Lake Chany (Novosibirsk region) is closed.  Its length is over ninety kilometers, and about eighty-five wide.  The salinity of the reservoir is not very high, while it is different in its different parts.  For example, in the southeast it is completely insignificant.  Interestingly, this is the largest saline body of water in the country. </p><p>  If you find Lake Chany on the map, you will notice that it covers simultaneously five districts of the region.  The reservoir includes a system of three lakes - the Big and Small Chans, as well as Yarkul, and interconnected reaches.  Each of them has its own vegetation, depth, salinity.  Due to the significant differences between them, some researchers consider them different independent reservoirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, most scientists all believe that this is one lake, which consists of three parts.  The food of the lake is mainly snowy, it is also fed from nearby rivers.  The pond freezes in October-November.  Ice leaves the surface of the water only towards the end of spring.  The lake has its own shipping. </p>

    <p>  In addition, Chany is a great place for active pastime.  Many camp sites offer rental of ATVs, snowmobiles and boats. </p><h2>  The legend of silver fish living in the lake </h2><p>  Most species of fish that live in the lake have shiny silver scales.  An ancient beautiful legend is even composed about this.  It says that thousands of years ago a thin path stretched from the moon into the clear waters of the lake, along which the inhabitants of the moon came to Earth.  Their skin was silver.  Somehow, when guests from the moon once again descended to the lake, a <span>volcano erupted.</span> </p><p>  The ashes rose very high and did not allow the lunar path to descend.  Because of this, the lunar guests could not return home.  Then they had to settle permanently in the depths of the lake, and they turned into beautiful fish with silver scales. </p><h2>  Mysterious lake dweller </h2><p>  A terrible legend about a mysterious creature that lives in the depths of Lake Chany has been walking around the reservoir for many decades.  Local residents are convinced that the giant snake drowns boats and pulls fishermen and livestock into the abyss, and claim that they saw its silhouette in the water. </p>

Interestingly, almost all of them stretch from the southwest to the northeast.  The shores of the reservoir, as well as its islands are covered with a variety of trees and shrubs: birch, raspberry, currant, bird cherry, rose hip and many others.
