Agur Waterfalls and Mount Akhun</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are in Sochi, then the first few days you will spend, without a doubt, on the beach.  However, there are so many beautiful places that it would be a real crime to abandon fascinating excursions.  One of the most interesting sights of these places is the Agursky gorge.  The Caucasus Mountains are a whole world of formidable peaks and fast rivers, lakes and amazing landscapes.  But not only high mountains are famous for these places.  As a result of the breakthrough of the Argun River, a unique Argun Gorge was formed.  It is famous not only for its natural beauties, but also for ancient architectural structures, ranging from tower fortifications to military monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agursky gorge" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Thanks to the location, these places have become so popular among tourists.  The Agursky Gorge is located almost inside Sochi, between Matsesta and Khosta.  It can be reached by car and city buses.  Even if this is your first time here, the road will not be too difficult for you.  From the Central District of Sochi, you can get on routes No. 122 and No. 2. From Adlerovsky District, you will find No. 125 and No. 105. So you will get to the Sputnik stop. </p><p>  Now you have to walk a little.  But it‚Äôs nothing, because in front of you is waiting for the real pearl of these places, the Agursky Gorge.  Follow the bridge to the left, now along the road upstream to the restaurant "Caucasian aul."  There remains a hundred meters and ahead of the path, cut into the rocks.  Here excursion routes begin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Agur Waterfalls</span> and Mount Akhun </h2><p>  If you have never been here before, we recommend starting with this route.  There are places on earth where you want to return again and again.  This is just one of them.  Walking along the path along Agur, past the famous waterfalls, you get real pleasure.  Myths and legends come to life here.  Directly from the gorge, the path rises to <span>Eagle Rocks,</span> where people received fire from Prometheus, for which the hero was then chained as a punishment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agursky gorge in sochi" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Individual training </h2><p>  The view from here to the Agursky waterfalls and Mount Akhun is simply fantastic, but it is almost impossible to convey this in words.  Moreover, it is amazing at any time of the year.  Shady trees and rich colors delight in the summer, rare winter primroses surprise closer to spring, and in autumn everything burns with unearthly golden hues.  From here the group descends to the Matsesta springs.  The route is simple, it is suitable for all people with more harmful physical training.  Trekking along a well-equipped trail takes a leisurely form and takes 4-6 hours. </p><h2>  Journey along the river </h2><p>  In fact, you can choose any route.  One way or another, but you will still see the main attractions and explore the entire Agursky Gorge in Sochi.  However, each of them is accompanied by a unique guide story and a show of the most amazing and hidden places.  Therefore, tourists often decide to visit all available excursions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is 6 km trekking in the middle of the Colchild Forest through a picturesque gorge.  Together with the group, you will see three cascades of magnificent waterfalls and a panorama of the Main Caucasian Range.  The observation deck of Eagle Rocks will give an unforgettable experience.  If you have always dreamed of trying yourself in the mountain climbing skills, then here you will have such an opportunity.  Those who wish will make the climb together with the guide.  If you are lucky, the group can catch red deer in the natural sites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agur waterfalls and mount akhun" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  On the eve of the first waterfall </h2><p>  Local attractions open to tourists one after another.  There is nothing to be done, until you reach the observation deck, where an exciting panorama stretches out, your gaze will limit the Agursky Gorge.  Damn font - this place is mysterious and very beautiful.  It is located just in front of the first waterfall. </p><p>  You should immediately warn tourists.  Here at every step I want to turn a little to the side, take pictures here and there, go down to the river or climb stones.  Do not do this without the permission of the instructor.  Where it is provided, the excursion trail itself will turn where you need to.  So, the Devil's Font is a picturesque stone bath, in which you can see the entrance to the cave.  She has the no less famous name Devil's hole.  In fact, there is a very beautiful nature and a peaceful atmosphere, nothing terrible that would justify these names. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful nature" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864281.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you like the noise of falling water and diamond splashes - this is exactly what the doctor ordered.  The Agursky Gorge in Sochi is the best place on earth, but its surroundings are no less wonderful.  During this excursion, the group will make a small ascent along the mountain river, where you can see the most beautiful forms of karst in the snake rust, admire five waterfalls and streams.  At the end of the tour, in the cafe, which is located at the last waterfall, you can taste barbecue, and then visit the tea plantation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agursky gorge damn font" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864280.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Three gorges </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt wait to see everything in one day, then this exclusive tour will be the ideal option.  The Agursky Gorge is far from the only attraction of these places.  In one day you can visit not one, but immediately in the three most famous gorges in the central part of Russia.  Each of them has its own attractions.  In the gorge <span>of the Khosta River,</span> tourists explore the village and listen to the fascinating stories of the guide.  The main attraction is the Orthodox church, where the shoes of the legendary St. Spyridon are kept. </p><p>  Passing to the Agursky Gorge, tourists will pass the old Circassian path to the Devil's Font.  Everything will please here.  Exceptionally beautiful nature, picturesque karst forms, streams and caves.  And vivid photographs will remind you of the experienced moments for a long time.  In the gorge of the Matsesta River, an ancient balneological center with a hydrogen sulfide source will be visited, where people have been treated since time immemorial. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour agursky gorge" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864278.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mount Akhun with a visit to the gorge </h2><p>  A narrow serpentine leads directly from the Black Sea coast to the top of the mountain.  This is an 11-kilometer highway that snakes itself.  For impressionable natures this is one of the best tours.  The road runs through picturesque slopes, which are covered with centuries-old beech and oak trees, ash and yew trees.  During the program, tourists manage to visit the Agursky Gorge.  Reviews emphasize not only picturesque landscapes, which are breathtaking, but also the professional work of a guide, who each time gives out a huge amount of information about these places, but does it a little differently.  Some tourists say that even the second time they were as interested as the first time.  All three waterfalls are waiting for you.  The first is 30 meters high, with two cascades of water falling at an angle to each other.  The second multi-jet is a charming sight, like a wall of water.  Height 21 meters.  The third is slightly larger, height 23 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agursky gorge reviews" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864277.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Only mountains can be better than mountains </h2><p>  The four-hour route to Big Akhun Mountain is a leader in tourist visits.  This peak is considered one of the most famous <span>attractions in Sochi.</span>  This is the highest <span>mountain</span> in the coastal part of the <span>city, the</span> peak of which reaches 663 meters.  When the weather is fine, a view of a rare beauty and range opens within a radius of 40 km.  The best panorama cannot be found for a review of Sochi. </p><p>  From here, you can clearly see the mountains, the sea and almost the whole city.  In 1936, to improve visibility, local architects built a 30-meter tower.  On the way, you can see the legendary Orlin cliffs, and going down, you can visit the shady gorge, which is replete with tropical plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agursky gorge description" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1864279.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price for excursions </h2><p>  You can call in advance with any local travel agency.  Choose one of the proposed routes, time and the most suitable option for you.  There may be several: </p><ul><li>  The tour operator gathers a group of up to 60 people.  In this case, payment is made in the amount of 600 rubles per person.  There is no division into children and adults in this case. </li><li>  On your car.  In this case, the group size can be up to 30 people.  The price of a guide will be 2500 rubles.  The price may increase if the company exceeds the declared amount. </li><li>  An individual trip for two.  Price - 6500 rubles. </li><li>  There are programs for four and six.  In order to book a ticket, you need to make an advance payment, 20% of the cost. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  It is impossible to visit Sochi and miss the opportunity to see the Agursky Gorge.  The description will be incomplete if you do not add that it is a real tropical paradise, where plants bloom almost all year round.  You can see the gorge under the snow, but this phenomenon is extremely rare.  Sometimes, just a few days a year, you can find a drop in temperature so much that on the soft branches there is a fluffy snowball.  In February, primroses are already beginning to peek out, and soon a new warm season begins. </p><p>  Tours take place in any weather, but in the rain you must make sure that the shoes are suitable.  No shoes and slippers if you want to reach a place with whole legs and good mood.  Sneakers, sneakers, and in heavy mud and rubber boots.  On the official website of tour operators you will find complete information about when and where the group gathers.  Usually a bus passes through the city and collects tourists at the indicated points.  Do not forget to bring a good camera.  Fantastic views must be captured and placed on your home album. </p>
