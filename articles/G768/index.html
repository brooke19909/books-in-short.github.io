What to see in Abkhazia in the winter?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Abkhazia attracts many tourists from Russia in winter.  She is especially beautiful at this time of year.  Indeed, in winter, persimmons and tangerines ripen here, ski resorts work, and a wonderful climate also attracts.  Especially often, <span>in</span> winter, Russians travel <span>to Abkhazia with their</span> families on New Year's holidays. </p><h2>  The climate in the republic </h2><p>  The republic is most attractive because of the mild climate.  The temperature in winter in Abkhazia, as a rule, does not fall below 5 degrees Celsius.  This allows even in February to take a walk in a warm jacket or windbreaker.  It only gets colder in the evenings.  Basically, thermometer readings vary between 15 and 20 degrees.  And if you imagine that in some regions of Russia at the same time the temperature can reach -40, then the weather in Abkhazia in winter is just fine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia in the winter" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1052514.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The snow that has fallen here melts very quickly.  And flowering trees under the snow look funny and unusual.  Palm trees, blooming roses, tangerines - all this appears to tourists in the most beautiful. </p><p>  The swimming season here ends in October-November, depending on the weather.  A warm and stable temperature is characteristic of December and January in these places, which is an additional plus for those who come to this country on New Year's holidays. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Abkhazia is as wonderful in winter as the <span>French Riviera.</span>  Mountains protect it from cold air currents.

    <h2>  What to see in Abkhazia in the winter? </h2><p>  Arriving in the republic after the end of the swimming season, you can not only admire the beauties of nature.  Most of the interesting places in resort towns are available for visiting in the cold season.  Rest in Abkhazia in winter has its own characteristics. <strong> </strong>  Tourists can also take air baths at local beaches, undergo treatment at sanatoriums, visit parks and more.  A winter trip to the republic will significantly save the budget. </p><p>  Especially beautifully famous is the Ritsa Lake.  Tourists from Russia are fascinated by Abkhazia in the winter, photos of mountains, palms, tangerines.  But Lake Ritsa is incomparable!  In addition to the reservoir itself, you can look into the relict national park, whose area is almost 400 square kilometers.  It is located around the famous lake.  Even those tourists who have already visited these places as part of a summer excursion will be able to take a fresh look at the beauty of the snow-capped mountains around the silver surface of the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia in the winter photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1052523.jpg"></div>

Responses of lovers to relax here in December enthusiastically praise the local landscapes, trees and more.  The winter forest of this country is as if copied from the page of a children's book.  Huge evergreen fir and spruce, nearby mountain gorges and rocks, snow caps on trees and many traces of forest inhabitants. </p><p>  However, do not forget about security measures, admiring the wonderful views.  You can easily fall into a stream or fall under an avalanche.  Therefore, for forest walks, it is recommended to take accompanying people with you.  Extreme sportsmen can even get a night in a real booth, which is built by hunters and heated by a fire. </p><p>  It is important to prepare well for such movements: clothes, snowshoes and special equipment - all this will make the trip comfortable and safe. <br>  In addition, there are beautiful palm trees, citrus trees, cypresses, eucalyptus trees, mimosas and other evergreens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Abkhazia in winter to relax" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1054302.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Rest in Abkhazia in winter will be remembered also by fresh fruits.  Persimmons, tangerines, grapefruits, apples, kiwi, lemons, feijoa, pears and dates are all available in abundance on the market at the lowest prices.  Abkhazia is waiting for those who are tired of city bustle, frost and really want to subtropics.  In winter, it is completely different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cafes and restaurants </h2><p>  A significant disadvantage of winter recreation can be called the fact that so many cafes and restaurants close their doors before the start of the summer season.  Most of the establishments that work here in the winter are designed for the local contingent.  And they can please visitors only with national cuisine. </p><p>  For example, in Pitsunda there are mostly cafes located in hotels.  In Gagra, all restaurants and cafes of the coast are closed.  However, you can drop by at Old Gagra to the popular local restaurant Gagripsh, as well as the Joekvara cafe, which continue to work during the off-season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in abkhazia in winter" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1052537.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most hospitable cafes and dining rooms in New Athos.  There are open all year round: a dining room at the New Athos cave, a cafe "Surf", "Abkhazian courtyard" and "Prime".  In addition, near the waterfall there is a wonderful restaurant "Tsarskaya Alley". </p><p>  But in the capital, life is still in full swing.  Here, sunny Abkhazia is still waiting for guests.  In winter (reviews of vacationers confirm) in Sukhumi, many cafes continue to work and even open additional verandas. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  It has a less active connection with the cities of Russia and within the country of Abkhazia in the winter.  You can still relax by car or taxi.  In addition, in the off-season, many bus and minibus routes operate.  Despite the fact that buses make fewer flights, they, like in the summer, cross the border.  If a tourist doesn’t travel to the republic by private car, he can travel by direct bus from Rostov-on-Don, Nalchik or Krasnodar. </p><h2>  Hotels and pensions </h2><p>  Coastal hotels, ideal for summer living, are not very suitable for those planning a vacation in Abkhazia in winter.  Reviews of tourists and the owners of some hotels themselves confirm this.  It is especially uncomfortable, damp and even dangerous to live in wooden hotels located right on the sea coast. </p><p>  But, in addition to such options, Abkhazia offers pensions and stone hotels in winter, in which it lives equally well in summer and winter.  It is very important in the rooms additional equipment with electric heaters.  The fact is that there are problems with central heating in the republic. </p><p>  Some tourist hotels have their own steam heating.  Settlement in remote places and the suburbs, where there is no public transport, is only possible for those tourists who have a private car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in abkhazia in winter reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1052528.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  Abkhazia receives tourists in many cities in winter.  The largest and most popular of them is Gagra.  It is located in the western part of the republic and has a coastline of 20 km.  In the old part of the city there is a particularly beautiful view of the mountains in winter. </p><p>  The capital of the country - the city of Sukhumi - is the most developed resort place in all of Abkhazia.  In addition, the city is so well located beyond the mountains that the warmest weather in winter is here.  In Sukhum, the sea is almost always calm, many cafes and restaurants work, as well as tourist excursions. </p><p>  Pitsunda is another famous climatic resort in the country.  Here is the world famous pine grove, which occupies about two hundred hectares.  This grove is a nature reserve and is protected by the state.  In addition to the unique flora, Pitsunda has a 7 km long beach. </p><p>  The city of Gudauta is characterized by lower prices for housing and food.  However, tourists do not have much popularity.  It is located at a distance of about 45 km from Sukhum and Gagra. </p><p>  New Athos is a popular resort of Abkhazia.  It is located between two <span>mountains, Iverskaya</span> and Athos.  Here you can see firsthand how beautiful Abkhazia is in winter.  Photos and impressions of the trip will remain in the hearts of tourists for a long time.  Indeed, in addition to the beauty of the mountains, a river flows here, many exotic trees grow.  Almond and olive groves, slender cypress trees, orange trees and vineyards are everywhere.  Among other things, there are extensive caves that have historical significance. </p><h2>  Excursions in Abkhazia in winter </h2><p>  Some mistakenly believe that in the winter in this republic they will have nothing to do.  In fact, many attractions are available here in the winter. </p><p>  Tourists can go to the Ritsa or Goluboye lakes.  Visit the <span>Pitsunda Temple, the Church of</span> St. George in Ilora or the village of Pskhu.  Tourists can visit the famous cave in New Athos year-round.  The stream of those who want to get acquainted with these places never runs dry.  In the off-season, work hours are limited to three days a week: Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.  The price of excursions does not depend on the season.  Inside the cave, visitors can go to a local cafe. </p><p>  The capital's botanical garden and monkey nursery also operates year-round and awaits guests.  Despite the short working <span>day, tourists</span> will have time for one excursion to get acquainted with rare plant species and look at monkeys. </p><p>  In addition to the usual study tours of winter Abkhazia, visitors can improve their health.  There are many hydropathic establishments in the republic that operate all year round.  In addition, there is the opportunity to visit the hot springs.  One of them is located in the village of Primorskoe, which is located near New Athos.  Also, mineral water and mud baths in hospitals of Abkhazia are available to tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abkhazia winter reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1054291.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gegsky waterfall </h2><p>  One of the most wonderful places in the republic is the Circassian or Gegsky waterfall.  You can see it during an excursion to Lake Ritsa.  But since the waterfall is far from the highway, to get to it, you need to drive along a mountain serpentine and expose passengers to danger, and most often guides exclude this magical place from the standard route.  You can drive to it only on an all-wheel drive unit, since the road is very narrow and runs near a terrible abyss.  Since it is very cold, it is recommended to dress warmly to visit this place. </p><p>  The waterfall itself looks amazing.  Its height reaches 55 m, the water is very cold not only in winter but also in summer.  It originates from the waters of the Gega River, which flows from the Gagra Range, flows through caves and falls from a cliff, making a bewitching impression with its powerful current. </p><h2>  Lost Paradise </h2><p>  Pskhu is a village in the republic with about 200 inhabitants.  It is located high in the mountains at an altitude of 760 m above the sea.  The main attraction of the village is the sanctuary of Inal Cuba.  There are also rich lands for hunters and fishermen. </p><p>  Coming here, you can get into a completely different world.  After all, there are absolutely no means of transportation except a horse harness.  Cellular and other communications are absent.  The villagers communicate with the city by radio. </p><p>  There is a small hydroelectric station, the work of which is supported by the villagers themselves.  Products are delivered to the village by helicopter.  In winter, there is so much snow that it falls asleep at home on the roof.  In order to leave the house, residents have to dig tunnels in the snowdrifts between the houses. </p><p>  The village of Pskhu is one of the most beautiful places in the entire Caucasus, with a very rich history.  This place has a unique climate, fertile soil, melliferous plants and beautiful views.  Mountain honey from apiaries of these places is considered the best in the country.  On the west side are mountains.  Especially beautiful is Silver Mountain after the rain. </p><p>  You can get here by helicopter.  People in the village are very hospitable.  In summer, they get to the valley by land routes, and in winter - only by air.  Once here, a person feels himself in another world and can be distracted from all the problems and everyday worries of the big city. </p><h2>  The hot springs </h2><p>  Many people know that Abkhazia is the sea, beautiful nature and a huge number of juicy fruits and fruits, famous lakes, waterfalls, temples and monasteries.  But not everyone knows about the hot springs in this country. <br>  In winter, visiting the springs can diversify the rest and make it useful.  Moreover, to improve their health, it is not necessary to pay for a sanatorium voucher.  A course of thermal treatments with healthy waters and mud can be taken separately. </p><p>  There are a lot of sources in Abkhazia.  Even if you fail to complete the full course of treatment, one visit to a hot spring in winter will bring a lot of impressions and positive emotions. </p><p>  The most famous healing springs are in the villages of Kyndyg and Primorsky.  Bathing, smearing and wrapping in these places have a healing effect on the body and give a lot of positive emotions to all tourists.  There is an improvement in mood after visiting the hot springs.  Tourists confirm that after visiting the thermal procedures in children, the teeth begin to erupt painlessly and quickly, and muscles are also strengthened.  In adults, the condition of the skin, muscles or joints improves.  Recovery takes place with the help of the forces of nature itself. </p><p>  Hot springs of Abkhazia do not look like sanatoriums.  Here there are only some amenities for visitors, but in general, a person feels alone with nature.  A visit to the source will cost only 100 rubles per visitor.  In winter, hot springs are one of the best types of healthy recreation. </p><p>  Abkhazia is ready to receive tourists from Russia in summer and winter.  There is something to do, a lot of interesting places and low prices for leisure and housing. </p>
