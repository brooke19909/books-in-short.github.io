    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Mogilev has one of such corners.  Sanatorium "Pines" is located among a dense forest filled with the aroma of needles and fresh foliage.  Nearby, no more than 400 meters from residential buildings, a full-flowing Dnieper flows proudly along the coast of which a long terrain path passes.  All guests, without exception, who come to the Sosny sanatorium at any time of the year, are engaged in its development.  Mogilev is located only ten kilometers from the health resort. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Back in the distant Soviet 1973, construction began on a sanatorium designed for 300 vacationers.  The health resort is able to accommodate the same number of visitors today, of which 130 places can be allocated to children.  The territory covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 hectares, all of it is under protection. </p>
