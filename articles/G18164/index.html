  <section class="page js-page"><h1>dvb t2 receiver. Features selection and useful features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Dvb T2 receiver is</span> designed to watch digital television.  What advantages does this type of TV broadcasts have, what functions of tuners can significantly simplify a person‚Äôs life and brighten up his rest?  The answers to these questions can be found in the article presented to your attention. </p><h2>  Digital tv </h2><p>  The Latin letters in the name of the Dvb T2 receiver indicate that this technical device is designed to receive second-generation digital television signals.  This is the standard adopted today in Russia.  Why this type of broadcasting is better than the usual, analogue is a separate topic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imgkid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tv antenna" class="if uuid-3171527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3171527.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, it significantly expands the signal coverage area.  Previously, there were enough places on the map of Russia where watching TV programs was impossible.  Today, in almost every corner of our country, television sets show twenty channels without interruption.  Even residents of those areas where before the transmission went without significant interference, for the most part are satisfied with the transition to the new standard. </p><p>  The Dvb T2 receiver perfectly processes a weak signal, which means that the quality of the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù can please even the most demanding user.  In addition, these devices have a number of very useful functions that help make viewing your favorite TV shows more comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Take everything from life </h2><p>  Now, viewers have a great opportunity not to miss interesting programs due to the fact that some of them go at an uncomfortable time.  Many Dvb T2 receivers are capable of recording broadcasts, and the process can happen automatically.  For this, the viewer must select in advance in the electronic program (another useful function of the set-top boxes) his transmission of interest and select the ‚Äúrecord‚Äù mode for it.  You just need to remember to connect a sufficient memory card to the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walmart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash card" class="if uuid-3171494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3171494.jpg"></div><p>  To save one transmission in high quality, one to several gigabytes is required. </p><h2>  Take a break! </h2><p>  For those who are used to watching videos using various types of players, the Dvb T2 receivers have an option that allows them to continue to not change their habits.  It is a function of "Time Shift" or "Time Shift."  Its essence lies in the fact that viewers can pause when watching digital television. </p><p>  At the heart of this technology is the same broadcast recording.  When the user of the Dvb T2 digital receiver presses the remote control button with a pause icon, flash drive recording starts.  When he clicks ‚Äúplay‚Äù, he gets the opportunity to watch the show, but not in the broadcast, but stored on the drive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Another useful option </h2><p>  Many reviews of Dvb T2 receivers mention another function that allows you to start watching the program of interest during the time.  In addition to the "record" mode in the electronic program, you can find another.  It is called "View." </p><p>  Turning it on for any transmission, you can not remember on which channel it is broadcast.  The main thing is that your Dvb T2 receiver and TV are on at the appointed time.  The device itself will tune to the desired program.  This feature allows you to significantly save time. </p><h2>  The World Wide Web </h2><p>  Some models of Dvb T2 Digital Terrestrial Receivers can be connected to the Internet.  The connection is via Wi-Fi using a network receiver, which is included in the package or can be purchased separately and connected via a USB connector.  The owner of the DVB T2 digital receiver gets access to videos posted on the popular Internet resource - YouTube. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wiltanet.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remote control from the receiver" class="if uuid-3171482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3171482.jpg"></div><p>  If desired, he can add his favorite clips to favorites.  Now they will always be at hand.  Many reviews of Lumax Dvb T2 receivers often refer to the convenience of the Cinema Hall.  This is the name of the collection of the best Soviet and Russian films, which is accessed by users of similar models of television tuners.  In order to use the Cinema Hall, you also need to connect to the World Wide Web. </p><h2>  New generation radio </h2><p>  Many, speaking of Dvb T2 receivers, forget about their ability to "catch" not only digital television, but also radio.  There are currently three such channels in Russia.  And there is every reason to hope that the number of radio stations transmitting their signals in digital format will increase.  Unlike analog programs, such broadcasts are completely protected from interference.  Music lovers will be delighted with the sound quality of digital stations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tosave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="digital dvb t2 receiver" class="if uuid-3171501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3171501.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth mentioning the large number of radio programs devoted to various musical genres on the air of the Radio of Russia and Mayak channels.  Therefore, do not forget about the button on the remote control, which is responsible for switching between TV and radio broadcasts. </p><h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  This article has revealed the features of digital television broadcasting. </p><p>  A brief overview of the useful features available on many models of television receivers was also made.  Such information will help greatly facilitate the choice of model for those who are going to purchase a digital set-top box Dvb T2. </p>
