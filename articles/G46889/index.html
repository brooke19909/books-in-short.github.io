  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of organization and its role in management</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Management, or the science of management, requires strict consistency and organizational clarity.  Therefore, the very concept of "organization" and the concept of organization in management are intimately connected and interdependent. </p><p>  <strong>Definition</strong> </p><p>  The word "organization" is ambiguous.  It can also mean a group of people united by any common material, scientific, ideological, etc.  interests, a number of measures, orders, actions taken to debug the normal operation of a mechanism (for example, the organization of the educational process).  Thus, the concept of organization sounds like this: it is a certain group of people (from two people or more) working together to achieve any common goals.  An organization is considered simple if it decides to realize one goal, and complex if at least two goals are realized. </p><p>  <strong>Organization and Management</strong> </p><p>  In <span>the management system,</span> organization is a complex concept.  The following factors are important to her: </p><ul><li>  the obligatory presence of any resources (these can be human resources, i.e. people, information, technological, raw materials, material, etc.); </li><li>  relationship with the environment: this includes laws governing the activities of both the manager and the enterprise as a whole, these are also <span>consumers</span> for whose sake the company works, suppliers providing the organization with raw materials, etc. </li><li>  the distribution of labor in the horizontal plane (large-scale production is divided into a number of smaller ones with a narrow industry focus. For example, automobile production - assembly of its mechanisms separately, etc.); </li><li>  subdivision into sectors and departments; </li><li>  the distribution of labor in a vertical plane (activities coordinating the "horizontal" production "); </li><li>  mandatory management. </li></ul><p>  <strong>What is a manager?</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A manager is simply a manager.  The concept of organization necessarily includes a control element.  And the manager is a management specialist, his activities include the organization of the work process at the company, the management of the company's employees, etc.  In fact, a manager is an official person, he can be included in both the middle and the top management of the organization.  His competence is the executive branch. </p><p>  The concept of management organization is associated with the implementation of certain rules, the non-observance of which often leads to a malfunction of the work process of an enterprise or company.  Then the set <span>goals and objectives</span> will not be achieved. </p><p>  <strong>Golden Management Rules</strong> </p><p>  Among the rules, the observance of which guarantees a sufficient coherence and stability of the labor process, include the following: </p><ul><li>  the so-called specialization rule.  It consists in introducing new technologies in labor processes, delimiting production by separate specialized industries, training and improving the skills of the management apparatus in various fields of scientific and technical innovation; </li><li>  integration rule.  Its necessity has been proved both by the needs of production itself and by the quality <span>of production</span> activity management.  The essence of the rule is to combine the actions of the management apparatus and its subordinate units into a common process.  This includes the goals, tasks that the company faces, as well as the needs and interests of the market where the company sends its products; </li><li>  the rule of respect for time, saving it.  It is important not only in the production of so-called material products.  The essence of the rule is that achieving the goals set will be faster the sooner the manager can respond to specific needs and demands of the market, the sooner he can mobilize external and internal factors of the production process to realize market needs and requirements.  The concept of organization of <span>the management process is</span> directly related to this rule.  Because the more energetic, more efficient the manager will be able to adapt to market changes, the faster he will solve the problems that arise, the more competitive his company or enterprise will be.  Therefore, this rule may be relevant not only within the framework of one specific production, but also affect the economy of a whole region, and, by and large, of the state. </li></ul>
