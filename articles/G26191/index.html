Both in its visual outlines and in its spiritual significance for the entire human civilization, <span>St. Peter's Basilica</span> in Rome has no analogues.  It captivates the imagination with its power.  Several generations of the greatest masters who built it, counted on precisely this.  They knew what they were building.  They did it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Peter's Basilica in Rome" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/267050.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  St. Peter's Basilica in Rome </p><p>  It is located exactly on the same spot where in Ancient Rome there were gardens and circus of <span>Emperor Nero.</span>  Here the <span>apostle Peter, the</span> closest disciple and follower of Christ, was executed on the cross and buried <span>.</span>  The tomb of St. Peter is located in the altar of the cathedral.  This is one of the greatest shrines in the entire Christian world.  St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is essentially only the final, final version of the temple, it was supposed to replace the previous buildings in this sacred place, which, successively replacing each other, became dilapidated and clearly did not correspond to the unique status of this place. </p><p>  The decision to build a grand temple, which would have no analogues either in the Christian or in the pagan world, was made at the beginning of the sixteenth century by Julius II.  St. Peter's Basilica in Rome was designed and built throughout this century, but in general terms it was completed in its second half, after the erection of a grand dome over it.  At the same time, there was an urgent need to bring into a harmonious whole the entire surrounding space around the cathedral.  Giovanni <span>Lorenzo Bernini</span> coped with this task brilliantly <span>.</span>  The area around the cathedral is his work.  Here and today, believers from around the world gather in anticipation of the papal blessing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rome St. Peter's Basilica photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/267052.jpg" width="492"></div>  These visual images are known to everyone - crowds of pilgrims, Rome, St. Peter's Basilica ... Photos and videos shot at this historic place are familiar even to those who have never been to Rome.  Everything that happens in the Vatican evokes a lively response even from those who in no way correlate with Catholicism.  In a sense, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is a collective embodiment of human genius.  The greatest architects of the Italian Renaissance took part in its design and construction.  Its walls, niches, dome and ceilings are painted by brilliant painters of the Renaissance.  All subsequent generations considered it a matter of honor to bring their small contribution to this building, trying not to upset the harmonies of the existing image.  Already in the mid-twentieth century, the famous Italian sculptor Giacomo Manzu worked on the design of the portal. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="st peter cathedral photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/267051.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Visit to the Vatican </p><p>  This is a required part of the program.  To be in Rome and not to be here is simply impossible.  It doesn‚Äôt even really matter which religious denomination a person identifies with.  You can be an atheist, but just pay tribute to the human genius who created St. Peter's Basilica.  The photo from the square in front of him is habitually decorated with many tourist sites and advertising posters at the entrance to travel agencies on all continents.  This is such an attraction, which is unacceptable to miss. </p>
