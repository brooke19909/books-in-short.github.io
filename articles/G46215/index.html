For example, such a person is Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev.  His biography is full of interesting facts.  We will talk about him in this article. </p><h2>  Good start </h2><p>  Interestingly, the future Azerbaijani millionaire was born in a poor family of shoemakers.  His parents were illiterate people, this explains the fact that the exact date of birth of Tagiyev is unknown.  But it is believed that it was 1823.  From childhood, Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev was calm and hardworking.  After the death of his mother, when he was only 10 years old, his father sent him to work.  The boy becomes an apprentice mason.  He is instructed to carry tubs with a solution.  Two years later, he is taught to trim stones, and after three more he masters the craft and becomes a mason himself. </p><h2>  So good luck </h2><p>  This experience was useful to him in the future.  He was able to control the construction of his buildings without relying on other people's opinions.  Soon, Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev becomes a construction contractor.  He manages to make money.  Although there is a legend that he received his first capital by discovering a treasure in the safe of an abandoned house, which he himself once made, and therefore was able to open.  After a while, he buys a kerosene plant and, having created his own company, begins his own production. </p>

    <p>  Three years later, together with his friends, he rents land.  Companions began drilling wells.  Bibi Heybat was chosen as the place for oil production.  This land was not favorable to them, and nothing could be obtained from the wells.  The comrades decided to sell their shares, but Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiev was patient.  Finally, oil came from one of the wells.  Patience was rewarded.  Baku oil made many people rich, and Tagiyev was lucky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Skillful approach </h2><p>  He began to develop his craft and, first of all, paved a good way for him.  At the same time, Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiev was engaged in other sectors of entrepreneurial activity.  He invested money from oil production in other industries.  Seven years later, his company already owned thirty tithes of land, which also produced oil.  They were in Balakhna and Bibi Heybat.  To transport oil, Tagiyev bought two schooners.  For the storage of petroleum products rented several warehouses, one of which was located in Moscow. </p><h2>  Good connections </h2><p>  By the way, oil products were produced at its plants.  They made kerosene and lubricating oils.  At that time, the company "Mazut" was created.  She was engaged in trade in the Caspian-Black Sea direction and belonged to the Rothschilds.  Tagiyev put forward the idea that the Baku-Batumi oil pipeline was to be built.  It was built over 10 years and stretches for 800 kilometers.  He passed through the Kurin and Rion lowlands, the slopes of the Lesser Caucasus, at the foot of the Suram Fortress.  Thus, this pipeline connected the shores of the Caspian and Black Seas.  This was not the only project that Tagiyev carried out together with other capitalists.  They also created a horse-riding society and launched the first show jumping. </p><h2>  Haji Zenalabdin Tagiyev Cotton Factory </h2><p>  The Azerbaijani millionaire was not just rich, but also a respected person.  People treated him kindly because he cared for them.  For example, he did not just build a factory, but thought that those who would work at it would be comfortable.  He built a mosque, a school for children of workers.  Moreover, teachers paid a salary out of pocket.  A medical center and a pharmacy were opened for workers.  Tagiyev also made sure that the workers were engaged in self-education, attending evening courses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unexpected obstacle </h2><p>  Haji was not hardened in the competition.  He was still thinking of ordinary people, such as his father was.  But opening a factory was not so simple.  At that time in Russia there were several textile industries.  Their owners did not need competitors, especially those living in the land of cotton.  After all, proximity to raw materials made it possible to reduce the price of products, which means that textiles produced at the Tagiyev factory would be better sold.  The Bukhara emir, fearing for the loss of sales markets, proposed to Tagiyev to build a factory in Bukhara.  But Haji rejected his offer. </p><h2>  Good product </h2><p>  He wanted to open production in his homeland and even acquired a large piece of land in Javanshir county, where he began to intensively grow cotton to provide his factory with raw materials.  As a result, production was launched.  However, only coarse calico was made, making concessions to competitors, who were opposed to having other types of fabric produced at the factory. </p>

    <p>  But calico was in great demand, especially among Muslims.  After all, it was made in a Muslim factory by workers belonging to the same faith.  So, it was perfect for making traditional funeral robes and clothes for the repentance of people who go to worship in holy places.  The factory was equipped with the most modern technology of the time.  Although once competitors started a fire in a factory.  Yes, not everything was burned, but the damage was significant.  Equipment failed, finished goods warehouses died.  Over time, it was possible to re-establish production, and after a while Haji Zeynalabdin opened his second factory in Tiflis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tagiev Fisheries </h2><p>  The company of Haji Zeynalabdin had extensive interests.  She owned the fisheries of Dagestan.  For 300 kilometers from Makhachkala to the Caspian, fish were fished to increase Tagiyev‚Äôs income.  He also rented state fisheries in the Kura River.  Stellate sturgeon, beluga, sturgeon, salmon and other fish were caught in it.  Dagestan gave a big catch of herring.  Processed products at the Haji factory.  It produced caviar, which was delivered to Russia and Europe. </p><h2>  Millionaire‚Äôs family </h2><p>  What was the Tagiyev family?  He was married twice, and he had eight children.  With his first wife Zeynab, who, incidentally, was his cousin, he had two sons and a daughter.  (Ismail, Sadig and Khanym).  When his son Sadig married, Tagiyev liked the younger sister of his wife, Sona Arablinskaya.  She was the daughter of a lieutenant general of the Russian army.  He was in good standing with the king and was even awarded with golden weapons.  This fact helped his younger daughters to study at the <span>Smolny Institute</span> in St. Petersburg, where only daughters of khans and beks were accepted.  With her second wife, in addition to her three daughters - Surai, Sarah and Leila, Tagiyev had two sons - Ilyas and Mamed. </p><h2>  The twists and turns of fate </h2><p>  Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev lived a very long life.  The wife and children were forced to live in poverty after his death.  In our country, there was just a period of Sovietization.  After the death of a millionaire, his family was deprived of all means of livelihood and thrown into the street.  His wife Sona died in dire poverty in 1932.  Relatives refused her, but she did not blame anyone for her kindness.  She knew how her support could turn out for them. </p>

    <p>  Leyla, the eldest daughter of Haji, was able to emigrate to Istanbul with her husband, which saved them from death.  Although the father was very upset by this news.  The middle daughter, Sarah, was suspected of preparing to kill Kirov, was arrested and spent two years in a prison in St. Petersburg.  In 1941, her daughter Safia was already exiled to Sterlitamak, where she left with her husband and children.  The youngest daughter lived all her life in Baku with her husband, who worked as a dentist.  Sons Ilyas and Mammad died.  Ilyas died in prison. </p><h2>  Forgiveness </h2><p>  Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiev was known for his philanthropy.  His wife was engaged in charity.  She was a guardian of educational institutions, organized charitable gatherings, helped those in need.  Interestingly, her daughter Sarah was not hardened.  She returned to Baku after the death of Stalin and began to try to restore the good name of her father.  However, nothing could be done.  Officials were deaf to her requests.  In turn, her daughter Safia was able to establish a charity fund named after her mother.  She began to collect money and send it to needy patients, children and the elderly.  Her daughter Camilla also continues this tradition, although it is very difficult to do charity in our time. </p><h2>  Only here </h2><p>  Why didn‚Äôt Tagiyev leave the country and save his family, as many rich people did?  The fact is that he really loved his homeland, Azerbaijan.  And although there were rumors that he wanted to leave for Turkey, he refuted them.  Tagiyev was deprived of all his wealth.  They didn‚Äôt even let him live in his city house, but he was already on the verge of a very old age.  But nevertheless, he took into account his merits to the Azerbaijani people and allowed him to spend the last days at the cottage in Mardakan.  His family also moved there. </p><h2>  As I wanted </h2><p>  During his lifetime, he honored the mall Abuturab, who told Tagiyev that he had to be prepared for the vicissitudes of fate and the loss of wealth, and asked him to think more about the eternal.  These words have come true to some extent.  Therefore, Tagiyev bequeathed to bury him near Abuturab.  This request was granted, and he found peace in the cemetery in Mardakan.  A mausoleum was built over his grave, which collapsed over time.  But Haji Zeynalabdin is alive in the memory of the people of Azerbaijan. </p><h2>  So it was before </h2><p>  Not every person will endure the loss of his wealth.  Especially if what he owned was as great as Tagiyev‚Äôs.  But in addition to money, he owned several buildings.  In the center of Baku, he had his own palace.  Its roof was decorated with giant domes.  Now it houses the museum of Azerbaijan.  Arriving in Moscow, Tagiyev stayed in his house, built near the Lenin Library.  The building had 4 floors and was decorated with four brightly shining gas lanterns.  Tagiev had factories, plants, cars, fishing, trading and passenger ships, mills.  In addition, he owned a country estate in Mardakan, he had representative offices in other countries. </p><h2>  Good deeds </h2><p>  Haji Zeynalabdin did not boast of his wealth.  In his house he kept an old ax, which he has remained with since the time when he was a simple mason.  He reminded him of the vicissitudes of fate and that prosperity could be lost at any moment.  Tagiev always helped people and did not forget that he himself came from a poor, simple family. </p>

    <p>  Haji regularly made donations for good purposes.  There are records of exactly what amounts he donated.  For example, he transferred 50,000 rubles to a commercial school, in which Muslim children studied.  He helped orphans, widows, sick people.  With his money, the building of a Muslim charitable society in St. Petersburg was built.  He donated for the repair of mosques, the improvement of the cemetery.  55,000 rubles were transferred for the construction of a madrasah in Tehran.  The Russian school for women "Saint Nina" received 5,000 rubles from him. </p><h2>  For the sake of people </h2><p>  Tagiev was the honorary chairman of charitable societies.  He built schools and placed great emphasis on youth education.  Particularly talented, he paid for studies at universities in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan.  In this article, we touch upon interesting facts from Tagiyev‚Äôs life.  One of them is that he gave the building of his five-story mill to a prison.  The fact is that earlier prisoners were kept on the island, and it was very difficult for relatives to get there.  So Tagiyev found such an interesting solution to this problem.  In addition, Haji Zeynalabdin contributed to the translation of the Koran into the Azerbaijani language.  At his own expense these books were printed. </p><h2>  So can you </h2><p>  The first female school in Baku is also Tagiyev‚Äôs merit.  Although on his way he met many obstacles.  The clergy were against this venture.  Therefore, Haji was forced to send a pier to Mirz Muhammad for permission to open a Muslim women's school to respected muhtahids.  It was received, and a school was built with Tagiyev‚Äôs money.  Muslims did not have female schools before.  Therefore, it was an innovation of the time.  The school building was very beautiful.  About a hundred girls were accepted for training.  Moreover, children from poor families were exempted from paying tuition.  Costs compensated Tagiyev.  The director was Ganifa Melikova. </p><h2>  Honorary Award </h2><p>  The girls did not just study, they lived at school and met with relatives only once a week.  Tagiev was proud of his brainchild.  At graduation, he always prepared gifts for girls, among which were books, souvenirs, dresses.  Tagiev was very fond of books.  He helped put together a great school library.  And in it were not only books, but also newspapers and magazines. </p>

    <p>  A few years later, there were already several female schools in Baku.  Few people know that for his services to Russia Tagiyev was awarded the title of "real state adviser."  He got it deservedly.  After all, during his life he made a considerable contribution to the development of education and culture of the country.  The title of ‚ÄúState Counselor‚Äù gave the owner many advantages.  ‚ÄúYour Excellency‚Äù was supposed to contact the person who possessed them; he could hold high positions in the public service. </p><h2>  To live well </h2><p>  Haji Zeynalabdin always cared for his hometown.  He knew his problems and tried to solve them.  In an effort to green Baku, he thought that for this it was necessary to first train specialists, so he opened a school of florists and gardeners.  In the sandstone he laid an experimental grove.  Also in the city there was a problem of water supply.  Therefore, Tagiyev decided to lay a water supply.  To do this, he entered into an agreement with a foreign company.  Well-known specialist William Lindley begins to search for water in the vicinity of Baku.  He finds her 190 kilometers from the city.  The city government opposed the plumbing.  But Tagiyev insisted on his own, especially since he invested his own money in this business.  As a result, the water supply system was built, and Haji received gratitude from the people. </p><h2>  Share with others </h2><p>  Tagiev is known not only for his kindness, but also for wisdom.  In times of terrible famine, when those who had grain profited from the misfortunes of other people by selling it at exorbitant prices, Tagiyev built four barns that he filled to the top with rice, flour, wheat and barley.  He distributed all this grain to needy for free.  One legend speaks of the wisdom of Haji.  One day he found out that there was no demand for fish in the city.  Because of this, the fishermen refused to go to work.  Then Tagiyev went to the place of fishing, took live fish from the fisherman and put his diamond ring in her mouth.  After that, he released the fish back into the water and promised to give this ring to whoever finds it.  Rumors quickly spread around the city, so people started buying fish, hoping to become owners of expensive jewelry. </p><h2>  Diverse interests </h2><p>  Tagiyev built a drama theater in Baku with his own money.  For the first time, women began performing on its stage.  After 30 years, the theater celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the first theatrical production.  The solemn march to this event was written by <span>Uzeyir Hajibeyov.</span>  During the performance of this work, a well-known philanthropist appeared on the scene.  The artists parted before him in deference.  The audience applauded while standing. </p>

    <p>  Tagiyev was educating the people, very fond of communicating with intelligent, educated people.  Therefore, the arrival in Baku D.I.  He took Mendeleev as a holiday.  The scientist was interested in Baku oil.  Haji Zeynalabdin warmly received him.  Tagiyev‚Äôs house became the venue for a gala dinner.  The owner took a picture with the guest and took an autograph from him.  This photo was on his desk in his office.  And Mendeleev mentioned Tagiev in the article ‚ÄúOil‚Äù in the dictionary of Brockhaus and Nephron. </p><h2>  Was there a conflict? </h2><p>  Interesting relationship Haji with Emperor Alexander III.  As a worthy believer Tagiyev was chosen as a representative of Muslims from the Caucasus at the coronation of the king.  During the ceremony, he was dressed in national Muslim attire.  He was wearing a hat, an archalug, a plague, a charyka.  In his hands he held a towel on which there was bread and salt.  The Prime Minister introduced him as a representative of the wild people.  In response, Tagiyev said that his people have a rich history and not at all wild.  The second unpleasant incident occurred when Alexander III came to Baku.  The station and the city were decorated before the arrival of the king.  A crowd of people was waiting for their emperor.  Tagiyev did not remove his hat from his head when he saw Alexander III, as other people did.  The emperor was unhappy with this.  Therefore, he went to Haji to clarify whose subject he was.  And although Tagiyev was prompted to answer that he was served by his Majesty, he answered in his own way that he was a subject of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Free lunches </h2><p>  From this article, you learned who Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev is.  Charity was in his blood.  He could not help but do good deeds.  Also rumors of his unprecedented generosity reach our days.  One of the stories tells of what happened once in Germany when Tagiyev arrived there.  In one of the restaurants where he went to dine, he was in no hurry to serve him.  A man of eastern appearance and in ordinary clothes did not evoke respect from the local waiters. </p>

    <p>  But Tagiyev was not so simple.  Together with him was a translator who helped Haji communicate with the owner of the restaurant.  First, he found out the cost of lunch at the institution, then asked to calculate how much lunch costs for 20 people.  Then he asked how much lunch would cost for one hundred people for one hundred years.  The figure was stunning.  But Tagiyev was not embarrassed, and he paid for lunch for every Azerbaijani who came to this restaurant for a hundred years.  This contract was concluded in 1911.  Its action ended in 2011, about which a letter from <span>the German Embassy</span> came to Azerbaijan <span>.</span> </p><p>  That was such an interesting and difficult fate for a man who could become a millionaire and lose everything again.  Surely Tagiyev‚Äôs house was hospitable and hospitable, since the owner loved people and helped them so much.  Haji Zeynalabdin has repeatedly said that he honors his religion and respects its laws, therefore he holds his right hand on the Koran.  But at the same time, his left hand rests on the newspaper, which means moving forward, towards progress. </p>
