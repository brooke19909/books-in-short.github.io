This is due to the fact that people want to get really productive equipment for little money.  Some models are of good quality, they are in many ways superior to the options offered by Europe and America.  Great examples are Xiaomi, Huawei, Asus.  Consider the ranking of the best models from China, analyzing their positive and negative sides.  The price tag of all the devices described below does not exceed 6 thousand - 20 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Huawei MediaPad M3 </h2><p>  Consider one of the best Chinese tablets that works with an 8.4-inch matrix and a resolution of 2560 by 1600. The device has 4 GB of RAM, which is enough to run even the most complex games and applications. </p><p>  The device has a processor that runs on 8 cores, each of which accelerates to 2.3 GHz.  The battery is not too capacious, only 5100 mAh, but even with this indicator, the device can work all day with moderate use.  This result is ensured by optimizing the applications and the shell itself.  You can purchase a device for 25 thousand rubles.  Charging takes a long time, but this is not considered a disadvantage in this price category. </p><p>  Of the advantages, two SIM cards should be distinguished, support for various data transfer options, reliable assembly, a metal-framed case, gaming capabilities, fast operation, a hardware platform and a well-functioning screen. </p><h2>  Xiaomi MiPad 3 </h2><p>  This Chinese tablet has a good display, excellent hardware component, and good build.  The device can be bought for 20 thousand rubles.  Powered by a 6-core processor, frequency 2100 MHz.  The graphics chip and 4 GB RAM allow you to use the device perfectly in any situation.  This tablet has a matrix with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels, a screen of 7.9 inches.  Color reproduction is as good as possible, brightness is high.  Of the advantages, one should also note the minimalistic design, good memory, materials from which the body is made, autonomy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="widgetcity.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese tablet samsung" class="if uuid-2510845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510845.jpg"></div><h2>  Lenovo Tab 3 Plus </h2><p>  This device costs only 15 thousand rubles.  For this money, a person gets 3 GB of RAM, an excellent graphical shell, an 8-inch matrix.  Screen resolution represented by Full HD.  There are two slots for SIM cards.  However, some disadvantages should be noted: the screen is easily soiled, so it will always have to be either wiped or covered with a protective glass.  The rest of the device is good, especially when it comes to gaming nuances.  It perfectly withstands long sessions in heavy games.  Autonomy is not bad, the display has good quality and excellent color reproduction.  The sound is good.  All buyers believe that this Chinese tablet in itself ideally correlates price and functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy n8000 chinese tablet" class="if uuid-2510847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510847.jpg"></div><h2>  Asus ZenPad 10 </h2><p>  This device has gained its popularity because it has a new version of the Android 6.0 operating system installed.  The quality of this device is at a high level.  RAM is 2 GB, built-in 32 GB.  The tablet has a 10-inch diagonal, supports a SIM card and data transfer type LTE.  That is why all people are free to use social networks and browse websites on the Internet at high speed.  Autonomy is at a high level, without difficulty the tablet is able to work for about 9 hours even with a heavy load. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, there is a drawback.  It lies in the fact that the device takes a long time to charge.  You also need to highlight the fact that this Chinese tablet has a lot of ‚Äúpre-installed‚Äù software preinstalled.  Also worth highlighting are good speakers, 10-touch multi-touch, good build and a beautiful screen.  The processor also runs fast, and no one complains about its functionality. </p><h2>  Chuwi Hi10 Plus </h2><p>  At the moment, this device is not widely popular, but they are also buying it.  The device is done pretty well, has 4 GB of RAM, the processor runs on 4 cores, the frequency of which is 1.4 GHz.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã10.8 inches.  Resolution 1920 by 1280. The battery is capacious, but the main camera has a 2 megapixel module.  A nice plus is that Android is installed on top of Windows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techtablets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy tablet chinese" class="if uuid-2510849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510849.jpg"></div><h2>  4Good T101i </h2><p>  This device has its drawbacks, but there are still more advantages.  RAM 2 GB, the processor runs on 4 cores, the frequency of which is 1330 MHz.  The battery is capacious, there is a special docking station with a keyboard.  The matrix received HD-resolution, and the display - 10.1 inches. </p><p>  Of the shortcomings, it should be noted that the battery life is too small, the processor overheats when charging, and the assembly is of poor quality.  However, the presence of Windows 10, a good keyboard, an excellent hardware platform allow you to add this device to the top of the best Chinese tablets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bb-mobile Techno 10.1 </h2><p>  This device runs on Windows 10 and is completely inexpensive.  Outside of China, this device is not particularly in demand, but this does not mean that it is of poor quality.  This tablet has a good build, the processor is designed for 4 cores, each of which operates with a frequency of 1.44 GHz.  RAM 2Gb, built-in 32Gb.  The keyboard is of good quality.  The matrix received a size of 10.1 inches.  The cost of the device is not more than 12 thousand rubles.  Of the shortcomings, it should be noted that there is not enough memory when working with a huge amount of information.  Of the pluses, battery life, good hardware, good build and excellent appearance are noted. </p><h2>  Cube t8 </h2><p>  If a person wants to have a good tablet with a small screen, then you can purchase this device.  The diagonal is 8 inches.  The device works with Android 5.1 operating system.  Performance is good.  RAM is only 1 GB, so you should not count on the fact that the phone will pull resource-intensive games.  The matrix has 8 inches, as already mentioned, a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels.  This will be enough to comfortably watch movies and play.  Another advantage is the support for two SIM-cards, as well as LTE networks.  Autonomy at an average level, but this is fully explained by the low cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xiaomitoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese tablets galaxy note" class="if uuid-2510852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510852.jpg"></div><h2>  Bb-mobile techno 8.0 </h2><p>  Another good device that runs on Android 5.1 will be BB-Mobile Techno 8.0.  An eight-core processor is installed here, as well as 2 GB of RAM.  Such iron is not the most powerful, but for the price of 10 thousand rubles this will be quite enough.  The set provides a film, styluses, case.  In addition, the device is sometimes equipped with a cleaning cloth.  The camera has 8 megapixels, which allows you to take good pictures in natural light.  The only thing that can be noted as a drawback is unreliable trays for SIM-cards and microSD.  If you read reviews about the tablet, you will notice a lot of comments that they are easy to break.  In addition, the cover is metal. </p><h2>  Digma Plane 1601 </h2><p>  This device can be bought for 6 thousand rubles.  However, the device does not have the best characteristics.  The processor is designed for 4 cores, RAM is only 1 GB.  The latter may not be enough to play resource-intensive applications.  However, if a person does not need a lot from the tablet, but just needs hassle-free work with text editors, then this will be quite enough. </p><p>  The speaker has poor performance, it sounds terrible, the battery life is short.  Of the advantages, you need to allocate a good memory card, 2 slots for a SIM card and support for undemanding games.  The screen is beautiful. </p><h2>  <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Note N8000 Tablet </h2><p>  Many will be surprised that this list contains a tablet from Samsung.  However, we will not talk about the original model, but about a fake.  First, consider the characteristics that a true model provides. </p><p>  The processor runs on 4 cores.  RAM 2 Gb, built-in 64 Gb.  The screen is 10.1 ".  Screen resolution - 1280 by 800. There are 2 cameras, the main and front.  The case works with a separate keyboard.  Introduced features such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and others. </p><p>  It should be noted that the original model will cost more than 20 thousand rubles.  But the Chinese Samsung tablet can be purchased for only 10 thousand. Of course, the question arises: why? </p><div class="photo" data-original="a1dev.wishmesh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chinese tablet galaxy" class="if uuid-2510853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510853.jpg"></div><h2>  How to distinguish a fake from the original? </h2><p>  When buying a device, you must always pay attention to the warranty card, the book in which the instructions for the device are written, the battery level, and you should also try the device in operation. </p><ul><li>  In the original model, the camera will be in the center, and in the Chinese version it will be in the corner. </li><li>  You need to pay attention to screen resolution.  Samsung's Chinese tablet has a score of 960 by 600. The first thing to watch out for is the application shortcuts and app icons. </li><li>  All fake <span>tablet models</span> do not have GPS. </li><li>  All Samsung devices will have a variety of applications downloaded from the manufacturer.  In the Chinese tablet Galaxy N800, this will not happen, since the functionality is greatly reduced. </li><li>  At the moment, the IMEI code is no longer the main indicator of fake, but it is registered on all new devices.  The fake has instead written unknown, which means ‚Äúunknown‚Äù. </li><li>  Another surefire way to find out if a tablet is fake or not is to connect it to the Kies program, which can be downloaded from the manufacturer‚Äôs official website.  If Samsung Galaxy is a Chinese tablet, then the device will not be recognized. </li></ul><h2>  How to check the tablet at home? </h2><p>  A pretty topical issue will be how to check the tablet while at home.  As a rule, there will be no difficulties in the operation of the device.  Most light games do not freeze, applications run fine.  That is why any Chinese Galaxy Note tablet can withstand several hours of work with Wi-Fi and watching videos.  However, the battery will be discharged quite quickly, sometimes the percentage of charge may jump, which at first looks like a problem with the operating system. </p><p>  You also need to pay attention to the device‚Äôs memory.  When connected to a computer, it will not recognize 64 Gb, but 2 Gb.  In addition, the computer will not see the Chinese N8000 tablet as the one that runs on Android. </p><p>  Therefore, you can try to download drivers from the official site.  To do this, you need to download the program Samsung Kies 3. However, this program will not recognize the device if it is made in China.  You can also perform a full reset, which sometimes helps in the presence of such problems.  However, if no results are obtained, it follows that the purchased Note N8000 is a Chinese tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.leicke.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung n8000 chinese tablet" class="if uuid-2510855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510855.jpg"></div><h2>  Some nuances </h2><p>  When buying a device, it is best to pay attention to all the documents that are provided with the device.  At first glance, the amount, printing, laying in the corner of the warranty card: everything will coincide and done according to the rules.  However, if you take a closer look, you will notice that the book will come from a completely different device from Samsung from the Galaxy series, but this is for Note.  Also, the IMEI code will not be registered.  This is how the Chinese tablet Samsung N8000 can be distinguished from the original. </p><p>  Again, you need to pay attention to the size of the shortcuts, which will indicate the screen resolution.  If they are too large, then obviously the screen resolution does not correspond to the specifications declared by the manufacturer. </p><p>  The basic settings of the tablet, if you look at them in the menu, will correspond to those declared by Samsung, however there is no guarantee that these data are adequate. </p><p>  There are also some markings on the back cover.  The original record at the bottom of the device must be made with paint.  If it is glued, then the device is a Chinese Galaxy tablet.  Therefore, you should be extremely careful when buying, so as not to buy a fake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homeshopping.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="note n8000 chinese tablet" class="if uuid-2510857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2510857.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Such mobile devices will help to improve the life of every person.  This article describes the most interesting and noteworthy models.  They are completely inexpensive, but they have their pros and cons.  Among all the options described above, there are both modern models released quite recently, and older ones that have proven themselves over time.
