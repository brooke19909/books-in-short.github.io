Those who have ever visited this wonderful place will certainly be fascinated and will want to know more facts related to it.  And the chronicle is no less fascinating than the picturesque bay. </p><h2>  Description of Sevastopol Bay </h2><p>  The bay occupies a place on the northern shore of the Heracles Peninsula.  It has many daughter bays, separated by capes.  In general, it stretches for 7.5 kilometers.  Its steep banks look very picturesque and majestic.  It was here that the once-famous city of <span>Tauric Chersonesos</span> was laid <span>,</span> which is of historical value. </p><p>  The bottom, consisting of silt, alluvial alumina, crushed stone and iron oxide, as well as rocky shores, creates favorable soil in order to build marinas near the shore and not to pre-beat fires. </p><p>  When the city of <span>Sevastopol</span> was founded, the <span>Sevastopol bay</span> and got its current name.  Prior to this, she changed several names, which were mainly associated with its size or with the names of the settlements that were located nearby. </p><p>  The average depth of the Sevastopol Bay is 12.5 meters, and the maximum is 21 meters. </p><h2>  Bay fauna </h2><p>  For the Crimean peninsula, the Sevastopol Bay has not only cultural, historical and military, but also industrial significance.  Oddly enough this sounds, but it is here that some species of fish, such as red mullet and Mediterranean horse mackerel, are caught on an industrial scale.  After the collapse of the USSR, the number of this fish increased significantly.  In total, there are about 131 species of fish in the bay, while their species and abundance are constantly changing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Migrations and changes in species in the waters of the bay have many reasons.  Some fish just go to winter, others come here along with the ballast waters of the ships, then take root and begin to breed.  By the way, blue whiting was also found here, which usually prefers much more salty water. </p><h2>  Monument to the Scuttled Ships </h2><p>  Near Primorsky Boulevard there is a monument that attracts the eyes of tourists with its unusually beautiful appearance and some kind of romance inherent in it.  However, in addition to this, it also has an interesting history, since it is dedicated to an unusual historical event: the Sevastopol defense of 1854-1855. </p>

    <p>  At that distant time, military operations were going on and the Russian fleet opposed the Anglo-French.  The latter had a significant advantage both in the number of military units and in their power and maneuverability.  The enemy had motor ships, and only <span>sailing ships</span> were present in our fleet <span>.</span>  Then Prince <span>Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov</span> makes a difficult decision: to block the entrance to the bay by flooding several warships and keep the city defense to the last.  At first, his decision was perceived with indignation, but subsequently the military council recognized him as the only true one. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Five <span>battleships</span> and a couple of frigates were sunk at the entrance to the bay.  The defense of the city began, which lasted almost a year.  Gradually, the fortifications were damaged by storms, and over time several more ships were flooded.  Their crews then defended the city on the bastions.  In total, 75 warships and 16 auxiliary vessels were sunk in this place. </p><h2>  Ships in the Sevastopol Bay </h2><p>  Today, the bay is based not only military, but also civilian, patrol, hospital ships.  Upon arrival in Sevastopol, every tourist should definitely visit the bay and go on a sea excursion.  Here you will not only get the opportunity to ride on the sea by boat, but also learn a lot of interesting things.  For example, what are the most significant ships in the Sevastopol Bay?  Undoubtedly, after reading the background information, you can understand that it would be most interesting to see live: </p><ul><li>  ship "Getman Sagaidachny"; </li><li>  patrol ship "Ladny"; </li><li>  missile cruiser "Moscow"; </li><li>  landing ship "Yamal"; </li><li>  reconnaissance ship "Azov"; </li><li>  hospital ship "Yenisei"; </li><li>  demagnetization vessel "SR-137" and many others. </li></ul>

    <p>  It is interesting that some ships can be seen right from the promenade, however, in order to see the most interesting, you still need a boat trip. </p><h2>  Graf Marina </h2><p>  It is Grafskaya Marina that is considered to be the front door of the entire Black Sea Port.  This place has long been chosen for walks not only by tourists, but also by local residents.  It is from the pier that offers an excellent view of the Sevastopol Bay.  From here on the right side you can immediately observe the many warships of the Russian fleet. </p>

    <p>  The place itself makes an unforgettable impression, because the grandeur of the white colonnades is complemented by a strict view of the military constantly present here.  With bated breath, you can watch how in the evening sunset the legendary historical place - Sevastopol Bay - looks charming. </p><h2>  Transport Ways of Communication </h2><p>  As already noted, the Sevastopol Bay is not only of great military importance.  She plays an important role in the development and maintenance of transport infrastructure.  After all, the north and south of Sevastopol to this day are not connected by a bridge, and the only way from one part of the city to another is by sea. </p>
