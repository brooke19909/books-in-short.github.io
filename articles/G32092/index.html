    <h2>  Guest reviews are negative </h2><p>  Unfortunately, <span>the Panorama Hotel (Vityazevo)</span> has not only positive <span>reviews</span> .  But there are not so many negative ones, fortunately. </p><ul><li>  Some guests considered the lack of breakfast in the room rate a drawback. </li><li>  Someone did not like the lack of an elevator. </li><li>  Some are unhappy with the small size of the pool.  In fact, only children could swim in it. </li><li>  Some vacationers noted the lack of high prices in the restaurant. </li><li>  Someone complained that sometimes they had to remind maintenance staff to add liquid soap in the bathroom or bring toilet paper. </li><li>  There were guests who complained about the poor work of WIFI in the room. </li><li>  There was a precedent when tourists had to wait until the previous guest left the room. </li><li>  Not all rooms have balconies, and whoever had a balcony would like to have a table there. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to separately note that <span>the Panorama Hotel (Anapa, Vityazevo) was</span> built in accordance with unique technologies specially developed for earthquake-prone zones, therefore the building is safe in all respects.  The facade is faced with juicy beige color composite material.  Hotel Panorama is, of course, an adornment of the resort village of Vityazevo.  Here you will get a lot of pleasant impressions and vivid memories. </p>
