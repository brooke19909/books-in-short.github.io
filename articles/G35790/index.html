At all times there was a tradition when mother herself sewed toys for her children.  <span>The textile dolls of the</span> Bigfoot will undoubtedly appeal to young fashionistas.  Older girls can get to work with their mother.  This will be a very interesting collaboration experience that can bring mother and daughter together for a long time. </p><h2>  Material </h2><p>  Any big-legged doll starts with a project.  At this stage, you need to decide on the materials for making the toy.  A special knitwear is now available for sewing dolls.  It is pre-painted in <span>flesh color, it</span> remains only to choose your favorite shade.  There are 2 types of fabric of this kind.  Thinner - designed for sewing the head.  It has a small margin of elasticity, sufficient so that there are no extra folds.  2 view - a little denser, more suitable for the body and limbs. </p><p>  Fleece fabric can be used for the doll's body - this is a very soft, fleecy artificial knitwear.  The toy is tender and pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  For an environmentally friendly doll, you can use flax.  This is a wonderful material; it absorbs moisture well and allows air to pass through.  Be sure to keep in mind that after the first wash, the flax sits.  It is better to wash the canvas in advance, and only then cut the doll on it. </p>

    <h2>  Stuffing </h2><p>  Tilda's doll The big-foot is packed in several stages, each part is separate, there are very thin, hard-to-reach spots.  It is very important to choose the right material so that the packing is even.  All materials can be divided into natural and artificial.  Now is the period of general enthusiasm for environmental friendliness, so many people stuff dolls with wool.  The product is very soft, if you break the fiber into small pieces, you can achieve uniformity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The coat is beautiful, but it has its drawbacks.  Watch your child carefully for several days; allergies can occur to the coat.  In this case, it is necessary to replace the filler with a holofiber.  This is, although synthetic, but hypoallergenic.  Filling them is very convenient, because it already consists of small particles. </p><p>  For greater stability, many dolls prefer to stack piles with something heavy.  It can be silica gel, cereals or small sea stones. </p><h2>  Patterns </h2><p>  There are several options for cutting.  In the first embodiment, each part is cut separately.  Then the doll is gradually assembled into a single whole.  Sewing the head to the body is more difficult.  If you do this job incorrectly, your head will hang out.  Have to work out well before you get a good option. </p><p>  Pattern dolls Big-legged with one-piece head is much easier to perform.  You don‚Äôt have to torment by sewing it to the neck.  This option is especially useful for beginner needlewomen, will help to gain self-confidence and not quit work halfway. </p>

    <h2>  Stitching </h2><p>  Transfer the selected pattern first to the paper, then to the fabric itself.  When cutting, do not forget to add space for seams, about 1 cm. When all the details are cut, you can start stitching.  If you have a pattern of a Big-legged doll with a whole-cut head, we sew it, starting from the bottom edge, when the narrow part is sewn, you can fill your head in advance, it will be easier and more convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Handles are stuffed over the shoulder.  We sew the leg, starting from the bottom, so that in the end it remains only to sew the foot.  For the stability of the doll in the foot, you can put a piece of plastic or thick cardboard.  Only then finish the job.  To push the filler into bottlenecks - such as legs, pens, especially fingers, use Chinese sticks or thick wooden knitting needles. </p><p>  In order to assemble all the details into a single whole, special doll mounts are used.  Handles and legs turn out mobile.  You can use simple buttons.  We attach both legs at once, on top of the buttons and sew the doll through and through. </p><p>  There is another way to stitch a Big-Bear doll.  We transfer the patterns to a fabric folded in half, and immediately sew on a sewing machine.  Just do not forget to leave a place for stuffing.  After stitching, it remains to cut the finished parts. </p>

    <h2>  How to fill your head </h2><p>  To keep the head in good shape, you can take a foam ball as the basis.  If this is not the case, roll up a thick lump from the old newspaper and paste over it with papier-m√¢ch√©.  The workpiece is tightly wrapped with filler.  At this stage, the synthetic winterizer is best suited.  Now we push the whole structure all the way to the throat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To make the doll Big Nose get a nose, take a clerical pin.  We put glue on the tip and wind a small piece of padding polyester on it.  For strength, wrap the base with thread.  The resulting blank is inserted into the <span>foam ball</span> inside the doll.  From above only a small tubercle of the spout will be visible. </p><p>  The last step remains.  With a bait stitch, we pass along the upper edge and tighten.  To fasten, we make a few more stitches.  The head is ready.  Now we roll up another dense roll of synthetic winterizer, it must be inserted into the neck of the doll.  It should fit as tightly as possible to the ball of the head.  Now you can stuff the rest of the body. </p><h2>  Choose hair </h2><p>  The Big-legged doll loves beautiful hairstyles.  There are several options for making hair.  The simplest is ordinary yarn.  The presence of a large number of colors and textures gives room for imagination.  A doll can turn out curly, and shaggy, and with a classic tail. </p><p>  Professionals often use artificial hair.  In specialized stores there is a huge selection of hair specifically for dolls.  If you could not find them, use tresses, or wigs for people.  You can also find ready-made doll hairstyles on sale, you just have to stick them to the head. </p><p>  For a small doll, you can use natural wool for felting.  A very cute fluff is obtained on the head.  Hair dolls can be made of satin ribbons, loosening them. </p>

    <h2>  How to grow hair </h2><p>  How to attach <span>hair to a</span> Big-legged <span>doll</span> ?  The master class will introduce you in detail.  To begin, consider hair from threads.  First of all, you need to decide what hairstyle the doll will have.  If a parting is supposed to be in the middle, then we start with a parting.  If the hair is pulled back or freely falls on the shoulders, we start the firmware from the forehead.  We cut the strand into equal segments with a fold in the middle - this is the length of the hair.  Sew on a string in rows. </p><p>  Artificial hair is usually glued.  To do this, you need a hot glue gun or ordinary transparent super-glue.  Hair is glued in convergent circles to the crown.  We smear glue on the head with an even strip, and apply hair in small locks.  Remember to protect your hands with gloves.  The glue is very difficult to rub. </p><p>  Hair from wool can also be glued, or it can be torn using a special needle.  The wool is mixed with the filler inside the head and the hair will hold firmly. </p><h2>  Face </h2><p>  Eyes are a mirror of the soul, what kind of doll will it be?  Doll Big-footed, created with his own hands, most often instead of an eye has 2 simple black beads.  It seems nothing special, but it looks very nice, especially if you lightly brown your cheeks. </p><p>  Some craftswomen pay much more attention to the faces of their creations.  Carefully traced eyes look like alive.  Such a doll always has a special character.  We draw eyes for the dolls Big-legged, a master class in the photo below.  It shows you step by step how to draw eyes.  Paints are used mainly acrylic, they can be bought at any store for creativity.  Designer dolls have not only painted eyes, but also lips, cheeks, sometimes freckles or moles.  Before you start drawing, practice on paper. </p>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  The Big-legged doll loves to dress smartly.  Here you can not do without additional accessories.  A distinctive feature of the doll is that it never walks barefoot.  The simplest shoes can be sewn by yourself.  Often, shoes for babies or booties in the form of boots are suitable for her.  Beautiful shoes are sold in specialized stores for puppeteers. </p><p>  Depending on the project, the doll may need a hat or a crown, cute little headphones.  A handbag thrown over your shoulder will add additional charm.  Ruffles and lace will help to create a cute girlish look.  If the doll is intended for a small girl, try to avoid too small details.  Do not use beads and sequins, and beads are suitable only for the eyes. </p><p>  Despite the same patterns, two identical dolls never work.  Each craftswoman brings something of her own, and the doll acquires individuality. </p>
