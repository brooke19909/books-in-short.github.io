  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fundamentals of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>A democratic political regime</span> implies that all members of society are subject to the constitution and state law.  The government must exercise its power, adhering to certain principles.  The most important of them are the foundations of the constitutional system.  Democracy combines sovereignty, federalism, democracy, state, local power, as well as the freedoms and rights of citizens. </p><p>  The constitutional system is the fundamental social relations that are regulated by legal norms.  It is characterized by a whole system of principles: </p><p>  - <span>separation of powers</span> ; </p><p>  - freedom and human rights; </p><p>  - federated device; </p><p>  - secular and social characters of the state; </p><p>  - the rule of law; </p><p>  - democracy; </p><p>  - state sovereignty; </p><p>  - republican form of government; </p><p>  - freedom of activity; </p><p>  - ideological and political diversity; </p><p>  - a single economic space. </p><p>  1. The social foundations of the constitutional system.  Russia is a state whose policy is aimed at building conditions that can ensure free development and a decent life for people.  The government operates in the following areas: </p><p>  - definition and guarantee of the minimum wage; </p><p>  - human labor protection; </p><p>  - free medical care; </p><p>  - state support for families, fatherhood, motherhood, childhood, senior citizens and people with disabilities; </p><p>  - development of social services systems; </p><p>  - pensions, various benefits and guarantees. </p><p>  2. The economic foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation.  Guarantee of a single economic space, support for competition, free movement of finances, services and goods, freedom of activity.  In Russia, all types of property are protected: private, <span>municipal, state</span> , etc.  The rights of individual entrepreneurs are protected by law.  All <span>natural resources,</span> as well as land, are used in the Russian Federation.  They are protected, as they are the basis of life and activity.  All peoples located on the <span>territory of Russia</span> can legally use them, engage in agriculture and production.  Natural resources are in state, private, municipal and other forms of ownership.  Russian citizens have the right to be land owners.  Owners are free to dispose of natural resources if the legitimate interests and rights of others are not violated. </p><p>  The welfare state should provide a person with free development and a decent life.  The government provides: a living wage, personal security, access to cultural property, social security, medical care, the ability to enjoy social and material benefits, housing, etc.  A decent life involves free mental, physical, and moral self-improvement. </p><p>  <span>The foundations of the constitutional</span> system ensure the equality and sovereignty of the nations that reside in Russia.  People are free to express their will.  Equality means that all nations have the same rights in matters of state building, national language, culture, literature. </p><p>  The foundations of the constitutional system determine the form of government in our country.  Russia is a <span>mixed republic;</span> it simultaneously has the features of a parliamentary and presidential republic.  <span>Local government and state power</span> in the country are elected by the population.  Through this method, the principle of democracy is realized. </p><p>  The Russian Federation is a constitutional state in which several religions and creeds officially exist.  People themselves choose which god to worship.  The state guarantees citizens freedom of religion and conscience. </p>
