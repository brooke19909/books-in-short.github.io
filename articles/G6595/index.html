  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to protect Apple‚Äôs latest gadget? Cases for iPhone 6</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unless heard of the sixth iPhone, perhaps in uncivilized countries - it has become one of the most anticipated hits in the world of gadgets and one of the flagships of the mobile market.  If you were fortunate enough to acquire the miracle of technology from Apple, then you probably already wondered where to look <noindex>  <span>cases for iPhone 6</span> </noindex>  which ones are better and why.  If you didn‚Äôt think about it, it's time!  After all, an ultrathin and high-tech iPhone of the sixth generation is subject to many risks. </p><h2>  What can threaten an iPhone during operation? </h2><ul><li>  First of all, the danger is accidental bumps, falls, contact with scratching solid objects.  It is unlikely that you want your iPhone to have an annoying scratch, chip, or, even worse, a crack in the case or screen.  Of course, you can always contact the service center, but why spend the extra money if you have already developed and marketed cases for iphone 6?  By the way, the design of the case can be any, so this is also a good way to stand out among other owners of this device. </li><li>  There are other risks.  You do not need to be a specialist in mobile technologies to guess that the ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone will react extremely negatively to dust, moisture, dirt and other negative effects from the outside.  Do not rely on luck and expect that contact with the environment will take place without consequences - gradually there will be no trace of the ideal appearance, and sooner or later the functionality of the device will necessarily be disrupted, forcing you to again take it for repair. </li></ul><h2>  What are covers made of and how do they protect an iPhone? </h2><p>  Modern <noindex>  <span>cases for AppleiPhone 6</span> </noindex><strong>&nbsp;</strong>  designed to maximize the life of the device, while using the gadget becomes only more convenient.  The main materials for production are artificial or genuine leather, polyurethane, impact-resistant plastic, and in some cases metal.  There are a lot of design options, but really high-quality cases also differ in that they are ideally tailored to the configuration of buttons and connectors.  Thus, protection does not complicate the work with the iPhone, but rather makes it easier. </p><p>  When the device is in a case, you can safely carry it in your pocket, in a bag, briefcase, backpack, as well as keep it in the glove compartment of the car and just put it anywhere - at home, at work or somewhere else.  The case perfectly protects from moisture, does not allow dust and dirt to fall on the case and on the display.  It is much easier to clean the case from dirt than the device itself, and even if the case material is hopelessly damaged, it‚Äôs cheaper to buy a new case than to buy a new iPhone.  Shock-resistant models of covers are designed specifically for those who want to protect the device from falls and collisions with other objects. </p><h2>  Which case is better? </h2><p>  Choosing a cover, it is worth starting from several parameters, including the appearance and format.  Some people prefer book covers, some are classic, extremely easy to use, and some have a ‚Äúmagic window‚Äù that shows key information on the display and does not allow you to miss an important message or call.  As for the design, this is exclusively a matter of taste, but it should, of course, focus on high-quality materials and a stylish appearance. </p></div></article>
