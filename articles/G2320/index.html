    <h2>  Patong beach </h2><p>  "Pattaya in miniature" - this is the name of this resort in Phuket.  Indeed, there is practically everything here that people go to have fun on the mainland for.  Young people from all over the world love Patong no less than Pattaya.  Tony Resort 3 * (Phuket) is located in this center of entertainment.  Their center is rightfully considered Bangla Road.  Of course, there is a sex industry here, but families with children also come here.  The atmosphere here is very tolerant, and any traveler feels comfortable and relaxed.  The main daytime entertainment here, oddly enough for a Thai beach resort, is not the sea at all, but shopping.  And the local discos are unparalleled.  You can also go to a transvestite show, to such an exciting sports show as Thai boxing, or just go fishing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tony Resort 3 Phuket" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510560.jpg" width="600"></div>

No more than five minutes of not very fast walking - and you will be taken to any iconic place in Patong.  Bangla Road, Jungseilon Shopping Center - all this is just a few steps away.  Go to the sea for about ten minutes.  Nearby are many inexpensive cafes and shops, massage parlors and places where you can rent bikes cheaply.  Since Tony Resort 3 * is located in the thick of Patong, it can not boast of a huge garden.  Nevertheless, the hotel has three five-story buildings.  There are also two cozy courtyards surrounded by perimeter buildings of the hotel, and from the windows of the most expensive rooms you can see a large swimming pool.  Some buildings have internal passages to the restaurant.  You can park your car at the hotel - tourists claim that it is completely safe.  The reception is located in the lobby and is open 24 hours a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Massive double beds" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510567.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beaches </h2><p>  To get to the nearest beach, you need to turn left after leaving the hotel, go past the neighboring Viridian Hotel, and then focus on the huge tower of the Patong Resort resort complex.  From it begins an alley that rests directly on a road running along the sea.  But on the beach of Patong rarely sunbathe and swim, except in the first days of rest.  Experienced travelers go to neighboring beaches - Kathu, Karon or other famous coasts with white fine sand. </p><p>  In one of the courtyards of the Tony Resort 3 * hotel (Phuket), as already mentioned, there is a large pool, and in another - a small one.  Despite the fact that the hotel is large and there are always a lot of people living in it, there are always enough places here and there are free sunbeds.  It works until ten in the evening, but the staff will be loyal to the fact that you bathe later.  Moreover, the guests of the triple room have the opportunity to go to the pool directly from the building through the internal passages.  And on the first floors you can get to the artificial pond directly from the rooms.  In the large pool there is a special children's area, and they clean it every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Tony Resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1510562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  When you enjoy both Patong Beach and the nearby coasts, try the daytime shopping and nightlife of these places, the time will come to explore Phuket itself.  Guests at the Tony Resort Hotel often mention that the proximity to the center of Patong allowed them to book numerous trips to various places on the island.  This is a sightseeing tour of Phuket with a visit to its capital, as well as temples, waterfalls, parks and museums and all kinds of elephant, ostrich, snake and tiger farms and zoos.  This includes longer trips, for example, to Phang Nga Nature Reserve with a monkey temple, floating villages, hot springs and <span>James Bond Island.</span>  Phuket will never bore you, and you will come back more than once, or at least strive for it. </p><h2>  Tony Resort 3 * (Phuket Patong): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists call this hotel beautiful.  Although this is not the palace that the regulars of Turkey, Egypt or Tunisia are used to, the rest here is very comfortable.  Guests praise the style and comfort of the rooms.  Especially like the tourists who lived in this hotel, double beds made of solid wood.  They are very comfortable with good mattresses.  The staff, as is often the case in Thailand, are extremely friendly.  There are practically no complaints about the services and the service.  The Internet works throughout the territory, and the speed is very decent.  Although the hotel is located in the heart of Patong, it is calm and quiet.  We can say that it is an oasis among the seething sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople, should you go outside.  The hotel makes a very pacifying impression on travelers. </p>
