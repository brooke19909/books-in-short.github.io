This building was built over several centuries in order to remind all of humanity about how terrible and terrible death.  Of course, the building frame itself is made of more durable building materials, but the bones of more than 40 thousand people were included in the arches, portals, decorations, inscriptions, as well as the famous chandelier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ossuary in the Czech Republic" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275447.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <p>  Kostnitsa in the Czech Republic is now located in the town of <span>Kutna Hora,</span> which is located 70 kilometers from Prague.  In ancient times, this village was built on a silver deposit, and therefore was a major economic and commercial center of the country.  Later, these jewels were exhausted, and the city itself was covered by a wave of plague.  After this, armed uprisings followed, wars that finally destroyed the former financial center of the state, and Kutna Hora became only a small province.  However, her very notorious Kostnitsa still praises her. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kostnica church in the Czech Republic" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275446.jpg" width="600"></div>

Soon, secondary burials began to be practiced in the country, and those bones that had already been spent in the earth for many years were removed and stacked in the local Siedletsky monastery, which served as a chapel at the cemetery.  By the 14th century, more than 40 thousand people had gathered bones in this place, and one of the monks decided to bleach them.  Gradually clearing each bone, he stacked them into pyramids, which resulted in 6 pieces, each of several meters.  After the death of this monk, the Siedlec Monastery was closed for 350 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ossuary in czech republic photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275448.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <p>  Kostnica herself in the Czech Republic was born in the 18th century, when a certain F. Rint carved a real work of art from all these human remains.  His technology is still a secret, but the wonders of a non-standard art form please the eye and inspire philosophical thoughts.  It is also known that for all life terrible beauty is remembered to everyone who comes into this church. </p><p>  The ossuary in the Czech Republic includes absolutely all parts of the human skeleton.  Oblong ones became the basis for the coat of arms and crown; skulls decorated portals and arches.  But the greatest delight is caused by the huge chandelier in which the master put bones of all kinds: both phalanxes and twisted coccyx.  It is worth noting that this cathedral is very large, and despite this, each of its cells, each hall and passage is equipped with patterns and manual cutting from this material.  That is why the temple, which is an example of the severity of medieval architecture and horror, which can only inspire the human skeleton, is considered to be Kostnitsa in the Czech Republic. </p><p>  Photos of this work of art, as well as its most outstanding parts, are presented in the article, and before traveling to this country, you can appreciate the greatness and horror that lurk in this place.  In conclusion, it is worth noting that, despite the huge number of human remains concentrated in one place, there are still no legends about the possible ghosts and spirits living here. </p>
