    <h2>  Application for a mortgage loan </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that financial institutions present their requirements and limitations to borrowers.  For example, to get money on a loan for housing, you must have a permanent residence permit and work.  In addition, the total employment history of the borrower must be at least 1 year.  If the client‚Äôs credit history is damaged, then it is unlikely to get a mortgage.  In addition, he should not have a criminal record and other parallel loans.  The minimum age for obtaining a loan is from 21 years, and the maximum is not more than 65-75 years at the time of repayment of the mortgage. </p><p>  When filling out the application, you can specify the co-borrowers, who may be brothers, spouses, parents or acquaintances.  A man under 27 years old must show the bank a military ID.  Without him, a loan will be refused, even if he has a delay in connection with his studies.  When applying for a mortgage at the same time in several banking organizations, it is necessary to find out more detailed requirements for borrowers and the procedure for acquiring real estate in each of them.  Once the application for a mortgage is approved, you can proceed to the selection of suitable housing.  The bank spends several months on these events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Getting a loan for the purchase of secondary real estate </h2><p>  The procedure for obtaining a used mortgage on housing has its advantages: </p><ol><li>  After the transaction, the apartment can be immediately used for living. </li><li>  Buying secondary real estate is much easier, as banking organizations are more likely to lend to this particular segment of the market. </li><li>  Housing can be chosen in any convenient place and area. </li><li>  Such real estate is most often built from more durable building materials, therefore it has a long service life and meets all the requirements. </li></ol><p>  The procedure for obtaining mortgages for secondary housing is of interest to many citizens today.  Often banks offer customers favorable conditions for obtaining a loan to purchase such an apartment.  The main thing is that the loan amount does not significantly exceed the value of the selected property.  In other words, the borrower should be able to immediately pay between 15-35% of its value. </p><p>  Among other things, you can not take a mortgage loan for real estate that does not meet the requirements of the bank.  For example, secondary housing should be in good condition.  A mortgage will not be given to an apartment in a house to be demolished.  That is why the borrower will have to devote a lot of time to finding suitable housing. </p>

    <h2>  Mortgage loan expenses </h2><p>  Most people do not know how much they will have to pay for <span>mortgages</span> if they approve the loan.  Often, this behavior leads to the fact that borrowers incorrectly calculate the full cost of the apartment.  As a result, they later have problems with repaying a loan. </p><p>  When buying a home on credit, you have to pay for various services, which can range from 3-10% of the value of real estate.  For example, some banks charge a fee for considering a mortgage application.  Moreover, if a financial institution refuses to receive a loan, the borrower fails to repay the paid money. </p><p>  The main condition for obtaining a mortgage loan is an independent assessment of the acquired housing.  Such a procedure is carried out to determine the amount of the loan.  Most often, banks already cooperate with some appraisers.  Therefore, the client does not need to look for experts himself.  True, about 5-20 thousand rubles will have to be paid for such a service. </p>

    <p>  It will also be necessary to fork out for insurance.  According to the current legislation, when buying an apartment you need to protect yourself from the loss of housing and its damage.  In addition, banks may refuse to receive a loan if the borrower does not insure the ownership of the apartment and life.  Therefore, insurers still have to pay a few percent of the cost of housing. </p><p>  It should be remembered about additional commissions of financial institutions: for cell rental, wire transfer or cash withdrawal.  If there are difficulties with repaying the debt, the bank will charge fines and penalties.  It is advisable not to allow such situations in order to avoid problems. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before taking a loan, weigh well all the consequences of this decision.  Perhaps now such a financial burden will be unbearable, therefore, it is better to wait for a more favorable moment.  Of course, to calculate all the costs of obtaining a mortgage is simply unrealistic.  But when applying for such a loan, you should definitely consider your family budget and <span>unforeseen expenses.</span> </p>
