  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jaeger regiments - a prototype of modern special forces</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From time immemorial, major battles took place according to one scenario: tightly closed ranks of heavily armed foot soldiers converged on the field and the battle began.  The place of the fallen in the front ranks of the warrior was immediately taken by the one standing behind.  The outcome of such battles depended both on the talent of the commanders and the courage of the soldiers, and on the choice of the battlefield. </p><h2>  Reasons for the emergence of a new kind of troops </h2><p>  The linear tactics of warfare was effective on a flat rough terrain.  Only in such a section could densely closed ranks of infantry be maintained. </p><p>  But the terrain did not always allow the commanders to choose a suitable field for the battle.  Gullies, hills, groves and rivers on the battlefield did not make it possible to maintain a linear order of construction.  The ranks of the infantry were torn, enemy cavalry rushed into the breaches ... </p><p>  In this regard, the need was arising for the creation of such a kind of troops that could successfully fight on hilly terrain, and next to groves or fishing lines.  And he appeared after the invention of small arms.  The new warriors were called rangers.  Agile, quick-witted, agile, they felt great in any terrain, could appear unexpectedly and just as unexpectedly disappear behind hills or trees. </p><h2>  The first huntsmen: rangers, pandura </h2><p>  The first jaeger regiments in European armies appeared in the seventeenth century.  Applying modern military terminology, they can be called special forces of the time. </p><p>  In 1756, the first ranger units were created in the British colonial army in North America.  They were equipped with volunteers from hunters and huntsmen, applied tactics borrowed from the Indian tribes.  Mostly fought with garrisons of French fortresses and Indians. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Europe, during the Second Silesian War (1744-1745), the troops of Frederick the Great had to engage in battle with troops of Austrian panduras.  These detachments from the settlers of the border strip were completed.  The Pandurs did not know how to march in formation, but ambushed, accurately fired and successfully resisted the trained Prussian infantry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ushakov.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Austrian Pandur" class="if uuid-3067568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115077/3067568.jpg"></div><p>  On the orders of Frederick II, jaeger regiments were created in the Prussian army. </p><p>  Before the Seven Years War (1756-1761), this innovation was of little interest to the monarchs of Europe.  But seeing the Prussian rangers on the battlefields, the military leaders of European countries borrowed the idea. </p><h2>  First Jaeger Battalion </h2><p>  In Russia, the first battalion of volunteer hunters was created in 1761 by order of Count Rumyantsev.  The huntsmen worked like snipers on the battlefield: with well-aimed shots they destroyed enemy commanders and horsemen.  The soldiers of the battalion were allowed to act out of order and "shoot when they want, without orders." </p><p>  The specifics of the use of rangers in battles is reflected in the equipment of soldiers and officers.  The uniforms of rangers of that time can be called camouflage with a stretch. </p><p>  Unlike lush, bright hussar uniforms embroidered with metallized cords and galloons with metal buttons, huntsmen wore uniforms of predominantly dark green color with black cords.  There were no various bright details.  Leather ammunition - only black.  Sultans on shakoes were absent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ciwar.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://ciwar.ru/russkaya-armiya/russkaya-pexota-1799-1814/izmeneniya-uniformy-russkoj-pexoty-1807-1809-godov/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Huntsman, 1806-1807 g" class="if uuid-3066490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115077/3066490.jpg"></div><p>  The emblem of the huntsman, or light infantry, as they began to call them later, was a hunting horn. </p><p>  The weight of the equipment was as light as possible.  Jaeger units were armed with shortened and lightened guns - 10 cm shorter and 500 grams lighter than the general army.  The most accurate shooters received a rifled gun. </p><h2>  Huntsmen in the Russian army </h2><p>  The actions of the first battalions of rangers were so successful that in 1767 there were three thousand five hundred rangers in the Russian army, and by 1769 all infantry regiments were equipped with their units.  In 1796 a Life Jaeger Regiment was formed. </p><p>  The advantages of light infantry, repeatedly proven in battles, led to the formation of light cavalry.  The principles of the formation of personnel and the military tasks to be solved by horse-jaeger regiments remained identical to jaeger regiments, but mobility and the ability to make deeper raids on the rear of the enemy were added. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pochta-polevaya.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://pochta-polevaya.ru/aboutarmy/history/russkaya-imperatorskaya-armiya/a275795.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Life Guards Jaeger Regiment" class="if uuid-3066433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115077/3066433.jpg"></div><p>  In 1856, by decree of Emperor Alexander II, jaeger regiments were transformed into infantry and grenadier. </p>
