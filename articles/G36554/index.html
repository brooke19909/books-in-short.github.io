Are you passionate about sewing and want to improve your skills by learning to sew without a pattern?  Then this article is for you, because in it you will find free instructions and tips on how to make fashion accessories yourself, sew a blouse quickly and without a pattern with your own hands. </p><h2>  Choosing a blouse model </h2><p>  Women and girls are such by nature that they want to be unique and look beautiful at any time of the year.  On the eve of the spring-summer season, of course I want to replenish my wardrobe with new products, sew a new blouse, and not one.  We immediately accept the postulate - there is no ugly female figure.  Any flaw can be masked, you just need to listen to the advice of sewing masters. </p><p>  Usually, the beautiful half of humanity is complex about extra pounds, especially those gained in the winter.  What can be offered for overweight girls, how to sew a blouse so that this nuance is invisible?  The main thing is to pay attention to the choice of fabric.  This should not be bulk material so that no additional processing is needed.  The model should not have elements that are visually filled, such as shuttlecocks and ruffles.  The blouse should not be fitted. </p><h2>  Bat blouse </h2><p>  As an option for a blouse that has a free cut, you can offer tailoring of a bat model.  The fabric for it should be light, but not crumbling when cut.  For work you will need: cloth, pins and scissors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="printingtextil.blogspot.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bat blouse" class="if uuid-2368060" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2368060.jpg"></div><p>  To sew a blouse with your own hands, you need to fold the prepared fabric in the form of a scarf on a corner, pin down the pins where the stitch will take place.  The neckline can be any, but in the model in the photo above it is made in the form of a boat.  The neckline is treated with an oblique trim or braid.  Next is a line of side seams.  You can leave the bottom and edges of the sleeves in the form of corners, or you can cut off under the oval.  All sections are processed and decorated, if desired, with decor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you do not round the bottom and sleeves, a piece of fabric can be overlaid even before the cut or zigzag around the entire perimeter of the square.  This will simplify the work. </p><h2>  Blouse for fat </h2><p>  Nobody will look at extra pounds if you wear the right clothes.  For example, a blouse with a V-neck is suitable for full ones.  For her, you should choose a fabric of discreet colors, it is better if it is pastel colors.  If you sew a blouse on the fabric from the fabric, it will perfectly hide the extra pounds.  For the summer version of the blouse, the lightest fabric is selected - cotton.  It can be a cambrica with a nice coffee color.  The decor can be braid and small patches of leather or velor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Blouse for fat" class="if uuid-2370965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2370965.jpg"></div><p>  For the cut, you need to take the material 160 cm long and 130 cm wide. The fabric needs to be folded into four.  The measurement is taken - the hips, and a quarter of the measurement plus 5 centimeters is laid off from the central bend.  From this point, a line of the side seam is drawn, which does not reach the top by 25 centimeters (here will be the sleeve of the blouse).  At the top, the neck is made in the form of an oval, and then in front of the neck cut we turn into a V-shaped neckline.  The fabric cut is ready.  It remains to sew the blouse with your own hands, cutting off the side seams, making belt loops, decorating the sleeves with braid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the belt to the blouse, you need to take material two meters long and 25 centimeters wide.  Since the material is thin, it needs to be folded and stitched several times.  The ends of the belt, like the sleeves, are decorated with braid.  The result is a wonderful elegant blouse.  By the way, she will look great on a thin girl.  You just need to take less material. </p><h2>  Sun blouse </h2><p>  Sometimes, even having a desire to update your wardrobe, nothing is found in stores, which could please the eye.  It happens that the style is like, but this size is not.  The easiest way is to make a new thing yourself.  To do this, just buy a summer light fabric and sew a blouse with your own hands without a pattern.  It is without her.  As you will understand, without a pattern, sewing is much easier. </p><p>  This blouse can be sewn, like the previous one, with just two seams and a neckline.  The fabric should be so large that the radius of the circle is equal to the length of the product.  The pattern is done on fabric according to the scheme in the photo below, thanks to which it is clear how to sew a blouse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="printingtextil.blogspot.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunflower Blouse" class="if uuid-2368062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2368062.jpg"></div><p>  The cut out circle needs to be cut up, or if the material is loose, then overlay.  In the place on the diagram where the inner circle is drawn, this is the circumference of the hips.  Where on the diagram it is indicated "to grind and collect" - these are shoulder seams.  Next is the processing of slices.  A maximum of one hour and a half is required to complete the work. </p><h2>  Master Class.  Circle blouse </h2><p>  In practice, what was stated above is simply and wonderful told by the designer for sewing clothes Olga Nikishecheva in her video workshop.  Complex models are not needed for a full figure, but the original, creative and hiding extra pounds are what the video says.  After watching this video, every fashionista wants to create such a blouse for her wardrobe. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Kc7JgyH-TN8" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=Kc7JgyH-TN8" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/9/5/3/1953.jpg"></div><h2>  Model with hanging sleeves </h2><p>  A blouse with beautiful, hanging sleeves is one of the easiest options for a summer blouse.  How to sew this model without a pattern, we will consider in the photo below.  To sew this blouse, it is enough to have a piece of fabric equal to two lengths of the product, plus five centimeters for the hem of the bottom of the blouse and for the seams in the shoulder of the sleeve. </p><p>  For the cut of this blouse you need a shirt or t-shirt.  Having outlined its contour, we draw the necessary length of the sleeve and bottom of the blouse.  The cut consists of two parts - backs and shelves.  Before stitching them, you need to overlay them.  Next is the side of the blouse and the bottom of the sleeve.  A neckband is sewn around the circumference of the neck, which on the shoulder has a distance between the shelf and the back of the order of 3-4 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="graszkowa.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hanging blouse" class="if uuid-2368678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2368678.jpg"></div><p>  As an option, you can trim an edge with a separate shelf and a separate back, leaving long ends to make ties on the shoulders.  This is at the discretion of every fashionista. </p><h2>  Cut in one technique. </h2><p>  For a new stylish blouse to appear in the wardrobe, it is not necessary to be able to sew.  It means, to own the intricacies of sewing.  It is enough to buy thin elastic material.  It can be tricotin or wet silk.  These tissues do not crumble.  The size of the fabric should be equal to two lengths of the product, that is 130-140 centimeters, and have such a width that will be equal to the distance from the elbow to the elbow of the open hands.  This is approximately an average figure of 75 centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="graszkowa.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Original cut blouse" class="if uuid-2368693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2368693.jpg"></div><p>  The photo clearly shows how to sew a blouse.  To do this, it‚Äôs enough to sew two side seams, and then either sew the belt, as shown in the upper two technical figures, or seize along the side seam, as in the lower ones.  And these will be two options for blouses.  Seams and free edges need to be processed. </p><h2>  Blouse made of circle </h2><p>  To sew a blouse model (in the photo below), you need to make a circle cut, the diameter of which is 140-150 centimeters.  Fold it in half and again in half.  Set aside from the horizontal angle 10 centimeters, this will be the neckline of the blouse.  Put down vertically 7 centimeters.  Connect the resulting points and make a cutout. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nowacraft.blogspot.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Circle blouse" class="if uuid-2369241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2369241.jpg"></div><p>  Put 22 centimeters horizontally from the center and lower the perpendiculars to the edge of the circle.  Set aside 25 centimeters from the top point.  It will be an armhole.  From this point to the bottom of the blouse, bait with pins the side seam and sew.  The blouse can be decorated with embroidery or applique.  If the width of the material does not allow you to make a pattern from a circle, you can make it from two semicircles.  In this case, it is possible to simulate the cuts in the upper parts of the sleeves, in the shoulder seams to make an assembly. </p><p>  It is not so difficult to engage in modeling, the main thing is to want to create something original for yourself. </p>
