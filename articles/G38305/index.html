    <p>  Relationship development does not happen without problematic and conflict situations.  Solving such problems is best done through dialogue.  The more constructive the dialogue, the easier it is to <span>solve the problems that</span> have arisen between the participants in the dialogue.  Thus, constructive interaction is a solution to the problem through communication and the ability to hear each other, while the skills are available and clearly explain their position. </p><h2>  Why you need a constructive relationship </h2><p>  From early childhood, a person develops the skills of constructive interaction.  Since the child in childhood relies more on the emotional component of their development, parents should correctly formulate communication skills using the emotional side.  Depending on the communication skills laid down in childhood, the conditions of constructive interaction surrounding him, a person enters adulthood more or less contacted. </p>

However, not everything happens the way you want, and often the child chooses the wrong direction for his development.  And the role of parents in the life of a teenager is very important, they must find an approach to him and, without hitting his feelings, help to choose the right direction. </p><p>  Constructive interaction is <strong> </strong>  communication between an adult and a teenager on equal terms and the ability, through dialogue, to find a way out of difficult situations. </p><h2>  Confidence is the basis of adult-teen interaction </h2><p>  Constructive interaction with the adolescent will be achieved if trust is at the heart of the relationship.  If there is trust, it will not be necessary to control every step of the child and worry about going through a difficult period.  A teenager who trusts an adult will tell him about events in his life, share experiences and problems.  However, if an adult is caught lying, trust will disappear, and it will be very difficult to restore it. </p><p>  Parents should not violate the personal space of the teenager, give him the opportunity to independently find their place in society.  However, a teenager should feel the support of parents, this will give him confidence in their abilities. </p><p>  The adolescent period is the time of psychological separation from parents and exit into the adult world, the formation of an independent inner world. </p><h2>  How to painlessly overcome adolescence </h2><p>  Growing up, the child will "separate" himself from his parents, he will need a personal space that no one will violate. </p><p>  In order not to set up a child against yourself, you need constructive interaction with a teenager.  Parents must state their vision of the situation, and the child their own, and together come to a common result that satisfies both. </p>

    <p>  Such methods of constructive interaction should be present on the part of the adult: </p><ul><li>  It is available to tell the child about his fears so that he understands them. </li><li>  The child must understand that you are ready to listen and understand him at any time, while not criticizing. </li><li>  Show that the opinion of the child is important to you, and you respect him. </li><li>  The child himself must make a choice when necessary, and, accordingly, bear responsibility for this. </li><li>  Be sure to praise the child so that he does not disappoint in his abilities. </li><li>  Love and support will help the teenager go through the difficult stage of becoming a person. </li></ul><p>  If a teenager feels independent, while adequately owning the situation, has a stable self-esteem, knows how to communicate in a team, is responsible for his actions - this means that the teenage period has passed, and the help of the parents was provided correctly and constructively. </p><h2>  Society and nature </h2><p>  Nature provides resources through which man can live.

    <p>  Constructive interaction is the influence of nature on society and society on nature. </p><p>  Nature performs many functions, and one of them is economic.  Its resources possess economic properties and economic potential.  A man began to use this function when he began to make the first tools, build houses, sew clothes.  Every year, the needs of mankind are increasing, for the satisfaction of which a natural resource is used. </p><p>  With the development of civilization, nature helps to satisfy human needs in aesthetic, scientific, cultural spheres. </p><p>  <span>The relationship between man and nature</span> is ongoing.  Without interaction with nature, people simply cannot live.  Therefore, there must be a constructive interaction between society and nature.  In order not to break the connection with nature, man must constantly maintain it within the framework of a certain optimum. </p><h2>  Interaction with nature </h2><p>  Nature is a source of livelihoods for people.  It provides various benefits for life, it also poses tasks for a person, by solving which, the society comprehensively develops.  For example, the presence of rivers, lakes, seas encourages people to develop the fishing industry, rich soils contribute to the development of agriculture, oil deposits - the development of methods for its extraction and processing. </p><p>  At the same time, the absence of any natural wealth in a particular region encourages a person to look for a way out of the current situation, to master new opportunities of nature. </p>

    <p>  The constructive interaction of man with nature should be expressed in a sense of the measure of the use of natural resources.  With a "shortage" of natural resources, people will slightly reduce their development opportunities, and with an overabundance - they may be left with nothing.  Therefore, the principle of the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù is important here. </p><p>  Constructive interaction is important in all areas of human life.  <span>The ability to communicate and</span> interact will help society to develop harmoniously and correctly. </p>
