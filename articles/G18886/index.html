    <p>  It is necessary to knit according to the presented scheme with a fantasy openwork pattern.  Facial surface.  Gum 1x1. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The density of this knitting in this case should be as follows: 26 p. X 28 p.  openwork pattern = 10 by 10 cm;  23 p. X 29 p.  res.  = 10 by 10 cm. </p><p>  It should be noted: before starting knitting, it is necessary to make a full-size pattern.  This will help to figure out what's what, novice craftswomen. </p><h2>  Openwork top in the color of young greenery.  We knit the back and before </h2><p>  Knitting summer tops with knitting needles is not always very difficult.  Despite the fact that the diagrams or descriptions seem very incomprehensible.  And direct proof of this is this beautiful outfit. </p><p>  The back should be knitted like that.  On working knitting needles, draw 146 stitches and knit one row with the front ones on the wrong side.  Getting started. </p><p>  1st row of a fantasy openwork pattern: knit according to the figure 12 loops on the right, then repeat the rapport of 18 loops seven times and knit the last 8 loops on the left side.  Repeat Figure 1 from the first to sixteenth rows eight times and then knit according to Figure 1 from the first to third rows. </p><p>  Next, knit the fourth row according to Figure 2 - on the wrong side.  In the row, exactly reduce 47 loops - 99 loops remain on the knitting needles. </p>

    <p>  Now you need to knit a 1x1 elastic band, and one face is always knitted from each edge.  After 12.5 cm of elastic is tied, 39 loops must be closed in the center to make a neckline.  Now it's time to tie the armhole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After knitting another five centimeters of elastic, without forgetting the edge loops, knit the front surface.  Now you can close the remaining 30 shoulder cut loops.  The second armhole fits the same way. </p><p>  Before you should knit the same way as the back, the height of the elastic in the ideal ratio is 5.5 cm. Close 39 stitches in the middle, and then knit each armhole separately.  After knitting 12 cm with elastic, you need to close the 30 loops that remain.  Knit the second armhole the same way. </p><h2>  Openwork top in the color of young greenery.  How to combine everything? </h2><p>  That's how we knit a summer top with knitting needles.  Now we need to assemble all the parts together.  It is done like this.  All the details must be laid out on the pattern, moisten a little from the wrong side and let dry. </p><p>  First sew the shoulder seams, the side seams.  And here we must remember that the cutout of the armhole will begin about 3.5 cm higher than the gum begins.  All.  A new, beautiful and stylish outfit is ready.  It remains only to try it on and go out into the light. </p><h2>  We knit a beautiful top using a pattern of removed loops.  What do you need for knitting? </h2><p>  Let's try knitting another summer top with knitting needles.  Schemes and description will give the full picture necessary for productive work. </p><p>  For size 36/38, 150 g of white, pink and purple yarn (a combination of cotton, silk and polyamide), circular knitting needles No. 3,5 and a hook No. 4 are useful. </p><p>  Pattern 1 fits in this way: the front surface in the front rows is the front loops, in the wrong rows are the back ones. </p>

    <p>  Pattern 2: the pattern with the loops removed is circular rows (the number of loops in the 15-18th circular rows and in the 31-34th circular rows is a multiple of 8; in the remaining circular rows is a multiple of two) knit according to the pattern.  It presents odd circular rows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Even circular rows: the loops must be knitted with a thread of color, which is in the previous circular row according to the figure;  Loops that were removed should be removed again.

    <p>  Wrong rows: the loops are knitted, as in the row before, the loops that were removed must be removed again as wrong, and the thread should be stretched in front of the canvas.  The knitting density should be 25 stitches x 36 rows = 10x10 cm. </p><p>  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that before the armhole the summer top with knitting needles for beginners (namely, this can be said about this model, because it is not very complicated) is knitted in one piece in rows in a circle.  Decreases, which are necessary in order to make thawing, are depicted in the form of bevels. </p><h2>  Extra long top.  Start knitting </h2><p>  On knitting needles with a cruciform set, you need to dial 232 loops using purple yarn.  Lock in a ring and continue to knit with a pattern 2. It will be more convenient if the side lines at the beginning of the circular row are marked, do the same after the 116th loop of the circular row.  When 35 cm is made (this is 126 rows from the beginning of knitting and the 31st row of the pattern), to stitch the top, you should knit two loops together in each rapport together so that there are only five faces between the two loops removed.  The result is 203 loops. </p><p>  From this description you can understand what to knit <strong> </strong>  knitting summer tops, in general, is not so difficult.  The main thing is to adhere to the presented schemes and job descriptions. </p>

    <p>  To get a central back section, knitting 45.5 cm (this is 164 rows from the beginning), you need to divide all the work after fifty loops (this is the middle of the back) and continue knitting in rows in the direction of both forward and reverse.  When 50.5 cm is connected (this is 182 rows from the beginning), it is time to start knitting the armholes, and start work from the back section as follows: we knit 46 loops, close 10 loops (this will be the left armhole), now we need to knit 92 loops in order to do before, close 9 loops (this is the right armhole) and knit another 46 loops. </p><h2>  Those same 92 loops </h2><p>  Now temporarily set aside the loops of the back of the top and continue knitting on 92 loops, based on the pattern.  After 65 cm (this is 234 rows from the beginning), the middle 30 loops must be closed to make the neck.  Both sides are now tied separately. </p>

    <p>  To achieve rounding along the inner edge, you should use every second row - close 3 loops twice, thrice - two, and once - one at a time.  After 69 cm (this is 248 rows from the beginning), you can close the remaining shoulder loops - 18 pieces on each side.  Now you need to continue to work on both halves of the backrest on 46 loops, of course separately.  When 56 cm is ready (this is 202 circular rows from the start of work), continue to knit on 4 parts.  These are 32 loops on the right half of the back, 14 loops on the right crossed neckline, 14 loops on the left crossed neckline and 32 loops on the left half of the back. </p><p>  After 60.5 cm (this is 218 rows from the beginning of the work), fourteen loops of both halves of the back should be crossed, which were knitted separately.  That is, the first 14 stitches must be placed in the second 14 stitches.  Now you can continue knitting using all 92 loops - on a single fabric. </p><h2>  From neck to shoulders </h2><p>  The women's summer top with knitting needles must be knitted very carefully, because the result of all work will depend on attention no less than on the skill level of the knitter.  Tops are often very openwork or with complex beautiful patterns.  After all, women want to be smart warm summer days.  Therefore, the presented description and schemes should be treated responsibly. </p>

    <p>  In order to make both transverse cuts, you need to knit in the next second row as follows: knit 16 loops, then close 18, knit 24 again, close another 18 loops, again knit 16 loops.  We must continue to work on all three parts separately, paying attention to the pattern.  After 63 cm (this is 226 circular rows from the beginning of knitting), dial 18 closed loops on the working knitting needles and work again using a single canvas including 92 loops. </p><p>  When 69 cm is connected (this is 248 rows from the beginning), you need to close all the loops.  The middle loops in the amount of 56 pieces will form the neck, and the outer loops of 18 pieces on the left and right will form the shoulders. </p><h2>  How to put together? </h2><p>  Probably, it has already become clear that summer tops can be knitted with needles, with some effort.  In order to try on a new thing, it is necessary to combine all the details.  First you need to make shoulder seams.  The back of the product should be treated with purple thread in three circular rows of connecting posts.  In this case, from the second circular row, you should enter the prepared hook exclusively for the back backs of the loops of the previous row.  The edges of the armhole and the neck of the product are tied with a purple thread - one circular row will be enough - using single crochet and connecting posts. </p><p>  Large-sized summer tops with knitting needles knit in the same way as tops for slim girls.  The only difference is that it will take a little more yarn, and therefore, the work will take a little more time.  But for experienced knitters, nothing is impossible.  It is so? </p>
