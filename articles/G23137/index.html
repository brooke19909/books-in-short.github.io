    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Most tourists, after a holiday, feel like sharing their impressions of the Jiraporn Hill Resort 3 * hotel.  Reviews on the official website of the hotel or other popular sites will be useful for those wishing to go to Phuket. </p><p>  So, leisure for tourists and accommodation here is quite budget.  If you want to relax economically, then this hotel will be the best option for you.  In case of a family trip, it is better to book a standard room, as it is larger, has a huge balcony, a kitchenette and many wardrobes. </p><p>  The hotel is located on a quiet and calm street, away from noise (but not very far at the same time), so you can relax here or have a nice evening in silence by the pool. </p><p>  The staff is friendly, they always smile and quickly solve problems.  Room cleaning is carried out every day, the rooms are clean and well maintained.  Near the hotel there are all the necessary institutions: cafes, salons, shops, which further increases the attractiveness of this institution. </p><p>  You can have a delicious breakfast in any cafe, but breakfast at the hotel is much cheaper.  The menu changes daily, the food is delicious, full, varied. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The hotel has a problem with towels, they are old and washed, and foot towels with cuts and holes, but they are clean and change every day.  In addition, far to the beach.  You have to rent a bike or use the shuttle service to Patong Beach.  This is perhaps the main disadvantage of the hotel.  But for such a service and low price it can be forgiven. </p>

The room on the ground floor is unpleasant due to humidity and dampness, as well as due to insects in the room.  The room itself is normal, decorated in white, with ceramic tiles on the floor, but the furniture is a bit old.
