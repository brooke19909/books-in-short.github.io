    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Kalithea Sun &amp; Sky (Greece) is an economical and comfortable hotel.  So, the cost of living for one night in a double room per season is from 3 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Kallithea San &amp; <span>Sky (</span> Rhodes <span>island</span> ): holidays, reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel, many tourists pay special attention to the comments of people who have already been here.  Therefore, we have summarized several reviews of travelers staying during their vacation in Rhodes at Kallithea San &amp; Skye. </p><p>  On the whole, the majority of our compatriots having a rest here were very pleased with the hotel.  They agree that the hotel is well worth the money spent. </p><p>  As for the rooms, tourists visiting Kallithea recommend booking standard rooms in the main building.  They have recently been repaired and installed solid modern furniture.  As for the bungalow, then some of them are damp.  Also, not all of them boast a pleasant view from the window.  Otherwise, the guests of the Kallithea had no complaints about the numbers.  The rooms were cleaned every day, and they did it very efficiently.  Lingerie was also changed, as stated, three times a week. </p><p>  The tourists also liked the hotel grounds.  Everything is very well maintained and clean.  Extremely positive emotions were left by the staff at Kallithea San &amp; Sky.  So, without exception, all the hotel staff were very friendly and always ready to help.  The waiters in the restaurant very quickly cleaned the dirty dishes, the girls at the reception always answered with a smile all the questions.  Our compatriot also liked that many hotel staff speak or at least understand Russian.  Therefore, no one had problems in communication here. </p><p>  As a rule, when studying reviews of the vast majority of hotels in Greece and other countries, one involuntarily draws attention to the fact that guests' opinions about food quite often differ.  As for the three-star hotel "Kallithea San &amp; Sky" in Rhodes, the situation is different: the overwhelming majority of guests liked the food.  So, almost all tourists pay attention to a very tasty and varied food.  Continental breakfast is offered, but for lunch and dinner you can choose from a variety of dishes.  Here everyone will find food to their taste: various vegetables, fruits, meat, chicken, turkey, seafood, delicious desserts, etc. Due to such a variety of menus, even those who carefully monitor the figure could not resist the end of the vacation gained a couple of extra pounds. </p><p>  I liked the vacationers and the local beach.  Despite the fact that going to it for about 15-20 minutes in measured steps, this did not bother the tourists at all.  After all, along the road you can admire beautiful and vibrant landscapes.  The beach itself is small pebble.  When entering the water there are no large stones, so it is impossible to hurt the legs.  On the beach you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas.  However, you can bring your own beach equipment, placing it on the territory not occupied by sun loungers. </p><p>  The tourists did not raise any complaints about the location of the hotel.  So, near there are lots of shops, a supermarket, as well as restaurants and bars.  A bus stop is just 300 meters away.  From here you can get to the city of Rhodes by comfortable air-conditioned bus. </p>

    <h2>  What to do in Rhodes? </h2><p>  As a rule, most tourists, arriving in Greece, try, in addition to relaxing on the beach, to devote time and various entertainments, as well as to see local attractions.  We offer further information on what to do on the island of Rhodes.  We also find out how much money should be taken with you on vacation. </p><h2>  Sights of Rhodes </h2><p>  One of the most famous attractions located on the Greek island of Rhodes is the Acropolis of Lindos.  It was built over three thousand years ago.  In addition to the acropolis itself, in Lindos you can see the ruins of the early Christian church and the walls of the knight's castle.  Please note that in the summer it is very hot, so it is best to go here early in the morning or late in the evening, while remember to bring a supply of drinking water. </p><p>  Rhodes Fortress deserves special attention.  It was built during the Middle Ages and was intended to protect the capital of the island - the city of Rhodes from invaders.  It is considered one of the longest in Europe: for example, the length of its walls is four kilometers. </p><p>  Wildlife lovers are advised to visit the Butterfly Valley, which is a unique nature reserve.  This attraction is located thirty kilometers from the city of Rhodes. </p><p>  An interesting place to visit is Rodini Park.  It is considered one of the oldest parks on the planet.  This landscape park was erected by the ancient Romans.  It is interesting that already in those days a water supply system was built here.  Also on the territory of Rodini is the tomb of Ptolemy I. </p>
