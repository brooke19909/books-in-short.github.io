The organization offers customers a universal portfolio of services, which includes a wide range of insurance products.  The company was established in 1992, and belongs to the category of system-forming market entities. </p><p>  In the article, we consider the features of OSAGO from Alfa Insurance.  Customer reviews, interesting facts will also be offered to the attention of the reader.  Let's get started! </p><h2>  Electronic CTP </h2><p>  Many people are actively shopping online, as the Internet has rapidly entered all areas of life.  The company presented to the attention of potential buyers an information portal where you can go to your personal account.  There you can familiarize yourself with all the services on your own and issue an insurance policy in Alfa Insurance.  Customer reviews report that the registration process and registration of the policy does not take much time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurustrahovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Company mobile application" class="if uuid-3141653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141653.jpg"></div><p>  Customers can work with their personal account remotely, because the organization has developed a convenient mobile application.  Authorized and unauthorized users can send an application for an insurance policy to Alfa Insurance.  Customer reviews note that passing the registration procedure will allow you to keep information about all insurance contracts in one place.  Which is very convenient! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tricks for the assessment of damage under OSAGO </h2><p>  Often there are situations in which the expert does not include certain damage in the assessment report.  As a result, the insurer significantly reduces the total amount of CTP insurance payment to Alfa Insurance.  Reviews of motorists contain information that the vehicle must be inspected together with an expert and insist on reflection of all detected damages.  In case of any disagreement, you can leave your comments in the act.  Many customers report underreporting when calculating the amount of work needed.  Thus, the company can underestimate the total amount to 40%, which is confirmed by numerous reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vdvrus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Online policy registration" class="if uuid-3141687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141687.jpg"></div><p>  Customers are advised to conduct an independent examination to assess the actual damage caused to the car.  Only after that can you make a claim and send it to Alfa Insurance.  Customer reviews say that in all open sources of information for which the calculations are carried out, the cost of materials, spare parts and standard hours of service work is significantly underestimated relative to the average market values. </p><h2>  Subtleties and nuances </h2><p>  Clients may be refused a refund if one of the participants in an accident has a fake or invalid policy.  Reviews note that this organization may declare the contract invalid after the formal sale.  Therefore, policyholders must always carry a receipt for payment of the policy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="auto-ru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTPL policy registration" class="if uuid-3141681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141681.jpg"></div><p>  The company does not always pay full compensation for losses, which is confirmed by negative customer reviews about Alfa Insurance.  Many policyholders recommend going to court if such a situation occurs.  The law states that the insurer is obliged to pay compensation to the injured even if the company is deprived of a license to conduct business. </p><h2>  Features of the design of an accident with Europrotocol </h2><p>  There is a simplified procedure for registration of traffic accidents, which does not provide for the call of the traffic police.  When issuing the Euro protocol, participants are required to provide the insurance company with a notice form within five days.  As a rule, the injured party promptly notifies the insurance company of an accident, and the culprit postpones this obligation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emdadcartehran.ir" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance benefits" class="if uuid-3141703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141703.jpg"></div><p>  Some owners claim that AlfaStrakhovanie takes advantage of this circumstance and remove a copy from the original document, which is lost over time.  As a result, the insurance company may file a recourse lawsuit and receive cash.  There is another option, in which the organization does not accept the application, and then refuses to recover losses.  Clients of this company argue that, being the culprit in the accident, you can not relax during the entire period of action. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Public opinion </h2><p>  <span>Form an objective opinion will help customer reviews about the company Alfa Insurance.</span>  <span>Some openly say that this organization is engaged in extorting money.</span> </p><p>  <span>Dissatisfied customers filed complaints with the prosecutor‚Äôs office and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation against Alfa Insurance.</span>  <span>Customer reviews note that this structure carries out unfair business practices.</span>  <span>Many people say that it is impossible to issue an electronic insurance contract because the site does not work correctly.</span>  <span>Other comments contain information about the long-term registration of the CTP insurance policy in Alfastrakhovanie.</span>  <span>Customer reviews are full of negative comments about the boorish attitude of employees.</span> </p><h2>  Positive feedback </h2><p>  <span>Some clients appreciated the operational work of specialists at Alfa Insurance.</span>  <span>In the reviews, they note that employees are always ready to meet each other in resolving any issues.</span>  <span>Some car owners claim that this organization has never failed to pay and repair a vehicle.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lokalkompass.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customer reviews" class="if uuid-3141691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141691.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Satisfied customers recommend that you issue an insurance policy only in Alfastrakhovanie, as the organization has long existed in the market and has gained a reputation as a reliable partner.</span>  <span>Many liked the opportunity to apply for an electronic policy online.</span>  <span>Calculation of</span> payments is carried out in strict accordance with applicable laws, which is confirmed by reviews of the <span>AlfaStrakhovanie insurance company.</span>  Many customers choose not a monetary compensation, but car repair at the service station.  Since this option is the most profitable. </p><h2>  Reviews on the insurance company "Alfa Insurance" </h2><p>  <span>Many clients report that emergency commissioners are engaged in obtaining compensation from the firm under study.</span>  <span>The reviews of AlfaStrakhovanie contain information that such experts convince the victims that the damage to the vehicle was minor.</span>  <span>Emergency commissioners put the amount received from the company in their pocket.</span>  <span>That is why, many customers claim that fraud with compulsory motor third-party liability insurance prospers in this company.</span>  <span>AlfaStrakhovanie has an extensive network of agents, among which dishonest employees can be caught.</span>  <span>Customers</span> claim that the company takes a very long time to update the data and other information in the database.  <span>Customer reviews of the company contain information that when selling a car it is impossible to return money for the remaining period of the policy.</span> </p><h2>  Main claims </h2><p>  <span>Some customers say that the purchase of a policy on a site, the system automatically includes life insurance in the cost.</span>  <span>Despite the fact that this additional service costs quite a bit, but if you think about the scope of this fraud, you get an impressive benefit for the company.</span>  <span>Many clients sent complaints to the prosecutor's office about fraudulent activities of the organization, but this issue was not resolved.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="saxrules.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Employee Reviews" class="if uuid-3141698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141698.jpg"></div><p>  The company under study pays a reimbursement amount well below market average.  As confirmed by numerous negative customer reviews.  CTP in Alfa Insurance cannot be executed without the imposition of additional services that are constantly offered by the specialists of this organization.  Many do not like the indifferent attitude.  Therefore, policyholders move to other companies. </p><p>  The number of disappointed people is increasing every year, and Alfa Insurance's customer base is decreasing.  In other comments, people note that specialists often make mistakes in the policy.  Attempts to clarify issues by telephone do not lead to anything, so many customers have a negative impression on the work of Alfa Insurance.  MTPL reviews in this organization get conflicting, as payments are not transparent.  And very often dishonest. </p><h2>  Do I need to apply for a policy in Alfastrakhovanie? </h2><p>  There are many controversial comments from real clients about this organization, as some were satisfied with the cooperation, while other clients cannot receive insurance payments for years.  Many negative reviews can be found on the design of the E-Osago policy.  Clients are not able to draw up an insurance contract because the system transfers to the PCA website.  Many people misunderstand the calculation of the amount of damage, because the resulting loss is much greater.  Often, the insurance company pays only 50% of the required amount of repair.  However, this payment cannot cover all costs associated with the restoration and repair of the vehicle. </p><h2>  Some schemes of work </h2><p>  In the reviews of policyholders you can find information about the overstatement of the amount of repair from authorized service stations, as well as the underestimation of the amount of payment from the company Alfa Insurance.  Many talk about the indifference of this organization to their customers.  The company's experts and specialists hide the amount of payment from customers until the last moment.  Some clients caution others against applying for insurance with Alfastrakhovanie agents.  The policies purchased in this way are no different from the originals.  However, the insurance contract may be registered with another car owner in another region of the country. </p><p>  Clients claim that the agents are real scammers and cooperate with Alfa Insurance.  The insurance organization receives mostly negative reviews, since this structure irresponsibly refers to its customers.  <span>Users recommend purchasing policies from trusted agents that other people have worked with.</span>  <span>In their responses, customers say that earlier this organization was more responsible for its insured.</span>  <span>Attitudes changed at a time when the customer base became very large.</span> </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  The opinion of most customers agrees that the insurance company tries to save on payments as much as possible.  Also, this organization delays the indemnification period in the hope that the insured will repair the car on their own. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vladtime.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Large insurance company" class="if uuid-3141649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3141649.jpg"></div><p>  The company "Alfa Insurance" is a large system that offers various types of insurance and other services.  Whether or not to use the services is a personal matter for each person, however, reviews will help to form an objective opinion about the activities of this organization. </p>
