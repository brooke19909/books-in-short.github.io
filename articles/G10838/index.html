    <p>  The head of state is considered the most important symbol of <span>Sweden.</span>  <span>The king is</span> not interested in politics; he does not have any official powers since 1974.  All his duties are mainly ceremonial and representative in nature.  The monarch, having lost his last right to appoint a prime minister, has become a "trade symbol" of the state, "promoting" his business interests around the world. </p><p>  The royal family of Sweden is one of the oldest in the world.  Monarchical traditions in this country have existed without interruption for a whole millennium.  According to the Constitution, the royal family transfers the inheritance of the throne to the eldest descendant of the monarch, moreover, regardless of gender.  Therefore, the head of Sweden in the future will be Crown Princess Victoria, and not at all brother Carl Philip, who is younger than her in age. </p>

Today, apart from Carl Gustav XVI, members of the Swedish royal family are also Victoria with her husband, Prince Daniel, Karl Philippe and Princess Madeleine who loves to visit the United States.  But the royal house and the royal family are two different concepts.  The first also includes other <span>close relatives of the</span> king - his sister Birgitta, as well as the widow of his uncle.

The king constantly visits the municipalities, makes the so-called "erixgatures" - visits to the province, thereby showing his proximity to the people who answer him with adoration.  To see with your own eyes the wedding of the crown princess in Stockholm in 2010, a huge number of people gathered from all over the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal family of Sweden" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/66498.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <p>  The royal family is also actively involved in charity work, which is very appreciated by the Swedes.  They enjoy watching all the programs associated with the royal house.  For example, the broadcast of Victoria‚Äôs birthday broke all the rating records in the country. And what a jubilation it was when in 2011 they announced that the crown princess was pregnant!  One of the Swedish parent sites even displayed an image of the embryo in the crown.  However, sometimes the royal family of Sweden accepts very unusual signs of love: for example, rugs and knives for opening cans with the emblem of a royal family are sold in the Stockholm Museum. </p><p>  However, today in Sweden the number advocating for the liquidation of the monarchy is gradually increasing.  This is mainly due to the scandals in which it turns out </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crown Princess Victoria" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/66496.jpg" width="600"></div>  royal family lately.  Although the main population of the country is still calm about all the negative news that began to appear with enviable constancy.  It is possible that the royal house will undergo new reforms in the future.

    <p>  At present, it is difficult to say something definite, but the flexibility and pragmatism with which the royal family lives all the time trying to change the outdated traditions are truly a ‚Äúlifeline‚Äù of the Bernadotov clan.  However, in spite of everything, it is not necessary to wait for the ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù of the Swedish monarchy. </p><p>  Although without its own symbols - the list of which is headed by the royal family - this country will be different.  After all, Sweden simply can not be imagined without the monarchs, as well as without a blue-yellow flag, bright red houses and the character "Peppy - Long Stocking". </p>
