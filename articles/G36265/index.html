Now in the village there are 12 routes.  280 trolleybuses leave for flights;  there are only three depots in the city.  The fare is 15 rubles.  Transportation is carried out by Metroelektrotrans. </p><p>  The article will help determine which routes function in the city.  Here is a photo of the schedule, as well as a brief description of the transport network. </p><h2>  The history of the development of the trolleybus network of Volgograd </h2><p>  Trolleybus routes (Volgograd) began to expand rapidly after the launch of the first.  He connected two districts of the city: Krasnooktyabrsky and Central.  The first was the main <span>trolleybus fleet.</span>  At the moment, it has an index of number 4, is functioning to this day. </p><p>  Initially, the park consisted of only 20 vehicles, there were 30 drivers.  Given that the trolleybus service is open on the last day of December, staff training began in May.  The drivers were representatives of the first and second classes of cadets.  The training was carried out by specialists who arrived from the city of Saratov.  The courses ended a few months before the start of work. </p><p>  Volgograd trolleybuses eventually increased in number, which is good news.  From 20, the number of vehicles increased to 304. The development of the network continues to this day, but the number of cars has decreased.  Gradually new routes are opening up.  We are talking about 8a and 15a (2003), 18 (2004), 14 (2009), 1 (2008) </p><p>  Several years ago, Metroelectrotrans held small lotteries and raffles between passengers on trolleybuses and trams.  Prizes were tickets valid for only one mode of transport and for only 15 days, as well as special tickets with a protective layer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2008, the long-forgotten route No. 1 was restored.  The sequence of flights and the length of flights have not changed.  The final stop of the trolleybus (Volgograd) at number 1: "Station" - "Village VGTZ".  A year later, the place of departure of the vehicle was changed to the "Children's Center". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trolleybuses of Volgograd" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1516975.jpg" width="600"></div>

The operation of the network, lines and depot of this part of the city was frozen for an indefinite period.  Number 15 changed the endpoint to the "Railway Station".  Route 15a resumed.
