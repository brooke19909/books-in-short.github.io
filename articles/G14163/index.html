But this can be done by ordinary mailing in Russia.  She will help send a gift to her beloved grandson, household items and sweets to her son in the army or ordered goods.  The only thing that is required from the sender is to correctly package the parcel and write the address of the recipient.  The rest will be done by employees of the Russian Post. </p><h2>  How to make a package? </h2>

Of course, these requirements are not a whim of Russian Post employees.  They are designed to simplify the reception, sorting and delivery of all items.  All this ultimately affects <strong> </strong>  How long is the package in Russia.  And you need to start by packing forwarded items.  You can do this even at home by choosing a suitable box.  It should be cardboard or made of thin plywood.  If this was not found, it can be purchased at the post office.

    <p>  The content, under the terms of the provision of services by Russian Post, should be weighing from 2 to 20 kg, and measuring on either side no more than 1.05 m. The minimum dimensions are 110 x 220 mm or 114 x 162 mm.  It is desirable to pack fragile items so that it is almost impossible to break them.  It is also undesirable that there are voids inside the box.  On all sides of the parcel, the postal employee is already gluing with marked tape to prevent accidental opening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prohibited Goods </h2><p>  It should be noted that not everything can be sent by mail.  Prohibited goods include any flammable, explosive and toxic substances.  Also, you can not send any banknotes in the parcel, for this there is a postal order.  And, of course, you should not even try to convey antiques, jewelry and any weapons in this way.  Sending parcels in Russia with such contents is not only illegal, but can be dangerous for others. </p><h2>  Correct writing of details </h2>

A mistake in one letter or number can lead to the fact that the delivery time of a parcel in Russia will increase significantly.  According to the adopted rules, all necessary data must be written in Russian and in <span>Arabic numerals.</span>  The address of the recipient is indicated in the lower right corner, and the sender in the upper left.

It is possible to write the details of the mailing in different ink, except for red, yellow and green.  They should be written in legible handwriting, especially with regard to the index.  They can also be printed on a printer or typewriter.  All this ultimately affects how much the parcel is in Russia.

The only thing that does not need to be done is to seal it yourself.  The mail officer will do this using marking tape.  Also, before sending, any parcel is weighed, its contents are checked in case of suspicion or compilation of an inventory.  The latter, by the way, is carried out only at the request of the sender.

    <p>  In addition to the parcel, the employee will offer to fill out a form in which you will also need to indicate the addresses of the sender and recipient.  In addition, here you can write a small message for the addressee, if required.  The Russian Post will once again verify all the data, because it is on this form that the mailing will be processed.  The employee will definitely inform you how much time the package is taking, focusing on the target dates.  The sender only has a receipt for payment, which must be saved before delivery.  In a contentious situation, he will help you find the postal item. </p>

    <h2>  Parcel cost </h2><p>  The Russian Post established uniform tariffs for all shipments, including for parcels.  The final cost will be affected by such parameters as the shipping distance, weight and size of the shipment, and some additional services.  In addition, the price will still depend on the region and the complexity of delivery.  However, an employee of the Russian Post will necessarily report all the subtleties. </p><p>  The sender himself can also estimate the cost of the package.  The Russian Post posts information on prices not only on its official website, but also on <span>information stands</span> in each branch.  So, for a resident of Moscow, sending a parcel weighing 2 kg to relatives in Kaliningrad will cost about 200 rubles.  In addition, you will have to pay from 30 to 40% of the cost if it is large, weighing more than 20 kg or have non-standard sizes.  For each ruble of <span>declared value,</span> you will need to pay 4 kopecks. </p><h2>  Delivery timelines </h2>

This is influenced by many different factors, and above all the remoteness of the recipient from the point of reception.  In order to make it easier for both employees and customers of Russian Post to navigate, there are delivery deadlines.  They help evaluate when the package arrives at its destination. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In any case, this will happen no earlier than in 3-4 days.  This is due to the fact that 1 day is given for processing at the place of sending and receiving, and more time is needed for its transportation.  According to the regulations, parcels are transported at least once every 3 days and no more than once a day.  It is worth noting that during the holidays, delivery times may increase by 2-3 days due to the increased load on distribution centers. </p><h2>  Package Tracking </h2><p>  Those who are worried about how the parcel travels across Russia, and whether the recipient will receive it soon, can always track it by a special <span>postal identifier.</span>  It is assigned to any postal item and contains 14 digits.  During the receipt of the parcel, a check is issued in which it will be indicated.  Having such information, you can say exactly where the package is currently located.  Moreover, it is not necessary to contact the employees of the Russian Post. </p><p>  On the company's website in a special section you can see the status of the mail.  Depending on where the package is located, the following may be indicated: </p><ul><li>  Arrived at the sorting center; </li><li>  left the sorting center; </li><li>  Came to the place of delivery; </li><li>  Delivery to the addressee. </li></ul>

    <p>  At the 1st stage, all packages arrive at sorting, where according to the indicated index they are selected and packaged.  After the status is changed to ‚ÄúLeft the sorting center‚Äù, the parcels are transported to the place of delivery.  Depending on the distance and method of delivery, transportation can be from 1 to 20 days.  Once the status has become "Arrived at the place of delivery", you can go to send the parcel without even waiting for the notification.  By a unique identifier, an employee of the Russian Post can always find it among others.  After issuing, the status changes for the last time to the value "Handing over to the addressee". </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Russian Post keeps up with the times and today there is no need to worry about how long the package is in Russia.  All the necessary information can always be clarified with the employees, as well as use the available online services. </p>
