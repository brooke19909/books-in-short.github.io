What kind of food can you count on?  How do people who have already managed to spend several days respond about the hotel?  These issues should be addressed at the travel planning stage. </p><h2>  Hotel location features </h2>

    <p>  The location of the hotel is an important point that employees first of all pay attention to.  So where to look for the hotel Cubanacan Tuxpan 4 *?  Varadero, one of the most beautiful Cuban resorts - it is here, almost in the very center of the city, that the hotel complex is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, there are shops, cafes, restaurants and even a small shopping center nearby, so you will not feel divorced from public life.  The distance to Varadero Airport is 27 km - in a few minutes convenient transport will already bring you to the hotel, which is very convenient.  But the Havana airport is further away, namely 160 km.  The distance to the Cuban capital is 152 km, so many travelers visit vibrant Havana during excursions around the island. </p><h2>  Cubanacan Tuxpan 4 *: description of the hotel and the territory </h2><p>  The hotel complex consists of two multi-storey buildings and occupies a fairly large territory.  It should be said right away that the hotel was built in 1991, so you should not count on a unique design.  Nevertheless, in 2012 a complete reconstruction was carried out here - tourists can count on high-quality repairs, clean rooms, a cozy atmosphere and working equipment. </p><p>  In the courtyard there is a beautiful garden where you can hide from the scorching sun, walk along secluded paths, relax on terraces, play sports, swim in the pool, in a word, spend time with pleasure. </p><h2>  How many rooms are on site?
