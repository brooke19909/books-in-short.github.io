But, on the other hand, such a development entails many unpleasant moments.  And in order to avoid all sorts of surprises, they came up with special devices that are now available not only to scouts, but also to ordinary people.  These are the so-called suppressors or jammers.  With their help, you can not be afraid of hidden cameras, wiretapping, "bugs" and similar "things" that are available today to everyone. </p><p>  Suppressors can be purchased, for example, over the Internet.  And radio amateurs make them themselves.  How these devices work, what they are capable of, and how to make a GSM jammer with your own hands, we will talk in the next article. </p><h2>  How do jammers work on phones? </h2>

    <p>  Some of them are devices of this type that when the devices fall into their coverage area, all around the phones catch only interference, and people can‚Äôt talk on them. </p><p>  Other GSM jammers are aimed at scanning frequencies and are looking for a specific signal.  The moment it appears, they begin to generate interference.  Thus, significantly saved electrical energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cell-like suppressor </h2><p>  Devices can have a different range.

    <h2>  Suppressors and the Law </h2><p>  Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that, according to the Russian federal law ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù, all communications blockers are subject to mandatory registration and certification.  The certificate is issued by the device manufacturers themselves upon purchase, but the owners of the devices are responsible for the registration procedure.  If it is not passed, then the operation of the device is an illegal action, for which you will have to bear responsibility. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But thanks to such devices, you can protect yourself from various prying devices that have the goal of invading your personal life.  It is sometimes unrealistic to find them because of their miniature size, but GSM jammers can quite cope with the task. </p><h2>  Installation and operation of a suppressor </h2><p>  Installation of the device is completely simple.  The antenna is screwed into the connector, and the jammer suppresses the signals within ten seconds after switching on.  The blocker is able to work both <span>offline</span> and through the network.  Also, if necessary, you can use the cigarette lighter car. </p><p>  But we should not forget that illegal use of the device is against the law. </p>

    <h2>  Fine tuning </h2><p>  It happens that after the GSM jammers are charged by turning on the devices, they detect weak work, the extension of the effect only to a certain telecom operator or something else like that.  This happens if operators use slightly different frequencies. </p><p>  But in order for the device to work with them, it is necessary to perform the following actions: </p><ul><li>  remove the switch; </li><li>  unscrew the antenna; </li><li>  remove the cover; </li><li>  pull out the chip; </li><li>  turn a tuning resistor on it with a screwdriver to increase or decrease the frequency. </li></ul><h2>  Who needs to invade someone else's life </h2><p>  Similar actions are taken to configure on WiFi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Probably everyone knows today what "bugs" are.  Various means for wiretapping are currently used not only by special services.  They can be set by a student and even a schoolboy. </p>

    <p>  However, most often jealousy, business competitors, and others are interested in such devices.  Spyware can harm anyone.  Therefore, many are interested in information protection today.  And the GSM jammer suppressor acts precisely as a device that fights against such phenomena. </p><p>  Well, many people have long known about GSM 900-1800 cell phones that without a jammer they easily turn into a means of information leakage. </p><h2>  Jammer Bluetooth, 3G, Wi-Fi </h2><p>  Such a device is usually imperceptible and operates at certain frequencies.  At the same time, something like ‚Äúnetwork not found‚Äù, ‚Äúno signal‚Äù and so on is usually displayed on the cell phone when the device is operating.  And if it was installed with some kind of device, then after a few seconds it is interrupted.  Then no spyware can eavesdrop and catch signals. </p><p>  Jammers of GSM phones or Wi-Fi do not emit powerful noise, radio signal.  Therefore, household devices both worked and continue to work. </p><p>  Highly sensitive spyware can be installed anywhere: in offices, cars, apartments, saunas and so on.  Communication occurs at certain frequencies.  Conventional detectors often do not cope with the task and are not able to "calculate" modern espionage techniques.  But jammers designed to meet the increased conditions and requirements can "neutralize" the space. </p><h2>  Suppressor and anti GPS tracker </h2><p>  In recent years, another type of espionage technique has become widespread - GPS trackers.  They are far from being intended only to control cargo transportation, as manufacturers often say.  They are often used by law enforcement agencies, private detectives, and the same envious competitors, even criminal structures. </p><p>  These are absolutely tiny devices, which are easy to hide and hide.  And in the end, a certain person will be under such automated surveillance.  That's why the GSM signal jammer, a kind of anti-tracker, began to be developed. </p><p>  These are certain modules that do not allow to calculate the coordinates of a person or vehicle.  Anyone who follows using the tracker will only see ‚Äúno data‚Äù, or the data will not be received at all. </p><p>  Thanks to the suppressors of the vehicle, anonymity is ensured, and the collection of personal information via GPS channels is not allowed. </p><p>  Devices are able to successfully deal with all kinds of espionage technology, which can harm anyone in their personal lives, and in the business sphere, as well as the whole organization.  Therefore, in our realities, such things cannot be neglected, and you must try to protect yourself, your loved ones and employees from spy gadgets. </p>

    <h2>  DIY GSM jammer </h2><p>  On <span>the Internet</span> you can find instructions for self-assembly of devices. </p><p>  One of them is given below. </p><p>  The suppressor is able to withstand a signal at a frequency of 800 megahertz - most mobile devices are configured specifically for it.  The control generator here is the oscillating wave generator.  The device works perfectly, but for its assembly, of course, certain skills are needed. </p><p>  The <span>generator of synchronous</span> signals at forty-five megahertz is taken.  The local oscillator port responds to it.  The result is interference.  The resistance in both the port of the local oscillator and in the generator is equal by directing the signal from the generator of the oscillations of the receiver. </p><p>  At the port of the last generator, an antenna of 800 megahertz is configured.  The RF output is connected to the amplifier, increasing the power of the device to sixteen dBm.  After that, the increased signal hits the antenna. </p><p>  Then they come up with a case, install a battery, which is protected from other parts.  A switch is attached to the housing. </p>
