Famous pensions are located in Pitsunda, they have been functioning since the times of the Soviet Union.  The coastline is sometimes full of vacationers.  There are a lot of sculptures and attractions, as well as all kinds of entertainment for children and adults.  If you want a secluded and relaxing holiday, then not far from Pitsunda there is a secret corner - the Monastic Gorge. </p>

    <h2>  History of the Monastic Gorge in Abkhazia </h2><p>  The gorge has been called Monastic since ancient times.  Once upon a time in this beautiful place a group of monks settled.  The gorge met all the requirements - there was a source of fresh water, a lot of fruit trees and a cave where you can hide from the weather.  The source of water was replenished due to the cleanest mountain rivers, the taste of the water was amazing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The monks left this corner a long time ago, and the spring is still full of delicious water - they began to consider it holy.  The cave also remained, where you can enter and look around, imagine how the monks once warmed themselves in it by the fire. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Almost every resident of Pitsunda knows about the Monastic Gorge.  A reference point in the search for this object can serve as the Pitsunda fish factory.  Also in the region of the Monastic Gorge is the Armenian village of Agaraki.  It has very hospitable owners, they will gladly rent a house or a room at a reasonable price.  The private sector in the Monastic Gorge in Abkhazia is populated year-round. </p><p>  To get to the Monastic Gorge, you can use the services of a private cab or get on foot if you are light.  Walk about eight kilometers along the coastline, along the way there will be reserved zones and groves with unique flora.  Some of the reserves are fenced with a high fence, and some are completely free to enter.  A walk will give you unforgettable pleasure. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  In the region of the Monastic Gorge (Abkhazia), housing is not a problem: there are usually very few tourists here.  This is due to the fact that there are no mention of comfortable hotels with three meals a day in this region.  The apartments you rent here are small outbuildings or rooms on a common area.  As a rule, bathrooms are shared.  There will also be a shared kitchen with a large terrace, where everyone has lunch and chat together.  Guests prepare their own meals on their own, while you can use common utensils and kitchen utensils.  Fresh produce can be bought in a small market right in the village. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a reward for their humility, tourists living in such conditions get the opportunity to swim and sunbathe on the only sandy beach in all of Abkhazia.  Silence, peace, pacification - only you and nature. </p>

    <p>  There is an opinion that hermits live behind the gorge;  Of course, few people meet them. </p><p>  There is a lot of greenery, various animals, as well as the Relic Grove nearby, it is cool even in the hottest weather.  As for the local air, it's just a fairy tale!  Mostly conifers grow here, so the air is literally filled with volatile products.  After a walk along the coast, you will immediately feel a surge of strength and vigor.  The sea here, as already mentioned, is very clean and less salty than in other areas, since a lot of rivers flow into it, which originate high in the mountains. </p><p>  If you want to go on an excursion, you need to get to the center of Pitsunda - from there go various sightseeing buses or jeeps.  It organizes walks to Lake Ritsa, Gegsky Falls, Alpine meadows, etc. A picnic in nature is always included in any excursion.  The stories of the guide who will go with you are very interesting.  Also keep in mind that you will need to walk a lot, so the night before, have a good night's sleep and rest. </p>
