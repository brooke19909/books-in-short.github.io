  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Costa Dorada Real Estate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The vast area, proudly bearing the title of "Golden Coast", is given in Spain to the power of all kinds of tourist attractions.  Convenient geographical position, beautiful gently sloping beaches and the famous Spanish holiday atmosphere attract hundreds of thousands of tourists from all over Europe every year.  Sparkling in the rays of the gentle Mediterranean sun, sandy beaches gave a worthy name to this Spanish resort. </p><p>  Costa Dorada is a few small cities where the whole life of local residents seems to be aimed at providing tourists with a real vacation.  Here everyone will find something for everyone to enjoy.  Excellent conditions for water recreation are created on the coast, and street life boils 24 hours a day.  To get to this tourist paradise is very simple, because to the nearest major airport - Barcelona - there are constantly many regular and charter flights from Russia. </p><p><noindex>  <span>Costa Dorada Real Estate</span> </noindex>  presented in a very wide range of offers from agencies and individuals.  The acquisition of your own home or apartment here will provide the tourist with comfortable accommodation at any time convenient for the trip.  Do not neglect the fact that the acquisition of real estate in Europe is a reliable and profitable investment, and its availability will greatly simplify the receipt of a Schengen visa. </p><p>  Of course, when buying housing in warm Spain, the buyer, first of all, thinks about a vacation in this wonderful country.  And for these purposes, Gold Coast is the best suited.  Here, in one of the coastal cities - Salou - is the largest in the country amusement park Aventura.  In this corner on a vast area there is a huge complex of all kinds of attractions.  More recently, in May 2012, in this place, new Shambhala slides were opened, breaking European records of altitude and speed of descent.  The tourist will receive an unforgettable experience and a powerful adrenaline rush when falling from a height of 78 meters and descending at a speed of up to 134 km \ h. </p><p>  Active rest goes well with a beach holiday.  The sun's rays, golden sand and the Mediterranean Sea have a relaxing recline on the beaches of the Costa Dorada. </p><p>  You can add impressions by visiting the famous Barcelona.  Of all the cities of the Gold Coast, buses, minibuses, taxis and trains constantly run here.  Since one day you will not be able to see all the sights of Barcelona, ​​you will have to come here more than once: ancient castles and a fortress, a zoo and, of course, bullfighting - these are the magnets that attract tourists to this city.  Not far from the Costa Dorada there is the Andorra microstate, a visit to which will be an interesting addition to a vacation on the beaches. </p><p>  Due to the recent fluctuations in the Eurozone, Costa Daurada real estate has somewhat fallen in price, making its purchase even more profitable.  It is not necessary to overpay for a house by the sea - good apartments can be purchased a kilometer or two from the coast.  There are no traffic jams in resort towns, so it will not be difficult to get to the beach, and accommodation away from the coastal strip living round-the-clock noisy will provide comfort and save a considerable amount of money. </p></div></article>
