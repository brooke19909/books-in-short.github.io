Prague Tours</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Prague is rich in sights.  In this city there are many museums, theaters, ancient architectural structures.  Festivals are held annually in the Czech capital, which attracts tourists from all over the world.  But fans of classical music and connoisseurs of historical monuments are happy to visit the observation deck of Prague.  The article describes the facilities that allow residents and guests of the Czech capital to enjoy amazing landscapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic" class="if uuid-2534277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534277.jpg"></div><p>  Arriving in this ancient city, founded in the XIII century, tourists immediately get a guide to Prague.  They ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhat to see first?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere to start the inspection?‚Äù </p><p>  There are about twenty observation platforms in Prague.  Among them there are those that allow you to not only take a bird's eye view of the capital, but also see buildings located in other Czech cities.  From Charles Bridge does not make out all the sights.  However, it is with his description that every guide to Prague begins.  And it is no coincidence.  This bridge is a symbol of the Czech capital. </p><p>  Before telling about the most visited observation platforms in Prague - the Old Town and Malostransky bridge towers - it is worth telling about the building named in honor of King Charles IV.  After all, these three objects make up a single architectural composition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charles Bridge Prague" class="if uuid-2534281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534281.jpg"></div><h2>  The Charles Bridge </h2><p>  The construction connects the historical areas of Prague - Stare Mesto and Mala Strana.  The length of the Charles Bridge is more than five hundred meters.  Width is nine meters.  The bridge rests on arches lined with sandstone blocks.  Here, once upon a time, the so-called Royal Road ran along which the Czech rulers followed to the coronation. </p><p>  In the middle of the 14th century, another structure was located on the site of Charles Bridge.  It appeared in 1172.  The Juditin Bridge, which was the name of the predecessor of the main attraction of the Czech capital, was built during the time of Queen Jutta of Thuringia.  It was destroyed by one of the floods that occurred in Prague in the old days with enviable regularity. </p><p>  In 1357, <span>Charles IV</span> decided to build a new bridge.  The first stone was laid on July 9.  There are many urban legends associated with this attraction.  So, local residents once claimed that <span>Jan Nepomuk</span> was dropped from the famous <span>Prague bridge</span> <span>.</span>  Above the place where the saint's body plunged, they supposedly saw an amazing glow. </p><p>  The Old Town Bridge Tower is located in the eastern part of the bridge.  Malostranskaya - in the west.  To those who climb one of these viewing platforms, Prague appears in all its glory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="olyabalan.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague aerial view" class="if uuid-2534278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534278.jpg"></div><h2>  Old town tower </h2><p>  This building is nothing more than a passage from Charles Bridge to the historical district of Prague.  The height of the tower is 47 meters.  A staircase located on the south side leads into the interior.  The Charles Bridge bridge tower is decorated with highly artistic sculpted plastic and the arms of the Holy Roman Empire.  Some of the sculptures were destroyed during the siege of the Swedes in 1648.  This building also suffered in the 19th century, when revolutionary unrest erupted in the city. </p><h2>  Malostransky towers </h2><p>  Buildings were built at different times.  The lower tower is in the Renaissance style.  The second, higher, resembles the Old Town.  Behind the buildings begins the historic district of Mala Strana.  They are interconnected by an arch, which can be seen by climbing the Old Town Tower.  True, 136 steps have to be overcome.  Mail all excursions in Prague include a visit to Charles Bridge. </p><p>  This attraction is open every day.  In the summer - until six in the evening.  From November to May - up to five. </p><h2>  Powder Gate </h2><p>  Gothic-style buildings are located on Revolution Square, not far from the Public House - another famous landmark of Prague.  From the Powder Gate begins the Royal Road, which leads to the Prague Castle.  This building dates back to the 15th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Initially, the gate was to become one of thirty entrances from Stare Mesto.  However, plans have changed.  The tower was never completed, and later gunpowder was stored here.  The structure was badly damaged during the Prussian invasion.  In the XIX century, the Powder Tower during the restoration gave a pseudo-Gothic style.  The height of the structure is 65 meters.  Inside the tower is an exhibition of photography.  The observation deck is located at an altitude of 44 meters.  A staircase with 186 steps leads to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wheretostay.tips" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="powder gate" class="if uuid-2534286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534286.jpg"></div><h2>  Tower of the Old Town Hall </h2><p>  Observation platforms of the Czech capital have a high historical, cultural value.  They are included in the most popular excursions in Prague.  But for any practical purposes, of course, are not used.  In the old days, such structures were not built for beauty, but for safety. </p><p>  The main detail of the Old Town Hall is a structure 69 meters high.  In the Middle Ages, such constructions were needed to ensure the safety of city residents.  From here you can see almost all of Prague.  In the XIV century, and it was then that a watch tower was built on the main square, the city was very small.  The people responsible for security stopped enemy attacks on the vine.  True, not always.  Too often, Prague burned from fires caused by intruders. </p><p>  It is necessary to climb this observation deck on inclined plates, which is not very convenient.  But you can use the elevator.  Here, on the town hall building, the famous clocks are installed, not only showing the time, but also showing figures every hour, which depict 12 apostles.  These are the oldest chimes in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eshop.prague.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old town hall" class="if uuid-2534139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534139.jpg"></div><h2>  The tower of the cathedral  Nicholas (Mala Strana) </h2><p>  The baroque temple was built at the beginning of the XVIII century.  By the way, construction continued for more than half a century.  The tower, like all similar structures, was not installed for aesthetic reasons.  In it, healers spent the night and slept, designed to warn residents of the fire and other misfortunes.  They notified the townspeople with a bell.  Ironically, in 1925, the tower almost died in a fire. </p><p>  Do not confuse this temple with what is in the Old City.  There are two religious buildings in Prague named after St. Nicholas.  You can explore the city from the balcony, recently completed to the cathedral, located in Mala Strana. </p><h2>  Jind≈ô√≠≈° tower </h2><p>  This observation deck is a building in the Gothic style.  The height of the Jind≈ô√≠≈° tower is 68 meters.  Located on the street of the same name, crossing three streets: Karlov, Senovazhnaya, Wenceslas.  Chimes are installed on the tower, but you can hear them from within.  To listen to the chiming clock on the Jind≈ô√≠≈° tower is absolutely necessary.  Even those who have been here many times have never heard the same melody twice.  The musical repertoire of chimes on this tower is very wide.  Climbing the spiral staircase to the observation deck, you can see the Old Town and Wenceslas Square. </p><h2>  Petrin Tower </h2><p>  In 1889, members of the Czech Tourists Club visited the French capital.  They were unusually inspired by the Paris three-hundred-meter tower.  There was a dream to have a similar structure in his capital.  A bold plan has been implemented.  True, only partially - the height of the Petrin Tower, the creation of which the Czechs was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, is only 60 meters. </p><p>  The capital of the Czech Republic is on a hilly area.  The architects chose Petrin as the place for the future tower - the most famous mountain in Prague.  Construction began in March 1891.  Six months later, the official opening took place. </p><p>  Petrin Tower is one of the most visited places in the Czech capital.  Therefore, everything is created here for the guests of the city.  On the lower level is a cafe and gift shop.  There is also an underground floor in this architectural structure, which today is occupied by a small literary exhibition dedicated to the character of Ladislav Smolyak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrin Tower" class="if uuid-2534294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534294.jpg"></div><h2>  Zizkov tower </h2><p>  This is a relatively new attraction in Prague.  Zizkov Television Tower was built in the nineties of the last century.  Its height is more than two hundred meters.  That is, the television tower is the tallest building in the country. </p><p>  Not all tourists respond positively to this design.  On the one hand, it looks spectacular against the background of small old buildings.  On the other hand, it does not fit harmoniously into the urban landscape.  Some critics believe that it violates the panorama of Prague. </p><p>  The structure consists of three concrete pillars connected by sites.  They are cafes, restaurants, broadcasting equipment and an observation deck.  From a distance, a 200-meter structure resembles a rocket. </p><p>  The observation deck can be accessed by elevator.  It is located at an altitude of 93 meters.  It offers an unusual view.  In good weather, you can see not only the whole of Prague, but also the high-rise buildings located in neighboring cities.  The facility is also used as a meteorological laboratory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tgspring.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zizkov tower" class="if uuid-2534300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534300.jpg"></div><h2>  Gardens of Prague Castle </h2><p>  In the center of the Czech capital there are several sites from which unusual panoramic views of the city open.  In addition, these places are suitable for a relaxing holiday.  Observation decks in Prague Castle are never deserted.  There are always a lot of tourists equipped with cameras.  The sites are located near the fortress wall.  From here you can take a photo of the Old Town, look at the domes of the Church of St. Nicholas, which rise above the city rooftops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="globalnomadfamily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prague Castle Gardens" class="if uuid-2534304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534304.jpg"></div><h2>  The bell tower of St. Vitus Cathedral </h2><p>  In the southern part of the tower of the temple, the most famous in the Czech capital, there is an observation deck.  The height of the structure itself is 96 meters.  The site is below.  But in order to climb it, you need to overcome three hundred steps. </p><h2>  Vysehrad </h2><p>  The ancient fortress is located in the historical center.  It was erected in the X century.  According to historians, construction of the capital of the Czech state began in this part of the city.  And it was here that once upon a time, Princess Libus was condemned by a prophetic spirit.  According to legend, she suddenly saw that a city would soon appear on the hills above the river, which would become famous throughout the world.  Today in Vysehrad there are several viewing platforms from which tourists from different countries admire prosperous Prague. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zemefilmu.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vysehrad prague" class="if uuid-2534307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2534307.jpg"></div><p>  In order to appreciate the beauty of the architecture of the Czech capital, it is also worth visiting the Letensky Gardens, the Vrtbovsky Garden, Hotkovy Gardens, Vitkov Hill, Novyi Svet Street, the Strahov Monastery site, the Old Castle Staircase. </p><p>  The city over the Vltava is beautiful from all angles.  However, the bird's-eye view of Prague is truly bewitching.  When choosing a tour, specify whether viewing platforms are included in the route.  However, almost all tourist programs involve a visit to the Petrin Tower, the Zhuzhkov TV Tower or the Charles Bridge, and therefore, having visited this ancient city, you can take many vivid photographs. </p>
