    <p>  Before visiting this picturesque place, you should collect as much information as possible about the hotels located in the resort area.  The most famous Koblevo hotels are Victoria, Dniester, Atlantic, and Millennium.  But before starting to describe each of them, a few words should be said about the features of the village and its attractions. </p><h2>  Holidays in Koblevo </h2><p>  The resort village is located sixty kilometers from Odessa, which partly explains its popularity.  According to tourists reviews, there is no need to book a hotel room in advance.  Perhaps, only at the very peak of the season, Koblevo hotels are crowded.  The village is popular among vacationers since Soviet times.  But despite this, the offers of the restaurant and hotel business exceed demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the entrance there is a zone with recreation facilities and pensions.  It is always crowded here.  In order to appreciate the beauty of these places, you should drive into the depths of the resort area, where the hotels are located.  Koblevo is a resort that is suitable for both family and youth recreation. </p><h2>  Main attraction </h2><p>  The water park, which is located on the territory of this village, is one of the largest in Ukraine.  There are over twenty attractions here.  In the territory of the water park there is a water town, focused on the youngest visitors.  Near the entertainment complex - cafe, restaurant and guest house.  However, those who plan to spend most of their time in the water park do not need to rent a room in this hotel.  Not more than a hundred meters from the entertainment complex is the Dniester Hotel.  Koblevo is a small resort village.  Everything is located within walking distance. </p><h2>  Winery </h2><p>  There is an enterprise on Odessa Street, which includes vineyards and factories in which wine is produced.  These places are very popular among guests of Koblevo.  Tours are constantly held here, during which you can not only observe the process of preparing the drink, but also taste it. </p><p>  In addition to the winery and <span>water park, in Koblevo</span> there are no less interesting places.  Turkish fortress is a historical <span>landmark of Koblevo.</span>  It is located on the shores of Odessa Bay, near the settlement of Hadzhibey.  The ‚ÄúEni-Dunya settlement‚Äù was built in the eighteenth century and is located at the Sichavsky cape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Victoria </h2><p>  Koblevo - a village that exists due to the tourism business.  There are only boarding houses over fifty.  Victoria is one of the oldest hotel complexes.  However, reviews about it leave vacationers, both positive and negative.  The complex includes ninety rooms of different levels.  The hotel has a 24-hour restaurant "At Petrovich", a dining room, a sauna.  Rooms at this hotel range from deluxe to standard double.  However, according to reviews of some guests, the level of service in Victoria leaves much to be desired.  And the numbers "Lux" allegedly do not correspond to the cost.  Nevertheless, this hotel complex is visited annually by several hundred guests, and most of them, most likely, would not agree with such negative reviews.  Victoria is located at 1 Kishenevskaya Street. </p><h2>  Hotel Atlantic </h2><p>  Koblevo is a resort village where both Soviet-era buildings and new buildings are located.  Atlantic is a modern hotel complex.  It is an eight-story building, erected recently, in 2013.  Paid parking and a pool are located on the territory of the Atlantic.  All hotel rooms are classified as "luxury" and equipped with modern furniture.  The beach is a hundred meters from the hotel.  Address ‚ÄúAtlantic‚Äù: 7B Kurortny Avenue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Dniester </h2><p>  This hotel is suitable for nightlife lovers.  Not far from it are clubs, restaurants and cafes.  However, as already mentioned, Koblevo is a small and cozy tourist center.  Everything is nearby.  Therefore, this hotel often stops with families.  The water park - the main attraction of the village - is a fifteen minute walk from the Dniester Hotel.  The hotel is a five-story building, equipped with rooms of various levels.  Those who happened to relax in <span>Koblevo's boarding houses are</span> familiar with their layout.  Outwardly, these buildings have changed little.  One can only hope that the furniture in one-room and two-room rooms has been updated over the past decades. </p><p>  On the territory of the Dniester there is a small restaurant and a paid parking lot.  Hotel address: 3 Kurortny Avenue. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Millennium </h2><p>  Koblevo is a village on the Black Sea, where you can find a hotel for every taste and budget.  "Millennium" is a hotel complex that differs from others in interior and level of service.  In addition to the restaurant and parking, there is also a beach bar, a gym and a concert hall.  The Millennium is located on the same Resort Avenue, where the hotels are located, the description of which is presented above.  However, even outwardly this complex is different from the surrounding ones.  Although, according to the guests of Koblevo, who lived in the Millennium in the summer of 2016, the service at this hotel does not correspond to the cost of living. </p><h2>  Hotel "Duke" </h2><p>  Koblevo is a resort area, the center of which is one hundred meters from the beach.  It is in the very center of the village that the Duke Hotel is located.  In addition to the four-story building, the complex has a cafe, bar, playgrounds, a shop and even a small market.  Guests of the Duke Hotel leave various reviews about the rest, among which are extremely negative.  First of all, guests do not like the service, namely, the sullen manner of communication between administrators.  Perhaps the unpleasant impression of the interior and furniture is based precisely on the rudeness of the staff.  Duke Hotel is located at 1-A Beach Beach Alley. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Paradise </h2><p>  This hotel complex consists of four four-story buildings.  The distance from the beach to the hotel is a little over two hundred meters.  On the territory there is a basketball court, a small small town, a pizzeria, cafes and canteens.  Near the hotel there is a recreation center "Vinnitsa".  The pool adjacent to its territory can be visited by everyone for a fee.  Not far from the Paradise there are a number of drinking establishments and the classic version of the resort market, which sells mainly magnets depicting local attractions and other souvenirs that are always in demand among tourists. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  This article is about the tourist area.  The village, also called Koblevo, is located five kilometers away.  This suggests that in the summer you can meet only vacationers.  Locals who are not always distinguished by hospitality (if they are not landlords or owners of a small hotel business) do not live in houses located near recreation centers.  This feature Koblevo appreciate vacationers.  As for the cost of living, it is known that the closer the hotel is to the beach, the higher the room prices.  The budget option is represented by the hotels ‚ÄúVinnitsa‚Äù and ‚ÄúCarpathian‚Äù.  These hotels are located in the so-called Ukrainian part of Koblevo. </p><p>  There are also disadvantages to relaxing in this Black Sea resort.  Someone does not like the local beach and the sea, which in August is famous for the abundance of jellyfish.  Someone is not happy with the service.  Nevertheless, lovers of relaxation on the sea coast, if desired, will always find in this picturesque corner a hotel or a recreation center that will meet the needs.  The selection of hotels in Koblevo is really great.  In addition, rest in this resort can be useful from a cognitive point of view.  Sightseeing trips to Odessa, the legendary city with a long and fascinating history, depart from here. </p>
