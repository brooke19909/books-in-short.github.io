Due to this location, she became the protagonist in the world of great geographical discoveries.  Today in Portugal, sights and magnificent architectural compositions that reflect the rich history of the earth have been preserved. </p><p>  Excursion tours to Portugal are very popular.  More than 10 million travelers visit the country to see the beautiful palaces of Portugal, enjoy the clean beaches, <span>ancient fortresses</span> and mysterious castles. </p><p>  The country is famous for its magnificent palace Redondo, castles Obidos and Pena, as well as many other architectural ensembles. </p><p>  Portugal is not like the rest of Europe.  A significant proportion of the coast is blown by absolutely all the winds of the Atlantic.  The West is permeated by sharp fangs of rocks and looks like the cold landscapes of the English islands.  The south, which is located next to Spain, is not at all distinguished by brightness and colors.  However, the reviews about Portugal leave extremely positive.  After all, the country has its own zest and endless charm. </p><h2>  Castle Obidos (Castelo de Obidos) </h2><p>  Obidos Palace - one of the most famous buildings in Portugal, built on a small hill near the Atlantic coast.  Sightseeing tours to Portugal often include a tour of the castle. </p><p>  The name "Obidos", as they say, comes from the Latin word "fortress" or "fortified city", which was created on this site for a long time.  Due to its proximity to the ocean, Obidos attracted the interest of many invaders of the Iberian Peninsula. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="obidos palace" class="if uuid-2458406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2458406.jpg"></div><h2>  Quinta da Regaleira </h2><p>  In 1892, the owner of the castle was the Brazilian rich man, collector and philanthropist - Carvalho Monteiro, who started to build a garden of paradise on its territory.  Certainly one that could reflect his philosophical and mystical views, which would delight and amaze anyone.  The palace itself is made in the style of manueline. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fozocske.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="castle in portugal" class="if uuid-2458487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2458487.jpg"></div><p>  Manuelino - the most famous style in Portugal in the XV-XVI centuries, characterized by ornate patterns in the form of plants.  The facade of the building is generously decorated with gargoyles, Gothic towers and various capitals.  In 1942, the owner of the estate was Waldemard'Orie, who used it as a personal residence.  But since 1996, the castle passed into the possession of the Sintra City Hall, and it was opened to tourists for free access. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fozocske.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portugal castle" class="if uuid-2458490" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2458490.jpg"></div><h2>  Castle de la Pena (Palacio da pena) </h2><p>  Pena Castle in Portugal is the oldest and most beautiful castle of the period of European Romanticism.  This magnificent place is located in the vicinity of Sao Pedrode Penaferram. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pena Castle in Portugal stands on top of a hill near the city of Sintra, and on a bright day is clearly visible even from Lisbon.  The palace is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, it is considered one of the Seven Wonders of Portugal, and it is also often used for public ceremonies with the participation of the president and other dignitaries, including foreign guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onedio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="palace in portugal" class="if uuid-2458552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2458552.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the castle was carried out by Prince Ferdinand.  He was the husband of the Portuguese Queen Mary ‚à£‚à£. </p><h2>  Dona Chica Castle </h2><p>  This architectural ensemble was designed by the popular architect Ernesto Corrodi at the beginning of the 20th century.  Unfortunately, he remained incomplete, all due to lack of funding.  However, judging by the reviews of tourists, this is precisely its highlight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steampunktendencies.tumblr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gothic castle in portugal" class="if uuid-2461184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2461184.jpg"></div><p>  The palace is made in the best traditions of the neo-romantic style and has impressive windows with arcades that go down to the main entrance. </p><h2>  Almourol Castle (Castelo de Almourol) </h2><p>  The castle is located in the heart of Portugal by the Tagus River.  Almourol Castle was built by the Templars, not far from Tomar Castle, which was their main residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Templar castle" class="if uuid-2461389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2461389.jpg"></div><p>  When the army of the Templars was disbanded, the castle remained empty.  In the 19th century, the building began to be restored, and during this time it has changed significantly.  But still this castle is a national monument of Portugal. </p><p>  The Tagus River, on which stands a magnificent palace, runs in the department of Santarem.  In this area, the riverbed is still narrow; a large number of islands can be seen on the protruding shoals.  One of them was chosen for the construction of the Almourol fortress, which is an example of Portuguese fortress architecture. </p><p>  Before you there is an exact silhouette in a clear sky, drawn by the battlements of the castle and its round towers.  The immediate foundation of the castle was the base of granite rocks.  And around there is a quiet and magnificent nature: the river slowly carries its waters, its banks densely covered with rich forest, mysterious dark turquoise backwaters, swift rifts and rocky shallows.  Tourists note that this place has an incredible attraction. </p><p>  In the middle of Almurol castle, there is a square tower - a tower with a large dungeon, in which prisoners were previously held.  The tower was rebuilt many times, although it retained its main characteristics. </p><h2>  Castle of St. George (Castelo de S. Jorge) </h2><p>  The history of the city of Lisbon begins with the ancient <span>castle of St. George</span> .  Archaeologists claim that the two walls of the castle and 18 observation towers served as the most reliable protection.  All this was built by the Arabs in the 8th century! </p><p>  Currently, thousands of tourists come to this place in the Holy Land.  In 1255, Afonso III created the palace, which was used as the residence of the Portuguese sovereigns.  During its difficult history, the great building steadily survived attacks and fires, was repeatedly destroyed and reconstructed. </p><p>  After the earthquake of 1531, from this castle in Portugal there were only separate buildings in which the archaeological museum is currently located.  Among its exhibits are details of the decor of the antique royal castle and household items found during excavations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient castle in portugal" class="if uuid-2461436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2461436.jpg"></div><p>  Scraps of ancient books, national papers, restored by archaeologists, are preserved in the pavilion at the site of the library.  The external image and the interior of the museum will immerse guests in the atmosphere of medieval Portugal.  In the far wing of the castle, in the menagerie there were lions, which King Afonso V brought from Africa, as trophies obtained on the hunt.  Now there is a thematic restaurant "House of the Lion".  Tourists admire the castles of Portugal and leave the most enthusiastic reviews about this place.  Many say they would like to return here again. </p><h2>  Castle of the Moors (Castelo dos Mouros) </h2><p>  Palace of the Moors (Sintra) - a delightful castle of Portugal, which keeps a rich history.  It is located on one of the hills of the Sintra mountain range.  From the height of the walls offers excellent views of the town of the same name, the Atlantic Ocean, emerald plains.  From there you can even see the Mafra Castle. </p><p>  The palace was created in a strategic area, from here the Moors had the opportunity to control the key routes connecting Lisbon, Sintra, Mafra and Cascais. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grdash.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old castle in portugal" class="if uuid-2462566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/86863/2462566.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the XII century, while the Moors tried to share power among themselves, King Afonso Enriques liberated the local territories of Portugal.  And after the successful capture of the fortress of St. George in Lisbon in 1147, the Moors left Sintra. </p><p>  We examined the most amazing castles of Portugal and the reviews that tourists have left about them.  If you love traveling, be sure to visit these magnificent places. </p>
