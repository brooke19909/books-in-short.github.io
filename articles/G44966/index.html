Customer loyalty is the main strategy that allows customers to become not just random customers, but real friends of the network.  Marketers "Sportmaster" have developed an excellent customer program that encourages you to return to the store again and again and make purchases. </p><h2>  How to become a member of the Sportmaster family? </h2><p>  Get bonuses from the "Sportmaster" is actually very easy and accessible to anyone, if he is not too lazy.  Profitable transactions can be made not only in the store, but also directly on the official website.  From this, neither the amount nor the number of charges will change. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get sportsmaster bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2161243.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The formula is simple.  1 point on the card is equal to 1 ruble of the Russian Federation in the amount of the purchase.  If the goods were purchased in the amount of 1000 rubles, then 1000 points will be credited to the card.  A plastic card is issued free of charge.  You can get it on hand after making your first purchase at the Sportmaster store.  Filling out the form and getting 500 bonuses is all that needs to be done.  Indicate the real data and a valid phone number. </p><h2>  How to register online? </h2><p>  You can get Sportmaster bonuses on the company's website for free.  There is a special section on registration.  If you go into it and go through the standard questionnaire, the first 500 bonuses will be automatically credited to the virtual bonus card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The loyalty program</span> is not only a point accumulation system.  The more purchases, the more you can get Sportmaster bonuses.  At the same time, program participants have many privileges.  Some discounts are only valid for those who have a card.  The product return system and warranty repair conditions are also simplified. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sportsmaster get bonuses on the card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2161242.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you buy a simple ball worth 300 rubles, you will be surprised why points were not counted.  Please note that bonuses are awarded on goods whose value exceeds 1000 rubles.  But you can spend them without restrictions.  At least 200 rubles, at least 200 thousand.  Points do not appear immediately, but within 3 working days. </p><h2>  Important Nuances </h2><p>  Another caveat - do not be afraid to buy products from the categories "Sportmaster Discount", "Best Price" and others.  They also earn points. </p><p>  According to many buyers, it is Sportmaster that has the most profitable loyalty system.  You can get bonuses on the card at any time of the year, but it is better to spend them in the off-season.  Unlike other companies that provide bonuses only for a short period of time, after which they burn out, Sportmaster gives a chance to accumulate them during the year.  The key date is <span>March 11th.</span>  On this day, all the accumulated advantages of the past period will be burned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Exceptions are temporary bonuses, the validity of which is designed for the duration of a particular promotion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get sportsmaster bonuses for feedback" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2161240.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Blue card </h2><p>  The first step in the loyalty system is to get a simple blue card.  They are issued to everyone who made a purchase of 1000 rubles or more.  This is the easiest way to receive Sportmaster bonuses.  At the same time, of all types of cards, this one gives the lowest interest. </p><p>  There are not so many bonuses accrued on the blue card: with every 1000 rubles there are only 50 bonuses.  As much as possible with their help, you can pay 20% of the purchase price.  If you properly manage these advantages, you will save significantly.  The best time for shopping with bonuses is the spring-autumn season, when the store has additional discounts that are combined with the percentage of bonuses.  For example, a jacket, which will cost 5-6 thousand rubles a season, can be sold at a 30% discount in summer and plus 20% on a card.  Total purchase will cost 2-3 thousand.  This is used by many people, especially families where there are many children and all schoolchildren. </p><p>  In addition, the blue card provides a number of advantages.  There is an opportunity to book goods and return under warranty for 1 month later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Get 500 Sportmaster bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2161238.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Silver card </h2><p>  This is the second, more advanced level.  You can get such a card when the total amount of purchases for the entire period of your cooperation with Sportmaster is 15,000 rubles.  This is the only company in Russia that provides such benefits. </p><p>  A silver card is very beneficial.  With each 1000 rubles of purchase, it is no longer awarded 50, but 70 points.  The warranty period is extended for another 30 days, and you can get services with a 50% discount.  And most importantly - you can pay for goods with bonuses in an amount equal to 50% of its value.  No longer need to wait for the summer, but feel free to take your favorite jacket immediately for 2-3 thousand. </p><h2>  Gold card </h2><p>  And the highest level is a gold card.  It is issued to those who are a true fan of Sportmaster and have made purchases in the amount of 150,000 rubles.  For every thousand such customers receive 100 bonuses and can use them to fully pay for their new purchase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get 200 sportsmaster bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2161239.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Leave a review </h2><p>  Many are interested in how to get bonuses on the Sportmaster card for free, without making purchases.  Very simple.  To do this, just leave a review on YandexMarket.  To do this, on the store‚Äôs website you just need to follow the recommended link, the necessary page will open.  The first step is to fill out the review itself and give positive ratings.  The second - entering your own data, as well as information on the bonus card.  You can get Sportmaster bonuses for a review an unlimited number of times.  While this issue is not controlled in any way, but the bonuses themselves have a limit - in 90 days they will disappear. </p><h2>  Sign up bonuses </h2><p>  The easiest way to get 500 Sportmaster bonuses is to register through the online system.  It must be remembered that these are temporary benefits and are valid for only 30 days.  Another important point.  If you already have a club card and your phone number is attached to it, then in the online system you need to specify another and open a new card.  And after some time, these cards can be combined into one through the telephone of a free service department. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sportsmaster fill out an application and get 500 bonuses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2162961.jpg"></div>
