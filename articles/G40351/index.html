One of these countries can be called - Egypt, although the huge popularity of <span>holidays in Egypt</span> no longer allows us to consider the country exotic in the literal sense of the word.  And the pearl of this amazing country, which has a rich history and many historical monuments, is the resort of Sharm El Sheikh, located in the south of the <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span> </p><p>  The peninsula is surrounded by the Red Sea, so named because of the many corals considered the most beautiful in the world.  It is the gentle sea and the rich underwater world that attract tourists here, especially since the prices in hotels are relatively small, and the quality of service is European, that is, at a fairly high level. </p><p>  Of course, not all hotels have an impeccable reputation, but if you worry in advance, you can, after reading the reviews of compatriots who have already visited Egypt, choose the suitable option and even pre-book a room similar to that provided by 4 star Sharm Egypt hotels. </p><p>  The five-star Sharm El Sheikh hotels located in the Old City of Sharm El Maya on the coast of Naama Bay are world famous.  Decorated in an Arabic style, they amaze you with their luxurious interior, quality of service, varied food and entertainment.  All these hotels are united by a single walking recreation area, in which vacationers stroll in the evenings. </p><p>  But Egypt hotels 4 stars <strong> </strong>  not only are not inferior to five-star hotels, but sometimes surpass them in some respects.  So is it worth it to overpay?  Search 4 star hotels in Egypt for Sharm, look up the information and book a room. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main flow of tourists begins here in the fall and winter - in the dry season.  It is during this period that the air temperature drops to 25-30 degrees, and the water temperature, even in winter, is below 20-22 degrees. </p><p>  Many hotels of Egypt 4 stars <strong> </strong>  are located on the very shore of the Red Sea.  Located on the edge of Naama Bay, Iberotel Lido Boutique Hotel is just a few meters from the sea.  The hotel‚Äôs architectural solution is very unusual - it was built in the form of a three-story ship with cabin rooms, which are located on two decks.  A rooftop swimming pool creates the complete illusion of an ocean liner. </p><p>  Hotels of Egypt 4 stars, <strong> </strong>  like five-star - it's <strong> </strong>  high class hotels.  Typically, these hotels have their own sandy beaches with umbrellas and sun loungers, such as the Iberotel Lido.  Many hotels for children have playgrounds, outdoor pools, children's mini-clubs, and babysitting services are offered. </p><p>  True, judging by the reviews, clubs do not always work, or work, but the children are left to their own devices, and the nanny may not come at all.  But in the evenings, animators conduct entertainment programs for all vacationers. <strong> </strong>  Hotels of Egypt 4 stars <strong> </strong>  They have a lot of sports entertainment - gyms and tennis courts, billiards, darts and others. </p><p>  In Sharm El Sheikh there are about two hundred operating hotels from one to five stars.  One and three star hotels belong to low level hotels.  Service there, of course, is not at the highest level, but air conditioning, a TV and a safe are provided for free, and the rooms are cleaned daily.  True, for cleaning it is customary to leave a tip. </p><p>  Some hotels of Egypt 3 stars <strong> </strong>  very popular among tourists.  The 3-star Nile Valley Hotel has a respectable appearance and even non-smoking rooms.  And in the lobby there is a machine for cleaning shoes.  Of course there are 3 star hotels in Egypt, <strong> </strong>  which you don‚Äôt want to return to, but this is the exception rather than the rule.  Typically, high-class hotels are distinguished by the fact that they have a larger list of services, a more diverse menu and their own beaches. </p>
