Everything here has a great rest: a warm sea, endless beaches and the largest entertainment complexes on the mainland.  And he is chosen because the city has a developed hotel chain.  As it turned out, the "treshki" are the most popular among tourists.  Why?  Everything is simple.  Hotels in Salou (Spain) 3 stars combine a decent infrastructure, good location (proximity to the beaches), as well as comfortable living conditions. </p><p>  We will analyze the most popular options, but first a couple of tips. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="41.0777465" data-lng="1.1315925999999763" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/7/7/17677.png"></div><h2>  Tourists recommend </h2><p>  If the view from the window is very important to you, choose coastal hotels.  Then beautiful sunrises and sunsets will be provided to you.  For example, Casablanca Playa is located just near the beach.  In principle, almost all hotels of Salou (Spain) 3 stars are located in close proximity to the sea or 5-15 minutes walk from it.  But just in case, before booking, be sure to check with representatives on which line of the beach the complex is located. </p><p>  As for infrastructure, there is almost everything here: from spacious pools to gyms.  Hotel Jaime I is perfect for families with children. For younger guests there is a children's room, animators, as well as playgrounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.hoteljaimeprimero.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hotel Jaime I" class="if uuid-3226068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/3226068.jpg"></div><p>  Let's talk about the number of hotels of 3 stars in Salou (Spain).  As a rule, the interior is simple, but at the same time it has a comfortable rest.  The apartments are equipped with necessary furniture, air conditioning, TV, balcony and private bathroom.  Some hotel complexes also provide Wi-Fi, but mostly high-speed Internet is available on request, that is, for a fee. </p><p>  Remember that almost all Spanish beaches are municipal.  Therefore, you either have to stock up on your own umbrella and mat, or pay for renting sun loungers.  There is another option: book a hotel room on the 1st line.  For example, the loungers of the Best Maritim 3 * complex are located just 20 meters from the beach, which is separated by a narrow promenade.  The only problem is the lack of umbrellas.  As they say, whoever is in the shadow.  Therefore, if you do not plan or do not like to wake up early, we recommend that you stock up on your own umbrella. </p><h2>  3 stars: hotel ratings of Salou (Spain) according to TripAdvisor </h2><p>  The list was compiled based on reviews from tourists.
