This wonderful natural and historical attraction is completely impossible to ignore.  And sometimes you want to stay here for a couple of days to fully enjoy swimming in the Dead Sea and healing the body with unique salts and mud. </p><p>  But where to stay?  The shores of this reservoir are always waiting for tourists.  There are many resorts, and one of them is Ein Bokek.  In this small village, the five star David Dead Sea Resort Spa hotel stands out.  Our article is dedicated to him.  We will make a description of the hotel itself, its rooms, services and other infrastructure.  People come to the Dead Sea for medical treatment.  To consolidate and enhance the effect of swimming, you need to go through a wellness course in the hotel's spa.  We will tell you in detail about the procedures that the medical building of the hotel offers.  What do tourists say about the hotel?  We included their reviews and photos in our description. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="31.202574" data-lng="35.36140599999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/9/7/4/11974.png"></div><h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Address David Dead Sea Resort Spa - Israel, Samaria and Judea, Ein Bokek city.  At this resort, the hotel is hard to miss.  It is the highest (17 floors) and the largest.  Despite the fact that until recently the hotel was called "La Meridien Dead Sea", everyone here knows it under a new name.  Ein Bokek is located on the southwestern shore of the Dead Sea.  It is 150 kilometers from Ben Gurion Airport.  So the transfer from Tel Aviv will take more than two hours.  From Jerusalem it will take you about 90 minutes to get to the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ein Bokek is a fairly small resort.  Opposite it rises the Judean ridge, and the village itself is buried in tropical greenery.  Around the resort there are many attractions.  So, 16 kilometers away is <span>the Masada fortress.</span>  Travelers can also visit the Ein Gedi National Nature Reserve.  The resort is suitable for lovers of a quiet and measured rest, as well as for those who have arrived to the shores of the Dead Sea for recovery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: reviews" class="if uuid-2973337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973337.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  David Dead Sea Resort Spa is an entire hotel complex.  Next to the "five" is the hotel "Leonardo Inn 3 *".  And the infrastructure of the complex is joint.  Of course, the guests of the ‚Äútroika‚Äù were delighted that they could use the pools and baths of the five-star hotel for little money.  But this did not please the residents of David at all.  One way or another, but the joint coexistence of the two hotels significantly expands the territory of the complex. </p><p>  Tourists in the reviews say that it‚Äôs just right to get lost.  As many as twelve hectares!  But the territory is well-groomed, clean and well-landscaped.  Those hotel guests who came to the Dead Sea in the summer, assure that there is a lot of shade everywhere, it's nice to walk along the alleys.  It offers guests - several pools, a playground, a mini market, a souvenir shop and even a synagogue.  Car parking is free for guests, as well as the use of tennis courts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel is 750 meters from the shore.  A free electric car can bring guests to their own beach, which is not without reason called the "Golden".  This service is mainly used by people who came to the Dead Sea to treat joints, and even then on the way back, when the road goes a little up.  But walk to the beach on foot for five minutes. </p><p>  The length of the hotel's own coast is 500 meters.  The beach is really covered with golden sand.  It should be noted that it is also common to David Dead Sea Resort Spa and the Leonardo Inn.  But loungers, tourists say, are enough for everyone.  Sunset at sea is gentle, comfortable, the bottom is cleared of stones.  The beach has a shower, toilet.  But, tourists complain, there is no bar, not even a paid one.  Since the Dead Sea by nature itself is intended to be a source of healing and relaxation, water entertainments are not practiced here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.daka90.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa - Coast" class="if uuid-2973364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973364.jpg"></div><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  In most of the photos, David Dead Sea Resort Spa looks like a tall white building, at the foot of which there are reservoirs with turquoise water.  But the hotel also has a heated indoor pool.  One open-air tank is filled with sea water, and the second is fresh.  All of these pools surround the sun terraces.  On them are sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Beach towels at the hotel are free and without deposit.  Tourists report that there is also a sun terrace on the roof of the building.  Few people know about her, and therefore there is almost deserted and quiet.  On the roof there is also a shower and toilet, there are sun loungers.  Tourists say that this solarium is even better than the pool, because there are fans there, which is important in the summer heat.  For children there is a small "paddling pool" with a convenient approach for kids. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grandhotels-israel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: Pools" class="if uuid-2973374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973374.jpg"></div><h2>  Room categories.  Recommendations of tourists on the choice of rooms </h2><p>  David Dead Sea Resort Spa was built in 1996.  When in 2013 the former La Meridien Dead Sea entered the Grand Hotels hotel chain, a major overhaul was made in the building.  Only the rather poor soundproofing remained from the former: tourists complain that voices are heard from the corridor.  There are six elevators in the building, there were no lines in their lines.  Therefore, all tourists recommend booking a room on the upper floors.  So you get two bonuses at once.  The first is a beautiful view of the Dead Sea or the mountains.  And the second is silence and calm. </p><p>  According to hotel policy, only adults are accommodated on the top three floors.  And since local children have never heard the phrase ‚ÄúBe quiet‚Äù from parents, tourists living away from them can fully enjoy a relaxing holiday.  As for room categories, guests have plenty to choose from.  The cheapest rooms are called deluxe.  Among them there are double and triple, as well as family rooms (two adults and 2 children).  Suites are divided into subcategories.  These are Masada, Premium, Deluxe Suite, David Suite, Masada Suite, Royal Suite and Presidential Suite. </p><h2>  David Dead Sea Resort Spa: description of the lowest price room </h2><p>  Deluxe rooms are located between floors 10 and 14.  Tourists report that, without exception, all the guest rooms at the hotel are very spacious.  The balcony was especially struck by tourists - a huge one, with two sunbeds, a coffee table and a parasol.  The windows overlook either the Dead Sea or the pool.  In the usual deluxe room, guests will find all the amenities needed for a five-star hotel: a TV with LCD screen, air conditioning, a safe, and a minibar. </p><p>  Bathrooms are also very spacious.  There you will find a hairdryer, toiletries, bathrobes and slippers.  Most bathrooms have a shower, but some also have a bathtub. </p><p>  Premium rooms are located on floors 16 and 17.  According to the concept of the hotel, only adults are accommodated in these rooms.  The premium rooms have recently been redecorated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.grandhotels-israel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: room description" class="if uuid-2973379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973379.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the suites </h2><p>  Guests of more expensive rooms at the David Dead Sea Resort Spa, in addition to superior comfort, are also entitled to exclusive services.  This is a welcome drink and a sweet gift, improved breakfasts in a special lounge, free access to some treatments in the spa, early check-in and late check-out, separate reception.  Every day, tea and coffee bags and fresh newspapers are delivered to these rooms. </p><p>  The deluxe suite (floors 14 and 15) consists of a bedroom and a living room, two bathrooms and 2 balconies with sea views. </p><p>  In the room "David" to all of the above advantages are added a dressing room and dining area.  The balcony in this room on the 16th floor is panoramic. </p><p>  The uppermost level of the building is occupied by Masada Suites.  These rooms include a home cinema. </p><p>  On the upper two floors of the hotel building there are royal and presidential suites.  These rooms are individually decorated and are stunning with luxury furnishings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ca.kayak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: suites" class="if uuid-2973383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973383.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  According to tourists in reviews, David Dead Sea Resort Spa operates as a B&amp;B.  That is, breakfast is already included in the price.  But if you wish, you can pay half or full board.  Tourists strongly recommend taking three meals a day.  Firstly, because the prices for it at the hotel are very affordable.  Secondly, because the food there is delicious and varied.  And finally, because the Ein Bokek resort is very small, and there are only McDonald's from the catering places. </p><p>  Tourists leave the most laudatory reviews about breakfast.  But you should take into account the specifics of Jewish cuisine.  They don‚Äôt serve meat in milk sauces.  Based on the fact that people come to the Dead Sea for treatment, a separate diet table is set up in the main Bazaar restaurant.  VIP guests from the suites are served breakfast at Olives Lodge.  The food there is especially tasty, but you won‚Äôt leave the Bazaar hungry either.  For lunch, guests can enjoy a meal at Ain Midbar, or enjoy refreshing drinks at the Splash Bar by the pool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: Food" class="if uuid-2973389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973389.jpg"></div><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Whatever the weather outside, David Dead Sea Resort Spa will always offer guests to soak in two outdoor pools, the water in which (fresh and sea) is constantly heated to + 28 degrees.  And if, what happens extremely rarely, it rains, you can swim in the tank indoors.  Children are not allowed to visit the spa, which adults enjoy. </p><p>  Among the services of this bath complex, massages, cosmetic and therapeutic procedures, body wraps, anti-cellulite program, hydrogen sulfide baths are paid.  All other spa services - Finnish sauna, Turkish hammam, gym, jacuzzi - can be used freely. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cybevasion.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="David Dead Sea Resort Spa: services" class="if uuid-2973399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2973399.jpg"></div><h2>  Amenities at David Dead Sea Resort Spa </h2><p>  Throughout the hotel complex, and even on the beach, there is fast and free Wi-Fi.  The hotel building has three ironing rooms, a medical office, a gift shop and a mini market.  Guests can use the tennis court and squash court on site.  There is a playground for little tourists. </p><p>  At the reception, several employees speak Russian.  According to reviews, these pleasant young people are very friendly and strive to please guests.  Without leaving the hotel you can exchange currency, book excursions, call a taxi or book tickets.  For a small fee, the hotel offers an airport shuttle service. </p>
