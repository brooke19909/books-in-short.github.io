Dagestan has 42 districts and 10 urban districts.  The average in numbers is the Dokuzparinsky district.  In it, as of January 1 of this year, 15,214 people live.  The administrative center is the village of Usukhchay. </p><h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Dokuzparinsky district is the southernmost municipality, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã452.1 square meters.  km  The territorial unit was formed back in 1934.  On the south side, it borders with Azerbaijan. </p><p>  There is also its own enclave, which was formed on the territory of the Derbent region only in the 60-70s of the last century - this is the village of Avadan.  It was formed at the expense of immigrants from Lezgi villages.  93.96% of Lezghins live here (according to the Federal State Statistics Service for 2010), therefore, not only Russian, but also Lezgin is adopted here as the official language. </p><p>  In the region there are 16 territorial units subordinated to 9 rural settlements. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Dokuzparinsky district is the most beautiful in all of Dagestan.  There are high mountains and fast rivers, picturesque nature and unique fauna and flora.  This is where the climate is very diverse.  At the same time, in Kurush (by the way, the highest mountain village in all of Europe), snow may still lie, and fruit trees will bloom in Usukhchay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pilgrims and just tourists come to the area, trying to conquer impregnable cliffs.  So, Mount Bazardyuzyu is a kind of climbing symbol, its peak is an adornment of the Caucasus Range, and its height is 4466 meters and is the highest point of Dagestan. </p><p>  The second natural attraction is Mount Nesendang, its height is 3928 m. It is not as high as Bazarduzu, but it is more visible and attractive.  There is also Mount Radagan with a height of 4020 m and Mount Charundag (4079 m), which are the most inaccessible.  And the most popular place is the Yarudag mountain range with a height of 4116 meters.  There are many difficult routes here, so climbers come to her, competing in agility. </p><p>  Naturally, you can not remain silent about Shalbuzdang 4142 meters high.  People come here not only for competitions, but also to admire the ideal shape of this mountain, especially noticeable against the blue sky and the contours of neighboring peaks. </p><p>  There are many canyons in the Dokuzparinsky district - Charunsky (6 km) and Mullar tea (5 km).  On the territory of the second canyon there are two unique waterfalls - one 7 meters high, and the other - 8. Simply put, the area has many unique places that will always attract tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Usuhchay </h2><p>  The village is the administrative center and 1866 people live here.  Usuhchay is considered the oldest settlement of Lezghins.  The first mention of it dates back to the VIII century.  Historical information suggests that internecine wars took place on the territory of the settlement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the 19th century, active development began here, a police station was erected, a road service building (now it controls electric networks), many mosques. </p><p>  The first inhabitants of the village were immigrants from the village of Karakure.

    <h2>  Kalajuh </h2><p>  Previously, the village was called Kala, which means "fortress."  Indeed, a little higher than the modern settlement is an ancient fortress, or rather its foundation.  During the excavations, many interesting artifacts were found, from household items to weapons.  Now in the village of Kaladzhukh of the Dokuzparinsky district, 1695 people live. </p><p>  In 2013, the Russian government returned part of the Dagestan territories to Azerbaijan.  The lands of the village of Kaladzhukh of the Dokuzparinsky district were also assigned to them. </p><p>  Photos of local pastures have always fascinated tourists.  After all, this is about 900 hectares of beautiful meadows, where previously local residents grazed their pets. </p>

    <h2>  Mikrah </h2><p>  The village of Mikrakh of the Dokuzparinsky district is located in the center of the administrative-territorial unit.  1388 people live here.  The village has a unique attraction - a medieval settlement, which is located 500 m from the borders of the village.  And on both sides beyond the borders of the settlement there are burial grounds of stone crypts. </p><p>  The village is one of the oldest Lezgi settlements, it is located on the banks of the river Usukhchay.  There are many fertile arable lands in the district, huge pastures and springs with clean water.  The village is surrounded on four sides by mountains.  On one of them, Mount Yarydag, all-Russian climbing competitions are held annually.  The rock is an 800-meter sheer wall. </p><p>  In 1994, the village celebrated 5,000 years.  Naturally, the founding date can be refuted, but there are references to it even in the writings of the traveler Ptolemy, who lived in the II century BC.  The ancient origin of the settlement is also confirmed by the burial grounds surrounding the village and occupying more than 20 hectares. </p><p>  Simply put, Dagestan is a Mecca for tourists and climbers who regularly come here. </p>
