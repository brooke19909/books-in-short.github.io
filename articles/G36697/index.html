    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liepaja Latvia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/862702.jpg"></div>  In historical documents, the first mention of the settlement of Livs in this area occurs in 1253.  The year 1418 became tragic in the history of the city: then Liepaja was scorched by the Lithuanian army, and according to the sources, no native was left alive.  The settlement begins its new history in 1625.  In those days, the city belonged to the possessions of the Duke of Courland William.  After the end of the Swedish-Polish war, trade was rapidly developing, and at the end of the 17th century the port of Liepa was built.  At the same time, a canal was dug, in the 19th century the history of the city begins as an important center of international representations.  This function remains today: today, there are 13 embassies of various states.  In the days of the USSR, Liepaja (Latvia today) became a strategic military target.  There is a version that the local port was considered as one of the best bases for the preparation of military naval operations.

The sand is very small and golden, in some places the coast is about 70 meters wide.  Jurmalas Park is planted along the beach.  This natural object begins its history from the middle of the XIX century.  Today, its total area is approximately 70 hectares.  Here more than 140 species of shrubs and trees coexist peacefully.  One of the interesting modern attractions is the giant drums installed in the Seaside Park, which remind us that the life of the city is inextricably linked with music.  Many tours to Latvia include a day trip to this unique reserve.  Do not forget to visit this place if you are resting nearby.

The very heart of Liepaja is the square of roses.  Once there was a market here, but after its reorganization, the city government decided to equip a recreation area on the liberated territory and plant roses.  In total, about 500 bushes were planted, the last time the reconstruction was carried out in 2000.  Now the flowerbed looks even more spectacular, and along its edges you can see the signs of the twin cities of such a flourishing city as Liepaja.  Latvia is a very clean country in which they carefully preserve historical monuments and the health of citizens.  One of the important places for residents and visitors is Tirgonyu Street, whose alternative name is Pedestrian Avenue.  There are a variety of cafes, souvenir shops and photo workshops.  If you decide to have lunch or buy something, then do not forget that the official <span>currency of Latvia</span> today is no longer the local lats, but the euro.  The highlight of this street is a complete ban on the movement of vehicles, it is a completely pedestrian zone, hence the popular name.

In Soviet times, this zone was closed to civilians.  Therefore, there are no interesting historical monuments and rich decor.  Today, the Promenade is a <span>public place</span> that everyone can visit.  In recent years, the city government has paid sufficient attention to the improvement of this zone.  Places for recreation have already been created, in the summer, flowerbeds are broken.  There are cafes, souvenir shops, as well as a fish market, where you can inexpensively buy just caught fish. </p><p>  Attractive promenade thanks to the picturesque views.  From here you can clearly see the sea, port, ships and yachts, as well as the grand fountain.  One of the main decorations of the Promenade is the amber clock.  Rumor has it that it took about 50 liters of amber to create them.  The history of the creation of this object is also interesting: in 2003, an action was held in which the townspeople donated their amber for the creation of new city clocks. </p><h2>  Church of St. Anne </h2>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liepaya City" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/862677.jpg"></div>  One of the most interesting architectural monuments in Liepaja is <span>St. Anne's Church.</span>  The temple is considered one of the oldest in the city - the first mention of it dates back to 1508.  The church is located on Curcu Square, next to the Petertirgus Market.  Repeatedly the building was rebuilt, its appearance also changed.  Attention also deserves the interior decoration.  In 1997, the main altar of the temple celebrated its centenary.  This element of the church interior was created by Niklas Sefrens Jr., it is decorated with wood carvings and is made in the Baroque style, characteristic of its period.  The Church of St. Anne is the real pride of the city.  Liepaja (Latvia) is rich in architectural monuments and religious buildings, and in the whole country there is no second temple similar to this one.

According to legend, the first stone for its construction was really laid personally by Sovereign Nicholas II.  Of particular interest is the Holy Trinity Cathedral: one of the largest mechanical organs in all of Europe has survived to this day.
