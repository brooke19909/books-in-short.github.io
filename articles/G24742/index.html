With this item, you can associate wallpaper with the upholstery of the sofa, a carpet with curtains, or just make bright accents and a little comfort in this room.  Just changing the design of the pillows can completely transform the room.  Use acceptable purchased pillows, however, you can not guess with the color, adding an additional shade to the interior, which may not always be appropriate.  And you can create them yourself.  DIY pillow decor ideas can be found below. </p><h2>  Applique </h2><p>  The most common and easiest way to decorate pillows is to use fabrics of a suitable color, interesting texture and pattern, often for the manufacture they take the same fabric that was used when sewing curtains or a plaid, which allows you to create a common room style.  However, such products cannot fully reflect the individuality of the owner of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillow application" class="if uuid-3080142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080142.jpg"></div><p>  A more laborious, but very popular way of decorating pillows with your own hands is application.  It can be both subject and abstract.  Such products will decorate the children's room, and the use of modern designs will bring youth drive to the room.  More classic applications, including voluminous, will add romanticism to the design of the room.  The combination of flat geometric shapes and modern fabrics will be appropriate to look in a room made in high-tech style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For application, it is necessary to choose dense fabrics in which the edges are not strewed.  It is especially convenient to use faux suede, leather and flock in this type of decor.  If it is necessary to apply cotton fabric, then it can be pre-glued with non-woven fabric or duplicated parts can be made.  To do this, cut out 2 mirror parts of each element, then they are sewn together, turned out, if desired, filled and sewn to the main fabric. </p><h2>  Pechvork </h2><p>  Patchwork is another classic pillow decor.  It‚Äôs quite easy to sew such pillowcases with your own hands, the main thing is to follow the following rules: </p><ul><li>  In the finished fabric, the direction of the shared thread of all elements must match. </li><li>  Before using cotton fabrics, the material must be prepared so that the parts do not sit down when washing the finished product. </li><li>  For the same reason, do not combine synthetic and natural fabrics - in order to avoid subsequent deformation of the pillow. </li><li>  In order for the product to keep its shape better, it can be glued with non-woven, but only after all the shreds are sewn and the edges are ironed. </li></ul><p>  To work in this technique, it is not necessary to use classic repeating motifs of squares and triangles.  Such an ornament, combined with bright fabric in a small flower, is more suitable for decorating a country house in a rustic style.  But the use of a honeycomb ornament in combination with a modern print will make such a product a stylish, handmade jewelry.  The photo of the pillow decor in this technique clearly demonstrates this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovepatchworkandquilting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using patchwork to create a pillow" class="if uuid-3080204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080204.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, patchwork of scraps of various shapes without the use of cyclic ornaments is very popular when elements simply fill the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future product without following any sequence.  Another type of this technique is the creation of paintings from shreds, while they are not sewn onto the base, as in applications, but stitched together.  This technique is quite complex and requires some skill. </p><h2>  Trapunto </h2><p>  This technique has Italian roots, and products with such voluminous embroidery adorned the richest houses of European society.  Today it is more like an art stitch than embroidery, but this does not change the essence.  Beautiful three-dimensional ornaments made on a snow-white canvas, and dense filling with a small pattern of the background are the characteristic features of this technique.  You can also meet multi-colored products that look no less impressive in any interior, but the royal chic is to make such products in the style of Total White. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kdesparois.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.kdesparois.com/?p=1449"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trapunto pillow" class="if uuid-3080179" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080179.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself decor of a sofa cushion in this technique begins with the preparation of materials.  The blank for the front of the pillow consists of three layers - the lining, the filler and the upper material, on which the drawing is preliminarily applied.  In order for the product to turn out neat, you must follow three rules: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  All layers of the workpiece must be bound together over the entire area with needles. </li><li>  Embroidery should start from the center and move to the edges of the product. </li><li>  It is necessary to use a special machine, with free travel and a strong motor.  If there is no such technique, then the product is best embroidered manually. </li></ol><h2>  Embroidery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.potterybarn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery on the pillow" class="if uuid-3080239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080239.jpg"></div><p>  You can use any kind of embroidery for such a decor of pillows on your sofa with your own hands, whether it is smooth surface, crosses, chain stitch or Japanese national sashiko technique.  Embroidery is good because you can do absolutely any pattern.  Such products are quite durable, lend themselves well to cleaning, and if necessary - and to restore the picture.  You can embroider both manually and on a typewriter.  Moreover, a geometric ornament, similar to the decor of the sofa cushion shown in the photo, can be done with your own hands even on a household sewing machine. </p><h2>  Embroidery ribbons </h2><div class="photo" data-original="florilegium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ribbon embroidery on the pillow" class="if uuid-3080248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080248.jpg"></div><p>  This is the most romantic and elegant way of embroidery.  Finished products are striking in their beauty and sophistication, the flowers on them look like living.  Embroidery in this technique has been especially popular in Europe since the XIV century.  Many noble girls willingly embroidered ribbons for dresses, pillows, paintings, bags, which is not surprising, since doing this is quite easy and fast.  This is due to the fact that there is no need to fill the contours of the pattern, as if in smooth surface, to make a petal, but it is enough to make one stitch with a ribbon.  Today it is not only beautiful, but also very affordable type of embroidery, because satin and chiffon ribbons are not so expensive. </p><h2>  Batik </h2><div class="photo" data-original="society6.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using batik to decorate pillows" class="if uuid-3080256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080256.jpg"></div><p>  For those who like to draw, this type of creativity is ideal.  DIY pillow decor in this technique will not only allow you to enjoy the process, but also attach your successful work.  It will also allow you to create a unique artist style in your room.  Pillows in combination with paintings made in the same technique hung on plain walls will create a single ensemble, and replacing the images with them will completely transform the room without additional repairs. </p><p>  However, several nuances must be taken into account.  Firstly, in order for paints to go better, it is necessary to use natural silk, and this is a rather expensive material.  Secondly, take care of the product very carefully.  Hand wash at a temperature of 30 degrees with a special tool for silk, gentle spin through a towel, drying away from heating appliances.  It is necessary to iron such products a little damp and at an average temperature. </p><h2>  Pompons </h2><div class="photo" data-original="verysillymayor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pompom Pillow" class="if uuid-3080276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080276.jpg"></div><p>  DIY pillow decor is not only an exciting process, but also a way to get rid of unnecessary materials.  In this case, you can originally attach old yarn.  Making pillow pompoms is quick and easy.  As you can see in the photo, the elements have a low density, and in shape are more like brushes than balls.  This is what makes the pillow soft and pleasant to the touch. </p><p>  To achieve this effect, the yarn is wound, for example, between the legs of the table, 15-20 turns are enough, then the resulting ring is cut and laid out on the floor.  The workpiece is tied at regular intervals (required pile length * 2), and then cut between the nodes, forming pompons.  Thus, quite quickly you can make many elements of the same color at once. </p><p>  Then, on the fabric base, approximate marking is made in a checkerboard pattern, after which the ends of the ropes fixing the villi in the pompom are crocheted to the wrong side of the base.  Between the two ends of the rope one element should be 0.5-1 cm. Next, the ropes are tied with a double knot, the excess ends are cut off.  Pompons need to be placed tight enough to each other, so that as a result you get a single canvas. </p><h2>  Knitting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wayfair.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas pillow" class="if uuid-3080340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080340.jpg"></div><p>  In this technique, it is very convenient to do the Christmas decor of pillows with your own hands.  You can use both classic winter ornaments - snowflakes and deer, as well as original drawings, as well as shapes.  A triangle-shaped pillow - a Christmas tree decorated with multi-colored pom-poms - will delight children, and a beautiful New Year theme will become an alternative to Christmas sweaters popular in America.  It is very easy to knit such products as a crochet, and knitting, as the shape of the workpiece is a simple rectangle with a pattern on one half. </p><p>  Everyday knitted pillows also look beautiful, the decor of which consists of an ornament, braids or aran.  Such products go well with a knitted blanket, add coziness and warmth to the room. </p><h2>  Ruffles </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vanillajoy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruffle pillow" class="if uuid-3080355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3080355.jpg"></div><p>  Pillows decorated with fringe or ruffles are very beautiful and feminine.  However, this does not mean that do-it-yourself pillowcase decor for cushions is only in the rooms of little princesses.  The ruffles made in delicate color from lace, organza or tulle, combined with rhinestones and pearl beads will really turn the girl‚Äôs room into the princess‚Äôs chambers, especially if this is complemented by a decorative canopy above the bed.  However, the use of simpler and more natural fabrics with a modern print and sufficiently saturated colors will allow using this type of jewelry in any other rooms, making an ordinary pillow a stylish piece of furniture. </p><p>  DIY pillow decor is fascinating and multifaceted.  Creating new pillowcases for the same pillows, you can not only easily change the general appearance and perception of the room, but also work out different types of needlework techniques on a comfortable canvas size.  In addition, a self-decorated pillow will be a great gift for any occasion. </p>
