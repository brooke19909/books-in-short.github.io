Solar eclipses, a super moon, a <span>parade of planets</span> gave a lot of pleasant moments to lovers to look at the sky.  Among such events, the bloody Moon stands apart - a phenomenon that excites the minds and generates new predictions about the end of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bloody moon phenomenon" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/565618.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific explanation </h2><p>  The very name of a natural miracle causes quite unpleasant and even frightening associations.  However, the bloody moon is not a phenomenon of demonic origin, but to a greater extent physical, completely justified from a scientific point of view.  In fact, this is a total <span>lunar eclipse,</span> coinciding with those moments of the life of the Sun when it falls below the horizon or rises.  The color change of the Earth‚Äôs satellite is due to the peculiarities of <span>light refraction</span> in the atmosphere of our planet. </p><p>  As you know, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth, the night luminary and the Sun line up in one line, in such a way that our cosmic house hides a satellite in its shadow.  The blood-red moon becomes visible due to the rays of light that reach it shortly before the final entry into the earth's shadow.  On the way they are met by the atmosphere of the Blue Planet, due to its characteristics it is best to pass the long-wave part of the spectrum.  The rays reach the surface of the satellite and change its color.  The same mechanism is the reason for such spectacular earthly sunrises and sunsets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Optical illusion </h2><p>  The rise of the bloody moon is characterized by another feature.  The refraction of light by atmospheric particles ‚Äúshifts‚Äù the appearance of <span>cosmic bodies,</span> in this case, the sun and moon, for the observer in time.  As a result, the daylight shows itself to the world a little earlier than it actually rises, and the earthly companion can be seen for some more time after it sets in. </p><h2>  Fantastic Four </h2><p>  The Bloody Moon is a phenomenon that will delight someone and scare someone more than once in the coming year.  In 2014, two similar lunar eclipses have already passed: April 15 and October 8.  Residents of the Pacific coast, Australia and Southwest Asia could contemplate the event.  A couple of bloody moons are expected in the near future: April 4 and September 28 in 2015.  A series of <span>astronomical phenomena</span> was called a tetrad.  For two years, the red moon rises every six months.  A single appearance of a "bloodied" satellite occurs more or less often, however, a tetrad marks the sky much less frequently. </p>

    <h2>  Periodicity </h2><p>  Scientists have conducted a study of the rise of the four bloody moons over the centuries.  It turned out that between 1582 and 1908 they were not at all.  At the same time, over 50 analyzed centuries, the total number of calculated notebooks exceeded 140. These include the red moons of 2003 and 2004.  The forecast for the future is impressive: notebooks will become a relatively frequent event.  After completion next year, again the astronomical phenomenon will transform the sky in 2032‚Äì2033.  and in 2043-2044.  The total number of notebooks expected in the coming decades is six. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Terrible omen </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the bloody moon is a phenomenon of scientifically sound origin, it is attributed a connection with world catastrophes.  Penetrating deep into the ages, the human mind often finds confirmation of its own theories there.  The Red Moon and the significance attributed to it is no exception. </p><p>  Of the more than a hundred notebooks that passed before the end of the sixteenth century and in the last century, special attention is paid to those that coincided with military conflicts and persecution of Christians and Jews.  This was the case in the middle of the 2nd, the end of the 15th centuries, and in 1949-1950, as well as 1967.  Religious figures of different countries consider the bloody moon an unkind sign warning of impending troubles and devastation.  At the peak of tragic predictions, predictions about the end of the world and humanity are heard. </p><p>  The coincidence of the cruel events of history with the astronomical phenomenon excites the blood.  It is difficult to be indifferent to such a thing, but whether or not to believe in an impending catastrophe remains a personal matter. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bloody moon rise" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/565617.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Spectacle </h2><p>  We can say with confidence that, regardless of theories and predictions, there were and will be many who want to look at a mysterious and rare phenomenon.  In this case, far from all the inhabitants of our planet will be able to directly observe the eclipse and reddening of the satellite.  Part of the land with the best conditions for viewing an astronomical phenomenon should be in the shade, that is, under the cover of night, and in a certain position relative to the sun and moon.  However, the event will be available to the rest of the population. </p><p>  The Bloody Moon is a phenomenon whose photos delight and scare.  Of course, the picture does not compare with reality, but it helps to join in a significant heavenly event, experience delight, awe or fear, by and large always experienced by people in front of a huge space above their heads, but greatly amplified at such moments. </p>
