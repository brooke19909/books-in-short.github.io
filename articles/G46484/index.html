Many scientists tried to resolve this issue, but as a result quite contradictory opinions arose often.  Apparently, it should be noted that the truth, as always, is somewhere in between.  A single person can affect specific local events, but change the course of everything </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why Hitler did not like Jews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/252444.jpg" width="320"></div>  On a global scale, it is capable of the process only when the necessary external conditions for such transformations mature.  And in this regard, the role of an individual personality is really not so high: if one specific hero did not appear on the stage, another would inevitably appear, since time itself requires its appearance.  On the other hand, the engine of the development of society is man himself.  And indeed, sometimes heroes appear, capable of transforming the whole world with their own intellect, incredible charisma, or some other qualities.  One vivid example of the power of charisma was Adolf Hitler.  Of course, prerequisites for the establishment of a fascist dictatorship existed in the <span>Weimar Republic</span> , however, it was Hitler‚Äôs hatred of the Jews and his ideas about a racially clean state that were accepted by hundreds of thousands and then millions of Germans for several years, which led to notorious consequences.

    <p>  <strong>Why did Hitler not like the Jews?</strong> </p><p>  Adolf Schicklgruber was born in a small town on the border of Germany and Austria.  Already in the early years, the frantic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe greatness of his own nation was laid in him.  And she was put into the young head by one of the history teachers, Leopold Petch.  The teacher himself was an ardent pan-Germanist and a supporter of Prussian greatness and German nationalism.  After graduating from school in the city of Steyr, young Adolf leaves for Vienna, dreaming of entering the local art academy.  Many people know this story about how a young man in 1907 fails in exams, and the rector of the academy recommended that he do not engage in fine art, but architecture.  In the same year, young Adolf returned to his hometown of Linz.  This was due to the death of the mother and the need to draw up inheritance documents.  However, the next year the young man again tries to successfully pass the exams at the art academy.  And fails again.  It was the subsequent stage of his life that formed that Adolf Hitler, whom the whole world subsequently recognized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Wandering in Vienna, struggling with odd jobs, he begins to intensely engage in his own self-education, observing the political life of the Austrian state, reading newspapers and so on.  And here, answering the question: "Why did Hitler not like the Jews?", </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why did Hitler destroy Jews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/252442.jpg" width="376"></div>  the specifics of this historical stage in the development of the whole German society should be taken into account.  After all, the beginning of the 20th century was a collapse, first for the Germans of Austria-Hungary, and then for Germany itself.  Hitler watched his people lose their dominant position in his native country, the Habsburg empire, under pressure from the Hungarians and Slavs.  And later it becomes a direct participant and witness of the humiliating position of <span>Germany after the First World War.</span>  It was not he who came up with anti-Semitism.  This ideology has existed in Europe since medieval times.  And in German society at the beginning of the 20th century, the paranoid ideas of anti-German conspiracies were developing more and more, supposedly Jews were the central role, the idea that Germany should aspire for more was the very pan-Germanism that first pushed pro-imperial Germans into the struggle for the redistribution of colonial territories , and then into the abyss of the First World War.  All this has developed in a very peculiar way and rethought in the mind of young Hitler, leading to the infamous Holocaust.
