    <h2>  Vysehrad </h2><p>  For many travelers, magnificent Prague remains a cherished dream.  Reviews of tourists say that such a trip can be compared with a trip to a fairy tale from distant childhood. </p><p>  We continue our journey through the capital and go to the oldest district of Prague - Vysehrad, which is located on the bank of the Vltava River, on a rocky hill.  According to existing legend, Vysehrad was founded by Krok, the son of the founder of the Czech country. </p><p>  The first Czech princes and princesses Libushe lived here.  The famous fortress arose at the end of the X century, and at the beginning of the XII there was a residence of the Princes Przemyslovich.  At this time, a large stone palace and the church of Saints Peter and Paul were built here. </p><h2>  Sights of Vysehrad </h2><p>  The high towers of the church of St. Peter and Paul are visible from afar.  Initially, this place was a Romanesque basilica dating back to the XII century.  The appearance of the temple, which we can see today, appeared in 1885‚Äì1903. </p><p>  In the square, located on the south side of the temple, you can see the ruins of a watchtower.  It was used as a marina for ships, but more often it is called the "Libushe bath". </p><p>  Vysehrad Memorial Cemetery is a national monument of the Czech Republic, as well as the most prestigious burial place in the capital.  Here they found their last refuge B. Nemtsov, B. Smetana, A. Dvo≈ô√°k, K. Chapek and others. There was also created a wall-mausoleum ‚ÄúSlavin‚Äù, where famous figures of history and culture of the Czech Republic of the XIX century are buried. </p><p>  In Vysehrad, you can visit the museum located in the former bastions.  He tells in detail about the history of this fortress. </p><p>  The oldest building in Prague is the rotunda of St. Martin, which was used as a warehouse for storing gunpowder.  Now it has become the property of the church, so it is not so easy to examine its interior decoration today. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prague czech republic reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/600972.jpg" width="600"></div>

From them you can go down to the Tabor Gate (XVII century) which are the exit from Vysehrad. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Such a huge number of hotels, as in the Czech capital, is not found in any European city.  There are about 400 of them - for any requests and financial opportunities.  Most often, guests are offered small hotels.  Prague (Czech Republic) differs from many European cities with cordiality and hospitality. </p><p>  As a rule, the price includes breakfast - coffee, tea, rolls, cheese, jam. </p><p>  The most affordable Prague hotels are located in the Prague 6 and Prague 8 districts.
