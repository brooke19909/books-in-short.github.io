  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much does a manicure and pedicure master earn?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Being interested in a job change, women often wonder how much a manicurist earns.  Curiosity is due to the fact that it will not take a lot of time to master this profession.  It is enough to complete the courses and get a certificate.  Then you just have to get into a salon or start accepting customers at home.  Work as a manicurist seems an interesting and profitable occupation.  Let's find out how this is true. </p><h2>  What affects salary? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.douglas.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much a manicurist at home earns" class="if uuid-2677254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677254.jpg"></div><p>  There are many factors on which depends how much a manicurist earns. </p><ul><li>  Qualification.  Some experts believe that once it is enough to take courses and that's it.  Others, on the contrary, are constantly mastering new technologies, undergoing additional training and relentlessly experimenting.  The more skills a master has, the higher his income.  It is logical to assume that at the beginning of a career incomes will not be high.  For example, how much does a beginner manicurist earn?  Only 8-15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Place of work.  Someone prefers to work in the salon, not engaging in customer acquisition, but giving a certain percentage of each order.  Some masters of manicure, on the contrary, are very active.  They independently equip the workplace, purchase equipment and supplies. </li><li>  Number of clients.  Everything is simple here.  The greater the flow of customers, the higher the income.  Masters working in the salon do not search on their own.  However, with quality work, some customers may become regular.  This will ensure full employment and appropriate income.  How much does a manicurist earn at home?  With a steady flow of customers, revenue can be even higher than in the salon.  However, visitors will have to deal with the search for themselves. </li><li>  Region.  As in many other professions, income is highly dependent on the place of work.  For example, in Moscow and other large cities, the prices for beauty services are much higher than in the regions.  Accordingly, the capital's craftsmen can count on more solid incomes, which can be 60-100 thousand rubles.  For this reason, some masters from the regions may think about moving. </li></ul><h2>  Salary in the cabin </h2><p>  To better understand how much a manicurist earns, you need to understand how a salary is formed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Manicure services are so popular that even in small cities there are salons that provide them.  That is why even beginners usually do not know the problems with employment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fnp.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much can be earned by a manicure master" class="if uuid-2677259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677259.jpg"></div><p>  For the first time getting a job as a manicurist, one should not expect large incomes.  In addition, beginners are usually taken on probation.  Most likely, their salary will not exceed 15-20 thousand rubles.  However, for those who dream of working in the field of beauty, even such incomes will seem attractive. </p><p>  If the manicurist manages to establish himself well and pass the probationary period, he will expect an increase in income.  Up to about 30-35,000 rubles.  However, this figure can be considered almost the ceiling in the career of a salon master.  Of course, in elite institutions, employees can earn more.  But if we talk about the average salon, you will have to be content with a salary in the range of 35,000 rubles. </p><h2>  How to calculate income in the salon? </h2><p>  A big plus for manicurists working in the company is the lack of the need to look for customers.  However, with regard to income, everything is very ambiguous. </p><p>  It is advisable to find out how the salary of a manicurist is formed even before passing the probationary period.  After all, this directly affects the final profit.  Typically, income in a certain proportion is divided between the master and the salon.  Employers, depending on their own generosity, can pay an employee from 25 to 50 percent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, it is equally important to ask whether the employee will provide materials or whether they need to work on their own.  It is very important.  Sometimes it makes sense to agree to a lower percentage, but to use interior materials than to buy your own. </p><p>  All the nuances you need to find out are job placement. </p><h2>  Features of work in the cabin </h2><p>  Another feature is the presence or absence of plans.  They greatly affect how much a manicurist earns in a salon.  Supervisors can set a prerequisite for a monthly income or average bill.  Or all at once.  According to the results of the implementation of the plans, it is determined what percentage of the orders will be paid to the manicure masters. </p><p>  Also, a salon employee will have to put up with a fixed schedule.  In some salons, shifts last 12 hours, which is not easy for everyone.  For example, some masters complain of back fatigue.  Therefore, part of the income from manicure has to be spent on massage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.treatwell.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a manicurist earn per month" class="if uuid-2677255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677255.jpg"></div><p>  Another important feature of work in the salon is the time limit for each client.  Usually, the master is given 1 hour to perform hygienic manicure and coating.  It is necessary to have sufficient professionalism in order to be able to do quality work without sacrificing quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How much does a manicurist earn at home? </h2><p>  This question is relevant for specialists who want to "go free swimming."  The income of a home master directly depends on the number of clients and the cost of the services offered.  If the salon has a common price list, then a lone specialist will have to form it yourself.  You can focus on similar offers of other manicure masters in your area. </p><h2>  The hardest thing </h2><p>  The greatest difficulty is customer acquisition.  The more stable their flow, the better this will affect income. </p><p>  How much does a manicurist earn?  Assuming that the service will cost an average of 500 rubles, a specialist will be able to earn 30-50,000 rubles by accepting 3-5 clients daily.  You can always increase income.  If the same master will do manicure for 600 rubles, with the same flow of customers per month, his income will grow by 6-10 thousand rubles.  You can also offer pedicure services, which will further increase profits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hoefhair-nails.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a beginner manicure earn" class="if uuid-2677257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677257.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing the initial data, it is easy to calculate how much a manicure and pedicure master earns at home.  Thanks to such a simple calculation, many ladies find this profession very attractive. </p><h2>  Costs </h2><p>  It will be incorrect to talk about how much a manicurist earns per month without mentioning his expenses.  A home specialist is not required to pay interest to anyone, but at the same time some of the costs will be spent on mandatory needs.  Which ones? </p><ul><li>  Workplace.  To provide services, the master will need a comfortable table and high-quality lighting. </li><li>  Equipment.  Depending on the type of manicure performed, you will have to purchase a set of tools.  This can be a set of files, nippers, etc. If a specialist performs hardware manicure, you will need to purchase a milling cutter and nozzles for it. </li><li>  Disinfection.  A home master, unlike salons, is not subject to checks, so sterilization of instruments remains on his conscience.  An honest specialist will not neglect hygiene and take care of the thorough processing of tools.  This, of course, will entail additional costs. </li><li>  Expendable materials.  After hygienic manicure, many ladies prefer to make a color coating with regular or gel varnish.  To do this, the master will need a diverse palette of shades, as well as wipes, liquids and other consumables.  They need to be bought constantly. </li></ul><p>  To understand how much an average manicurist earns at home, you need to calculate all the costs, and then subtract the amount received from income.  Therefore, profit may not be as attractive as it seemed. </p><h2>  How to look for customers? </h2><p>  Many salon masters think about dismissal from a beauty salon, not wanting to share part of their income with the administration.  However, many are stopped by the most serious difficulty faced by home masters - the search for customers.  Their number directly affects how much a manicure and pedicure master earns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mittermeier.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a manicure master earn in Moscow" class="if uuid-2677261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677261.jpg"></div><p>  You have to try different options: </p><ul><li>  social networks; </li><li>  advertising on specialized sites; </li><li>  recommendations from acquaintances, etc. </li></ul><p>  If a home master used to work in a salon, he could build up a client base.  If you lure salon customers, you can get a good start.  The only question is how honest this behavior will be in relation to the former employer. </p><p>  Perhaps the best advertisement for a manicurist is the quality of the work performed.  That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt do it all in a hurry. </p><h2>  Work away </h2><p>  Some home masters go even further, working not only on their own territory, but also visiting the client.  Salon specialists are also considering this option in search of additional income.  So the topic is relevant. </p><p>  How much can you earn as a manicurist if you personally go to the client?  Such a service is paid more generously.  Just one visit will allow the specialist to earn an average of 1200-3000 rubles.  The total amount depends on the complex of services ordered.  Perhaps the client wants to perform not only manicures, but also pedicures. </p><p>  I must say that leaving the house is especially convenient for customers who do not have to spend time on the road.  However, this creates a certain discomfort for the master.  After all, he will have to bring along equipment and materials that may turn out to be heavy.  In addition, not every client can provide a convenient workplace.  That is why not every manicurist agrees to work on the road. </p><h2>  How much does a manicure master earn in Moscow </h2><p>  Capital salaries, as a rule, are higher than regional incomes.  That is why the masters who have reached the financial ceiling in their careers are thinking about moving to Moscow.  This justifies the interest in the salaries of capital masters. </p><p>  If we talk about average indicators, then in Moscow salons earn about 35-60 thousand rubles.  Having become a home master, you can increase your monthly profit by 30-40%, if you have a stable flow of customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniquenailsvienna.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do manicurists earn in the salon" class="if uuid-2677260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677260.jpg"></div><p>  Some masters first get into the salon.  This allows you to improve your skills and at the same time acquire ‚Äúyour‚Äù customers. </p><p>  You need to understand that the high requirements of Moscow hide the same requirements.  The clients are spoiled by the novelties and professionalism of the masters.  A potential specialist should always be in the trend, increasing the amount of knowledge and quality of skills. </p><h2>  Who earns more? </h2><p>  Salon masters usually have a certain ‚Äúceiling‚Äù in their salaries.  Having reached a certain level, you have to choose.  What to do: put up with your current income level, look for a new job or become a home master? </p><p>  Often, talented specialists are inclined in favor of the latter option.  Unlike other alternatives, it allows you to independently create a schedule and has no restrictions on income.  It all depends on the master himself, as well as the quantity and generosity of his clients.  With a good combination of circumstances, a manicurist, working at home, can earn 100 thousand rubles.  This is significantly more than the average salary.  For masters of manicure, it is 15-40 thousand rubles in Russia. </p><h2>  How to earn more? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kosmetikstudioneukoelln.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does an average manicurist earn" class="if uuid-2677256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2677256.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to increase income, an independent specialist can always use several options. </p><ul><li>  Expand the number of services.  For example, to offer not only classic, but also hardware manicure, deal with building or arched modeling. </li><li>  Improve professionalism.  Constantly studying new technologies, the master will always be in trend.  Accordingly, this will ensure stable demand among customers. </li><li>  Increase the number of customers.  You can create a page in social networks and post your work, run contextual advertising or arrange a campaign ‚ÄúBring a friend‚Äù.  The master should constantly engage in self-promotion, attracting new customers and increasing their number.  After all, this is the basis of his income. </li></ul><p>  Having learned how much a manicurist earns, each girl will be able to decide whether or not to dwell on this profession. </p>
