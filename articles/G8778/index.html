  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems with Sberbank cards: instructions for users</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Users of plastic cards of the largest bank in the country periodically encounter problems in their use.  The most common ones are: a chip malfunction (the card is "not readable" in terminals and when paying in stores), inability to pay online, delayed transfers from a plastic product.  Any problems with Sberbank cards cause inconvenience to the owners, so each of the cases requires a quick fix. </p><h2>  Card stopped reading: what to do? </h2><p>  One of the reasons why there is a delay when paying with a card in stores and cafes is a plastic malfunction.  The chip card is the most susceptible to deformation, which at the same time is a protection against product hacking. </p><p>  The chip is located on the front side and tends to wear off with constant use of plastic for 3 years.  It is for this period that most cards in Sberbank are designed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edgarsnyder.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="problems with Sberbank cards" class="if uuid-2863610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2863610.jpg"></div><p>  Problems with Sberbank bank cards related to a malfunction or gradual erasure of the chip are resolved by reissuing.  To do this, the client must contact any branch of his region and select the "Card" coupon, the "Reissue" tab on the electronic queue screen. </p><p>  Since 2018, the opportunity to issue a reissue of a card has appeared in the Client’s Personal Account - the Sberbank Online service.  To perform the operation, you must: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  enter the program; </li><li>  find a bank card with a technical malfunction; </li><li>  in the "Operations" tab opposite the product, select "Card Reissue"; </li><li>  select the reason for the reissue - “withdrawn by the ATM / Damage or technical malfunction” and the office to receive; </li><li>  press "Re-release", confirm the operation. </li></ul><p>  A reissue solves problems with paying with a Sberbank card at retail outlets.  In case of early reissue, the validity period of the card does not change, unlike the product number. </p><p>  In case of difficulties with the chip, the type of card product does not matter.  Problems with the VISA card of Sberbank are similar to the difficulties with plastic cards "Master Card" and are solved by reissuing. </p><h2>  Why does the card not work when paying online? </h2><p>  Problems with Sberbank cards when paying online are most often related to the type of payment instrument.  Some of the bank cards are not intended for payment on certain sites.  This applies to instant issuance cards - MOMENTUM, including credit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="problems with the Sberbank visa card" class="if uuid-2863630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2863630.jpg"></div><p>  If the user regularly makes purchases online, he should issue a name card.  Its cost is from 450 rubles per year, but the capabilities significantly exceed the resources of instant issuance cards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Application processing is possible both at the bank’s office and at Sberbank Online.  Product manufacturing time does not exceed 14 days.  The client can pick up the card in any convenient office at the place of registration.  For registration and receipt only a passport is required. </p><h2>  Delays in making transfers </h2><p>  Problems with the transfer from the Sberbank card can arise both when making an operation at the bank’s office, and in remote service channels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.entrepreneur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="problems with bank cards of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2863623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2863623.jpg"></div><p>  What to do if the money “hangs” in the process of transferring to Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  If the problem is related to the payment of utilities, funds can be transferred to the supplier’s account within 48 hours from the date of debiting.  It is recommended that you keep the shipment receipt for the specified time.  Otherwise, they will be transferred to the credit card account, after which the client must return to the bank in order to repeat the sending of funds. </li><li>  When sending money to an individual, the delay may be due to the recipient's card.  If it is faulty or is on reissue, the money will be returned to the sender.  Otherwise, it is recommended to write a claim for a refund.  Application review period is up to 10 days. </li></ol><p>  If the sender cannot wait for the funds to arrive at the indicated account, he must contact the administrator at the bank office.  The manager will consider the customer’s complaint and tell what to do so that the funds are returned to the user's card account or reached the recipient as soon as possible. </p><h2>  Problems with Sberbank cards in terminals and ATMs </h2><p>  Sometimes users encounter difficulties using cards in the bank's terminals.  The most common nuisance is an ATM freeze, which often leads to the "swallowing" of the card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="culturaliteraria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="problems with transferring from Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2863640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2863640.jpg"></div><p>  Such problems with Sberbank cards are solved in two ways: </p><ol><li>  Registration reissue.  If the operation was performed at terminals outside the company’s office, for example, at the point of sale, the card must be blocked and then reissued.  The operation is free.  To block a credit card, you should call 900, name F.I.O., passport details, address, code word.  The support service also accepts applications for re-issuance of a card. </li><li>  Card withdrawal in the presence of the client.  If the credit card is stuck in an ATM inside the office, employees can get it during the branch’s work (if there is such a technical possibility).  To do this, you must contact the cashier or office administrator and present a passport to confirm the identity of the card holder. </li></ol>
