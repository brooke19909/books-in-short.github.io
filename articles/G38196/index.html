Svyatoshinsky district already at that time was a completely ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù suburb of Kiev, as it had its own hospital, post office, and even a cinema, and every 25 minutes a tram from the Triumphal Gate went to the holiday village. </p><p>  Today Svyatoshinsky district is a well-maintained part of the city, which stretches over 12 km, more than 65 hectares in it are parks.  Those who are interested in cheap hotels in Kiev and the prices of cheap hotels will be pleasantly surprised, because here you can have a good rest, having rented a room at a price of just 250 hryvnias per day. </p><p>  Hotel "Tisa", according to customer reviews, is the cheapest in the city, but at the same time provides everything you need for a quality vacation: </p><ul><li>  It offers 60 rooms of economy category, standard and deluxe. </li><li>  The rooms have the necessary furniture, mini fridge and TV. </li><li>  The cheapest rooms are with conveniences on the floor, in the standard and suite there is a toilet and a bathroom. </li><li>  Wi-Fi zone and free parking. </li></ul>
