Here in 1990, the Mistral Mare Hotel 4 * was built.  It is not new, but in 2008 the building went through the restoration process.  The hotel looks beautiful - two buildings, towering on a hill above the sea, can be seen from afar.  And what is his interior!  Once inside, everyone will experience aesthetic delight.  It is impossible to describe in words, so you should take a look at the photo below, which conveys a riot of colors, national color and sophistication of design.  However, the hotel has many other features, in addition to its interior. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Mistral Mare Hotel 4 * is located in Istron, or rather, in the very small village of Kalo Chorio.  It refers to Lacition.  This is a nom in Greece, located in the east of Crete.  It is worth knowing this, as for lovers of attractions.  At 10 kilometers from the village is Agios Nikolaos, the capital of Noma.  And the airport is 75 km away.  Far away, but there is a plus - nobody will get in the way of taking off and landing planes. </p><p>  But, of course, the main advantage of the hotel is that it is in close proximity to the sea.  Literally 300 meters away is the famous Golden Beach.  And from the windows of the apartments of the hotel offers a wonderful view of the Mirabelon Bay.  In general, a picturesque place.  Especially popular among lovers of walks, beautiful views and young people.  Some do not like it here - but only because they have to go down to the beach, and many tourists want the sea to be at arm's length. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is in the hotel? </h2><p>  Mistral Mare <span>Hotel 4 *</span> has all sorts of amenities and offers various services.

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  People staying at Mistral Mare Hotel are mostly positive.  There are three main points that guests note - this is a gorgeous view from the window, an excellent level of service and modest prices. </p><p>  Cleaning is daily, linen and towels are regularly changed.  The staff is friendly and welcoming, everyone is fluent in Russian.  And, by the way, the majority of vacationers here are from Russia. </p><p>  The beach is below, you have to go down to it, but it‚Äôs not difficult - there are convenient steps.  The water is clear, as is the sand.  But it is best to go here in the fall, around October.  Tourists at this time are much less than in summer.  The beaches are half empty, and you can meet dawn here or spend a romantic night on the seashore all alone. </p><p>  If you draw conclusions, we can confidently say that this hotel is ideal for lovers of budget, but high-quality relaxation in a quiet, secluded and calm place on the beach.  Many people have already confirmed this.  So it‚Äôs worth coming here to rest and make sure of this fact yourself. </p>
