    <p>  In 1763, Britain dominated the entire North Atlantic continent.  This happened after the end of the war, which lasted seven years (1756‚Äì1763), and the victory remained with Britain.  In her submission there were 13 colonies, which were located on the shores of the Atlantic and in the northern lands of Canada.  Their residents were unhappy with the situation, so the country's leadership faced a new task - how to deal with indignant people? </p><p>  About 3 million people lived in the colony at that time.  The northern lands were developed by fishermen, merchants, and hunters.  People there are rich, there were planters and farmers.  This is precisely what played a decisive role in the upcoming revolution, thanks to which the foundations of the American nation were laid.  The revolution in America at that moment matured, according to historians.  Citizens are used to having their opinions taken into account, but the British government was far away and did not know the problems of overseas migrants.  Members of the government believed that foreigners should bring them income and imposed strict restrictions on the trade of colonies. </p><p>  The approach of the crisis accelerated the victory in the <span>Seven Years' War,</span> as a result of which the British authorities intensified colonial oppression due to military debts.  Britain introduced unpopular taxes, which could infuriate people.  Riots began to erupt everywhere and the American Revolution was brewing. </p><p>  All decisions of the British were made by King George III, whose actions were cruel to the citizens of the colonies.  In September 1774, the Philadelphia Congress was held, at which a plan of decisive action by the Americans was approved.  In May 1775, the Second Continental Congress was held, at which an independent government was proclaimed.  Boston's militias created a regular army, and was led by landowner <span>George Washington</span> from Virginia.  Thus began the American Revolution. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Americans captured the forts, which were located on the border of Canada.  The British strengthened in Boston.  The Americans, under the command of General Howe, went on the offensive.  The victory at Bunker Hill inspired the colonists with confidence in the victory over the British.  In 1776, in March, the British left Boston.  The revolution in the USA at that time was in full swing. </p><p>  In July 1776, the Continental Congress was held, at which they adopted the <span>Declaration of Independence</span> (author - Thomas Jefferson).  The American Revolution won its first victory.  However, in 1776, General Howe captured Philadelphia, and the Washington Army lost many soldiers.  The revolution in America continued.  The British had poor planning, they were surrounded by Americans and surrendered weapons near Saratoga. </p><p>  French troops came to the aid of the rebels, they participated on the side of the Americans.  Later, Dutch and Spanish troops took part in the war.  The Americans only needed independence, but Britain continued to wage war.  The revolution in the United States was becoming a significant event.  In 1778, the British set a new goal - the capture of the southern lands, on which there were large plantations of rice, tobacco and indigo.  They recaptured Georgia and tried to capture <span>North Carolina.</span>  This was their fatal mistake.  The Americans retreated to the lands of Virginia, but pretty exhausted the enemy.  After their troops carried out concerted actions with their allies, the British were blocked by French naval vessels and launched powerful artillery fire.  On this, practically the war was over. </p><p>  In October 1781, the British surrendered, and the Americans won the struggle for independence.  The British forces remained in New York, but the fighting against the French was conducted not only there.  In 1783, a great event took place in September - they signed the <span>Paris Peace,</span> which recognized the <span>United States as</span> independent.  The American Revolution has triumphed! </p>
