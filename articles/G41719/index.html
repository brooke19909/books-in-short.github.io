Hobbies, as a rule, can be divided into several types: active, passive, creative, intellectual and technical.  Today we will consider in detail what male and female hobbies are.  A detailed description of hobbies, tips and tricks for implementing creative directions will help make the right choice. </p><h2>  Popular hobbies for women </h2><p>  Often, female hobbies are creative directions, but sometimes you can meet a girl who is fond of motorcycles or auto racing.  Here is a short list of hobbies that will be interesting to lovers of needlework and creativity: </p><ul><li>  knitting; </li><li>  embroidery; </li><li>  floristry; </li><li>  making hair accessories; </li><li>  Painting; </li><li>  beadwork; </li><li>  decoupage; </li><li>  creation of handmade wedding accessories. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="essaybasics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oil painting" class="if uuid-2276578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71487/2276578.jpg"></div><p>  Each of these types of needlework is a fairly popular direction of creativity, so the network contains a lot of online photos and video workshops.  Also, almost in every city there is an opportunity to attend a meeting of like-minded people, where teachers will clearly and thoroughly familiarize the participants in the course with the chosen direction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting </h2><p>  This is most likely not even a hobby, but a lifestyle.  For the needlewoman involved in this type of handmade work, there are wide opportunities for the development of creative directions.  With the help of knitting, you can make clothes for children, adults and pets, children's toys, home decor items, all kinds of accessories.  A beginner needlewoman should decide on the initial direction of her creative activity, and then - conquer new heights, improving her skills. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grassington.uk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-2276500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71487/2276500.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting was born long before the formation of modernity, in ancient Egypt.  But progress does not stand still, starting from the fifteenth century, the occupation has become widespread, today this type of needlework includes a large number of techniques and a variety of materials for creativity.  A craftswoman who has chosen knitting as her hobby can replenish her wardrobe with exclusive items of clothing and accessories. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  For a ‚Äúfeather test‚Äù, ordinary knitting needles and a ball of simple thread are enough.  Then you need to look through a few simple master classes and try to repeat the steps for the speaker.  At the initial stage, it is necessary to master several types of loops and crochets, then try to transfer your knowledge to practice and tie a simple thing: a children's scarf or hat. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Floristry </h2><p>  There are a large number of types of floristry available for creativity, the following are hobbies and hobbies built on the study of floral directions of varying complexity: </p><ul><li>  Cold floristry (making flowers from polymer clay and cold porcelain). </li><li>  Fom-floristry (creation of realistic flowers from foamiran). </li><li>  Making bouquets and compositions of fresh flowers, wedding floristics. </li><li>  Create flowers from satin ribbons and fabric. </li></ul><p>  Today we dwell on the "live" floristry.
