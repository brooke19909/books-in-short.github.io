    <h2>  Opinion of guests about entertainment and beach holidays </h2><p>  Many guests respond positively to the large and clean hotel pool.  True, some tourists complained that swimming is possible only until 19:00.  However, this practice is the norm for most hotels in Turkey.  Near the pool there are always free sunbeds and umbrellas.  And next to the sun terrace there is a bar with a large selection of drinks. </p><p>  Most tourists were satisfied with the animation at the Grand Ideal Premium Hotel 5 *.  So, during the day there are various contests and games by the pool, and in the evenings there are shows of invited artists.  A Turkish Night is also held every week.  After the end of the evening animation, an incendiary disco begins.  If you want to have fun outside the hotel, you can always go to the street of bars in the center of Marmaris. </p><p>  Some tourists were a little surprised by the fact that the hotel‚Äôs own beach is a sufficient distance from it.  Although the coast can be reached in just one minute.  Therefore, guests either went to the hotel‚Äôs beach (located 300 meters, the road goes along a beautiful promenade), or went swimming in the sea on the nearest beach, and returned to the Grand Ideal Premium pool to sunbathe.  The beaches here are sandy, the entrance to the water is gentle.  However, sometimes algae are washed ashore, which employees do not have time to clean. </p><p>  As for excursions, their experienced travelers recommend taking it not at the hotel itself, but at agencies on the boardwalk or in the city.  Their quality does not differ, but the price will be much lower.  In addition, in most cases, in the form of a bonus, you will receive the opportunity to visit the Turkish bath (hamam) for free. </p>
