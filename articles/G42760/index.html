    <p>  Political power appears and develops due to the realization of the need to regulate relations in society.  It forcibly removes conflicts and contradictions that arise in society in connection with differences of interests.  The struggle because of them explains the need to apply this form of influence in order to overcome the resistance of opposing forces. </p><p>  The functions of political power are those features and properties inherent in it, thanks to which it acts in society and changes it.  They are most fully realized in the process of domination.  As a rule, there are four fundamental functions of political power: </p><p>  1. Management.  With its help, the subject of power implements its strategy in practice.  Management is expected to make specific and time-appropriate decisions.  It reflects the interests of the forces in power. </p><p>  2. The control function.  For its implementation, such bodies as the prosecutor's office, control chamber, and structures conducting audits are created. </p><p>  3. Organizational function.  It forms <span>political relations</span> between individual citizens, parties and classes on the one hand and the state on the other. </p><p>  4. Educational function.  It provides leadership authority, and encourages citizens to be law-abiding. </p><p>  Of course, the functions of political power are not limited to these four.  Since they are very numerous in society, they can be supplemented by several more. </p><p>  1. Preservation of the integrity of society. </p><p>  2. The formation of a <span>political system</span> in society <span>.</span> </p><p>  3. Control over the various structures of society in their own interests, the impact on them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  4. Management of the affairs of the country and society using different methods. </p><p>  5. Management of the activities of the <span>state apparatus,</span> authorities using their own means. </p><p>  6. Realization of interests and requests of social groups performing the functions of power. </p><p>  7. Stabilization of relations in society. </p><p>  8. Support and strengthening of the <span>power system</span> that already exists.  This is done not only to protect their interests, but also for the development of society as a whole. </p><p>  9. Maintaining the proportions between consumption and production in such a way that they help each other to progress, and not to stand still. </p><p>  However, at the present stage, there are some features of political power.  For all countries, democratic and economically developed, it has already become apparent that neglect of the interests of citizens leads only to the inability to satisfy the interests of their groups.  Society in this case is destabilized, social order is disturbed, and there is a risk of losing leadership positions.  For this reason, the interpretation of power by Western political scientists is somewhat different.  They understand it as the ability to express the interests of the whole society through the interests of a particular class.  Applying this point of view will help to find additional resources for it. </p><p>  In addition to the above, political authority performs functions that are significant in society, and also such: </p><p>  - reaching consensus in society; </p><p>  - identification of conflicts, their limitation and resolution; </p><p>  - management of public affairs; </p><p>  - maintaining order in society; </p><p>  - coercion in order to achieve goals that are significant for citizens, and to maintain order in society. </p><p>  In a systematic <span>form, the functions of</span> political power are as follows: </p><p>  - determination of their strategy and tactics; </p><p>  - suppression of behavior deviating from accepted norms; </p><p>  - analysis of the situation in society and in the world of politics; </p><p>  - disposal of various resources. </p><p>  Based on the functions performed by political power, we can say that it is necessary for the organization of society, maintaining its integrity, as well as for managing relations between citizens and the state. </p>
