    <h2>  Brief information about the bank </h2><p>  Tinkoff is one of the most unusual banks in Russia, specializing in customer service via the Internet.  It was originally called Khimmashbank and was established in 1994.  After 11 years, it was bought out by the famous businessman Oleg Tinkov, who managed to radically not only change the name of the financial institution, but also revise the principle of its work. </p><h2>  What services does Tinkoff offer? </h2><p>  Since its appearance on the financial market of the Russian Federation, Tinkoff (mortgage - a service that has appeared here recently) has completely abandoned universally accepted work standards.  His task was to maximize the light version of the service with minimal effort.  For example, all services provided by this loan guarantee were performed remotely.  And the only office of the company was the real branch of the bank, located at: Moscow, 1st Volokolamskiy proezd, 10, building 1. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As it progressed in the domestic credit services market, the bank created and offered various products.  One of the most famous among them was credit cards issued online.  They are still a kind of business card for the company.  Not stopping there, the representatives of the guarantor periodically introduce new services and services.  So, from a recent moment, tempting deposit programs have appeared in their financial menu, providing for quick processing of debit cards. </p><p>  Later, the bank began to offer the services of a professional credit broker.  This time, housing loans appeared in the <span>banking product</span> portfolio, becoming Tinkoff‚Äôs new flagship.  The mortgage, the conditions of which were selected individually, very quickly won the hearts of new and old guarantor customers. </p>

    <h2>  Brief summary of mortgages at Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  Unlike other financial organizations, the bank itself does not issue housing loans.  In this case, he acts as a credit intermediary and offers mortgage products to his partners.  His responsibilities include accepting online applications from customers who wish to obtain a housing loan, as well as their full advice on lending.  Then he collects the necessary package of documents from potential borrowers and submits response requests to other partner banks.  After that, the loaned person can familiarize themselves with the possible options and choose the appropriate mortgage program.  So, in fact, Tinkoff (bank) works.  A mortgage is not registered here, but professional help is provided in its selection and design. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mortgage loans at Tinkoff Bank - is it profitable? </h2><p>  Mortgage loans is a very sensitive and serious matter.  Therefore, it is so important to choose not only a bank, but also a loan expert who will help you in word and deed.  In response to your appeal, Tinkoff Bank (a mortgage in this organization will help solve existing housing problems) will offer you a number of privileges.  For example, if you have the appropriate documents, you can get a loan in the amount of up to 100 million rubles. </p><p>  In addition, you will find not just a one-time free consultation, but long-term communication with a personal manager.  It is he who will be able to dispel doubts and mistaken opinions about bank loans, calculate the amount of overpayment and draw up an approximate loan schedule. </p><p>  In addition, the mortgage at Tinkoff Bank (reviews of the service provided can be found below) involves a down payment of up to 15%.  In addition, if you take a housing loan through the Tinkoff institution, you can save a whole percentage of the bank rate.  And this is much more profitable than contacting the lender directly.  For comparison: with loans in domestic currency, the rate starts at 10.5%. </p><p>  Finally, contacting this financial institution will help increase the chances of approving a loan.  This is due to the fact that the client's application is sent to several banks at once.  Which will significantly reduce the time spent searching and narrow the circle of potential lenders. </p>

    <h2>  What do residents of various regions say about the mortgage at Tinkoff Bank? </h2><p>  As practice has shown, Tinkoff Bank (mortgage, reviews and the conditions for its provision raise a lot of questions from potential borrowers) are contacted by people from different regions of Russia.  For example, among user reviews you can find residents of Moscow and the region, Rostov, Sochi, Novocherkassk, Kirov, Vladivostok, Petrozavodsk, St. Petersburg and other cities of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Among these reviews, there are both positive and negative.  For example, some of the borrowers who repaid the loan write that they managed to arrange a mortgage at 10.45% per annum with the help of Tinkoff Bank.  Despite the fact that everywhere they were refused and demanded additional guarantees in the form of a second co-borrower. </p>

    <p>  Others talk about the speed of making a decision on a loan.  According to them, Tinkoff Bank helped them a lot.  Mortgage (reviews about it recreate the real picture of the registration procedure) with the assistance of the company's managers was approved in just 25-30 minutes.  Still others are grateful for the professional advice and assistance in finding a credit organization for specific Tinkoff employees.  They mention their names and surnames, as well as give flattering compliments to them. </p><p>  And of course, there are those who were dissatisfied with the quality of service.  According to them, the system for submitting scanned documents is not perfect.  It crashes and does not allow to complete the sending.  They claim that due to problems with their personal account, their scans sagged "suspended" for three weeks.  As a result, representatives of Tinkoff Bank removed them and asked to be sent again.  Clients lost time and had to personally go to banks in search of a suitable lender.  However, such comments are more likely an exception than a natural disruption of the system. </p>
