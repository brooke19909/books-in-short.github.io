Paper napkins are still being started by children in kindergarten, creating simple pictures or voluminous crafts. </p><p>  Experienced craftsmen can do more complex and spectacular crafts.  In the article we will look at how to make a flower from a napkin, both simple and voluminous.  Looking at the detailed schemes in the photographs, the presented color options will be easy to perform even for beginner needlewomen. </p><p>  A step-by-step master class of flowers from napkins will explain the phased work: what needs to be done in the first place, how to fix the result so that the craft lasts longer.  Let's start with simple colors, gradually complicating the technique. </p><h2>  Children's picture </h2><p>  If you do not know how to make a flower from a napkin with a child, we offer the option of a flat picture with a picture of chamomile.  To complete the task you will need several napkins of different colors.  For the background, a light green napkin crumpled by fingers, and for the frame, balls of crumpled pink and blue paper.  The main pattern - chamomile - is created from the natural shades of the flower: white, yellow and dark green. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="picture of camomile from napkins" class="if uuid-2316354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316354.jpg"></div><p>  If it is difficult for a child to independently complete the application, you can draw the contours of a flower for him.  Then you need to do the job of rolling the balls from pieces torn from wipes of the desired color.  For convenience in future work, it is better to immediately prepare and arrange them in small bowls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Flowers are created from napkins in stages.  First, balls of the yellow center are glued to the PVA.  Then petals are made of white elements.  At the end is a stalk and a leaf of chamomile. </p><h2>  Yellow dandelion </h2><p>  Such a lush dandelion can be made of several yellow napkins.  As can be seen in the manufacturing diagram below, napkins folded into a bundle in the middle are fastened with paper clips using a stationery stapler.  Then a circle is cut out with scissors, the edges of which are cut with a short ‚Äúnoodle‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin dandelion" class="if uuid-2316328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316328.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you need to carefully peel off all the thin napkins and, lifting them in your hand, squeeze at the base.  Simple flowers made of napkins formed in this way can be glued onto cardboard, adding stems and leaflets, and creating a picture.  You can strengthen the flowers on a stick and make crafts voluminous, then they can be put in a vase. </p><h2>  Napkin Eustoma </h2><p>  Using wire and napkins, you can create a bouquet of delicate Japanese roses eustomas.  They come in different shades, so there will be no problems with choosing the color of the napkins.  How to make a flower from a napkin, read on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY eustoma" class="if uuid-2316318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316318.jpg"></div><p>  Triangles are cut from napkins of the desired color, which are wound onto the wire over the top using PVA.  They are arranged sequentially, with a shift of each petal by 1-1.5 cm. Then the stem turns into a green napkin.  You can make sepals under the corrugated paper flower.  It is denser and holds wipes in position.  You can fix the base of the flower with a green cloth greased with glue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dahlia from napkins </h2><p>  Before you make a flower from a napkin, you need to pick up a dense material and stock up with a strong nylon thread.  Place napkins on top of each other and cut two free edges in a semicircle.  Then all the products are expanded completely and laid out one on top of another in a flat pile. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dahlia from napkins" class="if uuid-2316317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316317.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to carefully fold the sheets with an "accordion", gently running your fingers along the folds so that they do not tear.  In the center of the strip, a thread or a thin twine is knotted tightly on a knot.  It remains to carefully level all layers of napkins and spread them in different directions.  The photographs posted in the article show the entire process of doing the work, so making a bouquet of such beautiful and lush flowers is not difficult. </p><h2>  Carnations in a Vase </h2><p>  Flowers from a napkin according to the instructions posted in the article, it is easy to perform.  First, wipes of the same color are stacked in a pack.  To prevent them from moving to the side, the entire stack can be fixed with a paper clip.  A circle is cut out according to the pattern.  For greater similarity, crafts with a real flower, the edges of the circles are outlined with a felt pen of a darker shade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="white napkin cloves" class="if uuid-2316356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316356.jpg"></div><p>  A needle and thread is inserted at the center point of the bundle of circles.  You can use thick yarn by tying a large knot at the end so that the thread does not slip out of the paper.  Then, layer by layer, the tissue is crushed, forming the natural folds of the petals. </p><p>  If you want to put flowers in a vase, then you need to attach the stalks of skewers wrapped in a green napkin or wire. </p><h2>  Corrugated Roses </h2><p>  It is quite simple to make such voluminous flowers from napkins.  To roll a napkin into a roll, you need to use a plastic knitting needle or a simple felt-tip pen.  Paper is wound on a flat stick until the middle of the napkin.  Then, taking the stick out, they pick up the paper and press it a little with your hands to form wrinkles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Corrugated Napkins" class="if uuid-2316358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316358.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, you need to make several rose petals, from 6 to 8 pieces.  Then they begin to make up the flower itself.  The first petal is twisted into a spiral.  A long, flat edge hangs down.  Then the second petal is wound around the first in a circle.  This procedure is carried out with all other details. </p><p>  The lower edges are fastened together and tightly tied with a thread or satin ribbon.  Such crafts can be placed in glass glasses for decorating the festive table. </p><h2>  Napkin lotus flower </h2><p>  Making such a large flower resembles modular origami.  Each element is performed in the same way, and then they are simply inserted one into another in a checkerboard pattern.  Let's take a closer look at how to fold each module correctly so that the flower looks neat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="big napkin lotus" class="if uuid-2316352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316352.jpg"></div><p>  Start picking a flower from green napkins.  First, a square napkin is folded diagonally.  In the resulting triangle, turned apex to the master, the left and right corners go down.  Two drooping tails form.  They rise up, only first you need to turn the napkin on the back side. </p><p>  After the tails are raised up, the module bends in half and is placed on the table with a sharp corner out.  The remaining modules are connected in a circle using a stapler.  It will take 8 leaves.  Then work begins on white modules, which, after manufacturing, are worn on the sharp tops of green modules.  Three rows of white lotus petals are exposed in layers.  Yellow napkins rolled up into a roll are inserted into a void in the middle. </p><h2>  Decorative flowers in pots </h2><p>  To make three-dimensional flowers from napkins, we will prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  white napkins for the middle - 2 pieces; </li><li>  colored napkins (optional) - 5 pieces; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  white <span>floristic ribbon</span> ; </li><li>  synthetic winterizer for filling the inside of the petals; </li><li>  wooden sticks for stems; </li><li>  green crepe paper to fill the pot; </li><li>  plastic flower pot. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.blog.birdsparty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="potted flowers" class="if uuid-2316365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2316365.jpg"></div><p>  Balls are twisted from sintepon and wrapped in napkins.  Two white - for the middle of the flower, 5 colored - for the petals.  After wrapping on the back, the excess tails are tied with a floral tape, all unnecessary is cut off.
