And indeed, until October 2017, she was part of the famous Kempinski network line.  However, recently this hotel has simply turned into a private hotel ‚ÄúAjman‚Äù.  But this does not mean that rest in it has become less chic.  On the contrary, the hotel is considered the best in the whole emirate of the same name.  Let's find out that tourists who were fortunate enough to visit there are talking about the former Kempinski Hotel in Ajman (UAE). </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://farvater.travel/en/hotels/ae/adzhman/" data-original="farvater.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &amp; quot; Ajman &amp; quot; (&amp; quot; Kempinski &amp; quot;) Emirates" class="if uuid-2552727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552727.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the emirate of Ajman, on the shores of the Persian Gulf.  It is about 20 kilometers from Sharjah.  Approximately the same distance from the city of Dubai. </p><p>  Ajman (Kempinski Hotel) can only be reached by taxi.  After all, there is no bus service between this city and other areas of the country.  The cheapest thing is to arrange the passage of four people at once. </p><p>  You can still get on the tourist bus that goes to one of the Ajman hotels.  But this does not always work.  After all, such buses are most often filled to capacity.  But most often, hotel guests book a transfer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Emirate Ajman </h2><p>  Hotel "Kempinski" is located in this smallest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe UAE, which only recently began to "unwind" as a resort.  Therefore, the traditional nature of the Middle East has remained untouched here - palm trees, desert, beaches with white sand. </p><p>  This city still bears a touch of provincialism.  There are not so many attractions here, although visitors can visit the historical museum, the square watchtower and the local Al Nuami mosque.  And near the city there are healing mineral springs. </p><p>  But this does not mean that Ajman is not at all equipped.  Here is one of the most beautiful walking streets in the UAE, which is called Cornish.  There is also a public city beach.  In the evenings, not only visiting tourists come here, but also wealthy local families. </p><p>  You can also fully experience the famous Arabian hospitality here.  Hotel Ajman (Kempinski) is considered the best hotel in the emirate. </p><p>  This city will be interesting for Russian travelers because there is not only no ‚Äúdry law‚Äù here, but imported alcoholic beverages are sold in the Hole in the Wall store without any restrictions.  The only inconvenience is that they cannot be exported from the territory of the emirate. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.423032" data-lng="55.44233299999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/5/4/5/4545.png"></div><h2>  What is nearby </h2><p>  In 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel there are many different shops and cafes "Shisha", where you can smoke a hookah, overlooking the sea.  Not too far is the pier of the famous dhow boats, which make cruises on the Persian Gulf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some tourists argue that due to the location of the Ajman Hotel (Kempinski), Dubai is a long way to go.  But the transfer solves a lot of issues. </p><p>  It‚Äôs difficult to ride independently.  There are very big traffic jams towards Dubai.  In any case, in order to travel outside Ajman, you have to take a taxi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kempinski Hotel Ajman 5 *" class="if uuid-2552719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552719.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  The former Kempinski hotel - 5 * Ajman Hotel - is located in a very picturesque place.  Therefore, the architects tried to make his building as harmoniously as possible fit into the landscape. </p><p>  It is located in the middle of a beautiful landscape park, resembling an oasis in the desert.  All in palm trees, greenery and flowers.  On the ground floor of the hotel building is a shopping arcade with a variety of shops.  There is also a business center, a conference room and a room for weddings and banquets. </p><p>  The area around the building is huge and very green.  Many lawns, bridges, there is where to walk, especially with children. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/united-arab-emirates/ajman/hotels/kempinski-hotel-ajman/" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&amp; quot; Kempinski Hotel Ajman &amp; quot; numbers" class="if uuid-2552724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552724.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Kempinski Hotel Ajman Resort is a fairly large hotel complex.  It has 185 rooms.  These are luxurious guest rooms.  The main room categories are Superior and Suite.  All of them are very spacious, bright and decorated in the style of Middle Eastern gloss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rooms have furnished balconies or terraces with views of the sea and landscaped garden.  And of course, the higher the floor, the more beautiful the landscape from the rooms opens.  All rooms have a kettle and capsule coffee machine.  Sachets are replenished daily, as is drinking water. </p><p>  There are slippers, bathrobes, and very good quality toiletries.  Comfortable beds and great linens.  There is a small refrigerator where you can store food. </p><p>  They clean it twice a day, so that everything shines, they prepare the room for bedtime, and the curtains are closed.  If you need an ironing board - they will bring it. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://hotel.invia.cz/spojene-arabske-emiraty/ajman/kempinski-hotel-ajman/" data-original="hotel.invia.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ajman Hotel 5 * restaurant" class="if uuid-2552733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552733.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists agree that the former Kempinski Hotel (Ajman) 5 stars still deserves.  This is especially true of food.  The hotel has many restaurants for every taste.  ‚ÄúBukhara‚Äù - with Indian cuisine, ‚ÄúHai Tao‚Äù - with Chinese, ‚ÄúSabella‚Äù - with Italian ... </p><p>  There are enough bars and eateries here.  Amazing desserts are served at Kranzler Cafe, and good soft drinks and non-alcoholic cocktails on the beach at Beachcomber.  You can smoke a wonderful hookah in the same place.  Tourists also noted the World Cup sports bar and a live music venue. </p><p>  Food for every taste - shrimp, red fish, grilled meat (beef or lamb), duck, a delicious sweet table, fruit ... Every evening - themed dinners.  On Thursdays, a fish day with a huge selection of seafood. </p><p>  A small child can be fed cereals and cream soups.  Decent breakfasts with 6 types of yogurt, and for lunch and dinner - very good cheeses and a whole tray with nuts - walnuts, cashews, pistachios.  Juices are only freshly squeezed.  Rich locals specially come here for lunch or dinner, and this already says a lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelajman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kempinski Hotel (United Arab Emirates / Ajman): reviews" class="if uuid-2552739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552739.jpg"></div><h2>  Service and entertainment </h2><p>  Of course, the reception is open 24 hours a day to check in and check in guests.  And from the airport and back they are delivered in a limousine or BMW. </p><p>  Kempinski Hotel Ajman is famous for its spa treatments.  Therefore, tourists leave delighted reviews about the services of local massage therapists.  You can order this type of wellness service at two spa centers or right on the beach.  There you will be offered to take a steam bath in the hammam or relax in the jacuzzi.  Spas are open until eleven in the evening. </p><p>  There is a car rental desk at the hotel.  There are many opportunities for hotel guests to go in for sports - there is a tennis court, a gym.  In the morning you will be called for exercise, and in the afternoon - for aerobics.  In the evenings, guests play billiards, bowling.  There is even a night club.  After dinner, a professional pianist plays in the lobby bar. </p><p>  Very happy family with children.  Kids are safe and not bored.  The playground is gorgeous.  The staff is very friendly.  Workers are especially good with children. </p><p>  There are Russian-speaking employees who will explain everything and show you, including where it is much more profitable to go shopping.  The hotel bus carries free to the Dubai Mall in the evenings. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.kenwoodtravel.co.uk/middle-east/ajman/kempinski-hotel-ajman-hotel/" data-original="www.kenwoodtravel.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Ajman (Kempinski) pool" class="if uuid-2552730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552730.jpg"></div><h2>  Sea, beach and pools </h2><p>  Just a hundred meters from the building of the Ajman Hotel (UAE / Ajman) is its own 400-meter sandy beach.  There are many types of various water activities. </p><p>  The distance between the sunbeds is very large, so that you do not have the impression that you are sunbathing in a crowd.  Great sense of privacy. </p><p>  The beach is very beautiful.  The entrance to the sea is smooth, the sand is white.  Every morning it is cleaned and thoroughly cleaned.  You can take as many beach towels as you like, but change them at any time. </p><p>  But it should be borne in mind that this is an open sea with waves, and not a lagoon.  Therefore, there may be storms.  And in winter - strong ebbs. </p><p>  The huge outdoor pool is surrounded by palm trees, creating a dense shadow.  Around him are sun loungers and deck chairs.  There is a special pool for children.  When you sunbathe near an artificial pond, you can hear the birds singing. </p><p>  There are always free sunbeds - both at sea and by the pool.  In winter, the latter, by the way, is heated.  Therefore, if the weather is windy, most vacationers go there. </p><p>  Along the beach line you can walk for a long time, go jogging.  Each umbrella has a button to call the waiter, which will bring you an order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kempinski Hotel Ajman Beach" class="if uuid-2552718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2552718.jpg"></div><h2>  Former Kempinski Hotel (United Arab Emirates / Ajman) Travel Reviews </h2><p>  At the hotel everything is clean, comfortable, chic, but without excessive pomp.  Everything is thought out to make it convenient for people, including those who come with small children and strollers. </p><p>  Kempinski Hotel Ajman is, first of all, beautiful, stylish rooms, excellent cleaning. If something is missing (toothbrushes, adapters for sockets, etc.), then all this will be brought to you at the first request. </p><p>  If you use the free hotel transfer to the Dubai Mall, then you can visit the aquarium and the underwater zoo.  Nearby is one of the most interesting sights of the emirate - "Burj Khalifa". </p><p>  But mostly tourists come here to relax, relax at sea and sunbathe.  The feeling of staying at this hotel among tourists arises as if you are not in the Middle East, but somewhere in Vietnam or in the Dominican Republic. </p><p>  There is no animation, but most tourists believe that for a beach holiday this is even a big plus. </p>
