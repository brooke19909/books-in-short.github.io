    <p>  In fact, every citizen who has an electronic wallet and bank plastic (of any bank) is able to withdraw money to the second component.  True, some difficulties may arise.  And you need to know about them.  Especially when it comes to residents of Russia and Ukraine.  Most recently, serious changes have affected them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Map wallet </h2><p>  The first method, which allows you to quickly transfer funds from the card to the WebMoney account, and vice versa, is to link the plastic to an existing account.  The process is not so difficult.  You can tie several cards. </p><p>  What is this required?  A registered account in "WebMoney", as well as a profile that is identified.  More precisely, in which there is confirmed passport data.  And nothing more. </p><p>  How to transfer money from WebMoney to a card?  First, the binding is carried out - for this on the official website of the wallet there is a corresponding function.  Then the map appears in the user profile.  And there will be an inscription: "Withdraw funds."  Click, then select the amount to transfer, confirm the payment - and it's done!  Nothing special!  But this way is not so often used.  This is not convenient for everyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="WebMoney transfers money to a Sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441928.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that with attached plastic it is more convenient to transfer money from a card to a WebMoney wallet.  Fast, no problem, reliable.  This is the most common type of tied bank card use. </p><h2>  Keeper </h2><p>  But this is only one option.  After tying the plastic, you can consider other methods proposed by users.  For example, if a person is thinking about how to transfer money from WebMoney to a card, he can be offered to act through a specialized application.  It is called <span>Webmoney Keeper.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This software is installed on a computer.  Then you need to go through authorization in it.  Are you done?  Then you can move on.  Now the user should find the "My WebMoney" section and select "Withdraw WM" there. </p><p>  In the window that appears, select <span>"Bank Transfer",</span> and then the currency.  For residents of Russia, this is WMR.  After that it will be offered to pass authorization in the system again.  And then enter the verification code.  Once these steps are completed, WebMoney will allow you to specify the data for the transfer.  More precisely, the amount that is planned to be transferred.  To do this, select the "Withdraw" menu item.  That's all.  The payment is confirmed - you can wait until the money comes to the account.  But do not think that everything will happen quickly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money from webmoney to sberbank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441927.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Through the site by bank transfer </h2><p>  And here is another rather interesting and simple method for solving the problem.  If you want to transfer money from WebMoney to a card of Sberbank or any other organization, the user can use the official wallet website.  Namely, the Banking service.  It is available only to those whose profile is identified and has verified card details, as well as passports.  Otherwise, such a solution will not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Accordingly, when a formal certificate is received, one can deal with the question posed.  It's simple: the user goes through authorization in WebMoney.  Then he needs to go to the address https://banking.guarantee.ru/payout/wizard.aspx and select the type of currency to transfer there.  Next, click on "Bank Transfer". </p><p>  The user will be prompted to verify the correct details, if this is not the first operation.  Or you can re-enter the data for the transfer.  The next step is to enter the amount to replenish the plastic and confirm the payment.  A letter will come to the mail in WebMoney asking you to enter a confirmation code for the operation.  He will come at the command of the user to his mobile device, tied to a profile.  Then you can wait for the payment to be completed. </p><h2>  Problems for Russia </h2><p>  Recently, WebMoney has been <span>transferring money to the card of Sberbank,</span> as well as other financial companies in Russia with minor problems.  In particular, the transfer to plastic has become difficult.  And many generally began to believe that WebMoney in Russia no longer transfers finances to bank accounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="webmoney you can transfer money to a card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441930.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This is actually not the case.  Directly by bank <span>transfer to transfer money is</span> now problematic.  After all, even the administration of the service indicates that this function has been suspended in Russia.  Nevertheless, there is a solution.  Only ingenuity and ingenuity are required.  What is offered to the residents of Russia in this regard?  How to transfer money from WebMoney to a card? </p><h2>  Exchangers </h2><p>  In order not to think about the question for a long time, you can simply turn to the help of various exchangers.  There are a lot of them.  And they offer withdrawing funds to bank cards from WebMoney in a matter of days.  This is the simplest solution for those who don‚Äôt feel like downloading photos of their documents in an electronic wallet, as well as delve into the process of linking bank plastic to a profile. </p><p>  How to be  You need to find a good intermediary site that offers a withdrawal of funds from WebMoney.  Next, an application is left indicating the wallet from which it is necessary to write off funds, as well as the user's card.  At the same time, the process takes the form of a buyback from the owner of the currency. </p><p>  Very dubious trick, but it works.  With WebMoney you can transfer money to a card through exchangers, but you only need to use trusted services.  Otherwise, there is a risk of losing money in principle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money from card to webmoney wallet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441926.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, you should pay attention to the BesChange or SmartVM website.  They are recommended by many users.  The executed translation is guaranteed to come to the card. </p><h2>  Why exchanger </h2><p>  Thus, if you need to transfer money to WebMoney from a credit card and vice versa, it is best to use exchangers.  But only proven.  Why?  It is fast and relatively convenient. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings should be highlighted: </p><ul><li>  high risk of fraud (but only on suspicious exchangers); </li><li>  taking a commission for the operation; </li><li>  sometimes - a long wait for a translation; </li><li>  limits on the withdrawal of funds (everywhere their own). </li></ul><p>  Nevertheless, if you take a responsible approach to the issue, it is precisely this approach that will help withdraw funds to WebMoney.  With some monetary losses, but this will be done in full. </p><h2>  How much to wait </h2><p>  And how much to wait for transfers?  This question does not have a clear answer.  Nevertheless, users quite often indicate that when working through the WebMoney or Keeper website, they will have to wait about 5-7 working days for money. </p><p>  But exchangers offer different waiting times.  On average - 3 business days.  There is the possibility of an urgent withdrawal - this way you can replenish a bank card in a day, but at the same time they charge a high commission. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transfer money to webmoney with a bank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1441931.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What can be summed up?  Briefly, the money transfer process is described as follows: </p><ol><li>  Registration at WebMoney.  Be sure to bind a personal phone number. </li><li>  Download on a special profile page: passports, bank account details, cards.  You need to wait for the verification results. </li><li>  Linking bank plastic to the WebMoney profile.  Not necessarily, but it will make life easier. </li><li>  Making a bank transfer through WebMoney Keeper or the official WebMoney Banking page. </li><li>  Confirmation of payment and expectation of the result. </li></ol><p>  Working with exchangers is easier, but, as already mentioned, this is far from the best method.  Some users, due to recent problems with the withdrawal of funds, have abandoned WebMoney. </p>
