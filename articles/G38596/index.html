    <p>  In 1147, Moscow was first mentioned in the annals.  At that time, it was the estate of Prince <span>Yuri Dolgoruky.</span>  In the 12th century, Moscow was a small fortified city.  Here at that time there was a border of 4 principalities: Smolensky, Ryazan, Vladimir-Suzdal and Chernigov.  This had its drawbacks.  The location at the intersection of 4 principalities made it a ‚Äúpassage yard‚Äù during the military campaigns of the princes.  Therefore, an important role was given to strengthening the city.  So, in 1156, the current capital of Russia was fortified with new wooden walls.  By the middle of the 12th century, the city became larger, however, it occupied the territory of no more than half of today's Kremlin.  At this time, the Moscow principality was not independent.  It was part of the Vladimir-Suzdal land. </p><p>  Muscovites took part in <span>internecine wars.</span>  In 1170, they supported the brothers A. Bogolyubsky against the actions of Yaropolk to seize their territory.  Upon learning that Moscow took part in the war, Yaroslav was forced to turn back.  For this, the very next year, the city was burned. </p><p>  In 1238, Moscow was destroyed by a horde.  However, despite this, she continued to enjoy a reputation as the safest land. </p><p>  A. Nevsky became the Moscow prince in 1250, who bequeathed this principality to his son Daniel.  For a long time the boy was under the care of his uncle.  After 10 years, Daniel became the Prince of Moscow, thereby laying the foundation for the Moscow line of princes. </p><p>  The boundaries of this state entity were small.  There were only two <span>large cities</span> in the composition <span>:</span> Zvenigorod and Moscow.  There were also 3 estates: Radonezh, Ruza and Przemysl. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite its small size, the Principality of Moscow in the <span>14th century</span> could withstand such a large city as Tver.  In the same century, the active joining of other regions of Russia began. </p><p>  The mass exodus of the population from Murom, Rostov, Vladimir due to the raids of the Tatars made the Moscow principality one of the most populated.  This allowed the state to rise. </p><p>  The opening of trade routes linking Lithuania and Poland with Polotsk, Smolensk, and the East made Moscow the Principality economically developed. </p><p>  Remoteness from Lithuania, the Mongol-Tatars also played a role in enhancing the influence of the city in the 14th century. </p><p>  The first Moscow princes </p><p>  The ancestor of the line of princes is considered to be Daniil Alexandrovich.  In 1263, he received from his father, Alexander Nevsky, a small inheritance, which after a while began to be called the Moscow Principality.  Under Daniil Alexandrovich, the Kremlin was renovated, the Holy Danilovsky Monastery was founded, and churches were built.  During his reign, the capital of modern Russia has significantly expanded its borders and strengthened its position. </p><p>  After the death of Daniil Alexandrovich, the land passed to his eldest son - Yuri Daniilovich, who after the death of the Tver prince received the right to the principality of Vladimir.  Under Yuri, Moscow expanded its borders: in 1303 Kolomna and Mozhaisk were annexed. </p><p>  After the assassination of <span>Yuri Danilovich, the</span> principality of Moscow passes to his brother, Ivan Kalita.  During his reign, Yaropolch, Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod, Bogolyubovo, Pereyaslavl-Zalessky were annexed.  During his reign, the Arkhangelsk and Uspensky cathedrals and the oak Kremlin were built. </p><p>  Kalita's successor was Simeon the Proud.  He subjugated the small princes, behaved imperiously, expanded the borders of Moscow land.  Through acquaintance and friendship with the Khan of the Golden Horde, Simeon ensured a peaceful life in his state. </p><p>  All Moscow princes took significant steps to strengthen the influence of the Moscow principality and expand its borders.  But perhaps the most significant contribution to history was made by Daniil Aleksandrovich, who began to annex new territories to his land. </p>
