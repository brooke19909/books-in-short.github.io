Kulikovo Field Festival</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1380, a battle took place between the troops of Dmitry Donskoy and Mamaia.  It played an important role in history, because it became a decisive step towards the establishment of unity of the Russian lands.  Dmitry Donskoy won. </p><p>  In 1965, the Museum of the Battle of Kulikovo was created in the Tula region.  It is located near the village of Ivanovka, in the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh.  In 2016, a whole complex dedicated to a significant historical event was organized nearby.  Briefly, the most important thing about the Battle of Kulikovo, museum exhibits, and the festival, which is held in the Tula region annually, can be found in the article. </p><h2>  Battle </h2><p>  It happened, of course, not quite in the place where the Museum of the Battle of Kulikovo stands today.  Historians argue about the exact location of the place to this day.  According to the annals, it happened on the shore of Nepryadva.  However, scientists were able to prove that in the 14th century there were impassable dense forests. </p><p>  The lack of burials also confuses researchers.  True, in 2006, archaeologists using modern technology discovered something resembling the graves of warriors. What happened in September 1380? </p><p>  Russian troops became the initiator in the battle, to which the Museum of the Battle of Kulikovo is dedicated.  They crossed to the south bank of the Don, destroying bridges behind them.  By 11 o‚Äôclock they were ready for battle.  Dmitry Donskoy took part in the battle, at the last moment exchanging clothes with the boyar.  Mamai watched the battle from afar. </p><p>  There were many losses on both sides, but the Tatar army eventually hastily left the battlefield. </p><h2>  Museum of the Battle of Kulikovo in the Tula Region </h2><p>  The beginning of the collection was laid by one of the participants in World War II, an amateur archaeologist who devoted many years to the study of the great battle.  True, in the 19th century, ideas about the battle were far from modern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1836, a draft of the future temple was prepared, which was to become a monument to the valiant soldiers who fell on the Kulikovo field.  However, the first stone was laid only in 1913. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of the Battle of Kulikovo" class="if uuid-2601860" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2601860.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking about the museum of the Battle of Kulikovo, they often mean a military historical reserve.  The atmosphere of the 14th century is recreated on a vast territory.  There are many exhibitions, guided tours. </p><h2>  Military Historical Reserve </h2><p>  The complex is located in the village of Mokhovoe, Tula region.  The main buildings are made in the style of Russian postmodernism, while on the territory there are hotels, cafes, souvenir shops. </p><p>  Most of the exhibits are the results of the work of modern researchers.  Here are various layouts that allow you to gain knowledge about the features, progress, alignment of forces of the Kulikovo battle. </p><p>  In order to feel the atmosphere of bygone days, connoisseurs of Russian history spend several days in the reserve.  What to see in the vicinity of Kulikovo field? </p><div class="photo" data-original="tulagid71.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memorial Complex" class="if uuid-2601864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2601864.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A visit to the museum-panorama of the Battle of Kulikovo leaves an indelible impression.  First of all, you should visit the main exhibition.  It consists of several rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum was founded recently.  Some expositions appeared here in 2016.  The history of the battle is presented in two planes.  The guide gives interesting facts about the events of 1380.  The museum employee talks about the Battle of Kulikovo briefly, the most important, and the information presented by him is supported by the finds of archaeologists presented at the exhibition.  There is also a children's exhibition.  It is called <span>"Alone in the field is not a warrior."</span> </p><h2>  Museum of Merchant Life </h2><p>  On the territory of the historical reserve, not all exhibitions are devoted directly to the battle.  There is an exhibition worth visiting in order to learn a lot of new and interesting information from the history of Russia. </p><p>  The Museum of Merchant Life is located in the village of Epifan, in a typical Russian manor of the 19th century.  It once belonged to the Baibakov bourgeoisie. </p><h2>  Memorial complex in Monastyrshchino </h2><p>  The formation of the complex in this village began in the 19th century, when an art exhibition dedicated to the Battle of Kulikovo was opened here.  The process of complex formation has dragged on.  The opening of the museum took place only in 2000. </p><p>  First, the exposition "Field of Russian Glory" appeared in the building of the former parish school.  In 2005, several more exhibitions dedicated to medieval Russia opened. </p><p>  The exhibits presented here are ethnographic in nature.  They allow you to learn about the life and life of residents of the settlements of the Don River Basin.  There is a monument to Dmitry Donskoy at the stone church.  Here, the Walk of Fame was laid with commemorative signs of the cities that took part in the Battle of Kulikovo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.povarenok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Column monument to Dmitry Donskoy" class="if uuid-2601870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2601870.jpg"></div><p>  In 2012, the Horse Yard was opened in the village of Monastyrshchino.  It contains more than 30 horses today.  These hardy strong animals were the power of the Russian army.  Each commander had cavalry.  In addition, a solid horse was an indicator of status. </p><p>  In the northern part of the village Monastyrshchino - the confluence of the rivers Nepryadva and Don.  It was here, as the chronicler claimed, that Russian troops made the crossing on the eve of the battle.  However, these data are refuted by researchers of the 20th century. </p><h2>  The festival </h2><p>  As already mentioned, every year in the Tula region an event dedicated to the Battle of Kulikovo is held.  Festival participants put on 13th century ammunition and try to recreate in every possible way the atmosphere of the times of Dmitry Donskoy.  A grand event is being held on Red Hill.  Duration - 4-5 days.  Who takes part in the festival? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum Reserve Kulikovo Field" class="if uuid-2601862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2601862.jpg"></div><p>  Military-historical clubs operate in different cities of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, whose members know no less than historians about the life and life of medieval warriors.  Once a year they come to the Tula region and take part in various thematic competitions. </p><p>  At the festival, pair fights, military cavalry and even a massive battle on foot are being reconstructed.  Here, workshops are held on baking bread, roasting ceramics, making armor.  On the territory there is a brewery, a fair, a forge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.orfey.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kulikovo Field Festival" class="if uuid-2601872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2601872.jpg"></div><p>  In order to learn more about the significant battle, you need to visit the Tula region.
