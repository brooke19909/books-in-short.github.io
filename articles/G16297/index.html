The Korean manufacturer regularly produces phones in various price categories.  For example, in 2013, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Trend GT-S7390 was released.

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The design of the packaging box designers picked up an interesting one.  It shows naturalness.  The panels are decorated in wood, and the emphasis is not only on color, but also on natural ornamentation.  On the front side is a photograph of the smartphone.  Above it in the upper left corner is the company logo, decorated in blue tones.  Below is the full name of the model.  On the side, the buyer can get acquainted with the main characteristics of the Galaxy Trend S7390.  Here you can see information about Wi-Fi support, operating system, camera resolution, processor capabilities, communication standards and more. </p><p>  But what is inside the box?  Unfortunately, the manufacturer will not surprise the user with a complete set of equipment.  All that is provided is documentation and a charger.  Most of the comments were made regarding the lack of accessories.  It's about headphones.  Also, buyers will have to buy an additional memory card and case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Trend S7390 is not very different in appearance from other devices of this manufacturer.  The case looks quite compact.  Its height is 121.5 mm and its width is 63.1 mm.  As for the thickness, it is somewhat overestimated, is almost 11 mm.  The corners on the case are rounded, a frame runs around the perimeter, which focuses on the front and rear panels.  As for the latter, the camera lens and speaker hole are displayed on it.  In the center of the cover is the company name. </p><p>  The front panel has a large touch screen.  It is framed by a black frame that expands significantly from the bottom and top.  The control panel is designed typically, as for devices of the Korean manufacturer.  A mechanical key is displayed in the center, touch buttons on the sides.  There is no backlight.  At the top of the Galaxy Trend S7390 there is only a speaker hole and a logo.  The lock button is displayed on the right side face, and the volume ‚Äúrocker‚Äù is on the opposite side.  For the mini-jack connector, there was a place on the upper end. </p><p>  Under the back cover is the battery.  Directly below it is a SIM card slot.  There is also a connector for external media.  Hot swapping is not provided by the developers. </p><p>  As for the build quality, users have no comments on it.  The device doesn‚Äôt crackle when pressed, there are no creaks or backlash.  Case material - plastic.  The most easily soiled is the screen.  Periodically, the user will have to erase the fingerprints, since the manufacturer did not use <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  But in defense we say that it is not difficult to remove them, just wipe the screen with a soft cloth.  If you do not use the case, then small scratches will begin to form on the case over time.  In order to avoid this, you can purchase, for example, a bumper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung s7390 galaxy trend" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002286.jpg" width="600"></div>

The display is manufactured in compliance with TFT technology.  Many users are already familiar with it.  Unfortunately, reviews of such screens are not very good.  Resolution - only 800 √ó 480 px.  The brightness level is sufficient, but when working outdoors in sunny weather, glare forms that can cause some inconvenience.  Users will have to adapt.  In order to read the information on the screen, most likely, you will need to cover it with your hand.  Color is limited to support 16 million colors.  The contrast is good.  Pixels are not visible to the naked eye.  Resolution is 233 ppi.  For convenience, the developers have provided automatic screen rotation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy trend gt s7390" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002287.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Can I use the Galaxy Trend S7390 as a camera?  The characteristics of the camera, unfortunately, will not allow you to take great pictures.  Optics is based on a 3 megapixel sensor.  Flash and autofocus are not provided by developers.  Accordingly, their absence is strongly displayed on the quality of photographs.  Of course, you can experiment with the settings, but the end result will not change much.  In the camera menu, the user has access to effects, brightness control, white balance and more.  If desired, you can switch to the video recording mode.  The quality of the videos is average.  During recording, you can mute / unmute the sound.  The maximum frame rate is 30. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung s7390 galaxy trend pay" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002288.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  It's time to study the technical specifications of the Galaxy Trend GT-S7390.  The performance of the device is not very high.  The developers used a single core chipset.  Its capabilities are limited by a clock frequency of 1000 MHz.  In principle, the device copes with everyday tasks well, but it can hang on games. </p><p>  The low performance is also evidenced by the small amount of "RAM" - only 512 MB.  Naturally, resource-intensive applications cannot be installed on the phone - it simply won‚Äôt pull them.  Integrated memory storage is 4 GB.  According to users, at present this is already too small an indicator.  It should be borne in mind that not all volume will be available.  Since this model is a smartphone, an operating system is installed on it, the files of which occupy about half of the native memory.  Given this, the user can only be content with 2 GB.  The situation is saved by the support of memory cards.  If desired, each owner can install media up to 64 GB. </p><p>  Samsung's GT-S7390 is based on a modern and fairly popular OS - Android.  The manufacturer installed a version of Jelly Bean.  Pre-installed software, according to users, is enough.  Everything functions quickly and clearly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="galaxy trend s7390 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002289.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy Trend S7390: battery specifications </h2><p>  The autonomy of this phone model is provided by a lithium-ion battery.  Its type is removable.  Capacity is only 1,500 milliamps per hour.  How long can gadget owners expect?  If you believe the characteristics indicated by the manufacturer, then in standby mode the device is able to work for about 15 days.  If you use the gadget as a music player, then one battery charge is enough for 40-42 hours.  Those who prefer to talk on the phone for a long time should expect that they will have to charge the battery after 8 hours. With an average load in combined mode, the device lasts 2-3 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung s7390 galaxy trend specifications" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002290.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  Often information appears on the network that after some time the phone starts to freeze very much, system failures appear.  The first thing that comes to the minds of owners in this situation is to run to a service center.  In principle, this is the right decision, but advanced users recommend changing the Galaxy Trend S7390 firmware on their own first.  No special knowledge is required for this, it is enough just to consistently perform certain actions. </p><p>  What will be needed for flashing the phone?  Of course, the gadget itself and the USB cable.  Be sure to charge the battery, as if the update process is interrupted, this can completely damage the device.  Install drivers on the computer, download the new firmware and the Odin program. </p><p>  The order of the actions: </p><ul><li>  Turn on the computer / laptop. </li><li>  Install drivers for the phone. </li><li>  Save the new firmware file to the PC. </li><li>  Download the Odin program.  It is specifically designed to change the firmware of mobile devices. </li><li>  Reboot PC. </li><li>  Unzip Odin and extract the firmware files to your desktop. </li><li>  On the phone, activate the option "USB debugging".  After that, turn off the device. </li><li>  Transfer it to Dowload Mode by simultaneously pressing the power, home, and volume rocker keys (bottom). </li><li>  Warning should appear on the phone screen. </li><li>  You must confirm the selection of the boot mode by pressing the top of the volume button. </li><li>  Open the Odin program on the PC.  The launch is carried out on behalf of the administrator. </li><li>  Without turning on the phone, connect it to the computer using a USB cable. </li><li>  It is important to pay attention that the window with the inscription ID: COM changes color to blue.  In this case, you can continue the action. </li><li>  Select the firmware files and press START. </li><li>  Wait until the installation process is complete and only after that you can turn off the phone. </li></ul><h2>  Galaxy Trend S7390: issue price </h2><p>  What about the cost?  This model belongs to the segment of budget devices.  This is evidenced by the technical specifications.  At the time of release, the price varied within five thousand rubles.  Having studied all the possibilities, we can say that this gadget justifies such a cost. </p><p>  In 2014, this phone model was available for purchase.  A discount of almost a thousand rubles was offered at MTS stores.  Samsung Galaxy Trend S7390 in this case is blocked only for working with one mobile operator. </p><p>  Currently, this model has already been discontinued.  In specialized stores, it is not for sale.  The only place you can buy a phone is in the secondary market.  The price depends on the state of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="firmware s7390 galaxy trend" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2002291.jpg" width="600"></div>
