    <p>  The sand on the beach is grayish, shallow, the sea is clean.  As a rule, in Phan Thiet, winds are frequent.  This is due to geographical location.  Relaxing <span>on the beach</span> by the hotel is a real pleasure.  You can enjoy a cocktail at the bar or take a sunbath.  Also here all the conditions are created for surfing. </p><p>  People often come to the beach to meet the sunrises and see off the sun.

You should not go on long trips, but you can see the nearest attractions. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Attractions attract most tourists.  There are a lot of them in Phan Thiet.  Particular attention should be paid to traveling to Mount Taku, where you can see the statue of the reclining Buddha.  The length of the monument is 49 meters.  This is the largest Buddha statue in all of Vietnam.  It is located on a mountain, where you have to climb. </p><p>  Another memorable trip could be the road to the sand dunes and to the island of Rum.  After exploring the white dunes, the guides definitely recommend to go to <span>the lotus lake.</span>  These magnificent flowers bloom here all year round and are pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  Those who want to take pictures in a picturesque place should definitely visit the fishing village.  There are a lot of beautiful boats that have become a symbol of this place. </p><p>  Red Canyon is a visiting card of the region.  Travelers are also brought here.  This is a very beautiful place, which was formed by the merger of sand of various colors. </p>
