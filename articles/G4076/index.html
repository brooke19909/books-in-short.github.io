In this regard, economy class housing is very popular.  Apartments in this segment can be purchased not only by the middle class, but also by less well-off people, using all kinds of lending programs and state support.  In addition, in order to reduce the cost of apartments, developers are beginning to actively develop the outskirts and suburbs of St. Petersburg.  Such real estate in St. Petersburg is in no less, if not greater demand.  And one of its facilities includes a new residential complex located in the village of Murino, practically next to the Devyatkino metro station.  This is the LCD "Swallow".  The developer, the Petrostroy company, classifies its offspring as liquid and highly demanded projects on the market, which, in principle, is confirmed by both positive feedback from grateful customers and the speed with which apartments in a residential complex are being bought up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc swallow" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283608.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The company "Petrostroy" has been operating in the real estate market for more than ten years, mainly engaged in the construction of residential real estate of economy class.  The developer has six completed projects, seven are under construction and two are under construction.  The developer sells housing on the basis of the requirements of federal law No. 214. The developer implements all his projects in the territories of such large cities as St. Petersburg and Perm.  The company considers its main goal to provide all those in need with high-quality affordable housing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The developer belongs to the category of reliable developers who always hand over their objects on time and without any unfinished work. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  The residential complex "Swallow" is a multi-section fifteen-story building.  In total there are 14 sections.  The location for the complex, the developer chose more than successful.  This is the Vsevolozhsk district, which is being actively built up by developers today. </p><p>  All houses are being built in accordance with the principles of a unified architectural concept, have a stylish design and are lined with beige and brown brickwork.  The sale of 2460 economy class apartments in the residential complex "Swallow" is provided.  Devyatkino is the nearest metro station that can be reached on foot, taking no more than seven minutes.  Which, of course, is a huge advantage of the complex and extremely attractive to buyers. </p><p>  A few words about what the Swallow LCD address will have.  So far, it can be found among the rest of the new buildings, focusing on the following recommendations: building 7 should be searched for along Petrovsky Avenue.  When all the <span>houses are</span> put into operation, each of them will have its own building number. </p><h2>  LCD "Swallow": the progress of construction </h2><p>  Work on the construction of houses began in 2013.  Construction is carried out in seven phases.  All design and estimate documentation was developed by Petrostroy specialists.  ‚ÄúSwallow‚Äù is not her first project, so investors who signed the agreement can be sure that all the houses will be completed on time.  As for the latter, the commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2016. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Real estate in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283607.jpg" width="600"></div>

The developer‚Äôs website is constantly updating data, publishing news, photos and video materials about the stage at which the construction of buildings is currently underway.  According to the latest information, everything is going according to plan, in the coming months the <span>houses of the</span> first three phases will be <span>commissioned</span> .  An interesting fact in favor of the developer: the company has permission for integrated development, which is valid until 2020.  However, Petrostroy specialists decided to turn in all the buildings ahead of schedule and significantly reduced the time for their construction.  Given the excellent reputation of the developer, you can be sure that he will keep his promise.  And in the near future, the residential complex "Swallow" will receive its first tenants. </p><h2>  Ecology of the region </h2><p>  This is a question that worries every resident of the metropolis who has decided to purchase an apartment in a new building on the outskirts.  Which is not surprising.  People want to see from the windows of their houses not smoking chimneys, but a forest and a river.  With this in the LCD "Swallow" everything is in order.  Vsevolozhsk district is considered favorable in terms of environmental conditions, there are no large industrial enterprises. </p>

    <p>  The activities of those that are available are offset by the presence on its territory of large forests, park areas, lakes and the Okhta River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  Such a good location can not boast of all the new buildings that are available in such a huge city as St. Petersburg.  LCD "Swallow" is located from the metro station "Devyatkino" just one kilometer.  This makes it possible not only to quickly reach the desired area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe metropolis, but also allows you to use all the nearby infrastructure, which has developed over the years. </p><p>  Nearby, just two kilometers from the buildings, is a roundabout.  Murino has a bus station and a railway station.  Almost near the houses there is a public transport stop, from which minibuses and buses often leave. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  LCD "Swallow" is not the only complex that is being built in Murino.  Nearby are several more similar objects that are at one stage or another of construction.  Some have already been commissioned.  Therefore, at first, residents of new buildings can take advantage of their infrastructure.  In the village itself there is an outpatient clinic, a kindergarten, a school, shops in which you can purchase essential goods.  In addition, the metro also has everything that a modern resident of the city needs.  Near it there are three schools and as many kindergartens, there is a mini-market, a fitness center, large shopping, entertainment and health centers.  If necessary, you can go to Vsevolozhsk, which is a fairly large city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc swallow builder" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283614.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <p>  In addition, in parallel with the construction of buildings, the developer is also working on the construction of social and commercial facilities, which will continue after the houses are put into operation.  So residents of the residential complex ‚ÄúLastochka‚Äù will not feel a lack of anything almost immediately after settlement, unlike many other apartment owners in other new buildings. </p><h2>  What does the developer offer </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the housing in the "Swallow" belongs to the economy class, in connection with which the houses are mainly dominated by studios and 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments.  Since the complex was built with the expectation of young families, there are not many trenches in it.  All housing is for rent with rough finish.  The cost of apartments is one of the lowest in the whole Leningrad region, which makes the offer very attractive for a potential client. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc swallow construction progress" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283616.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Unfortunately, they are not very diverse.  Nevertheless, there is a choice.  An apartment of any format has about 5 layout options, which will allow each buyer to choose for themselves decent housing in accordance with personal preferences and tastes.  There is nothing superfluous in the apartments, however, the company's specialists have correctly distributed every useful centimeter of such a precious area.  Each living room has a functional, albeit small, bathroom, a fairly spacious entrance hall, an ergonomic kitchen.  All apartments are equipped with loggias or balconies.  Treshki are offered only in two buildings, in all the rest - only residential premises of a smaller format.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments varies from 22 to 79 square meters.  Ceiling height - 2 m 75 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc swallow prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283611.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  As we already said, the developer offers buyers apartments with only <span>rough finish.</span>  It includes: floor screed, plastering walls and ceilings, installation of an entrance wooden door, two-chamber double-glazed windows, water, gas and electricity meters, heating radiators.  Installation of plumbing equipment is not provided. </p><p>  If the owner of the housing expresses a desire, the developer company can provide the services of a designer-designer and perform all the finishing work on residential and sanitary facilities.  Cost - from five thousand rubles per square meter. </p><h2>  LCD "Swallow": prices </h2><p>  On the real estate market, "Swallow" is considered one of the most affordable projects, offering residents of the capital housing at an extremely attractive cost.  Apartment prices here are the lowest in comparison with similar options in the suburbs of St. Petersburg.  So, a studio apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã22 to 32 "squares" can be purchased for 1 million 770 thousand rubles.  For ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù (30-40 sq. M.) Will have to pay from two and a half to three million rubles.  "Dvushka", an area of ‚Äã‚Äã53-72 "squares", will cost from 3,500,000 to 4,800,000 rubles, three-room apartments, of which there are very few, cost 4,700,000 rubles.  Their area is 79 square meters. </p>

    <h2>  Payment </h2><p>  The developer, in order to increase the availability of housing, offers a variety of forms of payment.  On the terms of shared participation or using preliminary booking of apartments (with the obligatory conclusion of contracts).  It is proposed to purchase apartments in installments.  The size of the down payment and payment schedule are negotiated individually with the company's specialists.  It is also possible to purchase an apartment using a mortgage.  The Petrostroy company cooperates with many banks, in connection with which each potential client will be able to choose a suitable loan program for himself without any problems.  Perhaps the use of military mortgages and maternity capital.  As you can see, it‚Äôs possible to purchase affordable housing in the Swallow housing complex without any problems even if you don‚Äôt have your own funds to buy it. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  After completion of construction, the developer plans to carry out the whole complex of works on the arrangement and landscaping of the territory.  Small architectural forms will be installed in the courtyards of the houses, playgrounds for children and sports facilities for adults with street exercise equipment will be equipped.  Pedestrian paths will also be asphalted and a ramp to Petrovsky Prospekt will be arranged with an exit to the roundabout.  It is planned to build an underground parking and guest parking near each building.  All entrances will be equipped with CCTV cameras.  In one of the courtyards there will be a comprehensive school, in the other two - kindergartens.  Since all the first floors of the buildings were given for commercial premises, after putting them into operation, objects of social, household and commercial infrastructure will begin to function and render their services here.  It is planned to build a sports and entertainment complex for children on the territory of the Swallow complex. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do those who have already taken part in the <span>shared construction of the</span> Swallow housing estate or just thinking of buying an apartment in it say?  About the quality of housing, since it has not yet been commissioned, there are, of course, no comments.  However, taking into account the feedback from previous customers of the company, it can be understood that there are no special complaints from people.  The houses are rented out without defects, the quality of the finish, even if rough, does not cause any special complaints.  If there are any shortcomings, then they are minor, problems are solved immediately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="petrostroy swallow" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1283609.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, everyone praises the cost of apartments and their forms of payment.  Potential buyers like the fact that the developer periodically holds promotions, the conditions of which sometimes save more than five percent of the amount, which, given the multi-million dollar value of current apartments, is not so small. </p><p>  And, of course, everyone is delighted with the location of the complex.  To have a metro station within walking distance of the apartment‚Äôs threshold is a lot.  Even the owners of apartments in prestigious areas of St. Petersburg sometimes can not boast of such an advantage, so valuable for living in a megalopolis. </p><p>  Of course, when the houses are put into operation, there will be those who are dissatisfied.  There are always people who are not happy with something.  In the meantime, one thing can be said: construction is proceeding in accordance with plans, the developer offers to buy apartments at quite decent prices, next to the house there is a metro station, the ecology of the district in which the residential complex is located, a good one, and even a forest and a river nearby.  One can only dream of such a thing.  So welcome to the LCD "Swallow"! </p>
