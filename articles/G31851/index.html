Summer has long been left behind, the holiday season is ending, but Turkey in October still receives tourists who wish to soak up the sea. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * is located on the coast of the beautiful Mediterranean Sea.  The hotel belongs to the long-known resort of Alanya, and at the same time is located in the Obagel region.  The hotel is a five-story building, one hundred meters from the beach.  It is not difficult to get from the airport to the hotel; the bus service is well established.  Only now have to overcome the path length of 110 kilometers.  The nearest airport is in Antalya.  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * Address: Alanya, 07400, Atat√ºrk Caddesi, Oba Kasabasƒ± G√∂l Mahallesi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471517.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fifty meters from the hotel there is a public transport stop.  This is convenient if tourists intend to visit local attractions. </p><h2>  Grand Bayar Beach 4 *: description </h2><p>  The hotel can be attributed to the relatively young.  It was built in 1995, and in 2010 a major reconstruction was made.  The last redecoration was carried out in 2012.  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * is medium in size, its area is about 3000 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * has at its disposal ninety rooms.  The choice of apartments can not be called diverse.  The economy hotel is designed for family vacations, therefore the number of rooms is represented by rooms of two categories: </p><ol><li>  Family room. </li><li>  Standard room. </li></ol><p>  All apartments are equipped with satellite TV and TV, minibar, air conditioning, hairdryer.  Housekeeping is daily.  The rooms are clean with nice new furniture.  Since recently renovated, the apartments are still in good condition. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  All tourists are always concerned about the issue of food.  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * (Alanya) operates on the all-inclusive system so popular in Turkey.  The hotel has one open restaurant, designed for 250 people, one indoor for 150 people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey in October" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the complex has two bars that offer guests not only cocktails and spirits, but also a variety of snacks throughout the day, as well as ice cream. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Grand Bayar Beach 4 * (Alanya) offers its guests to use the pool and relaxation area with sunbeds around it.  The hotel has a laundry room, a conference room, a doctor, a paid safe at the reception.  The hotel area is quite small, one might say compact. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, you can visit the hammam, a beauty salon and a shop in Grand Bayar Beach 4 *.  Hotel service is unobtrusive, staff communicates in English, Russian and German.  But animation programs for adults are organized three times a week in Russian and German. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  What are the benefits of Grand Bayar <span>Beach Hotel 4 *?</span>  Alanya <span>beaches</span> are the pride of all local hotels.  The complex is located on the coast.  In fact, the territory of the hotel is separated from the coast by a road.  Walking through it is not entirely safe, since traffic on it is quite busy, and there is no traffic light nearby, while the drivers themselves do not express a desire to let anyone pass.  However, this point is not so important, since there is a special underground passage under the highway.  As soon as you passed it, you find yourself on the beach.  There are free umbrellas and sunbeds.  The coast itself has a pebble-sand coating. </p><h2>  Holidays in October </h2><p>  Although the summer is long gone, the season is not over yet.  Turkey in October, as before, takes everyone to relax.  Of course, tourists in this period are already much smaller, the number of staff is gradually reduced, but the prices for tours are much more pleasant than in summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4 service" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, you can relax for quite reasonable money in the middle of autumn.  At this time, Grand Bayar <span>Beach 4 * (Turkey,</span> Alanya) is still operating.  The weather in October in Alanya is much milder than in the summer.  There is already no that intense heat, tourists are pleased with the soft warmth, sometimes it blows with heat.  On average, at this time the temperature fluctuates around +25 degrees, sometimes even rises to +30.  But at night it blows cool (+15).  Evenings can sometimes be fresh, and therefore tourists should take warm clothes. </p><p>  The first half of October is the perfect time to relax.  But after the fifteenth, the risk of rains and temporary cooling increases.  At this time, the weather can bring surprises, however, the temperature regime may vary from year to year. </p><p>  However, even the rain will not be able to spoil the vacation, since the water temperature is still high (+24), and therefore quite acceptable for swimming.  All the vagaries of nature are more than offset by the cost of tours in October.  This is the cheapest month to relax. </p><h2>  Recommendations for tourists </h2><p>  Those who are planning a vacation in October should clearly understand that at this time parties hang out.  Most likely, water parks are already closed, there are no rides on a banana, aquabikes.  But discos still work.  Nightlife no longer boils like it does in summer.  But the autumn holiday opens up many other possibilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4 turkey alanya weather" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since the hotel is in a good location, you can take a leisurely stroll along the coast in your free time.  Alanya is rich in historical and cultural attractions worth seeing.  In the summer, vacationers are simply not able to do this, because the heat is in the way.  But autumn is the most comfortable time for excursions.  In October, those trips that are simply unavailable in the heat become possible.  This is mountaineering and trekking in the Akdag and Dzhebelireis mountains, a pirate tour on a boat on the river to the old town of Iotepe, travel on mountain streams and exploring waterfalls, rafting and jeep safaris, exploring caves. </p><p>  Men will certainly enjoy sea and lake fishing, and women at this time are enjoying shopping trips with visits to jewelry and textile shopping centers. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  Alanya is one of the most pleasant cities in Turkey.  This resort can not be compared with the bustling Istanbul, but there are advantages here.  No wonder that the city has gained such popularity among our compatriots. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Alanya, you can see the ancient ruins of the port of Aytap and the town of Siedra, Alara Khan (caravanserai), the village of Leartis and much more.  The calling card of the city is <span>Cleopatra's beach</span> and the Kyzyl-Kule tower.  An interesting fact is that once <span>Mark Anthony</span> presented Cleopatra with the southeastern part of modern Turkey.  So the sand was brought to the Queen‚Äôs favorite beach from the north of Africa.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it is completely dust free, and therefore the sea on this beach is never muddy.  The length of this beach is about 30 kilometers, it is worth it to see it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach hotel 4 beaches" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among the objects for viewing, it is worth highlighting the fortress of Alanya, which is the central historical attraction.  It is well preserved, and meets tourists in all its beauty.  No less interesting is the Kyzyl-Kule tower in the port of the town.  Thousands of tourists visit it annually. </p><p>  The archaeological museum of Alanya is very interesting.  It is constantly updated with new artifacts, since excavations in Turkey do not stop. </p><p>  Just in the fall, visits to the caves of Alanya are very popular.  These are very entertaining trips.  Along the Mediterranean coast there are quite a lot of caves and grottoes.  Particularly interesting for holidaymakers: Dim Magarasy, Damlatash Magarasy, Karain Magarasy.  <span>Damlatas</span> Magarasy <span>Cave</span> is located at the very beginning of Cleopatra's beach, so it is very easy to get to it.  Can be reached on foot. </p><p>  Among the most visited places of the city is the Tersane shipyard.  It is located next to the Kyzyl-Kule tower.  In the evenings, Tersane is lit with lights, making the shipyard look prettier.  Currently, it serves as a pier for people. </p><h2>  Grand Bayar Beach 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Leading a conversation about the hotel, I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists.  According to holidaymakers, the wonderful staff works at Grand Bayar Beach 4 * (Turkey, Alanya).  All employees are very friendly, polite and helpful.  At the reception they settle without delay, while not extorting money.  Cleaning is done efficiently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4 alanya" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471522.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel itself is quite modest in size.  The rooms are also small in size, but they are all very clean.  It can be seen that the repair was not so long ago.  Plumbing in the apartment is new, it works properly.  There is no mildew or smudges in the bathroom.  But the size of the bathroom itself is very tiny. </p><p>  The room has normal furniture with good beds and mattresses.  The windows of the apartments can overlook the pool, the coast or the city.  When booking a room, you should definitely indicate what you want to receive.  Then, upon arrival, you will be lodged exactly where you wanted.  There are no problems with this. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is very good.  The same all-inclusive system works here.  Perhaps the buffet is not too sophisticated, but vacationers are satisfied with the food.  Meat dishes are prepared from lamb, beef and chicken.  Many different appetizers, salads, also offer potatoes and pasta.  Fruits are present, but their choice is not very large.  Most often served oranges and watermelons.  But the assortment of sweets is simply amazing.  Their palatability is particularly impressive. </p><p>  The pool at the hotel is small, but there is also a separate children's pool.  Tourists are advised to visit the massage parlor in the complex.  All the massage therapists working there are simply gorgeous.  Of course, you will have to pay for the sessions separately, but it's worth it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4 reviews" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has its own beach, it is a five-minute walk.  To get on it, you need to walk along the underpass so as not to cross the busy highway from above.  The hotel is located on the beach, and the road runs between its territory and the coast.  The beach itself is not very big, but sandy.  But in the water sometimes you come across pebbles.  There is a bar on the shore, but you have to pay for everything because it does not belong to this hotel. </p><p>  In season, there are a lot of vacationers on the coast, sometimes a bit crowded.  But this is not even a minus of the hotel, since in this area all hotels have similar beaches.  All of them are separated by breakwaters.  Apparently, this was originally planned territory during construction. </p><h2>  How to spend leisure time </h2><p>  In the evenings, the hotel sometimes has entertainment programs.  But most of the time the administration prefers to collect all the tourists who want and take them to a disco.  So those people who are looking for active nightly activities are satisfied.  In the evening, you can walk along the promenade along the sea and enjoy the beauty of the coast.  Five minutes from the hotel there is a small market where you can buy fruits and souvenirs.  There is a bus stop near the complex.  By transport, you can reach Alanya in ten or fifteen minutes.  And there really are an incredible amount of entertainment and attractions. </p><p>  The hotel always has guides from tour operators.  But the price of travel is not cheap.  Alternatively, you can book tours near the hotel.  There, any trip will cost you much cheaper. </p><p>  However, many tourists prefer to visit Alanya and its attractions on their own.  Since the traffic intersection is nearby, it is not difficult to get to the city center.  Alanya itself is not very large, and all the main attractions are not far from each other, which is very convenient.  But if you decide to recover in the mountains or ride a jeep, then here you can‚Äôt do without a guide.  Vacationers highly recommend boat trips, of which not only children but also adults are delighted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand bayar beach 4 turkey alanya" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1471526.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resting at the hotel in October, you definitely need to take time to the cultural program, this is a great chance to see the beauty of these places.  In the summer, due to the heat, many simply do not leave the beach.  And autumn is a great time for both relaxation and excursions. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  This hotel can be recommended for a budget holiday on the shore of Alanya for those tourists who do not have serious requirements for the infrastructure of the complex.  Here you can have a good rest, living almost on the seashore.  Given the ratio of "price-quality", a hotel can be a good option for an inexpensive vacation. </p>
