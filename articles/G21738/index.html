If a girl knows how to make a front and back loop, and also has perseverance and patience, she can safely get to work. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1771567.jpg" width="458"></div>  It is interesting that products without fasteners, but with two shelves, automatically turn into cardigans.  Creating such a model is an extremely simple process.  It is enough to make a large rectangle with slots instead of armholes, where then sew the sleeves.  Volumetric shelves are stacked in folds and turn into a beautiful drapery if plastic yarn and large knitting needles are chosen.

    <p>  Good material is bamboo and viscose.  If the canvas is hard, this effect cannot be achieved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting patterns for sweaters can contain several basic patterns: </p><ul><li>  Elementary solid ornaments. </li><li>  Openwork. </li><li>  Braids. </li><li>  Jacquard. </li><li>  Complex elements ("cones", combinations of various types of patterns). </li></ul><p>  For beginners, the best option is shawl or <span>hosiery knitting,</span> as well as patterns made up of front and back loops in different combinations. </p><p>  In this case, you can not be wiser with a complex cut and tie all the details with rectangular ones. </p><p>  Of course, the product will ‚Äúsit‚Äù on the figure better if you fit the details of the front and back, as well as knit neat armholes and neck.  The pattern of <span>knitting sweaters with knitting needles</span> for women also matters: braids and plaits are very decorated. </p><h2>  Long jacket with braids </h2><p>  The photo at the beginning of the article depicts a very successful and practical model. </p><p>  Knitting <span>patterns for sweaters for women</span> are good because they give room for creativity.  Considering the patterns of details, you can notice that they have the simplest contours of all possible: these are rectangles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern sweaters for women" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1771538.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  This product can be performed in two ways: </p><ul><li>  Tie back and shelves separately. </li><li>  Combine these three canvases into one. </li></ul><p>  If the second method is chosen, then the work starts from the bottom, gaining as many loops as required for the manufacture of all three parts.  Then they increase the fabric, focusing on the selected patterns of knitting sweaters. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for women" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1771537.jpg" width="500"></div>

To make the sleeve look better, cut a few loops, indicating armholes. </p><p>  Now the back and each shelf are knitted in turn.  After all the parts are ready, they are sewn along the shoulders with a <span>knitted seam.</span> </p><h2>  Sweatshirts </h2><p>  The drawing shows that the designer designed the detail of the sleeve, narrowed down and expanded from above.  This is optional but recommended. </p><p>  You can give this part the shape of a rectangle, but you should be prepared for the consequences: </p><ul><li>  The width of the sleeve will be equal to the girth of the hand in the widest place, plus ten centimeters for a loose fit. </li><li>  The cuffs will be pretty loose. </li><li>  Over time, the sleeves can stretch out and become shapeless. </li></ul><p>  The knitting pattern for <span>sweaters for women</span> often includes ornaments for the back and shelves, and the sleeves are made in some simple pattern.  In this case, it is stocking.  The first rows are tied with a shawl pattern so that the cuffs do not twist. </p><h2>  Assembly of parts and knitting straps </h2><p>  Finished sleeves should be sewn along the edges and then attached to the main parts. </p><p>  The bar can be made in several ways: </p><ul><li>  At the same time as knitting shelves. </li><li>  At the last stage of work. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, at least ten loops are taken to the bar and in each row they are knit with their faces. </p><p>  When choosing the second method, around the edge of the finished and stitched sweaters, they gather loops and knit several rows with a garter pattern.  Then all the loops of this long row are not tightly closed. </p><p>  There is another way to knit a bar: make a wide crochet. </p><p>  Knitters should remember that on one side of the sweater there should be button loops.  However, if another type of fastener (buttons or sewing clips) is selected, this refinement is irrelevant. </p><h2>  Summer model - knitting pattern sweaters for girls </h2><p>  The following photo shows an excellent version of a children's product.  If you use cotton yarn to create such a sweater, it will be indispensable throughout all seasons. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweaters with patterns" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1771565.jpg" width="458"></div><br>  The drawing shows the dimensions of an adult product.  To turn a blouse into a nursery, you need to take measurements from the child and adjust the pattern.  It is important to keep the proportions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sweatshirts for girls" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1771535.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Many knitting patterns for sweaters that contain such an element as a yoke are raglan. </p><p>  What you should know about such models: </p><ol><li>  The neckline is the first row of the canvas.  In this case, the rows will not be circular, but direct and returnable. </li><li>  At four points, loop additions are performed.  Four loops are marked with markers, and new elements are added before and after the marked ones.  Thus, in each odd row, the fabric increases by eight loops. </li><li>  The yoke is usually knitted with a pattern that differs from the main one.  Knitting patterns for sweaters attached to this article contain all the necessary ornaments.  For the upper part of the product, it is worth choosing scheme A.1.  Then switch to stocking. </li><li>  After the raglan line is equal to the distance from the neck to the armpit, the canvases are divided into three parts: two sleeves separately and a back with shelves.  They are knitted in turn around. </li><li>  In order for the model to be flared, additions should be made at two points on the sides (in those places where the side seams are usually located).  The operation procedure is shown in diagram A.2. </li></ol><p>  To complete all the paintings, you should knit a few centimeters with a shawl pattern. </p><p>  The methods for performing the bar are described above.  They are quite appropriate for this model. </p><p>  After completing the work, you should wash the finished product in warm (not hot) water and dry it unfolded. </p><p>  In general, knitting patterns for sweaters for women are not difficult and can be done by a skilled worker with any needlework experience. </p>
