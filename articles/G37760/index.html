Giza - a city near which there is a complex of pyramids, tombs of the pharaohs, has extraordinary energy.  To everyone who has been there, the amazing ancient secrets of this civilization are revealed. </p><h2>  Country of houses for the dead </h2><p>  The rich and interesting history of Egypt.  According to legend, from the beginning of the creation of the world, the gods ruled this land.  Several generations passed before they brought people out of savagery and transferred them full power.  Menes became the first king of the earth.  The myth about him entered the Greek and much later Roman historical tradition.  Menes is mentioned by Diodorus, Manetho, Herodotus and others. </p><p>  He combined Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the city of Memphis.  It was on this territory that the first houses for life after death were found - the pyramids.  There are about 118 of them in the country, most of them in the city of Giza, Egypt.  Photos of the most famous can be seen in the material. </p>

    <p>  According to the theory of some scientists, pyramids are associated with grain, because, folded in a heap, it has a similar shape.  Others are sure: this is a pie form that was used in mourning rites.  Usually the tombs buried the dead and all that they would need for extraterrestrial life.  But constructions in this territory were created according to other standards.  They surprise with the accuracy of architectural proportions, the speed of construction and raise hundreds of questions regarding their purpose.  Researchers are still looking for answers to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The city under the pyramids </h2><p>  The third most populous country is the city of Giza in Egypt.

    <p>  At a distance of about 25 km from Cairo or 8 km into the desert from Giza, there are architectural structures of the XXVI-XXIII centuries BC.  e. </p><p>  For a long time the city was a small village, but in the twentieth century.  began to grow sharply.  The reason for this was tourists, historians, art lovers who considered it their duty to visit Egypt.  Giza was the northern cemetery of Memphis, a city that at one time played the role of the capital of ancient civilization.  Now it stands El Badrashan. </p><p>  Giza gained popularity among the inhabitants of the country during the construction of the pyramids of the IV dynasty of rulers.  It is worth noting that representatives of previous births are also buried in these places. </p><h2>  Desert pearl </h2><p>  One of the <span>seven wonders of the world</span> is the Pyramid of Cheops.  Until now, historians cannot answer the question of how and why such a building was built.  Interestingly, even in the 21st century, the geniuses of modern construction cannot achieve the ideal geometric proportions of this tomb.  Not only the supporters of ancient architecture, but also people who believe in <span>extraterrestrial life,</span> come to Egypt.  Giza and its pyramids are fraught with many secrets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The customer was King Hufu, better known as Cheops.  The second name appeared and popularized thanks to the works of ancient Greek thinkers. </p><p>  There is a legend that the ruler was a cruel tyrant and suffered from <span>delusions of grandeur.</span>  However, neither treasures nor Pharaoh himself were found in the tomb.  The architect is considered the nephew of the king, the architect Hemiun.  According to the documents, the construction lasted 25 years. </p><p>  There are versions that the Great Pyramid was not designed by people, but by aliens from Sirius.  There is also a claim that this is the creation of the Atlanteans.  No less interesting is the option that the ancient civilization set a miracle, to the level of which contemporaries have not yet grown. </p><h2>  Riddle top </h2><p>  The height of the first pyramid at first reached 146.60 meters.  But Cheops is not the only one who was built on the territory of the Giza plateau.  <span>Ancient Egypt</span> also boasts a similar miracle. </p><p>  A copy was built by the successor of Khufu, King Chefren.  Researchers still do not know exactly who he was his predecessor - his son or brother. </p><p>  This pyramid was built 40 years later than the first, tentatively in the middle of the XXVI century BC.  e.  Its height is 143.9 meters, but due to the fact that the structure is located on a high hill and the walls have a steep slope, visually it looks bigger. </p><p>  Like the tomb of Cheops, it consists of chambers into which narrow corridors lead. </p><p>  It is still in excellent condition, although, like the first structure, it has slightly reduced its size and height.  Now it is 136.4 m up and 210.5 m √ó 210.5 m at the base (started from 215.3 √ó 215.3 m). </p><p>  Three tombs were once decorated with pyramidal stones that complement the ensemble.  Unfortunately, they all disappeared in the stream of time.  Historians do not know what they were made of, what characters they applied.  The only source of information about this part of the tomb is the top of Chefren.  Although the pyramid itself is absent, there were mounts on which the stone was placed.  This helped restore the design to its original form. </p>

    <h2>  Tomb guard </h2><p>  The largest statue on earth is the Great Sphinx in Giza.  Egypt saw in him a symbol of the power of the ruler.  It is carved from solid stone, the length of the lion's body is 73 m, and its height is 20 m. The monument is located opposite the second building.  It is believed that initially it was the head of a lion, and only then some pharaoh gave her the appearance of Chephren. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the statue did not retain the first appearance.  There are many versions of relic damage.  One of them was hit by the core of Napoleonic troops.  Another option is the devout Arabs who inhabited the land of sand, used the Sphinx as a target for cannons.  This was due to the fact that their religion forbids portraying a human face. </p><h2>  Curse of the tomb </h2><p>  Traveling through the ancient world, you will see the three greatest pyramids of Giza.  Egypt put an end to the era of grand tombs with the construction of the <span>Pyramid of Mycerinus.</span>  This building holds the titles of the smallest, lowest and latest of the three.  It makes up only a tenth of Cheops.  Located 200 meters from Chefren.  Height - 66 m. The construction was completed in 2505 BC.  e.  The form and style were so different from the first two that the ancient Greeks set a new time frame for the structure - about 550 BC.  e. </p>

Also, customer Mikerin did not shine with patience.  In order to speed up the process, the stones were not processed according to the system of predecessors.  Nevertheless, the ruler did not succeed in reaching the final of the construction.

    <p>  In 1837, the British Howard Vance opened the tomb.  He found a sarcophagus and a lid in the shape of a human figure.  They tried to transport the treasure to England by ship.  But during the storm, the ship sank along with the find.  Since then, there is a legend about the curse. </p><h2>  Another course </h2><p>  In addition to general tourist routes, you can visit less popular, but equally mysterious places.  For example, it will be interesting to see the tombs of the <span>wives of the pharaohs,</span> priests and officials of that time. </p>

He will tell about the legends that lived in Ancient Egypt.  Giza has at its disposal the necropolis of Saqqara.  There are 11 structures, mainly of the VI dynasty, although earlier structures are also found.  Against the general background stands the <span>step pyramid of</span> Djoser.  It consists of 11 funeral rooms where family members were buried.
