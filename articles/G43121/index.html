    <p>  <span>The Argazinskoe reservoir</span> is popularly called simply the lake of Argazi.  It is the largest body of water in the Chelyabinsk region.  The city replenishes fresh water from this particular source.  On the shores of the lake there are a lot of <span>pensions, resorts,</span> tourist centers.  The reservoir itself was built in 1946, during the construction of the Argazinskaya hydroelectric station.  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBayramgulovo village there is a dam on <span>the Miass River.</span>  It is worth noting that the name of the reservoir came from Argazi, this lake was flooded during the construction of the hydroelectric station. </p><h2>  Argazi nature </h2>

    <p>  The coastline of the lake has large fluctuations that reach six meters, it can be called poorly defined, because it is constantly changing.  To a greater extent this applies to the eastern shores of the lake.  From all sides the lake is surrounded by hills, and from the west - by the most beautiful spurs of the Ilmensky mountains.  The shores are very diverse: wooded and bare, gentle and hilly.  The edge of the coast is dotted with many bays, wetlands, where the aquatic vegetation that dominates Argazi is rampant with colors.  The lake has a sandy, rocky or muddy bottom, there are many flooded islands.  Its depth in some places reaches eighteen meters, the average is about twelve meters.  The mountains and hills around the lake are covered with deciduous and coniferous forests.  Where the river leaves the reservoir, a dam is installed, the length of which is 1500 meters.  The whole territory is strewn with many islands, their total number reaches 45. Everyone who is looking for a recreation center on Lake Argazi will easily find a comfortable place for themselves here.  Peace, silence, complete reunion with nature - all this can be found in these parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We go fishing </h2><p>  The most common, although not the only vacation on Lake Argazi is, of course, fishing.  The season for fishermen is year-round.  For those who relax in the summer, for fishing it is best to rent or buy a boat.  Some nature lovers prefer to sit on the shore with a fishing rod, but to go on a real fishing trip, get a rich catch, it is better to use a boat.  If you came to Argazi in the winter, it is better to go fishing in the "Buran" for fishing.  Going on it on a journey and taking into account the nature of the lake, you need to be extremely careful.  Since the water level here is constantly changing, ravines, faults or cracks often form on the surface, movement can be dangerous.  If you arrived just for the sake of fishing, then this event will definitely surprise you and please you.  The lake offers many fishing options and methods. </p><h2>  What fish is found in Argazi? </h2>

    <p>  All true fishermen strive to get to Argazi.  The lake is famous for a variety of fish species.  Here you can catch perch, chebak, pike, ide, burbot, ruff, zander.  It should be noted that recently the lake has been actively stocking.  Particular attention is paid to burbot and whitefish.  In 2007, forty million whitefish and ripus larvae were launched, as well as ten million burbot larvae.  Currently, the lake is considered the main and largest ripus base.  Thanks to the latest incubation technologies, fish farmers annually collect more than tens of millions of <span>whitefish</span> and ripus <span>caviar</span> .  Those who come to the lake in the summer have the opportunity to catch large specimens of burbot, the weight of which can reach twelve kilograms.  Good catch of zander or pike.  However, it is worth noting that the zander population on Lake Argazi has declined significantly in recent years, it can not be found in all places.  Some lucky fishermen manage to catch carp, its population here is small, top-dressing is good, so it very rarely goes for fishing.  Single instances of carp can weigh twelve kilograms.  At the end of the 20th century (in 1998), sturgeon was launched in Argazi.  Very rarely, but some instances come across now.  The Kealim River flows into the lake, it is along it that the <span>brook trout</span> gets here, there is a chance to meet <span>rainbow trout,</span> which can weigh three kilograms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2>
