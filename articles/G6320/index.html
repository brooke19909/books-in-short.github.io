    <h2>  Peach Hill Resort 4 *: general description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Phuket has beautiful hotels scattered over the hills with stunning views of the jungle and the sea.  Most of them are a complex of villas and bungalows with a small private garden.  This arrangement allows tourists to feel in seclusion, even in a completely filled hotel.  Peach Hill Resort also looks similar, with a picturesque view of the island's surroundings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel complex, which will be discussed today, is far from new - it opened in 1997, but has since been constantly refurbished and refurbished.  At the moment it consists of three parts: two buildings and a complex of villas.  The last few years were rebuilt from a bungalow, and now they are luxurious Thai-style jacuzzi houses decorated with precious woods.  The first building - Peach Wing - was commissioned after repair in 2001, the second - White Peach Wing - in 2009. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is fifteen thousand square meters, which houses residential buildings, restaurants, swimming pools and beautiful gardens, where numerous animals and insects live.  Guests at the Peach Hill Hotel Resort can accommodate in two hundred and sixty-two rooms of various categories. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The hotel complex Peach Hill <span>Hotel Resort 4 *</span> is located on the slope of a rather high hill.  On the one hand, this provides guests with an excellent view of the rooms and gives the hotel some special charm.  But on the other, it makes you climb fairly steep stairs several times a day, which is quite difficult for people aged and young children to do.  And it‚Äôs hard for ordinary people to quickly adapt to such a load. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second line from the beach, which is quite natural for Phuket.  Most of the hotel complexes on the island do not have their own beach area, so you have to get to the sea on foot or in a special shuttle.  Peach Hill Hotel Resort is located about two hundred meters from the beach, which is easily overcome in five to ten minutes.  Interestingly, the hotel is built at the junction of the two best beaches in Phuket.  Therefore, tourists can relax on each of them in turn.  If you prefer the noisy and youthful Patong beach with an abundance of nightlife, you can reach it by breaking fifteen kilometers on a rented motorbike or tuk-tuk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Please note that approximately fifty-six kilometers are required from the airport to the Peach Hill Resort.  For Phuket, this is not much, because the airport is located at some distance from the main tourist centers.  In addition, most hotels provide a shuttle service for a fee, which eliminates the need for an urgent matter after arrival to look for a taxi or get to the city by public transport. </p>

    <h2>  Service at the hotel complex </h2><p>  Most vacationers primarily note the excellent speed of Wi-Fi, which is free and catches throughout the hotel.  Upon check-in, guests are given a username and password, they must be entered every time you enter the Internet.  Many tourists noted that every three hours you are thrown out of the system, so you must re-enter by entering the login. </p><p>  Peach Hill Resort (Kata) has developed a flexible compliment system from the hotel.  They go to the following categories of guests: </p><ul><li>  newlyweds; </li><li>  birthday people; </li><li>  those celebrating the wedding anniversary; </li><li>  regular visitors to the hotel complex. </li></ul><p>  In addition, each guest receives a welcome drink and a bouquet of flowers before checking in, which is very pleasant after a hard flight and a long journey. </p><p>  Most vacationers at Peach Hill Resort 4 * (Phuket) note that the staff at the hotel is quite helpful, and the maids clean the rooms very high quality.  Tea and coffee making facilities and a toilet set are replenished daily.  At each cleaning, the bed is changed and towels are changed.  Some tourists write in their reviews that they noticed dirt on the floor after cleaning the room, but it turned out that the maids had to be warned in advance about the need to clean the floor.  Otherwise, they will limit themselves to wiping out dust, arranging things, making the bed and sweeping the floor. </p><p>  If you relax by the pool, then sunbeds and umbrellas will be free for you.  If you wish, you can take a beach towel, take it with you to the sea or lay on a lounger by the pool. </p><p>  When booking a room, you must indicate the need for a transfer to and from the hotel.

    <h2>  Peach Hill Resort 4: reviews </h2><p>  If you want to know whether to go to the hotel described by us, then you should carefully study the reviews of those who have already rested here.  On the Internet, such comments are posted in large numbers, so we tried to analyze most of them in order to form an opinion on the hotel complex, as close as possible to reality. </p><p>  Of course, not without negative reviews.  After all, people have different addictions and habits, which is why they evaluate the environment completely differently.  Some guests find the food quite monotonous, and accommodation on the mountain is very uncomfortable.  Others do not like the abundance of living creatures in the hotel (and this is natural, if you remember that the hotel is practically in the jungle).  But the third people remember with an unkind word the staff who did not always respond to their requests with due speed and quickness. </p><p>  Mosquitoes are particularly displeasing for guests.  During the day, they hide in dense greenery, but at night they haunt absolutely none of the tourists.  Most of them are near the villas, because they are located farthest from the city streets.  This annoying nuisance does not allow spending evenings on the balcony with a cup of aromatic coffee or tea.  However, especially savvy guests quickly find a way out of this situation - they buy a fumigator and insect plates, which are installed on the balcony.  In this case, it becomes possible to calmly enjoy the night Phuket. </p><p> We cannot say that all of the above is fiction and nit-picking.  Nevertheless, positive reviews about staying at the hotel are much more than negative. </p><p>  Many guests noted how well the staff monitors the hotel.  Everything is repaired, clean, and even water samples are taken from the pools.  This is repeated regularly and inspires confidence that you are in a great place where everyone cares about your well-being and health. </p><p>  More than once in the reviews, tourists talked about how they were absolutely free to change their booked rooms to rooms of a class above.  Moreover, this happened even without any requests. </p><p>  Upon arrival, guests are transported in a small shuttle throughout the hotel and shown the most beautiful places.  Thus, you can navigate the location of the pools and restaurants. </p><p>  The hotel guests also considered the transfer to the beach, which has an interval of one hour, to be very convenient.  Indeed, many can reach the sea on their own, but far from every vacationer can reach the steep hill. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is very convenient for those who like to wander through the streets of the city on foot.  In close proximity are small shops with a mass of goods necessary for life, shopping centers and restaurants.  Most of the hotel guests emphasized that they had dinner at various cafes almost every day and were always pleased with the food and service. </p><p>  Many appreciated the beach bags, umbrellas and mats that are in each room.  Thanks to this, it is convenient for tourists to pack on the beach and leave the hotel if there is a sudden tropical rainfall outside the window (and this happens in Phuket very often). </p><p>  A pleasant surprise for our compatriots was the ability of the staff to communicate in Russian.  For Thai hotels this is a big luxury, so for a certain category of travelers this fact may be decisive when choosing a hotel. </p><p>  Of course, Peach Hill Resort can not claim to be a five-star hotel, but it copes pretty well, being the "four".  Here you can relax, plunging into the indescribable atmosphere of Phuket.  In addition, a pleasant advantage of such a vacation would be its low cost.  If these are important points for you, then feel free to book a hotel for the coming dates and go on your Thai voyage towards adventures. </p>
