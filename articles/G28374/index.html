This question was asked by so many people.  At this stage in the development of engineering and technology, it is difficult to say exactly what is best and what is not.  This is due to the fact that each company has its own "trump card", that is, a difference from competitors, which allows you to stand out from the total mass of this particular camera.  To be honest, we can say that people asking the question of what kind of a good camera to buy can themselves answer it.  You can ask any professional photographer: "Recommend a good camera."  And the first thing he will do is ask what the person plans to do with the camera? </p>

    <p>  Without exaggeration, we can say that the <span>best camera</span> is the one with which you will shoot everywhere and always and use it specifically for your needs.  It sounds corny, but still it is the purest truth.  People are divided into 2 categories: those who want to click on the buttons without hesitation, and those who care about the shooting process.  <span>The</span> first 2 steps of cameras are perfect for the <span>first people</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what good camera to buy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13618/126167.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The very first step will be the CTF, or a soap dish, as it is popularly called.  The simplest, most compact and convenient camera that fits in your pocket.  It can be worn everywhere and always.  Price ranges from 80 to 400 dollars, depending on the brand or configuration.  Purely formal, we can say that the question of which good camera to buy is inappropriate here in principle.  DSCs are designed in such a way that a person directs and takes pictures.  Minimum settings, large buttons and screen.  This is very convenient for those who do not find fault with the quality of the photo, and for those who do not want to part with the camera for even a second. </p><p>  The second bar is the so-called compacts of the advanced class.  These are all the same CTFs, but with the best technological stuffing.  Usually they are offered to those who renounce simple soap dishes.  You can judge purely logically: if you ask the seller in the store about what a good camera to buy, and he pulls out a beautiful model that looks like a professional, then this will definitely intrigue the buyer.  Such DSCs rely on appearance.  Of the differences from the previous class, they observe: </p><p>  1. Practical similarity with the lower class CZK. </p><p>  2. The completeness of the settings, including manual ones. </p><p>  3. More advanced optics, which allows you to take high-quality pictures. </p><p>  If this does not suit the buyer, then the question of which good camera to buy, the seller can only get from the counter ZZK, or a digital SLR camera.  In common people they are called DSLRs. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="advise a good camera" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13618/130232.jpg" width="455"></div><br>  These are completely professional cameras, which bypass many times simple soap dishes and advanced digital telephony centers in terms of image quality and number of functions.  The problem is that they are expensive.  But, if you have money and you intend to spend it, then the SLR is your choice.  Each such camera has an interchangeable lens, and this gives almost unlimited scope for creativity.  All Nikon cameras can be considered really good SLRs, starting with the D200 models and ending with the D1-D2 models.  At Canon, the D80 is considered to be good.  Sony will have good and inexpensive models of the Alpha series.
