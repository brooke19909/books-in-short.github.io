Against the background of smartphones, it is difficult for them to maintain their position in the gadget market, since they lose to them in many respects. </p><p>  Although it cannot be said that push-button phones have forever lost their significance.  They still remain in demand in some categories: business people as a spare ‚Äúdialer‚Äù;  among older people who find it difficult to cope with the complexity of ‚Äúabstruse‚Äù smartphones, and also they are bought by small schoolchildren, since such phones are cheap and they are not a pity in case of loss. </p><p>  In this article, we will talk about one of such mobile phones - Ginzzu r12d, which can be purchased at mobile phone stores. </p>

    <p>  The model was replaced in 2015 by its predecessor Ginzzu r11D.  Like all Chinese-made mobile devices, the Ginzzu r12d mobile gadget has very affordable prices, so it is available to every category of citizens.  You can buy a phone at a price of 2300 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance of the device and description of parameters </h2><p>  So, where to start the review of Ginzzu r12d?  Naturally, with its appearance. </p><p>  The mobile phone is a one-piece monoblock, that is, there are no retractable or folding parts in it.  The body color is performed in three versions: classic black, playful red and restrained white.  The Chinese do not waste money on expensive materials for making the case, so the ‚ÄúDzintzu‚Äù is made of the notorious plastic, which, however, is able to withstand some ‚Äúblows of fate‚Äù. </p><p>  The parameters of the Jinzu mobile phone are almost standard: </p><ul><li>  length - 122 mm; </li><li>  width - 58 mm; </li><li>  thickness - 13 mm; </li><li>  volume - 92.82 cm <sup>3</sup> . </li></ul><p>  The phone is not only small (compared to modern huge smartphones), but also light.  Its weight is only 84 g, so it is almost not felt in the hand, and especially in the pocket. </p>

    <p>  The device‚Äôs keyboard is large, which is especially appreciated by older people whose vision deteriorates with age.  In addition, the keys are highlighted in the dark.  On the side is the volume control key.  On the back cover, in addition to the camera window, there is <span>an emergency call</span> button or SOS button, which, if necessary, will make an instant connection with emergency services.  This feature is very appreciated by older people who live alone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  When unpacking the device, first of all, its equipment is checked, that is, the number and availability of necessary additions.  Set "Dzintzu r12d" is not rich in devices: </p><ul><li>  Charger; </li><li>  USB2.0 cable </li><li>  mobile phone instruction manual; </li><li>  dock station; </li><li>  battery; </li><li>  and, in fact, the phone itself. </li></ul><p>  Some customers are missing out on a set of headphones and a memory card.  But they can be purchased separately for a small amount. </p>

    <h2>  SIM card and making calls </h2><p>  Only 1 standard-sized SIM card is inserted into the Ginzzu r12d phone.  Perhaps this is all that can be said about SIM cards. </p><p>  What about the process of making calls?  First things first: </p><ol><li>  You can put both standard polyphonic ringtone and your favorite MP3 music on incoming calls.  Yes, this simple "dialer" is able to make a different sound. </li><li>  Vibration.  Vibration mode can be set both in addition to the sound alert of an incoming call, and as an independent alert in silent mode.  But, according to customer reviews, the phone‚Äôs vibration is weak, it is almost imperceptible. </li><li>  Talk on the speakerphone.  During a conversation, the Ginzzu r12d user can set the speakerphone mode with a single key press.  With this function, you can leave the phone on the table, and do your own business without stopping the conversation. </li><li>  Ability to set speed dial.  In the phone settings, for each key, you can set one number from the phone book.  And then, in order not to rummage through the contacts and not waste time searching, you can just click on a specific number and then the call will go to the specified contact. </li><li>  The ability to transfer phone numbers from the phone‚Äôs memory to a SIM card and vice versa. </li></ol><h2>  Ginzzu r12d: processor </h2><p>  The brain of a mobile device is its processor.  It controls all the work of the phone programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Jinzu processor has only 1 core.  This is a rather low indicator for phones, since both the power of the phone and its power consumption depend on the number of cores. </p><p>  But this figure is significant for smartphones, and not so much for a regular push-button, because a large number of programs are not included in the ‚ÄúDzintz‚Äù. </p><p>  The clock frequency of the Ginzzu r12d is 312 MHz.  This indicator also affects the power of the mobile phone.  The higher the clock frequency, the more operations the phone is capable of performing. </p><p>  These two characteristics of the processor of a simple phone, despite their low performance, are standard for plain mobile. </p><h2>  Camera phone </h2><p>  A simple and <span>budget phone</span> is equipped with a camera to match the device itself. </p><p>  The Ginzzu r12d camera has only 0.1 megapixels, which is currently negligible. </p><p>  Allowable photo resolution is 422 x 237 pixels.  These parameters determine the number of points (Mp) vertically (422) and horizontally (237). </p><p>  It is possible to change some parameters in the camera settings, but only manually.  For example, the level of necessary lighting for the best shooting result, and you can also set the contrast of the future picture. </p><p>  In addition, there are a couple more photo settings in the phone, which are considered not basic, but additional.  These include the "Portrait" and "Landscape" modes.  That is, depending on what the owner of the ‚ÄúDjintsu‚Äù intends to shoot - a portrait or a landscape - he must set the desired mode in advance, which will contribute to better focusing on a specific object. </p><p>  In general, reviews about the Ginzzu r12d, more precisely about its camera, do not describe this feature of the mobile phone very much, since the quality of photos and the number of additional modes are negligible. </p>

    <h2>  Additional memory </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the phone seems to be simple, it still has a built-in slot for a memory card, which is designed to increase the internal dimensions of the phone.  The slot is designed for micro-SD cards.  But still Ginzzu r12d is not "omnipotent."  The maximum capacity of the memory card that this phone allows is only 4 GB.  In principle, this amount is quite enough for a mobile phone whose capabilities are limited. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the kit does not include additional memory in the Ginzzu r12d. </p><h2>  Phone menu </h2><p>  Ginzzu r12d, the menu description of which is worth considering in detail, is very easy to manage.  So, what is in it: </p><ol><li>  Phone book. </li><li>  Messages </li><li>  Call log </li><li>  Magnifier. </li><li>  Organizer </li><li>  Multimedia. </li><li>  Setting. </li></ol><p>  Understanding the use of the mobile phone will not be difficult, since the menu is simplified. </p><p>  An interesting feature in the phone is "Magnifier", with which you can increase the size of the menu icons and read text.  Magnifier interacts with the camera. </p><p>  The phone book holds 300 contacts in the phone memory.  If necessary, you can transfer numbers to a SIM card. </p><p>  The device has a service for sending short text messages (SMS), and it is also possible to transmit images or short audio messages (MMS). </p><p>  In the "Call Log" you can view recently dialed and received phone numbers. </p><p>  An important addition is the "Organizer", which contains important devices for everyday life: </p><ul><li>  alarm clock; </li><li>  calculator; </li><li>  the calendar. </li></ul><p>  Viewing multimedia files is also available in such a seemingly simple device.  The screen displays graphic images, photos, videos. </p><p>  The "Settings" menu is nothing more than the settings of a mobile device.  Language selection, sound setting, date and time settings and other settings. </p><h2>  Ginzzu r12d screen </h2><p>  The display of the ‚ÄúDjintzu‚Äù is small, but it is enough to display all the necessary information.  Although the reviews of some users are dissatisfied with the modest parameters of the device, because not all menu icons are displayed at a time. </p><p>  It is worth considering the screen characteristics of the Ginzzu r12d in more detail: </p><ul><li>  diagonal - 2.2 inches (compare modern smartphones, whose diagonal reaches 5.5 inches); </li><li>  matrix for the phone - TFT; </li><li>  color depth - 16 bits or 65536 colors. </li></ul><p>  The screen is bright, all menu icons, numbers and names are clearly displayed on it.  Very convenient, according to buyers. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the Ginzzu r12d, like all phones, is the battery that supplies power to the mobile device.  What are the characteristics of this most important ‚Äúdetail‚Äù of the mobile phone: </p><ul><li>  capacity is 1050 mAh; </li><li>  variety - Li-Ion (lithium-ion); </li><li>  the battery is removable, comes with a mobile phone; </li><li>  Ginzzu r12d battery can be charged from USB; </li><li>  in GSM networks, the talk time is 4 hours; </li><li>  in GSM networks, the waiting time is 240 hours (this property is useful for those who use the "Dzintzu" as an additional phone, which is rarely used). </li></ul><h2>  How is the Ginzzu r12d managed? </h2><p>  A push-button telephone provides push-button control.  Ginzzu r12d has on its front side a keypad made of high-quality plastic.  Digital dialing is carried out using large buttons, which, in addition, are highlighted in the dark.  Switching the menu, flipping contacts occurs using two buttons with the image of arrows located at the top of the button panel.  The Off key is also the reject call key. </p><p>  All the menus in the Jinzu phone are completely in Russian (Russified), but if necessary, the language can be changed to any other. </p><p>  On the back cover of the mobile phone there is also a button - SOS. </p><h2>  Additional Chips </h2><p>  Of course, Ginzzu r12d is a mobile phone without frills, but nevertheless it has some pleasant additions. </p><ol><li>  There is a built-in flashlight in the Ginzzu r12d.  It is located on the lower edge of the mobile phone, and to turn it on, you need to go to the menu.  The flashlight is not very powerful, but in some life situations it is quite capable of helping out. </li><li>  Flight mode.  A very convenient feature for those who often fly.  It is enough to transfer the phone to airplane mode and access to voice and text messages, calls will be blocked.  At the same time, you do not need to turn off the mobile phone itself. </li><li>  SOS key with the ability to set any phone number.  When you click on this button, a call will be automatically made either to the emergency number or to the number of one of the relatives. </li><li>  Games that work for free and do not require an Internet connection. </li><li>  Communication with a computer.  The included USB cable allows you to easily connect your phone to a computer for file sharing. </li><li>  PIM Organizer is a device that allows you to work with documents: open them on the phone, read, print, and convert voice dialing to text. </li><li>  Wireless and fast Bluetooth data sharing method. </li><li>  The presence of FM radio.  The built-in radio is capable of picking up a signal at frequencies of 87.5 - 108 MHz.  For listening, it is not necessary to use headphones as an alarm device. </li></ol>

What can I say about this about the Ginzzu r12d? </p><ol><li>  A USB connector is built into the device, a cord is included. </li><li>  A type of connector corresponds to the type of micro-USB (7 by 2 mm). </li><li>  The standard is 2.0. </li></ol><p>  Using this method of connecting a mobile phone to a computer, you can transfer graphic, audio, documentary information. </p><h2>  Comparison of Ginzzu r12d and Ginzzu r11d </h2><p>  This is not to say that the Ginzzu r12d is the new model that replaced the Ginzzu r11d, since the two devices appeared in 2015.  But 12d is a more advanced device, slightly different from 11d.  But what are the differences? </p><ol><li>  Price - 12d for several hundred rubles more expensive than 11d. </li><li>  The weight of the "Dzintz 12d" is 84 g, and 11d - 77 g. </li><li>  In the improved model there is a color variety.  If the first model (11d) is available only in a black case, then the updated version is available in three versions: white, black and red. </li><li>  The "Dzintz r11d" has a built-in memory of 16 MB, but it does not have a slot for an additional memory card.  In its updated analogue, on the contrary, there is no internal memory, but it is possible to use a memory card. </li><li>  11d battery capacity is less than 12d (950 and 1050 mAh). </li><li>  Ginzzu r12d manufacturers have increased the size of the display.  Its diagonal is 2.2 inches, while the 11d - 1.77. </li><li>  As for the shooting modes, the updated device has the ‚ÄúPortrait‚Äù and ‚ÄúLandscape‚Äù modes, which cannot be found in the more primitive ‚ÄúDzintz‚Äù. </li><li>  In 12d there is a voice recorder and voice dialing, as well as an additional supported audio format - WAV. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the differences are insignificant, but these innovations have a tangible impact on the cost of the Jintsu mobile phone. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  How are buyers talking about this device?  Reviews for the Ginzzu r12d are mostly positive.  And in fact: the phone meets almost all the requirements of a regular ‚Äúdialer‚Äù and justifies its budget price with dignity. </p><p>  So, customers say that the ‚ÄúDzintzu r12d‚Äù has a decent design, simple, but at the same time convenient.  Large keys, a bright screen, a lightweight gadget that makes it nice to make calls.  Also, users of the device like the fact that the mobile phone is charging on a special base-stand, which is very convenient and does not allow you to forget that the phone is charging. </p><p>  Some reviews of the Ginzzu r12d indicate product flaws.  For example, most people complain that the call is very quiet and it can be difficult to hear it on the street or in transport.  In addition, many do not like the vibration of the Ginzzu r12d phone.  They say that it is practically not noticeable in a bag or pocket of outerwear.  Another disadvantage is that on the back cover is an emergency call button, which is easily activated when accidentally touched.  More reviews of Ginzzu r12d speak of an inconvenient menu, or rather, its excessive simplicity.  And besides this, not all menu icons fit on the screen. </p><p>  And the price.  It would seem quite affordable price, varying in the range from 2300 to 2600 rubles.  But even this indicator has become a "stumbling block" among users of the "Dzinsu".  Someone thinks that the price is the most affordable and affordable.  But in another opinion, the cost of the device is still overpriced.  To this conclusion, buyers come by comparing with similar mobile devices, but from other manufacturers.  They believe that at 2300 rubles there are not enough additional devices in the phone and a small number of camera pixels. </p><p>  Still, the Ginzzu r12d is a good phone, and the reviews are mostly positive. </p><p>  Well, what else can you expect from a simple ‚ÄúDzintsu‚Äù?  The phone carries out its simple tasks to a solid "5", but what else is needed for those who do not like "bells and whistles"? </p><h2>  Should I buy a Ginzzu r12d? </h2>

    <p>  Ginzzu r12d, a review of which was presented in this article, still deserves attention and can be taken as a simple device for calls.  There is no reason to expect anything more from him, however, like from most push-button cell phones. </p><p>  Many may be confused by the "untwisted" name of the Chinese company.  But in the case of buying a regular, budget phone, there is no risk, and the ‚ÄúDzintzu‚Äù will not disappoint you. </p><p> It is especially worthwhile to buy this phone for your loved ones, for whom you are constantly worried: elderly parents or grandparents.  Teach them to use ‚ÄúDzintz‚Äù (which is not so difficult), and they will always be in touch, and in an emergency they will be able to call the necessary services on their own. </p>
