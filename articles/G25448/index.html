One of these attractions is Lake Ohrid.  Macedonia is famous for this pond, since it is considered the oldest of all located in the Republic.  This reservoir is very picturesque.  That is why every year tourists come to the lake, as if to sea resorts.  Most often here you can meet Macedonian and German vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ohrid Lake" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1087221.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Ohrid Lake (photos are presented in the article) is the deepest body of water in the Balkans.  The surrounding landscape is complemented by majestic mountains having a height of about two thousand meters.  Also rich is its aquatic ecosystem, in which there are more than 200 endemic species.  Many of them are important for the global ecological system.  In 1980, the city of Ohrid and its lake were included in the <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> List. </p><p>  Lake Ohrid is the deepest in Macedonia.  The average depth of the reservoir is 155 meters, while the maximum is 288 meters.  The water is very clean and can be seen to a depth of 22 m. Sailing on a boat, you can watch how beautiful and nimble fish swim below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is 358 km¬≤, and the length of its coastline is 87.53 km.  In length, it spreads over 30.4 km, and the width of the reservoir is 14.8 km. </p><p>  Interestingly, the lake is divided into two states.  One part belongs to the Republic of Macedonia, and 1/3 of its coast is in the possession of Albania. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ohrid Lake Macedonia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1087223.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hydrology of the lake </h2><p>  The city of Ohrid is proud of its heritage, since this basin was formed about five million years ago, which puts it on a par with such famous lakes as Lake Baikal and Tanganyika.  Another interesting fact is that the total catchment area is 2600 km <sup>2</sup> .  The water supply of the reservoir is 25% rainfall and rivers.  Also part of the water comes from the nearby Prespa Lake.  It is located 150 meters higher, located 10 km from Lake Ohrid.  In Presp, water is collected from karst underground sources.  50% of Lake Ohrid is fed from underground springs and sources. </p><p>  The water leaves the reservoir by evaporation, as well as through <span>the Black</span> Drin River, flowing out of the lake in a northerly direction.  This river heads to Albania, where it connects with White Drin.  Such a merger is combined into one river Drin.  Thanks to this cycle, water always remains crystal clear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rest on the lake </h2><p>  As already mentioned, many tourists from other countries come here as a resort instead of the sea. </p>

Already in the spring comes a pleasant warm season.  But swimming in the lake at this time is still cold.  In May, the water warms up to about 16 degrees.  Therefore, many prefer summer time for a trip to Lake Ohrid.  The water temperature rises to 18-24 <sup>0</sup> , the average is 21 <sup>0</sup> .

    <p>  You can decorate your vacation by visiting cozy cafes, shops and local markets where amazing jewelry is sold.  A deep-sea trout is found in the lake, from the scales of which the locals make such beautiful souvenirs. </p><h2>  Water transport </h2><p>  Going to such an interesting place, tourists on vacation want to get the maximum experience.  That is why you definitely need to ride on a cruise ship, which carries guests to explore some of the sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ohrid lake photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1087222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Although it is worth noting that Lake Ohrid is not particularly lively in terms of crossing.  On the <span>surface of the water</span> you can see in some places small boats and huge cruise ships.  Small-sized iron boats have bright, cheerful colors and are moored for overnight stays mainly near the mountainside near the houses. </p><h2>  Ohrid Hotels </h2><p>  Ohrid hotels, which exist only at the expense of tourists, try to please every vacationer.  In the city you can find a variety of housing options.  It can be hostels, private apartments, rooms, campsites, apartments or hotels.  The most common are 2 * and 3 * hotels.  To rent a double room in such a place on average will cost $ 30.  If you think about your accommodation in advance and book a place, your impressions of your vacation will be the best, and you will never forget Lake Ohrid again.  Holidays at the height of the season are richer, but there are many tourists here, so without thinking about an overnight stay, you have to stop where you have to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ohrid lake water temperature" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1087220.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  If the hotel is too expensive to stay, you can choose one of the hostels, which will cost about $ 10 per night.  But it is worth remembering that a room in such an institution is designed for 5 to 10 guests.  If you have tents, they can be set up at the hostel for $ 6.  Camping is also available.  The work of such stops lasts from July to September.  If you choose Sveti Naum Camping, a <span>nudist beach is</span> located nearby <span>.</span> </p><p>  The most profitable housing include private rooms.  On average, a night costs $ 12.  But this is much better than living in a hostel designed for several strangers. </p><h2>  Fauna of the lake </h2><p>  Lake Ohrid has its own unique underwater ecosystem, which is characteristic only of this reservoir, while it completely occupies the entire food chain.  Baikal and Tanganyika are also distinguished by the same characteristic properties.  Phyto- and zooplankton, sponges, mollusks, and crustaceans live here.  Several species of cyprinids, trout, eels and several other species of predatory species are found from fish. </p>
