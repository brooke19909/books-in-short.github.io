    <h2>  Negative Hotel Stay </h2><p>  Unfortunately, a number of vacationers at some moments of rest in the <span>Park-Hotel Gorodok (Samara)</span> had a negative impression. </p><ul><li>  Many hotel guests unanimously complain of poor sound insulation between rooms.  When you want to relax in the evening, loud voices can be heard from the next room. </li><li>  Also, those who come to rest in their own car note that it is rather difficult to find a hotel, it is almost impossible without a navigator.  Signs are only in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. </li><li>  There were also complaints that a non-smoking room had been pre-ordered, but upon check-in the room was not only for smokers, but was poorly ventilated. </li><li>  It was also noted that in some rooms WI-FI is poorly caught.  When contacting the administration, no alternative was proposed. </li><li>  There were precedents when vacationers who had previously booked a room were not confirmed on the spot. </li><li>  The negative review was also about the fact that, having arrived by prior arrangement with the hotel administration, the guests found that the room that had been booked was not yet cleaned after the eviction of the previous guests. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you still decide to come to the <span>Park-Hotel Gorodok, transport accessibility</span> is ensured by the proximity to the city center.  And after twenty minutes of driving you will find clean forest air.  It is also convenient to get to <span>Kurumoch airport (</span> or from the airport).  Fatigue after the road will help you relieve the cozy atmosphere in the rooms, delicious food and friendly staff.  Having a rest in a quiet calm place, you will surely remember the hotel location - <span>Samara, Studeny ravine -</span> and want to return here again. </p>
