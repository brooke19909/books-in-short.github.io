  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coin 20 kopecks 1981. Features, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A coin of 20 kopecks in 1981 is considered one of the most variable.  Collectors count about nine varieties of this currency.  The cost of each type will, of course, depend on the safety of the coin, as well as on the frequency of occurrence.  Today we will understand why some coins are more expensive, while others cannot be sold for the ruble.  Let's try to understand the difference between the five varieties of these coins, and for what collectors are willing to pay a tidy sum. </p><p>  A coin with such dignity was first minted back in 1961.  But since then, little has changed in her appearance.  In some ways, it resembles a three-copeck coin of 1961.  Perhaps due to the use of the same stamp.  This money continued to be released until 1991. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1981 reverse" class="if uuid-3162468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162468.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  For the production of coins, an alloy was used, which included: 12 parts of nickel, 58 parts of copper and 30 parts of zinc.  He was also called the composition of Neusilber.  Despite the fact that the appearance of the coin remained virtually unchanged for many decades, its composition changed.  In recent years, 20 kopecks in 1981 were already made from a whitish copper-nickel alloy (cupronickel). </p><p>  No magnetic properties, of course, are observed.  The weight of the coin is almost 3.5 grams.  Production was launched in the Leningrad Mint. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Compared with the "earlier" coins, 20 kopecks in 1981 was quite modest in the exterior decoration.  The medalist placed only two large images on the obverse of the coin.  The main place, of course, was occupied by the emblem of the Soviet Union, then there was the inscription "USSR".  There are no more details. </p><p>  The coat of arms is an image of the Earth on which a sickle and a hammer are minted.  below is the fourth part (visible) of the sun with rays that reach the "foot" of the Earth.  On the sides - a wreath, which consists of wheat ears and ribbons wrapping them around.  The ribbons converge below.  Above is a five-pointed star.  It has smooth rounded tips, not split. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="20 kopecks 1981 obverse" class="if uuid-3162467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162467.jpg"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The appearance of the coin of 20 kopecks 1981 from the reverse side has not changed since 1961.  Here you can count five main elements.  At the very edge of the edging is an indication of the year of coin minting.  In the center is the inscription "cents".  The entire main part is occupied by a figure talking about the face value of the coin.  These are large numbers, the font is quite sharp, the borders of the numbers are slightly rounded.  Along the walls of the coin are stalks of wheat, originating from a bunch of oak leaves.  Ears have three main spines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="meshok.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a few coins 20 kopecks 1981" class="if uuid-3162475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162475.jpg"></div><p>  There are several varieties of coins of 20 kopecks 1981.  We will tell in a little more detail about some specimens that are distinguished by experienced numismatists: </p><ol><li>  F140.  The gaps that exist between the ears are quite narrow.  This is different from the coinage.  In addition, ears under the number "2" have no awns.  There is no step on the right side of the five-pointed star. </li><li>  F141.  Ears have rather long awns.  A star differs from other images in sharper tips. </li><li>  F142.  The coat of arms image is slightly raised.  The spikes on the ears are long.  If you look closely, the spike that is located near the coat of arms (on the inside) has five awns. </li><li>  F143.  Unlike the previous one, in this version there are not five, but only three spines.  If on other coins in the image of the Earth you can see the Gulf of Guinea, then on this kind of coins it will not be.  If you compare with option F142, then you can see that the emblem pattern is slightly down. </li><li>  F144.  At the ear on the inside of the coat of arms there are three ears, as in the previous version, and not five, as with the variety "142".  In addition, coins of this type do not have a noticeable spine, which on the variants ‚Äú142‚Äù and ‚Äú143‚Äù will be visible between the third and second spikelets.  An image of the Gulf of Guinea is present here, but it is made in the form of an arc. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coin 20 kopecks 1981 reverse and obverse" class="if uuid-3162472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162472.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Running coins 20 kopecks 1981 are very cheap.  "Walker", as they say in numismatic circles, can be sold for 1-5 rubles.  If the condition is perfect, then you can help out a little more (up to 40 rubles). </p><p>  Coins that belong to the varieties can be a little more expensive: 141, 142, 143, 144.  The most expensive coins f140.  Their cost varies from three thousand rubles and above. </p><p>  Tip.  If you want to make money on the sale of coins of 20 kopecks in 1981, then try to find the monetary unit that was produced in 1990.  This is the most expensive instance, the cost of which starts at auctions from 25,000 rubles.  Coins of 1981 minting will be slightly cheaper (up to 13,000 rubles). </p>
