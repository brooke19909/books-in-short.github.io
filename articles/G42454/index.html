Human Behavior, Actions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The popular theory of stigmatization arose in the 20th century.  Its supporters believe that in society there is a common mechanism for labeling certain social groups.  With it, the majority condemns certain deviations from generally accepted normal behavior. </p><h2>  Theory of Theory </h2><p>  The causes of this phenomenon lie in the conflicts of people among themselves.  The stigmatization theory says that the majority defines norms, and gives violators of these norms a label (stigma).  People who do not follow generally accepted rules of behavior are considered deviants (deviated). </p><p>  The theory of stigmatization was formed thanks to the works of several world-famous sociologists: Edwin Lemert, Howard Becker and Kai Erickson.  All of them belonged to the same generation of scientists working in the first half of the 20th century.  Erving Hoffman also made a great contribution to the development of the theory.  A key feature of this teaching is the idea that acts that are negative in nature do not exist.  The internal content does not affect the assessment.  A negative attitude depends only on those norms that society itself freely accepts. </p>

    <h2>  Primary deviation </h2><p>  In sociology, the point of view is accepted that there are no "normal" and "abnormal" people.  Moreover, each person is characterized by <span>deviant behavior</span> in any particular area.  Therefore, there are no people with pathologies.  Someone violates the rules of the road, someone does not pay taxes, someone acts as a bully during football matches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stigmatization theory distinguishes the so-called primary deviation.  These are violations of public norms that slip away from the attention of law enforcement officers because of their frivolity and routine.  Moreover, the assessment of "good", "bad" action depends on many small things.  For example, in some societies women are not allowed to do what a man can do, while in other countries there are no such restrictions.  Also often deviant behavior is determined according to mass stereotypes.  For example, in many countries men are criticized for their effeminate appearance and image, although somewhere similar behavior is not forbidden.  The criterion of "good", "bad" is associated with the social environment of a person.  It depends only on the morals of people living nearby, whether a critic will follow this or that behavior. </p>

    <h2>  Secondary deviation </h2><p>  Putting a label on a person by the majority entails noticeable consequences for him.  In response to the reaction of society, secondary deviant behavior arises.  The person who received the label becomes an addict, a criminal, a loafer, etc. for those around him. This status suppresses any other individual personality traits.  People who have long lived as branded begin to build their whole lives on the basis of this characteristic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The stigma theory also explains the typical behavior of those in the deviant group.  Every day, feeling the criticism of the rest of society is a huge stress.  Friends, acquaintances, and even relatives often turn away from people with a negative label.  A similar critical situation is experiencing all the social skills of the individual.  What can a person do in this position?  As a rule, he unites in a deviant group with the same people. </p><h2>  Stigma and crime </h2><p>  Very clearly, the principle of rallying works in the underworld.  People who find themselves in this environment almost always become members of a huge group that opposes itself to the rest of society. </p><p>  Based on this pattern, some researchers believe that crime is partly due to the fact that society stigmatizes criminals, tears them into a criminal niche, and thus prevents prisoners from returning to normal life.  The theory of stigma in criminology today has many supporters.  Interestingly, a similar rule leads to the emergence of youth subcultures and countercultures. </p>

    <h2>  Life with a label </h2><p>  The group activities of stigmatized people can take many forms.  But in all of them there is a common similar unifying incentive - the desire to find mates in misfortune.  This can be well-organized and even supported by the state and social services clubs for the disabled, the elderly, people suffering from obesity, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some of these circles can develop into something more.  For example, many countries have their own nationwide societies of anonymous alcoholics.  They do not just unite people trying to fight their bad habits.  Such societies offer their members a whole doctrine - a new way of life necessary in order to return their lives to normal. </p><p>  Stigmatization in sociology can occur on a national basis.  In this case, people often unite on the principle of neighborhood.  In large cities, small national regions appear, the majority of whose population is in one or another diaspora. </p><h2>  "Understanding" </h2><p>  Often social stigmatization leads to the fact that the imposed identity of a person may not coincide with a true identity.  This discrepancy leaves a negative imprint on the individual.  Such an asocial person can expect support from only two groups of people.  The first is those who have to live with the same stigma.  They were discussed above. </p><p>  But there is a second group.  These are the so-called "understanding".  Such people are considered "normal", society treats them as their own.  However, they do not want to label the lepers.  On the contrary, ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù people with stigma are sympathetic.  With them, a person suffering from his lack can feel comfortable.  "Understanding" do not shame and do not force the outcast to control themselves by the rest of society. </p>

    <h2>  Contacts with deviants </h2><p>  The phenomenon of "understanding" was particularly interested in Erving Hoffman.  He described this type of human relationship in detail in his book Stigma.  According to his assumption, in order to get closer to the marginal, an ordinary person needs to survive a serious shock - something that would allow him to look at others with an unusual look. </p><p>  Stigmatized people hardly come into contact with people from someone else's circle.  For example, a ‚Äúbad‚Äù child expelled from peer companies is likely to snarl at attempts to establish any relationship with him.  This is a natural <span>psychological defense</span> against a largely hostile environment.  Each asocial person loses his sociability over time.  Gradually, it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to find a common language with people.  Therefore, even a friendly person will have to wait a while and try to show their sincerity.  And only after that he will be able to secure the stigmatized trust. </p><h2>  Ideas by Thomas Sheff </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstigma was one of the main ideas in the scientific work of Thomas Sheff.  His main thesis is that society establishes <span>social control</span> over its members <span>, the</span> main tools of which are sanctions against those who deviate from the generally accepted norm.  Schaeff continued the research of his predecessors.  He was noticeably influenced by Becker's theory of stigma. </p><p>  At the same time, Sheff studied the phenomenon of labeling from his own perspective.  Prior to this, he studied a lot of the problem of mental illness and their transition into interpersonal space.  In essence, Scheff linked psychology and sociology. </p>

    <h2>  Residual deviation </h2><p>  In the works of Thomas Scheff, the theory of stigmatization grew into the theory of residual deviation.  Its author believed that many mental illnesses are the result of a person‚Äôs social reaction and choice.  Such a controversial statement is one of the tenets of critical social theory.  Sheff's idea came about after rethinking social norms. </p><p>  Modern culture is different in that all people within the same <span>cultural space</span> should share approximately the same way of thinking.  These norms are enshrined in <span>human behavior</span> in childhood through education.  In order to make a child socially adapted, parents instill in him all those views and habits that are considered necessary for a full life in society.  A ‚Äúbad‚Äù child may refuse to recognize these guidelines, and then he is outside the circle of friends of his peers.  Exactly the same principle works with adults. </p><h2>  Nature of deviations </h2><p>  In his books and articles, Sheff emphasized that mental illness is only a reflection of the act of choosing values.  And today this idea has many opponents.  Sheff refused to acknowledge mental health as a physical fact.  That is, "abnormality" is the same conscious choice as the habit of greeting friends. </p><p>  The creator of the resonance theory paid special attention to the importance of the emotional factor in social manipulations.  For example, children are constantly faced with a mismatch between what they want and what they are allowed and forbidden.  Their way of expressing their displeasure is crying.  Gradually, children have to accept the standards of behavior that their parents instill in them. </p><p>  Deviations have their own clear boundaries that separate it from the norm.  In order to maintain this ratio, society constantly reminds itself of what is good and what is bad.  For example, on television and in newspapers there are constantly references to thefts, murders and other crimes.  Every day people are reminded of the perversity of crime and responsibility for breaking laws. </p><p>  At the same time, some sociologists today are trying to prove that society voluntarily or involuntarily maintains deviations, creating fertile soil for them.  For example, prisons do not help a person abandon his deviant behavior.  On the contrary, the offender finds a comfortable living environment in places of detention, which serves as a venue for rallying people from the criminal world. </p>

    <h2>  Stigmatization and emotions </h2><p>  In adults, pride and <span>shame</span> act as emotions in relation to stigmatization <span>.</span>  <span>These</span> natural reactions are a response to <span>social sanctions.</span>  In this case, we are talking about non-verbal everyday rewards and prohibitions.  Sanctions may be imaginary.  Regulators of shame and pride in a person are included at the moment when he is alone and is not the object of direct criticism of society. </p><p>  Shame gives rise to another emotion - anger.  The circulation of these two feelings goes in three stages.  First, the destruction of social communication occurs, then there is a violation of communication, and finally, it all ends with a conflict between people.  Many experts agree that this pattern is a vicious circle from which it is impossible to get out without changing your own behavior.  At the same time, a sharp sense of shame often blocks the ability to restore the social connection of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and stigmatized.  Often it triggers a reaction of alienation. </p>

    <h2>  Depressed Deviant </h2><p>  When stigmatized, a person who receives the label often experiences depression.  Its root lies in the absence of reliable social ties.  In a person with depression, these important contacts for a full life are destroyed.  This condition arises as a logical continuation of the stigmatized alienation from the rest of society. </p><p>  As a rule, the fundamental feeling of an outcast is shame, not anger or grief.  Typical behaviors are an insecure soft voice, avoiding eye contact, anxiety, slowness, and self-blaming. </p>
