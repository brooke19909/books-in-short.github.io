    <h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  It will be useful first of all to consider what modifications the device is present on the Russian market. </p><p>  The simplest version of the device is 600D Body.  It comes without a lens.  The corresponding item must be purchased separately.  <span>Lenses for the Canon</span> 600D come in many different types, markedly different in terms of technology.  Therefore, the photographer will have the opportunity to choose the best, based on the tasks to be solved. </p><p>  The next modification of the device is the Canon 600D 18-55 Kit.  It assumes the presence of an entry-level lens apparatus in the delivery set - without an optical stabilizer having the usual light sensitivity. </p><p>  Canon 600D Kit 18-55 IS II includes a more advanced lens.  It is equipped, in turn, with an optical stabilizer and allows shooting at an insufficiently high level of illumination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most technologically advanced lens is installed in the Canon 600D Kit 18-135 IS.  It has a large range of focuses, remarkable characteristics in terms of optics.  Of course, it also has a stabilizer, adaptation to a low level of illumination in the camera is the most optimal. </p><h2>  Design and appearance of the camera </h2><p>  The <span>Canon 600D</span> SLR is quite similar in appearance to its predecessor in the EOS line - a device with an index of 450D.  Most significantly, they are distinguished by the presence of a rotary display in the camera model under consideration.  In addition, the dimensions of the body of the new device are slightly larger, in its structure there are additional elastic elements that facilitate the girth of the camera with your hands. </p><p>  It can be noted that a new button appeared in the Canon 600D camera - one that allows you to switch the shooting of videos to Live View.  It is located near the viewfinder. </p><p>  In order to configure certain shooting options, as well as quickly adjust them, the photographer can use the quick access function, which is called up by pressing the Q button. </p><p>  What does the Canon 600D look like?  The device photo is below. </p>

    <h2>  Device functional: what's new in the model? </h2><p>  First of all, about the new device features.  According to many photography enthusiasts, as well as market experts, one of the most significant innovations implemented in the Canon 600D is the presence of a wireless <span>external</span> flash <span>control</span> system.  This option allows you to take high-quality pictures without releasing the camera from your hands.  The corresponding external flash control system also makes it possible to illuminate an object simultaneously with an internal element of a similar purpose. </p><p>  Another useful feature of the Canon 600D is its rotatable display.  This hardware component displays a picture in a fairly high resolution - about 1 megapixel - and contributes to a significant increase in the convenience of shooting. </p><h2>  Device Management Features </h2><p>  Let us now consider some features of the practical use of the basic functions of the Canon EOS 600D.  First of all, you can pay attention to the presence of an additional option, which is located on the circular switch of shooting modes, - "Video".  Another nuance that characterizes the control of the device is the ability to shoot in RAW format, even if the camera operates in standard mode. </p><p>  Using the camera‚Äôs software interfaces, you can use various frame filters.  At the same time, they work equally effectively when shooting both in RAW format and in the JPEG standard.  In addition, you can convert a picture from the first format to the second using proprietary applications. </p><p>  Among the most useful options for the Canon EOS 600D is the ability to <span>record sound</span> not only through the built-in microphone, but also when using an external device of the appropriate type. </p>

    <h2>  Movie Features </h2><p>  Let us now consider the specifics of video recording using a device from Canon.  According to experts, the video recording interfaces implemented in the camera are not too different from those installed in the previous model of the EOS line - a device with an index of 550D.  In particular, the above-mentioned indicators for the maximum resolution of video files, as well as frame rates, are the same for both devices. </p><p>  In order to start shooting video with the camera, you must select the appropriate mode using the hardware switch, then click on the Live View button.  It is noteworthy that during the video recording, you can shoot ordinary, single frames.  The maximum size of a video file that can fit on a camera‚Äôs flash drive, 4 GB, no longer accommodates the FAT32 file system, in which flash drives are most often formatted.  The maximum video length in the highest resolution, thus, is about 30 minutes.  The format of the recorded video file is MOV. </p><p>  In the process of recording the corresponding multimedia content, you can manually adjust the exposure.  The sound in the video, as we noted above, can be recorded using both the built-in and external microphone. </p><h2>  Work speed </h2><p>  The speed of the device is estimated as extremely high.  In particular, this is reflected in the fact that autofocus is very quickly activated.  In some cases, for example, when shooting in low light conditions, minor errors may occur in the unit performing the corresponding function.  But, as experts say, the instruction supplied with the Canon 600D warns about this in advance. </p><p>  The camera is also very good in terms of the speed of the software interfaces.  True, some difficulties may arise when viewing pictures on a large scale - those that are presented in RAW format.  According to experts, this is due to the relatively low performance of the processor that is installed in the device.  Although in practice, viewing pictures in full resolution using, in fact, a camera is not the most common task.  As a rule, it is more convenient to work with a PC with the appropriate type of content. </p><p>  In terms of the speed of automatic shooting, the device is fully consistent with the declared characteristics, photographing at a rate of 3.7 frames per second.  But on one condition - if the files are written in <span>JPG format.</span>  If you shoot in RAW, then the speed of automatic shooting is reduced to less than 2 frames per second.  At the same time, a high-speed flash memory module should be inserted in the camera - it is best if it is a carrier in the SDHC standard. </p><p>  At the same time, as experts say, the Canon 600D Kit SLR is amateurish in one way or another, and therefore, in practice, the user will most likely not use the automatic shooting mode.  But even if he has to do this, it is likely that he will not need pictures in the RAW standard, and he will be completely satisfied with the files in the JPG format, which, of course, are obtained when working with the device of the highest quality under consideration. </p>

    <h2>  Program menu and software </h2><p>  Now consider the specifics of the camera‚Äôs software menu, as well as other software that comes with the device.  As we noted above, the device is equipped with a display that can be rotated and has a sufficiently high resolution.  These advantages are successfully combined with the convenience of using the camera's interfaces: by using horizontal and vertical navigation buttons, the photographer can quickly switch between various device options. </p><p>  Many experts characterize the main menu of the device as extremely convenient from the point of view of the location of the most popular options.  In addition, the device‚Äôs software interfaces have the ability to adjust shooting parameters using both hardware switches and software.  Also for this purpose, you can use the Q button and scroll wheel. </p><p>  The instructions that came with the Canon 600D are pretty detailed.  But in case the photographer has doubts about the purpose of certain functions on the screen, a guide for them is provided in the camera‚Äôs software interface. </p><p>  Among other notable menu options are the ability to apply effects, as well as organizing photos by rating.  The software supplied with the camera allows you to solve problems related to setting up the device, managing shooting modes and options, sending files to a PC, viewing and editing photo and video files.  In addition, you can work with multimedia content from a computer using a USB cable.  In principle, this option is also typical of many other Canon EOS solutions. </p><p>  Consider the features of using some types of software available to the device user, in more detail.  Among those programs that are available to the owner of the camera - Picture Style Editor.  With it, you can, for example, create personalized styles when processing photos. </p><p>  Another powerful program that a photographer can use is Digital Photo Professional (or DPP).  Its main function is to convert RAW files to other multimedia standards.  DPP program allows you to batch process files, manage color, change the parameters of optics. </p><p>  Another notable Canon solution that comes with the camera is ZoomBrowser EX.  This program is intended for use in Windows and is a software adapted for viewing mainly JPEG-images, as well as videos.  This software allows, in particular, editing video in order to edit the film, overlay various special effects on the frames. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the solution </h2><p>  Consider which experts highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the Canon 600D.  Among the undoubted advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a rotatable monitor with high resolution; </li><li>  the ability to adjust <span>white balance,</span> adapted for almost any shooting conditions; </li><li>  high speed of the camera - in terms of working with autofocus, software interfaces; </li><li>  the ability to customize styles for pictures; </li><li>  the ability to adjust options during shooting, in which various automatic modes are activated; </li><li>  the presence in the device of such functions as automatic adaptation to the level of illumination, brightness correction; </li><li>  the ability to record data about the author of photos in EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãformat; </li><li>  the presence in the program interface of options that allow you to configure quick access to the most popular settings and functions; </li><li>  the presence of guidance on the use of functions in the control interfaces of the device; </li><li>  the ability to control an external flash in wireless mode; </li><li>  high resolution video in Full HD, good frame rate in the corresponding mode; </li><li>  the ability to take pictures at the same time as recording a video; </li><li>  support for digital zoom when shooting movies - in the value from 3 to 10; </li><li>  the ability to record sound using an external microphone; </li><li>  Support for stereo recording with custom level settings, as well as filtering wind noise. </li></ul><p>  These are the strengths of the apparatus. </p><p>  In turn, experts refer to the disadvantages of the Canon EOS 600D device: </p><ul><li>  insufficiently high speed of automatic shooting in the recording mode of a picture in RAW format; </li><li>  lack of a <span>built-in</span> image <span>stabilizer</span> ; </li><li>  unstable autofocus in some modes. </li></ul><p>  In general, it is obvious that the device has more advantages than disadvantages.  But do device users think so?  We will study their reviews, which are presented on various thematic online portals. </p>
