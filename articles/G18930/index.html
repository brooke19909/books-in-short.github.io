Maybe this was due to the fact that this breed resembles a plush toy.  And when the pug puts on a sweater and goes for a walk, you can confuse it with a toy dog.  Be that as it may, the craftswomen knit overalls, booties and hats for their pets, and then create cute knitted animals. </p><p>  To tie a toy, you need to think in advance what parts it will consist of.  Usually the head is knitted separately: it has the most small parts, so it‚Äôs convenient to work not with the whole toy, but with some fragment of it.  The crochet technique allows you to make changes to the original model during the process without dismissing the product. </p><h2>  Knitted pugs </h2><p>  Cute handmade toys have warmth and tenderness.  Because the author made them with love. </p><p>  There are many crochet pug patterns.  In the amigurumi technique, children are knitted in the size of five to eight centimeters.  Such a toy can be hung, pinned, put in your pocket.  The process of its creation will take no more than an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amigurumipatterns.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pug artist" class="if uuid-3171012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3171012.jpg"></div><p>  Amigurumi is a national traditional Japanese toy.

They are already larger in size - from ten to twelve centimeters.

Game pugs knit in the size of twenty-five centimeters.  For a child of three to five years, this is a convenient size.  Such a pug is crocheted or knitted.  Such toys should be washed well, so the yarn should not fade. </p><h2>  Universal toy </h2><p>  In order to decide to make a pug with their own hands, several models are selected.  It is desirable to combine in them such qualities as ease of manufacture, ease of washing, and the absence of solid parts.  These requirements are met by a crocheted pug no larger than twelve centimeters in size.  It is perfect for a collection and for a game.  The small size will allow you to use it as a souvenir, he will be able to live in a bag or pocket. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A toy knitted in a circle will be difficult for beginners: in order to maintain symmetry, you need to label each row and count the loops.  It is better to dwell on a model consisting of two halves, interconnected.  The pug toy will turn out a little flat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="monateka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3171169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/3171169.jpg"></div><h2>  Toy details </h2><p>  The product has two large parts: the front and rear halves.  They are distinguished by the presence of a muzzle pattern on the front part.  The photo shows how to crochet a pug: besides these details, a pair of ears, a tail and a butterfly are knitted.  Eyes, tongue, nose and eyebrows are made after. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Toy details" class="if uuid-3169739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3169739.jpg"></div><p>  First knit legs - two identical parts.  Starting with eleven loops, knit five rows.  In each row, one loop is reduced.  Having connected five rows, they close the loops.  Such parts will need four pieces.  The ears are knitted in the same way as the legs, only from black yarn.  Two parts need to be connected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A ponytail is one row of single crochet posts connected on a chain of ten air loops.  The thread remaining after fixing the last loop, leave a length of about five centimeters. </p><p>  A bow tie knitted from red yarn.  For him, ten loops are gathered and four rows are crocheted with crochets, after which the loops are closed.  In the center, a butterfly is tied with red thread without cutting the ends. </p><h2>  Back and front halves </h2><p>  The tummy and back are knitted equally, only the muzzle is tied with colored yarn.  Loop through the wide sides of the legs, eleven loops.  In total, twenty-two loops are obtained on knitting.  Knit six rows and at the end of the sixth row add a chain of three air loops.  In the next row, the addition is repeated.  These will be pens. </p><p>  On knitting should get twenty-eight loops.  So they knit three rows, after which they reduce two loops on each side.  Twenty-four loops should remain.  So knit two rows of neck.  Then the front half of the pug knits in one pattern, and the back in another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted Pug" class="if uuid-3169607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3169607.jpg"></div><h2>  The rear half of the pug crochet: diagram and description </h2><p>  After two rows of neck are connected, they knit their head with beige yarn.

Two colored threads are introduced to draw the face.  When the color changes, the threads cross each other so that empty gaps in the fabric are not obtained.  Like the whole toy, the pug‚Äôs head is knitted with crochets. </p><p>  Scheme and description: </p><ul><li>  Hook the dark thread after the fifth beige column. </li><li>  Knit four columns and change the thread to beige. </li><li>  Knit six columns and change the thread to dark.  Each time the threads cross when changing colors. </li><li>  Knit four dark columns and change the thread to beige.  The row is completed by five columns. </li></ul><p>  Knitting head in rows: </p><ol><li>  5 beige, 4 dark, 6 beige, 4 dark, 5 bezh. </li><li>  5 beige, 5 dark, 4 beige, 5 dark, 5 beige. </li><li>  Add one loop - 6 beige, 5 dark, 4 beige, 5 dark, 6 beige (add one loop). </li><li>  7 beige, 12 dark, 7 beige. </li><li>  7 beige, 12 dark, 7 beige. </li><li>  One loop is added - 8 beige, 2 brown, 8 dark, 2 brown, 8 beige (add one loop). </li><li>  7 beige, 3 brown, 8 dark, 3 brown, 7 beige. </li><li>  6 beige, 16 brown, 6 beige. </li><li>  6 beige, 16 brown, 6 beige. </li><li>  7 beige, 6 brown, 2 beige, 6 brown, 7 beige. </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 7 beige, 4 brown, 4 beige, 4 brown, 7 beige (reduce one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 26 bezh (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Decrease one loop - 24 beige (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 22 bezh (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 20 bezh (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 18 bezh (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 16 bezh (decrease one loop). </li><li>  Reduce one loop - 14 bezh (decrease one loop). </li></ol><p>  The threads that knitted the muzzle are neatly fixed.  They can be linked together.  Sew on eyes.  Black nose is embroidered with a nose and eyebrows, pink is made a loop - this is a tongue.  Sew on a red butterfly. </p><h2>  How to assemble a toy </h2><p>  After the front and rear parts are completely ready, proceed to stitch them.  For this, both parts are tied with a beige thread along the contour, leaving the upper part of the head uncovered - a syntepuh is stuffed through it.  Start stuffing in small pieces, ramming them in the paws with a pencil.  If this is not done, they will hang like flippers. </p><p>  The body is not stuffed so that the toy remains soft.  After stuffing the heads continue and finish stitching the product. </p><h2>  How to sew ears </h2><p>  Amigurumi toys are traditionally sewn with sewing thread.  They are not visible against the background of a knitted product, but modern techniques do not use such methods.  Crocheted pug ears are steamed with an iron through a damp cloth and checked for their identity.  If after steaming one ear is bigger, you can bandage it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="spinayarncrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ear tying" class="if uuid-3169741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3169741.jpg"></div><p>  To assemble separately related parts, a seam is made without tying the column.  For this, a hook is inserted into the extreme loop of the part and one of the loops of the web to which it is tied.  Folding the end of the thread in half, pull out the loop.  Without tying it, they repeat the operation again.  Two loops form on the hook.  They stretch the second through the first, as in an air chain.  This seam fasten all the details. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In order to crochet a funny pug dog, any light yarn of natural shades is suitable.  It will be needed a little, so the product will not become expensive.  Instead of ready-made eyes, you can sew buttons, and glue a disk of salt dough onto the holes in their center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sirpurlgrey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pug amigurumi" class="if uuid-3170939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45915/3170939.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting a toy is always fun.  Invite your child to create a friend for himself and help him complete the pug crochet. </p>
