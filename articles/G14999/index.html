So what are the differences between the two devices?  Perhaps this will become a secondary issue, which we, nevertheless, will analyze today.  The main part of the article we will devote to the analysis of some characteristics of the model.  Well, before you start reviewing the model, we recall that the release date for the iPhone 6S Plus in Russia is September 9, 2015. </p><h2>  Differences </h2>

    <p>  Both devices - smartphones Iphone 6S and IPhone 6S Plus - were presented in the international arena in September this year.  So how does one device differ from another?  Firstly, I would like to note that in the latest model the reading function is implemented more efficiently.  Sometimes it seems that in front of us is really a real miniature book.  Pocket, so to speak. </p><p>  Secondly, working with the phone is often inextricably linked to the availability of the Internet.  On the device you can read news and articles, and a larger screen provides greater comfort at the same time.  Third, the 6S Plus has more advanced energy efficiency features.  In this regard, it works for several hours longer.  And, believe me, this is very, very noticeable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fourthly, the device will not be difficult to transport, for example, in a jacket.  Yes, and a cover to wear in jeans, you will not need to be required.  And all this with an eye on the large <span>screen sizes,</span> please note.  And finally, we note that with such a display it is very, very convenient to watch video.  If there is no particular desire to carry an iPad with you, the 6S Plus will easily replace it in this regard. </p><h2>  Conclusion to differences </h2>

    <p>  The main, of course, was the reading mode.  The new <span>IPhone 6S and IPhone 6S</span> Plus differ dramatically in this regard.  There is a special night mode in the latest model software.  It is designed to reduce the burden on the eyes of the owner of the phone during prolonged reading in low light conditions. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  What can be found in the box with the phone?  The basis of the delivery kit is the device itself and the necessary pair of accessories.  We are talking about a network adapter and a cable such as MicroUSB.  It can also be used to synchronize the phone with a personal computer or laptop.  Also included are <span>EarPods.</span>  In some countries, a device that allows you to remove SIM cards is included in the package.  But not in all, this should be remembered.  The composition ends, of course, with a warranty card and phone documentation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The dimensions of the device are not much different from those that have become known to us since the time of the first introduction of the Plus product.  The mass of the device has changed, yes.  Now the mass of the iPhone 6S Plus, an overview of which is presented in the article, is 192 grams.  During the manufacture of the structure, a new alloy was involved. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2>

    <p>  There were a lot of them before.  Now one more has been added.  This is the so-called ‚ÄúRose Gold‚Äù.  But, according to some reports, the ‚ÄúCosmic Gray‚Äù remains the most popular color at present.  It is believed that it is the most practical, simple and straightforward.  These are the three ‚ÄúPs.‚Äù  The pink and gold solution is perfect for girls and women.  Now you can meet, by the way, a lot of such devices among the representatives of the beautiful half of humanity.  Now service centers are actively behaving, which offer to change the phone case. </p><h2>  About covers </h2>

    <p>  To protect the screens of all the latest ‚Äúapples‚Äù the most modern materials are used.  However, only an armored 50 mm glass can save the phone from a sloppy user.  This means that even with such an enhanced ‚Äúarmor‚Äù device must be handled carefully, since even in the iPhone 6S Plus, a review of which the reader can find in this article, it is possible to break the screen without much difficulty.  In general, if you do not like to apply special films and glasses, it is better to purchase a cover.  Also a practical solution. </p><h2>  IPhone 6S Plus: Overview of Security Features </h2><p>  Currently, in the smartphone market you can find a huge number of cases for our phone model.  In such a truly rich assortment, it is easy to get lost and choose not what you wanted and indeed needed.  Perhaps the best option would be to purchase the Incase SYSTM Case.  This accessory can be found in several versions.  In general, such a cover is a composition of two parts. </p><p>  In more detail, the mesh is quite tightly attached to the case.  It is necessary to ensure depreciation.  At the top position is a base made of translucent polycarbonate.  With all this, the owner of the phone will not feel discomfort when working with the buttons.  There is no difficulty with connecting cables.  The dimensions and dimensions of the device when using the cover will not increase to such an extent as to cause discomfort to the user. </p><p>  The screen is hidden behind special sides.  If the <span>iPhone 6S Plus, the characteristics of</span> which you can find in this article, accidentally falls, the case will take on the bulk of the blow.  The likelihood of damage to the device will be minimized.  This product is not available in the Russian Federation; it can only be ordered via the Internet.  However, it may be that soon it will go on official sales in our country as well.  The case will be especially relevant for people who often drop the phone or simply treat it casually.  It is strange that such individuals are among those who own a model of such an expensive brand. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  Here the lens of the main camera is noticeably protruding.  Next to it is an LED flash. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  Under the screen on the front side there is a sensor called ‚ÄúTouch ID‚Äù.  Above is an additional camera.  It is interesting that the role of the flash for it is played by the device‚Äôs screen itself.  If you like to take photos on the front camera in low light conditions, then this move will be to your taste.  You must admit that such a peculiar flash will be much more practical, since it will not blind. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  Here is the power control button.  It allows you to turn the phone on and off, and also just lock it.  There is also a slot in which a Nano-format SIM card is installed. </p><h2>  Left side </h2><p>  On this side there is nothing but a button that allows you to adjust the volume of the device.  She is responsible for the change in multimedia players, as well as for switching the sound mode of the device. </p><h2>  IPhone 6S Plus: features </h2><p>  First we‚Äôll tell you what the phone is made of.  The main materials that were used to create the case are glass and metal.  An operating system of the iOS family has been implanted into the device.  In terms of communications, networks of the second, third and fourth generation are supported.  The processor is a chip model A9.  The size of RAM built into the device is 2 gigabytes. </p><p>  To store user data, depending on the model, 16, 64 or 128 GB can be allocated at once.  Accordingly, the cost of the device also increases.  Wired and wireless interfaces: Wi-Fi (works in the a, b, g, n, ac bands), ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.2, a connector for synchronizing with a personal computer (it also serves as a port for charging the battery), as well as connector 3, 5 millimeters into which a wired stereo headset is connected. </p><p>  The diagonal of the display is 5.5 inches.  The picture is displayed on the screen in HD quality.  The element itself is capacitive, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology.  The display resolution is 1920 by 1080 pixels. </p><p>  Among the navigation modules were GLONASS and GPS.  The primary and secondary cameras have a resolution of 12 and 5 megapixels, respectively.  Dimensions in all three planes: 158.2 by 77.9 by 7.3 millimeters with a mass of 192 grams. </p><p>  The cost of a new phone is currently 66 thousand rubles or more (depending on the built-in long-term memory). </p>
