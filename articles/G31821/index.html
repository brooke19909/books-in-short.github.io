If in the beginning of the 90s it practically sunk into oblivion, today most families conclude agreements on life insurance for the main breadwinner so that if something happens to him, the family is not left without a livelihood.  But today I want to raise a topic that is almost never discussed, namely, insurance of prisoners.  What they have rights to and in which case they can receive payments, let's understand together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prisoner insurance" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19607/1967790.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First practice </h2><p>  Our society has come to this relatively recently.  Prisoners insurance was still under development, and today not every company is ready to conclude such an agreement.  However, the problem of dealing with people who are serving their sentences is quite acute.  People are subjected to unlawful actions in their direction, subject to beating and humiliation, which leads to illness or even death.  Therefore, insurance of prisoners is not a fashionable trend, but a necessity. </p><h2>  How it works </h2><p>  Even before the sentencing, at the time of the conclusion of the pre-trial detention center, you can contact the Rosmed company, which will conclude a short-term contract with the person under investigation.  From the moment of transfer to the colony it will be necessary to re-enter it.  After the prisoner's insurance is completed, he will receive a policy.  Now, if a person is beaten, injured or seriously ill, then he will be taken from the place of serving his sentence for an independent examination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, under the terms of insurance, prisoners are held accountable for the institution in which the person is held.  That is, if bodily injuries are found and it is found out that employees of the <span>correctional institution are</span> involved in this <span>,</span> material resources will be recovered from the head for the similar behavior of his employees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company rosmed" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1967380.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Rosmed Insurance Company has developed a special system through which relatives of the convicted person can take care of ensuring his well-being.  The insurance contract is concluded directly with his relatives.  Since they are free, they can contact the insurance institution and provide documents. </p><p>  However, most often the question of prisoner life insurance arises after information comes from a loved one about bullying by security officers.  But it is much better if you take care of this in advance.  In this case, one copy of the policy is sent to a personal file, which is stored with relatives.  This is already becoming the reason that the attitude of the administration towards the prisoner will be more humane, because no one wants conflict situations and fines. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prevention of misconduct </h2><p>  Rosmed Insurance Company is conducting a thorough investigation of each specific case.  In some situations, the responsibility will extend to the PS, primarily to the boss.  They will punish him for his cruel treatment of a prisoner.  Thus, the simple conclusion of an agreement with an insurance company is an excellent method of combating the actions of employees of PS.  Do not forget that the payment of compensation is supposed only in case of an insured event, which is negotiated by the terms of the contract. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health insurance" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1967382.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  What cases apply to payments </h2><p>  Health insurance is not only about the possibility of beatings and bullying by prison staff.  Conditions of detention can severely undermine the immune system, as a result of which a person acquires a serious illness.  In this case, the insurance covers the costs of treatment and recovery.  In addition, the list also includes a number of cases, but it may differ depending on the amount of insurance.  The standard kit includes tuberculosis. </p><h2>  Dictated by the need </h2><p>  If initially health insurance was voluntary, then today this measure has become mandatory.  According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, state insurance is free of charge for all categories of citizens in custody.  All convicts are involved in labor, and accordingly should be involved in the insurance system.  If a person has lost working capacity, performing socially useful work, then he is entitled to compensation at the state level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prisoner life insurance" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1967383.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tariff Rates </h2><p>  Now let's look more specifically at what cases the insurance of prisoners and convicts applies to. </p><ul><li>  Harm to health as a result of unlawful actions by employees of organs.  The value of the tariff rate is 0.23% of the sum insured. </li><li>  Health hazard due to accident.  Payouts of 0.99%. </li><li>  Disability, that is, permanent disability.  Tariff rate 0.19%.  In this case, it is considered the fact that the reason was the actions of employees of the correctional institution. </li><li>  Disability due to an accident.  The rate of 0.71%. </li><li>  Death as a result of unlawful actions by employees of the correctional institution.  The rate of 0.3%. </li><li>  Accidental death.  The rate of 1.28%. </li><li>  The initial diagnosis of tuberculosis is 3.16%. </li><li>  Death as a result of newly diagnosed tuberculosis is 0.94%. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance for prisoners and convicts" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1967384.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Contract time </h2><p>  It is negotiated individually, depending on the wishes of customers.  Usually, when concluding an agreement for less than a year, tariff rates are slightly reduced.  In addition, each of us needs to be able to operate with special terms.  The insurance amount is exactly the part on which the insurance was concluded.  The insurance premium is the amount that you have to pay in order to receive the insurance amount in the cases described above. </p><p>  For example, if the amount is 50,000 rubles (the injured person will receive so much), then the cost of executing the contract, that is, the premium, will be 2500 rubles.  That is, the larger the sum insured, the greater the payment, and therefore the degree of protection of a person. </p><p>  The cost of insurance of prisoners depends on what cases are stipulated by the terms of the contract.  Some companies may offer to conclude a contract for the provision of a lawyer.  So there is help in representing your interests in court.  If a person does not have money, then he can use standard insurance, which protects against arbitrariness of the administration of the correctional institution. </p><h2>  Insurance in Russia </h2><p>  Today in our country provides several types of insurance: </p><ul><li>  <span>Payment of benefits</span> in case of temporary incapacity for work, for example, for women in pregnancy and childbirth. </li><li>  Pensions in case of old age and disability. </li><li>  Compensation payments in connection with a disease or beatings inflicted on the walls of the detention center.  But there is a nuance to receive disability benefits, it is necessary that this fact be associated with a disease or injury that arose during the serving of the sentence. </li></ul><p>  Each person can receive them if the occurrence of an insured event is proved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accidental death" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19607/1963382.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In which cases a person will not receive payments </h2><p>  It should be understood that each prisoner may have thoughts to create conditions for the occurrence of an insured event and receive money.  As a result, deliberate provocation of employees on illegal actions can be used.  There were cases of beating a cellmate, but the results were presented as an attack by a security guard.  There may be intentional harm to health in order to evade work. </p><p>  In addition, an insured event does not occur if: </p><ul><li>  It occurs during a medical examination or while in a medical institution. </li><li>  If the disability occurred when the prisoner was suspended from work due to a violation of order, or during the suspension of work. </li><li>  If injuries were inflicted on a person when he committed a serious violation or malicious act. </li><li>  When the regimen established by the doctor during the course of treatment was violated. </li></ul><h2>  We carefully read the contract </h2><p>  Be sure to discuss with the agent all the details and ask to list the entire list of cases when you can use the insurance amount.  The specialist should clearly distinguish between cases that involve the payment of money, as well as those that do not fit this definition. </p><p>  The insurance contract involves a free contribution amount, at the discretion of the insured.  It can be five thousand or a million rubles.  Payment will be 5% of the specified amount.  If we are talking about tuberculosis, then the percentage rises to 8%.  The contract will be valid while the convict is in the territory of the correctional institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="permanent disability" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1967389.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Process </h2><p>  There are very few companies that conclude such agreements.  In many cities of the Russian Federation there are only Rosmed branches.  At the same time, the relatives of the convicted person need to discuss the nuances of insurance not only with the company, but also with the administration of the correctional institution.  This is necessary so that there are no problems when examining a prisoner by an expert.  It doesn‚Äôt take much time for registration.  The maximum takes five days.  One original of the documents is kept by a relative, the second in the personal file of the convicted person, in the colony.  They can give him a copy in his hands. </p><h2>  Required data </h2><p>  Since it will not work with the person serving the sentence, information must be collected in advance.  His last name, first name and patronymic, date of birth and passport details will be required.  In addition, it is important to know the address and index of the institution where it is located, as well as the name of the head of the correctional institution.  The contract also contains the data of the person who is the beneficiary.  It can be a wife, a child, a parent.  His name, passport details and address of residence are entered. </p><h2>  How is the payout </h2><p>  If an insurance situation has occurred, it is necessary to notify the company about this and provide documents that confirm your words.  These may be acts, protocols, a medical examination report.  Based on these documents, monetary compensation will be calculated.  If the fact of inflicting beatings is proved, then a one-time compensation payment will be charged.  In case of disability, payments will be long-term, and may be assigned for life. </p>
