  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imamat is an Islamic state</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An imamat is an Islamic <span>state entity</span> in which secular and spiritual authorities are united and constitute a single whole, in contrast to the caliphate, where they are divided.  Also, under this term is understood the Muslim doctrine, which implies the dominance of the community over all spheres of society. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The leader of such a state has great religious significance.  He is perceived precisely as a spiritual leader and supreme leader.  According to Muslim doctrine, its main function is to prepare its subjects for a future life.  The Imamat is a political and religious structure that is based on the recognition of the special status of the supreme ruler.  He is assisted by a special representative organ called the sofa.  It consists of persons close to the ruler, its function is mainly deliberative.  Of great importance is a separate layer of nobility, which is close to its head and completely devoted to it.  It is not appointed, but recognized by a special religious council called the Mejlis al Ulema. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imamat is" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1296154.jpg" width="250"></div></h2><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The Imamat is a state that, despite its theocratic character, has a coherent and fairly flexible management system.  Under the supreme ruler is a special advisory body - the Majlis al-Shura.  In addition, the position of the vizier (or naib), who heads the main office, acquired particular importance.  Separately, it should be said about the judicial system.  It consists of two levels: <span>Sharia courts</span> and military tribunals.  The first of them are based on ordinary people's law, so such judges have a fairly high weight in society. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caucasian imamat" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1296142.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The imamat is a structure in which religion plays a particularly important role.  The ruler of such a state is not just a political and social head, he is perceived by residents and the population as a spiritual and religious leader.  Therefore, his personal qualities are especially important: in the eyes of Muslims, he must be honest, noble, smart, and well versed in teaching.  While the caliph, for example, is an elected person, and he also performs secular functions.  Under the imamate, the state takes care of the spiritual state of Muslims, while in the caliphate it also performs secular functions.  There are also differences in the doctrine of the hidden imam.  In the first case, according to Muslim beliefs, he should become the supreme ruler, while in the second case it is assumed that he will be an authoritative religious figure, but at the same time preserves the institution of power of Sheikh ul-Islam. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imamat state" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1296140.jpg" width="443"></div></h2><h2>  State </h2><p>  The Caucasian imamate existed in the 19th century: from 1834 to 1859.  The prerequisite for its formation was the movement of Imam Mysore, who in the previous century sought independence of this territory, struggled with <span>blood feud</span> and feudal fragmentation.  This led to the <span>Russian-Caucasian wars,</span> and although the imam himself was captured, the mountaineers won, nevertheless, because they retained the Chechen and Dagestan territories.  However, after some time, after a lull, General Yermolov was appointed to this region, which led to a further clash and confrontation between the parties.  Then the highlanders united in alliances, and in this way the imamat state was created.  Shamil was his third ruler.  He and previous rulers came from the accident, and the new political entity itself included Chechen, Dagestan, and Circassian lands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of an imamate" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1296137.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Device </h2><p>  The creation of the imamate occurred as a result of the struggle of the highlanders against the royal troops.  Its core was the accident and Chechnya.  It was divided into three dozen districts, most of them.  His official language was Arabic.  In addition, in the state there was a code of laws - Nizam, which served almost all <span>spheres of public life.</span>  This code was based on Sharia, <span>customary law, the</span> norms and rules of which were adapted to the needs of the life of a new political entity.  This legislative compilation was adopted and approved during the reign of Imam Shamil.  The supreme ruler, the imam, was not only the spiritual and religious head, but also the commander of the troops and the chief judge.  Under him consisted of a council - a sofa - and direct control on the ground was carried out through naibs, governors.  The judicial system consisted of several levels: the muftis made up the upper layer, and the cadias submitted to them. </p>

    <p>  Viceroyhood enjoyed a certain autonomy, but if the naib suffered, for example, defeat, then, as a rule, he was removed from his post.  Under his leadership were special commanders of military units.  Gradually, the power of the naibs increased. </p><h2>  Troop organization </h2><p>  Shamil created a regular army, which consisted of cavalry (murtazeks) and infantry (lower classes).  At first, the mountaineers used captured weapons, but later they managed to build their own weapons production plants.  The main part of the army was Avars, the second place was occupied by Chechens.  The ruler created a real state management system in his state: an effective tax system and a permanent control body were introduced under him.  Shamil did a lot to strengthen his power: he sought to subjugate, pacify other local rulers.  He rallied the villages under his authority, showing at the same time considerable administrative and state abilities.  Very soon he became a dangerous adversary, so the Russian troops had to overcome his resistance for several decades.  Thus, an understanding of what an imamate is in history is of great importance not only for Muslim civilization, but also in relation to our state. </p>
