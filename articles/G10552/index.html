    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  In the outdated brochures you can still see the old name of the same hotel complex: Leganya Beach Ex Mari Beach.  To avoid possible confusion, we note that, despite a different name, this is the same hotel.  Transfer from the airport to the hotel complex takes 35 minutes.  On the way, you can see almost the entire Mahmutlar.  After all, he, in fact, is buildings along the highway, as well as on two or three streets perpendicular to it. </p><p>  However, for a tourist in Mahmutlar to buy fresh fruits, cheese, oriental sweets is not a problem.

    <p>  However, the sea itself in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach is worthy of the most flattering reviews: turquoise, crystal clear.  Swimming in it is a pleasure. </p><p>  However, car rental tourists have the opportunity to visit the best <span>beaches of Antalya.</span>  According to reviews, a wonderful comfortable beach vacation with water attractions is guaranteed by Lara Beach, especially loved by Russian-speaking tourists;  Olympos - a beach surrounded by pine forests, a very cozy secluded beach Adalar. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Catering for tourists provides the main restaurant of the hotel Leganya Beach Hotel 3 *.  European and local dishes are prepared.  And more - local.  After all, the hotel has almost no tourists from the New World and Western Europe.  Mostly Russians and Turks rest here.

Very tasty local coffee. </p><h2>  Alanya Infrastructure </h2><p>  Active guests of the Leganya Beach Hotel (Turkey), having breakfast, go either on an excursion or shop.  To buy goods of interest, most guests go to the center of Alanya, to Ataturk Street.  It is crossed by numerous streets with leather, jewelry, souvenir shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="leganya beach turkey" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1107933.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For those who decide to buy precious items, according to hotel guests, it makes sense to visit the Baran Club Jewelery boutique and Sifalar Jewelery store.  Their range is impressive.  As a leather store, tourists liked Baran Club more than others, as well as the ‚ÄúWorld of Leather in Alanya‚Äù, where prices are more affordable. </p><p>  However, they are not fixed at all, so the buyer should bring down the price declared by the seller to a more acceptable and real one.  For example, when buying a terry dressing gown, you should be guided by the price of $ 10, figures from onyx - $ 7-8, women's leather jacket - $ 300, men's autumn - $ 488;  women's like coat - $ 550. </p><p>  Note that cunning traders inflate prices by 2-2.5 times. </p><p>  Tourists who do not know how to bargain prefer to shop in stores with fixed prices.  Supermarkets ‚ÄúAlanium‚Äù and ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù are the largest of them. </p><p>  For those who want to enjoy the night club life of Antalya, young and perky guests recommend the Antalyan club Mothnam and the Shida club.  Relatively inexpensive, you can relax in the "Club 29".  Fans of alternating a disco with the consumption of spirits prefer the Dedeman club. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The Leganya Beach Hotel is close to the cheap tour desk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya leganya beach hotel" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/1107932.jpg" width="600"></div>  Guests resort to his services, especially not bothering the guides who sell excursions at exorbitant prices.

Leganya Beach Hotel provides its guests the opportunity to park rented cars.

    <p>  In general, according to guests' reviews, the hotel complex really provides high-quality services of a three-star vacation. </p><p>  At the end of this article, I want to remind you that the quality of rest, especially in small hotels, largely depends on your friendly attitude to the staff that ensures your vacation.  Be friendly, smile!  Learn some Turkish phrases, and your vacation will go in a friendly atmosphere.  In Turkish, our "hello" is translated as a merhabah;  "goodbye" - hoshchakal;  "thank you" - Saol.  The bartenders of the hotel are funny companion guys.  If you savor drinks sometimes and say: erefe (‚ÄúFor a meeting‚Äù - the most common Turkish toast), you will become an honored guest of this place. </p>
