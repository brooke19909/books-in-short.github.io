But do mobile gadget lovers share this view? </p><h2>  Features: user reviews </h2><p>  According to some users, the frequency of 1.6 GHz is not enough to perform modern tasks.  However, in this case, the decisive role is played by another - the Atom Z2560 chip technology.  The specificity of this chip lies in the ability to quickly process 3D graphics at a relatively low frequency.  Thus, the processor in this case is a factor of high-performance smartphone. </p><p>  Regarding the other characteristics, users generally rate them quite positively.  And this is not surprising, because the device is equipped with an HD-display made using modern technology, quite competitive performance in RAM and flash memory, and also supports basic communication standards. </p><p>  The general opinion of users about the characteristics of the device we have studied.  Now consider the specifics of the design of the device. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Asus Zenfon 5 phone has a plastic case.  It can be noted that it also has a small metal part in the lower part.  Among other noteworthy design decisions implemented in the device, one can note the placement of an 3.5 mm audio slot in the upper part of the case.  SIM card slots are located under the back cover of the device.  Despite the rather large thickness of the device, its design visually makes the smartphone very compact. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What does Asus Zenfon 5 look like?

    <p>  In the design of the device‚Äôs case there are no pronounced sharp corners, the device looks pretty strict and solid.  In general, the concept is at the level of leading solutions from the brand.  The plastic insert located under the touch buttons looks interesting: when light falls on it, it shimmers beautifully. </p><p>  Key buttons - ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, as well as the one that causes recent applications, are located at a fairly large distance.  This is convenient, since in the probability of missing the desired option and engaging another is minimal.  It should be noted that many users are accustomed to a shorter distance between the corresponding touch controls. </p><p>  The back panel, as well as the end elements of the device case, are made of rubberized plastic, which is characterized by resistance to pollution. </p><p>  On the left side of the device is a key to adjust the sound level, as well as a button to turn on the device.  It can be noted that the material of their manufacture is similar to that used in the production of the marked plastic insert, which is slightly lower than the touch buttons.  That is, the keys in question can also beautifully shimmer in the light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Users note the high definition of the image on the screen that the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone has.  Testimonials from mobile gadget lovers include very positive assessments of the quality of the display when viewing small text.  It can be noted that for fans of reading, the smartphone has a special mode.

Setting up the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone in terms of activating the corresponding option is very simple.  You just need to enter the menu item on the interface, which sets the screen settings.  True, the sensitivity of the sensor when using the device with gloves is significantly lower.  But it is enough to answer an incoming call or read SMS. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  In modifications of the phone intended for delivery to the Russian market, an Atom Z2560 processor is installed, operating at a frequency of 1.6 GHz.  It may seem that this characteristic of the chip looks modest against the background of many competitive solutions.

    <p>  The device interface allows you to quickly access any options that interest the user.  In order to use the ‚ÄúAsus Zenfon 5‚Äù settings in the part of the camera or communications, you will need to spend literally a few seconds.  Difficulties with installing third-party applications from the Google Play store and its analogues are almost not fixed by users. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Another important aspect in which we can explore the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone is the characteristics of the device in terms of sound.  The quality of the conversational speaker users is not particularly complaints.  The interlocutor's speech is heard perfectly.  The functioning of the headphones, which are connected to the device through a standard 3.5 mm jack, is also evaluated by experts and users quite positively.  But according to some experts, the external speaker located on the rear panel of the device does not work loudly enough.  Although, as many enthusiasts of mobile electronics note, the corresponding hardware component of a smartphone in practice is used, as a rule, not too often. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The phone supports basic modern communication standards.  Using them in practice is very simple.  How to configure ‚ÄúAsus Zenfon 5‚Äù in terms of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth?  Such questions are practically not raised on thematic online portals, where lovers of mobile electronics communicate.  Similarly, there is no problem connecting the device to a computer via a USB cable.  Immediately after connecting the device and the PC through this cable, Windows detects the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone.  An instruction that would detail the nuances of the corresponding device activation mode is not required for users. </p><h2>  Phone memory </h2><p>  The RAM of the device is 2 GB.  This indicator is enough to launch most modern programs adapted for the Android platform.  The built-in flash memory of the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone is 16 GB.  If necessary, it can be increased due to additional microSD modules.  Hot swapping of memory card data is supported, in which it is not necessary to turn off the device. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery with which the device is equipped differs in a non-removable type, its capacity is 2110 mAh.  To many, she may seem modest.  However, in practice, users are able to achieve more than decent results in terms of battery life of the device.  So, in the video viewing mode in high quality and at the maximum brightness level of the battery resources of the Asus Zenfon 5 phone (many experts testify to similar results), it lasts for about 4.5 hours.  In reading mode, the device can work without recharging for about 9 hours.  At an average intensity of using the device, it should be enough for about a day. </p>

    <p>  But if necessary, you can always use one of the energy-saving modes that are implemented in the device.  So, among the most effective is the reduction in processor frequency.  You can also carry out the necessary configuration of applications in order to increase the battery life of the device. </p><h2>  Using two SIM cards </h2><p>  In the Asus Zenfon 5 smartphone (user reviews indicate that the corresponding option is extremely popular), 2 SIM-cards are supported right away.  However, there is only one radio module in the device.  Therefore, if a person is talking using one SIM card, then the second temporarily loses functionality.  Users greatly praise the SIM management interface.  So, you can always quickly choose the one with which it is desirable to call one or another number, for example, due to the fact that the current tariff is adapted for calling subscribers of a particular operator. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Asus Zenfon 5 phone (reviews of many experts describe it that way) has no direct competitors in its price segment.
