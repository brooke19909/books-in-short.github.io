In recent years, it has gained momentum, and it is no longer easy for everyone to understand the new products that appear on the market.  Everyone has long known LCD TVs, but few can explain the name of the device.  In fact, the technology appeared long ago, not to mention when liquid crystals became known. </p><h2>  Abbreviation </h2><p>  So, as you already understood, today we will consider televisions with a liquid crystal screen.  If you ever had to choose a similar technique or monitor for yourself, then you have often come across incomprehensible abbreviations such as LCD or LCD.  What does it mean?  And if you can easily guess that the LCD is a liquid crystal, then not everyone knows what LCD is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="flat screen tv" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1999819.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The last abbreviation is also related to our topic.  In English it stands for <span>liquid crystal display, which</span> in translation again brings us back to the liquid crystal display.  That is, LCD and LCD are one and the same.  Therefore, when choosing a TV, do not look for the difference between these concepts. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  This kind of screens first appeared in simple electronics.  It was used in the manufacture of thermometers with a screen, players, watches, telephones, etc. This type acquired a monochrome display, and received multicolor thanks to the RGB triad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now this display is used in a variety of devices.  These are computer monitors, laptops, televisions, telephones, cameras, e-books and much more. </p><p>  Over time, a display with a matrix appeared.  Thus, a tool for controlling thin-film transistors was added to the screen.  And to the abbreviation LCD began to add TFT and other <span>types of matrixes.</span> </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  The LCD TV did not appear immediately.  Back in 1888, liquid crystals were found.  Already after 40 years, a technology was created that began to be used in modern displays.  The first attempts to create such a screen were made in the 70s of the last century.  RCA was able to produce a monochrome product based on this material. </p><p>  This gave an impetus to the active use of new items in various electronics.  A color version of the LCD appeared in 1987.  Sharp, now known for its TV models, has released a three-inch color screen. </p><p>  The development of screens for laptops has also contributed to the development of LCD displays.  After applying the new technology, flaws were noticeable.  Initially used black and white matrices.  When they decided to try the color version, a lot of problems got out.  The static picture looked tolerable, but the slightest movement blurred the image. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD TV device" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2001378.jpg" width="550"></div>

Soon, the mass production of monitors began.  Already at the beginning of the 21st century, televisions began to appear, but small sizes: up to 15 inches. </p><h2>  How it works </h2><p>  Explain how the LCD screen works is not easy.  Especially people who are not technically savvy.  In order not to go into details that will completely confuse everyone, let's start with the elements. </p><p>  Obviously, the display consists of several parts.  They are conditionally represented by layers.  There is an LCD matrix.  Previously, it was a flat bag with glass plates.  Between the layers were liquid crystals.  At the beginning of the 21st century, all internal elements were replaced by more flexible ones made using polymers. </p><p>  The display has a light source that illuminates the picture.  All this is enclosed in a housing, and the electricity comes from the wires. </p><p>  Naturally, this is not the end of the screen.  The LCD matrix can also be represented in parts.  Its pixel has transparent electrodes between which there is a layer of molecules.  All this works with a pair of polarizing filters. </p><p>  If the whole structure is at rest, that is, without applying voltage, the molecules are in an amorphous state.  If electricity comes in, they line up toward the electric field, distorting their original structure.  A thin-film transistor is responsible for the color in the screen.  It works on the RGB color scheme.  Each pixel is born out of three color cells.  The color difference is affected by the magnitude of the electric charge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD TV repair" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2001377.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  <span>The device of the TV</span> with a liquid crystal screen allowed these models to break into the bestseller.  The first thing worth noting is the variety of sizes.  If you compare displays with a kinescope and without it, it becomes clear that the manufacturer has many opportunities for creating all kinds of models. </p><p>  The LCD panel weighs a little and takes up less space on the desktop.  New products have lost focusing issues.  Thanks to the use of technology, flaws were also lost with clarity at high resolutions.  Almost all LCD monitors have become digital.  Therefore, the graphics card does not need to work with digital-to-analog conversions.  But even in this case, manufacturers have learned to get out of situations with unwanted artifacts if the monitor is connected to VGA. </p><p>  As a result, we can say that such screens have become more economical both in cost and in occupied territory.  They ceased to "poison" the user with electromagnetic radiation.  Annoying flickers disappeared, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen itself expanded noticeably. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  But, of course, not everything is so smooth.  There are problems that may turn out to be invisible to the average user, but they are also worth remembering.  For example, image clarity is achieved only with a certain resolution.  If you change it, then only through interpolation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to wipe the LCD screen of the TV" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1999823.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As for the electron beam monitors, LCDs do not have sufficient contrast and black depth.  Below is the speed of the picture change.  Contrast depends on viewing angles.  Often you have to deal with the replacement of the LCD screen on the TV, since most budget models are not protected from mechanical damage.  And if the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot covered with a protective glass, then even a slight pressure leads to degradation. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  However, at the moment this is the most popular form of displays.  Choosing a TV from a variety is not easy.  Buyers encounter difficulties at the very first stage - choosing a manufacturer. </p><p>  But even if you miss this moment and consider all the existing models on the market, you need to take a few individual parameters for yourself.  For example, immediately determine the <span>size of the screen.</span>  If you need a TV in the kitchen, 21 inches is enough.  If we are talking about the living room, then here you can buy a 75-inch screen. </p><p>  The brightness and contrast settings are unlikely to help you, since on average everything looks the same.  But the appearance may affect your decision.  Here you already need to select models by color, design, etc. </p><p>  Many try to pay attention to technical specifications.  You can buy a regular TV, which will simply show TV shows and no more.  There is an option to buy a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù model that has access to the Internet, games and other useful functions. </p><p>  By 2017, a trend has been identified by which users choose their model.  It turned out that most prefer 40-43-inch displays.  A popular manufacturer among all was Samsung.  Although he is not inferior to LCD TVs from LG. </p><h2>  Giant </h2><p>  Reviewing all existing models is not easy.  In addition, each buyer is looking for something individual.  But talk about the most popular and attractive realistically.  So, relatively recently, a real giant appeared on the market - Samsung UE75ES9007U.  This is a 75 inch LCD TV.  Its resolution is 1920x1080 with an aspect ratio of 16: 9. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replacing the LCD screen on the TV" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1999824.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The model supports digital and cable broadcasting of various systems.  It has many interfaces for connecting additional devices: Ethernet, USB, D-Sub, audio output.  There is gesture control technology, teletext, picture-in-picture, etc. </p><p>  But you should not expect another for such a diagonal and quality.  Before us is an almost frameless model with a large stand at the bottom.  If you hang it on the wall, it seems that in front of us is a picture hanging in the air. </p><h2>  Station wagon </h2><p>  A popular universal model was the LCD TV LG 43UH610V.  To say that this is a budget model is difficult.  Nevertheless, for such sizes and functionality - it is practically for nothing. </p><p>  This TV has a slightly larger frame than the previous one.  But the model still refers to the unspoken class of "frameless".  She stands on two small legs.  The diagonal, as the name implies, is 43 inches.  Resolution - 4K, and this is perhaps the main advantage. </p><p>  The TV has an advanced feature set.  It works with Smart TV and is equipped with various technologies that affect both sound and picture quality.  He got a lot of ports and connectors.  In general, a worthy option for those who do not require a lot, but want a reliable model with wide functionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how the liquid crystal screen works" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1999822.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Care </h2><p>  Any technique requires care.  Therefore, you need to watch TVs.  In addition, the situations are different.  On the Internet, people often ask how to wipe the LCD screen of the TV.  Someone easily copes with a wet rag, and then complains about problems with the device.  To do this, it is better to read additional information. </p><p>  There are several options for how to effectively clean the model of dirt and dust.  The easiest is to purchase special napkins.  They help eliminate static electricity, do not cause damage and are free from abrasive substances. </p><p>  You can use simple dry wipes or microfiber wipes.  The latter copes well with dust, stains and stains.  You can moisten them with water. </p><p>  The stores may offer a special spray.  Such a liquid does not have alcohol or allergens.  In addition, according to the manufacturer, it covers the equipment with a special protective layer. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  In order not to take the device to repair LCD TV screens after such cleaning, it is better to follow some rules.  It is advisable to remove dust with a lint-free cloth.  You can‚Äôt press on the screen, because not every matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãprotected by glass and can bend.  Sprays and other liquids must not be sprayed onto the screen.  They need to be sprayed onto the fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD screen dripped what to do" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1999818.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The napkin should not be very wet.  To clean the dirt from the joints of the screen, you can take cotton buds or tampons.  Every time you need to use new napkins.  And of course, you cannot clean when the TV is turned on. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  Sometimes models get severely damaged.  Hence, popular questions such as: "If a liquid crystal screen has flowed, what should I do?"  As practice shows, such a breakdown occurs more often due to mechanical damage.  Sometimes situations are comic, for example, your cat decided to tag the device.  This also affects the performance of the screen. </p><p>  Do not fix such a breakdown yourself.  You can, of course, find out the type of matrix and look for a replacement.  But you still have to contact the service center to have your display replaced. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Televisions with <span>LCD screens</span> have long been included in our lives.  Now millions use such models.  They have become more beautiful, more compact, better.  Manufacturers annually develop new technologies so that monitors show a good picture. </p><p>  Choosing such a TV is not difficult.  You need to calculate the amount that you can spend on, then decide on the screen size and, possibly, choose a manufacturer.  And then it's up to the small. </p>
