    <h2>  Beach, pool </h2><p>  Crete is famous for its sandy - pebble beaches with clean and warm sea water.  Entrance to the city beaches is usually free.  Even in the "hot" tourist months there is no need to take up seats in advance or to book sunbeds and umbrellas - all vacationers are freely accommodated in the coastal zone.  The three main Cretan beaches, including the famous beach and Star Beach water park, are deservedly marked with a blue flag. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Mari Kristin Beach Hotel is located on the first coastline, so the road to a small hotel beach takes only a few minutes.  The beach, as noted by former hotel guests, is pretty good, equipped with sunbeds.  The coastal water is clean, but some tourists did not like the entry into the water.  Here, as on all Cretan beaches, you can rent equipment for water sports and entertainment. </p><p>  The pool at the Mari Kristin Beach Hotel is quite an unusual geometric shape.  Former hotel guests often mention that the water is fresh, chlorinated and fairly clean.  Near the pool there is a small area equipped with comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  Reviews from tourists about the staff of Mari Kristin Beach Hotel are more than positive.  Often, attention is also paid to the hospitality with which the owner of the hotel and her relatives relate to the guests, helping her in the hotel.  Also about the hotel staff you can find such reviews: </p><ul><li>  Hotel staff communicates with guests politely.  Requests that relate to the organization of additional services or repair of faults in the room are fulfilled quickly and efficiently. </li><li>  The hotel has a Russian-speaking staff.  In addition to Russian and Greek, employees can be explained in English, French, German and Italian. </li><li>  Most of the guests were satisfied with the quality of cleaning and room service. </li><li>  Often celebrate the work of bartenders and waiters in a hotel bar: here they not only serve delicious cocktails, but also serve guests with a smile and funny jokes. </li></ul><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Dining in the hotel restaurant is organized like a buffet.  The price includes breakfast and dinner.  In addition, it is very convenient for hotel guests to taste Mediterranean cuisine in the Petalida restaurant on the seafront, where all hotel guests receive a 10% discount on the bill.  Talking about a hotel restaurant, tourists most often note such details: </p><ul><li>  Most of all positive impressions leave dinners at the hotel.  It serves real home cooking.  A variety of dishes of fish, meat, seafood, vegetables, an excellent selection of side dishes and desserts are prepared daily.  The breakfast menu is somewhat more modest, but it is difficult to stay hungry - from the morning menu, any guest can choose breakfast to taste. </li><li>  Cozy clean dining room. </li><li>  Excellent service in the hotel restaurant and bar. </li><li>  Quality alcohol and a variety of delicious cocktails. </li><li>  I would like to note one more plus: the lack of complaints about common problems of all-inclusive restaurants in the reviews - queues, lack of clean plates or dirt on dining tables.  There are no such unpleasant phenomena in the bar and restaurant Mari Kristin. </li></ul>

Quarters located in the heart of Hersonissos are often called one big glamorous party.  Here you can find an incredible number of nightclubs for every taste, including establishments, the entrance to which is completely free. </p><p>  Fans of shopping will surely enjoy a huge selection of shopping centers and local shops offering everything from local goods to products of world brands.  As souvenirs from Hersonissos you can take away not only seashells, but also voiced local ceramics, natural cosmetics, olive oil or exquisite jewelry.  In addition, it is no secret that shoes and clothes in Cretan stores, as in all of Greece, are much cheaper than in Russia. </p><p>  Of particular note are the Cretan water parks.  This is where the famous Star Beach, water park and entertainment complex on a separate island is located.  In the suburbs of Hersonessos there is an equally interesting Aqua Splash water park with fun animated programs.  For lovers of outdoor activities in the city, there is the opportunity to practice any kind of water sports, and there is also a respectable golf club just 4 km from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions, sights </h2><p>  What attractions can I see at Mari Kristin Beach Hotel?  Greece and the island of Crete, like an open-air museum, provide an opportunity to see the architectural monuments of ancient history.  The exposition of local museums includes unique archaeological artifacts discovered during excavations in the places of ancient Greek cities.  In Hersonissos itself there are not so many interesting historical objects, in comparison with the Greek cities located on the mainland.  But it is in the city that the main and most famous Cretan attraction is located - Knossos Palace, under which the labyrinth of the Minotaur is located.  In addition, tourists will be interested to see the remains of ancient stone theaters, the Roman seaport or the ancient Christian basilica. </p><p>  No less interesting will be excursions to the capital city of Heraklion and other villages of Crete, as well as boat trips to small local islets.  Guests at the Mari Kristin Beach Hotel can choose any sightseeing tour in a small agency located opposite the hotel or explore the island on their own, traveling by rented transport. </p>
