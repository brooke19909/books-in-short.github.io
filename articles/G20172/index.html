Some urgently need their own living space, but there is no money to buy an apartment, others go for the same in connection with moving to another city for work, while still others have started a family and want to escape from their parent wing as soon as possible.  There may be other reasons, but regardless of them, it is important to know how to correctly purchase a room in a hostel.  Let's look at this issue in more detail and find out what pitfalls should be considered when doing this. </p><h2>  The main subtleties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dorm room" class="if uuid-2816850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816850.jpg"></div><p>  Buying a dormitory room (pitfalls can be very different) is a very serious decision that can cause a lot of problems for legally uninhibited people.  In order to play it safe, it is recommended to ask the seller to provide a certificate in form 7 and 9 before concluding the contract. The last document provides information about all the people registered in the property.  If at least one of the tenants does not agree with the sale, then officially it will be impossible to conclude a deal in accordance with all the rules of the law, and therefore it will be considered invalid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When looking for housing, you should consider options in relatively new buildings.  In old Khrushchev, as a rule, poor living conditions, so you have to spend extra money on landscaping.  Therefore, before the purchase of housing in the hostel will be carried out, carefully carry out a technical inspection of the property and make sure that there is all the necessary documentation. </p><h2>  Room or apartment: which is better? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.society19.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spacious dorm room" class="if uuid-2816867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816867.jpg"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at this.  Saving on housing is not worth it, as this can turn out to be very expensive subsequently.  The cost of real estate is largely determined by its technical condition and convenience for living.  At the same time, the price of cheap rooms and apartments does not differ too much from the average market. </p><p>  You should never trust sellers, because they will not provide information that is true, especially if they urgently need money.  As practice shows, buying an apartment in a hostel often ends with resettlement in worse options.  Therefore, you need to carefully weigh everything, study the current state of affairs in the secondary market and carefully carry out calculations of future acquisitions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the choice - a room or an apartment - the first option is less preferable, since it significantly limits the possibilities.  Firstly, the area will be very small, and secondly, it‚Äôs necessary to put up with neighbors, not all of whom are peace-loving people.  And financial feasibility is not one of the best.  The cost per square meter of the room is higher than in the apartment. </p><h2>  Legal Aspects </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dorm room purchase" class="if uuid-2816852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816852.jpg"></div><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  If you decide that buying a dorm room is ideal for you, then you need to study the whole background of this process.  Immediately it is worth noting that it is better to conclude a deal directly with the seller, bypassing intermediaries, since this way you will be able to save on commissions pretty well.  However, in this case, you will not be able to avoid all the problems, the solution of which requires the help of qualified specialists who have experience in matters of interest to you. </p><p>  If the property is not privatized, then its owner does not play a significant role in concluding a purchase / sale agreement.  But it‚Äôs a completely different matter if the owner is the first person to have the right to make any transactions with living space.  But here it is critically important that a statement of refusal be made correctly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What role do neighbors play? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.faith.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for buying a room" class="if uuid-2816857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816857.jpg"></div><p>  This aspect should be given special attention.  The purchase of a dormitory room (professional advice will be given at the end of the article) is a difficult process from the legal point of view, as various problems may arise when trying to get a rejection from neighbors.  In addition to the relevant statements, it will be necessary to take documents from the guardianship authorities if persons under the age of majority are registered in the dwelling. </p><p>  This is where the "Child Protection Act" comes into force.  Parents cannot just take and buy square meters.  In the future, such a deal could turn into very big problems.  Firstly, the buyer will have to spend extra money, and secondly, the transaction can be completely canceled.  To avoid this, it is necessary to notify all residents in advance of their intention to sell the property and the estimated cost.  According to the current legislation, interest holders will have 30 calendar days to make a decision.  If they do not agree or cannot buy back the share, then the rightful owner will be able to make any housing transactions without any problems. </p><h2>  Options for documentary support </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.usforacle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a dorm room" class="if uuid-2816864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816864.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes you can find ads for the sale of two real estate properties that are in the same building in the neighborhood.  Their total area is comparable to a full-fledged apartment, so buying a room in a hostel is very profitable.  Documents at the conclusion of the transaction must be studied very carefully, since in the event of their privatization, the alternate acquisition and separation of shares will be impossible. </p><p>  So, what is needed to complete a transaction: </p><ul><li>  documents on the room, confirming the ownership; </li><li>  if the dwelling has been privatized, then a technical passport and a certificate of privatization are still needed; </li><li>  passport and owner code, as well as all registered in the room; </li><li>  certificate of family composition of the owner; </li><li>  if there are children who are not 18 years old, then it is still necessary to obtain permission from the guardianship authority for alienation; </li><li>  assessment assessment report. </li></ul><p>  It is important to find out how the property was privatized: under a world deal or in court.  In the latter case, the lawsuit is valid for 3 years, after which the homeowner may lose the right of ownership.  As a result of this, the contract will be considered invalid and the buyer may lose his money. </p><p>  Find out which organization the building in which you want to purchase living space belongs to.  Based on this, you can form an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe contingent living in the house.  Also collect information on whether utility bills are regularly paid.  If not, there is a high probability of turning off hot water or light.  Therefore, buying a dorm room in a mortgage or for cash will not be the most successful solution.  In addition, if you decide to take housing on credit, then you need to find a suitable bank. </p><p>  As a rule, financial institutions put forward the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  the borrower must be at least 20 years old; </li><li>  persons over 75 years of age are not issued a loan; </li><li>  official employment; </li><li>  must be a surety; </li><li>  with a negative credit history, you can not count on a loan. </li></ul><h2>  Possible loopholes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.elsavalle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="buying a dorm room in a mortgage" class="if uuid-2816856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816856.jpg"></div><p>  If in a communal apartment live harmful neighbors who do not want to sell a room, this does not mean that you can not buy a house.  The issue can be resolved by donating real estate.  However, such a loophole has a downside.  There is no guarantee that other tenants will normally accept you, and not begin to build various intrigues. </p><p>  There are also certain pitfalls in buying a room in a former dormitory through gift giving.  Here, ill-wishers can take advantage of Article 170 of the Civil Code, which refers to one transaction acting as sham and covering up another. </p><p>  Therefore, the best option is a peaceful settlement of the issue, when all parties have come to an agreement.  This is the only way to avoid various problems in the future. </p><h2>  What problems do people face when choosing communal housing? </h2><p>  Lack of legal knowledge can play a trick when buying a property.  This is especially true in cases where a room or apartment was previously privatized, but then, in connection with changes in legislation, a repeated procedure is required.  In this case, the tenants cannot be resettled, and therefore the purchase / sale agreement cannot be concluded.  In this situation, the stagnant process can drag on for months, or even years, as well as terms of repurchase will be less profitable.  Therefore, the best option is to agree with the neighbors. </p><h2>  Recommendations of specialists </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.t-flower-shop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy dormitory housing" class="if uuid-2816871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2816871.jpg"></div><p>  If you are interested in buying a dorm room, legal advice will help you do everything right and avoid a lot of pitfalls.  Therefore, before proceeding with the transaction, you need to consult with a specialist on all issues.  Professionals recommend that uninformed people trust the entire process to experienced lawyers or study the current legislation well so that after signing the contract there is nothing to complain about.  This will allow you to protect yourself and not throw money away. </p>
