    <h2>  The emergence and formation of the park </h2><p>  Here is the park of the centenary of St. Petersburg - the youngest in the city - was laid on waste land, in addition, they used to be periodically flooded.  In 2003, the Northern capital celebrated its 300th anniversary.  The date was celebrated magnificently.  It was timed to coincide with the commissioning of several significant facilities, including the Park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, founded in 1995.  Its territory is large - 91 (89) hectares.  But these are the initial figures - after the celebration of the 300th anniversary, part of the land was seized from him, on which, in particular, the Peterland water park was erected.  Now the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park itself is 54 hectares. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park of the centenary of St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1025182.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Park location </h2><p>  The Three Centennial Park (the youngest park zone of the Northern capital) is located on the Gulf of Finland, in the northwestern part of the city, in the northern part of the Neva Bay (or the Marquise Puddle - the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland), on the border of the Neva Lowland.  Next to it are the Piterland Water Park and the Seaside Victory Park and Central Park of Culture and Culture.  Elagin and Krestovsky islands also belong to this green zone.  The park itself is incredibly beautiful, especially when viewed from a bird's eye view.  It differs from the rest of the green areas of the city by its original <span>landscape design.</span> </p><h2>  The symbolic number "300" </h2><p>  It became possible to break the park of the centennial of St. Petersburg only after <span>strengthening the coast,</span> backfilling the soil under the park zone, building storm and general alloy sewers.  After that, a fence was built and lawns and flower beds were planned.  The number of plants in the park is symbolic - at the time of laying, 300 decorative apple trees were planted, received as a gift from the capital of Finland (Helsinki).  Institutions and organizations of the city also presented the future park with 300 seedlings of the most valuable species. </p>

    <p>  Shrubs planted also in the amount of 300 pieces - a gift from the German Savings Bank.  To the bushes, he added another 70 seedlings of linden. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the center of the park there is a pool and fountains, as well as a 22-meter lighthouse-style column.  It is granite, the number of tiers on it corresponds to the age of the city.  It is planned that over time the names of people who played a role in the formation of the Northern capital will be carved on the lighthouse. </p><h2>  Individual touch </h2><p>  Each park in St. Petersburg has its own zest.  Has it and the Park of the Three Centennial.  At the end of May 2012, a monument to Francisco de Miranda was erected here, an exact copy of the monument in Caracas.  It somehow happened that the sculpture of the fighter for the independence of Venezuela in the minds of the townspeople gained fame as a powerful talisman of a happy family life. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centenary park how to get" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1025184.jpg" width="600"></div>  Moreover, in St. Petersburg there are many other places where the newlyweds usually came, but the monument to the smoothie and gallant gentleman supposedly still has unspent power.  And the newlyweds come and go here.

    <h2>  Revolutionary and smoothie </h2><p>  Francisco de Miranda really fought for the independence of his country from Spanish domination, but he did not refuse himself earthly joys, and he kept a very frank diary.  His name was even associated with the name of the Great Empress.  But these are unconfirmed conjectures.  True, Catherine II helped him with protection from the machinations of the royal court in Madrid and a large sum of money for a good cause.  And on the third attempt, de Miranda entered Venezuela. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centenary park saint petersburg" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1025185.jpg" width="600"></div>  But he could not hold power.  The revolutionary ended his days more than sadly - he died chained with iron chains to the wall in the La Carraca prison in Spain.  The Centennial Park has become very popular at any time of the year thanks to the monument to the revolutionary and adventurer, don Juan and aristocrat Francisco de Miranda.

    <h2>  The pearl of not only the water park </h2><p>  But this monument is not the only object that attracts visitors to its park.  Peterland - the water park that has the highest dome in the world (45 meters, it is visible from Peterhof) - is a striking landmark of the whole city.  It is the largest in Europe: its area is 25,000 square meters.  meters, capacity - 2000 people.  In general, Peterland is a huge <span>shopping and entertainment center,</span> and the water park is its integral part. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park of the centenary of St. Petersburg how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1025186.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is equipped in accordance with all the latest high standards for such facilities.  It is also interesting that its dome is covered with a special film that makes it possible to sunbathe year-round, as it transmits ultraviolet rays.  And what is there in this water park! </p><h2>  Water attractions </h2><p>  There are several pools, including the ‚Äúwave‚Äù and for diving.  The depth of the latter is 6 meters.  There is an attraction "Lazy River", on the coast of which you can take an inflatable raft and "rafting" along it.  In certain places, rapids, waterfalls and funnels appear.  There are only 12 different types of saunas and baths, five Gorka attractions, the highest and longest of which is blue - equal to 202 meters, and the smallest - red and light green - 33 meters each, green and orange - 153 and 86 meters each respectively.  This beautiful modern water park has made the Three Centennial Park (St. Petersburg) very attractive for citizens and guests of Northern Palmyra.  There are also schools for surfing and diving.  You can find out about all the wonders of Peterland and the services provided, the list of which is quite impressive, on special resources. </p><h2>  Park Features </h2><p>  The indisputable advantage of the Park of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg is the free and wireless Internet.  There are no time limits for visitors to the park.  Large enough (length - 1 km, width - 100 meters) the beach has a volleyball court and all the necessary infrastructure.  Here you can relax and sunbathe.  True, it is not recommended to swim in this place by the Ministry of Emergencies, and not only because of the cold water: ships pass here, and fuel oil is often poured on the surface of the bay with rainbow colors.  But this does not bother visitors, especially on hot days. </p><h2>  Playground </h2><p>  The park is very tempting in winter - there are many slides for children, and adults can go skiing.  It can be added that the holidays of the city and the country are celebrated here on a large scale, for example, Victory Day, Shrovetide, Children's Day.  Even pillow fights are held here, and since 2011, events to launch flashlights have been systematically held.  Master classes, events like the Famely fest, Youth Against Drugs and many others are constantly held in the park.  In July 2015, one of the 12 most significant Russian festivals of this type, the VKontakte Festival, took place in the 300th Anniversary Park.  The park territory was divided into several zones (15 in total) - prototypes of VKontakte communities.  The purpose of the festival is to erase the boundaries between real and virtual communication.  So, in the area dedicated to art, graffiti lessons, a sand sculpture contest and dance master classes were held. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the centenary park" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/1025187.jpg" width="567"></div>
