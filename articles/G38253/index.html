    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Well, we are starting to study the ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù social project (MTS) with you.  What is it, you ask?  Let's try to understand. </p><p>  Of course, by one name alone, we can judge that we have a very favorable tariff, which is aimed at communicating with the family of a child.  More precisely, with parents.  But why is this a whole project? </p><p>  The thing is that you cannot find this tariff on the shelves of mobile communication offices.  The social project ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS) is a kind of exclusive.  By purchasing it, you can easily talk with relatives for 20 minutes a day for free.  Of course, if they also have an MTS number.  This is actually very convenient.  According to the MTS ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù tariff, the Internet on the SIM card will also be connected automatically.  You will receive a ‚ÄúSuper BIT‚Äù.  This is unlimited Internet with a <span>monthly fee of</span> only 250 rubles per month.  The most advantageous offer that can only be offered to users. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social project call mom pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866498.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where does it come from? </h2><p>  But where can I find the ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS) tariff?  After all, as already mentioned, this is a purely exclusive product.  And not every client can get it.  Why?  Let's understand this matter. </p><p>  The whole problem is that our current facility is a real social project, which was introduced thanks to the mothers of the military.  More precisely, recruits.  After all, when a son serves, it is always important to keep in touch with him.  And for this reason, the project called ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS).  How to connect it?  Now we will understand this matter. </p><p>  It is enough to just come to the draft board, where they send your son to the commission.  There, both he and you will be given SIM cards with which you can use this tariff.  Thus, there are absolutely no ways to participate in this social project without the help of serving sons.  Nevertheless, <span>the MTS</span> Call Mom <span>tariff plan</span> is similar to some other plans of this mobile operator.  Which ones?  Let‚Äôs understand this difficult issue. </p><h2>  Super Zero </h2><p>  So, among all the currently valid tariff plans, we can single out one with you.  They are preferred by those customers for whom all relatives and friends have also chosen the MTS mobile operator.  Why?  You will understand now. </p><p>  The thing is that MTS "Super Zero" ("Call Mom" ‚Äã‚Äã- its analogue as a social project) is what will help to talk for free with other subscribers of this operator for 30 minutes a day.  This is very convenient, isn't it?  You can chat with friends and loved ones for free.  Only to activate this feature will have to replenish your mobile phone account by more than 100 rubles at a time.  This is actually not such a big amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="call mom pay how to connect" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866499.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now that we know the ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS) tariff and its ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù counterpart, let's try to figure out how you can connect this opportunity.  In contrast to the social project Super Zero, each user can purchase. </p><h2>  We buy a number </h2><p>  Well, the first version of the development of events that can only be offered is a banal purchase of a new number with an already prepared tariff plan.  This is actually a very good and effective way. </p><p>  It is enough just to come to the nearest mobile communication office of your mobile operator and inform that you would like to purchase the ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS) tariff.  More precisely, its analogue for the modern user.  You will be given a SIM card, which will be registered on you.  From this moment on, a ‚Äúcountdown‚Äù will take place - 30 days for free calls 30 minutes a day.  After that, you will have to replenish the account. </p><p>  As a rule, now it is almost impossible to buy a SIM card.  This tariff is outdated.  Instead, they can offer "Super MTS" ("Call Mom" ‚Äã‚Äã- this is his other name).  Essentially the same as Super Zero, only with a monthly fee - 150 rubles.  For this you will also get free internet for your mobile phone.  As you can see, there are not so many analogues, but they are all quite attractive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff plan mts call mom" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866500.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  The second scenario is a call to the operator.  It is through conversation with a living person that, as a rule, most problems are quickly resolved.  And you do not have to puzzle over the issues of connecting tariff plans - they will do everything for you.  Just be prepared to pay about 100 rubles for changing the tariff, as well as give your passport details.  Sometimes they may be required. </p><p>  Dial 0890 on the phone, and then wait for a response.  Next, say that you would like to connect a ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù (MTS) tariff for yourself.  The operator will report that there is an analogue for ordinary clients (not draftees), and then he will tell all the details.  It will be "Super MTS".  Agree with the operator, and then wait a while.  If necessary, provide passport data. </p><p>  At the end of the conversation, you will receive an SMS notification that notifies you that the tariff plan has been changed.  After that, wait for the message stating the beginning of the "countdown" of free calls for this month.  You can call your relatives and friends without worrying about balance at all. </p><h2>  SMS requests </h2><p>  But we continue to move with you further.  If you want to connect the ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù tariff (MTS), or rather its analogue for ordinary customers, you can use the special command that is sent in the message to a special short number. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay call mom internet" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866501.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Enter ‚Äú721‚Äù in the message, and then dial 111 as a recipient. You can send SMS and then wait for the results.  Such a transition will cost you 90 rubles.  This amount will be written off from your balance, and then you will receive a notification about the successful transition to the Super MTS tariff plan. </p><p>  In fact, SMS requests are not always popular among users.  It is often customary to carry out manipulations with changing tariff plans in a slightly different way.  How?  Let's try to understand this difficult question. </p><h2>  USSD commands </h2><p>  So, our next move with you is the use of special USSD commands.  It is such requests that can help anyone quickly and reliably change the tariff plan, as well as connect some separate new features for the number. </p><p>  For our situation, we will have to dial * 111 * 721 #, and then click on the "dialer".  If you have enough money (90 rubles) to change the tariff plan, then in response you will receive a notification that will inform you of the successful processing of the request.  The tariff "Call Mom" ‚Äã‚Äã(MTS), or rather, "Super MTS", is connected to your number.  Now you can safely talk with your friends and relatives who are clients of MTS, free of charge for 30 minutes a day.  Very beneficial for the outgoing user. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mts super zero call mom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866506.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  And now we will learn about another very interesting bonus.  True, only the most advanced user can use it.  After all, we have a little work to do with the Internet and a special Internet assistant.  The second object we are considering is an application installed on the phone. </p><p>  Let's start with you from him.  First you have to find it in the installed programs of your gadget.  Now run it and look for the "Tariffs" section in the menu that appears.  There, select your favorite, read the conditions and click on "Connect".  In order to use the ‚Äúmundane‚Äù ‚ÄúCall Mom‚Äù option, you will have to pay attention to the ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù.  Now you can wait until you receive an SMS message about the successful completion of the operation.  As you can see, so far nothing is difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="super pay call mom" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/866509.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The main difficulties begin when users begin to use the Internet for help.  Go to the MTS official website, and then log in to your personal account.  Next, select "Tariffs" there, find "Super MTS" and click on the necessary line.  You will see an action menu.  Select "Connect" there, and then wait until you receive a notification on your mobile number.  Remember that you must have enough money to make a tariff change.  At the moment, 90 rubles.  That's all the problems are solved. </p>
