Its popularity is constantly growing.  Her technique is stable, and there is no doubt that over time, quality will only increase. </p><p>  Xiaomi rival is not so well advanced in its career, but in China this company is in the Top 5 in sales.  Due to some characteristics in the territory of the former Soviet Union, devices from this developer are loved and appreciated. </p><p>  For many people, these companies are on the same level.  And most buyers are not able to decide which manufacturer is better and whose smartphones are more popular.  We will consider many nuances in the article to understand which is better: Huawei or Xiaomi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei or xiaomi which is better" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2019282.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Diversity </h2><p>  Both companies present an extensive range of models, but Huawei is the leader in this matter - the manufacturer has more smartphones.  Most of the devices from Xiaomi are too primitive, their main part is monotonous.  Almost all devices are made of aluminum.  Huawei offers plastic, glass and metal options. </p><h2>  Own chipsets </h2><p>  The described company Huawei is currently the third in the world that creates its own hardware and uses in smartphones.  It is on the list after the Samsung and the American apple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to the fact that the chipsets are produced independently, the developer is not dependent on suppliers.  In addition, this reduces the cost of devices.  Also, this idea allows you to optimize your mobile devices and quickly equip them with constant updates.  Accordingly, answering the question: ‚ÄúWhich is better: Huawei or Xiaomi?‚Äù, The first option should be noted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which is better xiaomi or huawei" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2019283.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Official representatives </h2><p>  Both in Russia and Ukraine there are representative offices of Huawei.  At the same time, if he is talking about Xiaomi, then the developer only cost dealers here.  Due to the presence of numerous branches, it is possible to make the products more suitable for a particular region as accurately as possible.  This boosts sales and expands the market.  In addition, buyers always prefer to contact specialized service centers.  It‚Äôs much easier to repair a Huawei phone under warranty than an Xiaomi phone. </p><h2>  Work on cameras </h2><p>  Huawei has long been aiming to take a leadership position in the camera phone market.  Of course, it is impossible to say that their gadgets are the best in the pictures, but efforts to improve the matrix are noticeable.  Due to the fact that the devices receive modules from Sony, and the developer collaborates with Leica, the company has long been catching up with the same Samsung in the quality of images and the number of sales. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Compared with Xiaomi, the models from this developer shoot much worse, although they have similar characteristics.  Accordingly, this nuance gives an unambiguous answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhich is better: Huawei or Xiaomi?‚Äù. </p><h2>  Network compatibility </h2><p>  Huawei is not only creating smartphones, but is equipping the market with carrier accessories.  When releasing phones to a specific market, the developer takes care that the device works perfectly with the local network.  In Xiaomi, this figure also does not suffer, but some models do not support LTE. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi or huawei phone is better" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2019284.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cons of Huawei smartphones </h2><p>  Smartphones from Huawei do not have critical and noticeable minuses, but still buyers highlight some unpleasant features.  It is about them that will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Confusion with models </h2><p>  Which manufacturer is better - Huawei or Xiaomi?  The first, like the second, has its drawbacks.  Consider them to answer the question. </p><p>  Huawei, unlike Xiaomi, likes to produce different versions of phones for many countries.  Often the same devices come out under different brands.  It also happens that the phones seem to be the same, but differ in their filling, depending on which market they enter. </p><p>  For example, the Honor 5C phone (produced under a subsidiary brand, but in fact is a creation of Huawei) received a fingerprint scanner for China, this option is not available in the Russian version. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which phone is better xiaomi or huawei" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2019285.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Onscreen buttons </h2><p>  Of all Huawei models, only one Y3 II device received touch keys under the display.  All other smartphones work with on-screen options.  This is an uncritical flaw, but many buyers do not like this solution.  Therefore, answering the question ‚ÄúWhich phone is better than Xiaomi or Huawei?‚Äù, The second option should be highlighted.  After all, this company in the lineup has only one such phone - Mi Mix.  All the rest are made with the keys below the screen. </p><h2>  Oleophobic coating problems </h2><p>  Huawei developer clearly does not like to use <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Almost all models do not have it.  Because of this, water, dust, fats, fingerprints accumulate on the surface. </p><p>  On phones from Xiaomi, this problem does not occur.  The coating is of poor quality, it disappears after a year or six months, but at least there is one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which smartphone is better than huawei or xiaomi" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2019286.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  High price </h2><p>  Which <span>smartphone is better than</span> Huawei or Xiaomi? </p><p>  After Huawei began to be in demand, it quickly raised the cost of its phones.  Even with the fact that all smartphones are made in China, the price of them is as if they are ‚Äúpurebred Koreans‚Äù.  Unfortunately, many buyers are not ready to pay for such a device, as for Samsung. </p><h2>  Why are Xiaomi smartphones better? </h2><p>  This company did not take off as fast as Huawei, but this manufacturer still wins in some nuances.  Consider all the features, advantages and disadvantages of the lineup.  This will help you understand which company is still better. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Not all developers can compete with Xiaomi in the combination of cost and quality of devices.  Direct competitors can only be called manufacturers LeEco and Meizu.  Most of the company's smartphones sell for $ 300.  For such a price, for example, the same devices from Huawei can hardly be found. </p><h2>  Batteries </h2><p>  Phones have ordinary batteries if they belong to the Mi series.  All other gadgets and phablets are equipped with powerful batteries.  Even with the fact that their capacity is increased, still the thickness of the device remains at an excellent rate.  Huawei has minor problems with this issue, as some models are too oversized. </p><h2>  Powerful iron </h2><p>  Xiaomi is trying to market phones with great functionality, but for little money.  Developers do not use cheap chipsets.  The only phone that can ‚Äúboast‚Äù of such a feature is the Redmi 4A.  Its cost is $ 100, so the iron is rather weak.  Accordingly, figuring out which phone is better: Xiaomi or Huawei, it is clear that in this aspect the first is more successful. </p><h2>  Own ecosystem </h2><p>  Almost all phones manufactured by Xiaomi have an ecosystem.  A similar idea has long been used in Apple, but they have this technology a little differently implemented.  However, a certain percentage of buyers are still attracted by the ecosystem. </p><h2>  Infrared port </h2><p>  Xiaomi developers specifically equip their phones with an infrared port.  At the factory, a special program is installed in the firmware, which allows you to configure the diode.  Due to this, the phone can be considered a universal remote control.  It can be noted that everyone likes this technology, because now, if the device is lost, but you want to switch the channel, you can call it.  Considering this question, we can unequivocally answer the question of which is better than Huawei or Xiaomi.  The second manufacturer, of course. </p>
