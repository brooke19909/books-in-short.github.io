Despite the fact that the mentioned settlement is relatively young, it still has its own history and facilities worthy of attention.  Believe me, Nizhnevartovsk will be able to conquer you with its beautiful buildings, monuments and other objects, as well as the hospitality of its residents. </p><h2>  History of Nizhnevartovsk </h2><p>  The city of Nizhnevartovsk appeared in 1909.  More precisely, precisely at this time, with the creation of a pier on the right side of the Ob River, to which merchant ships moored to acquire a supply of firewood, its story began.  Soon, 5 houses were built near the marina, in which 11 people lived.  At the beginning of 1924, the Nizhnevartovsk village council was formed, and in 1964 the village turned into an urban-type settlement. </p><p>  However, the biggest impetus to the development of Nizhnevartovsk was the discovery in May 1965 of an oil fountain with a depth of more than 2,000 meters, which was called Samotlor.  In 1966, the first construction enterprise was created on the territory of the village - Megiongazstroy trust.  And in 1972 Nizhnevartovsk was endowed with the status of a city.  A few years later, the construction of the railway to Surgut began, which connected many large cities of Russia and Nizhnevartovsk. </p>

    <p>  Today the city is a large industrial, cultural and business center, which is developing dynamically.  There are all conditions for a comfortable life: educational institutions, various enterprises, entertainment facilities, which means that there are prerequisites for the implementation of interesting excursions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Plaque and steam locomotive layout </h2><p>  So, the most famous sights of Nizhnevartovsk are <span>a plaque</span> and a model of a steam locomotive, which were installed in honor of the 30th anniversary of the arrival of the first train.  It is worth noting that this infrastructure was built in 1976.  The object is located on the forecourt. </p><p>  The uniqueness of this attraction of Nizhnevartovsk lies in the fact that after the opening of the oil fountain in this area, great importance began to be given to the development of transport, including railway.  Without this type of transport, such a rapid development of Samotlor would hardly have become possible.  The length of the railway from Tyumen to Surgut was 700 km.  Its construction took 9 years, after which Surgut station was able to accept the first freight train, in the wagons of which there were 4,000 tons of cargo. </p><h2>  The most famous monuments of Nizhnevartovsk </h2><p>  Considering the sights of Nizhnevartovsk, it is worth paying attention to the monuments, which are very many in the city.  And each of them can be interesting for tourists. </p>

    <p>  Since Nizhnevartovsk owes much to the opening of Samotlor, it would be surprising if there were no monument to the conquerors of the oil fountain on its territory.  So, in 1978, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Nizhnevartovsk region, at the intersection of noisy highways on <span>the Glory Barrow</span> , a bronze figure of a worker was installed, with a burning torch in one hand and a hammer in the other.  The sculpture is 12 meters high and stands on a granite pedestal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city of Nizhnevartovsk is famous for another monument - F.E. Dzerzhinsky.  It is installed in front of the police department building.  The local artist Anatoly Troyansky, a retired Interior Ministry investigator who, incidentally, repeatedly presented his work at exhibitions, worked on the creation of the sculpture.  The erection of the monument was personally paid by law enforcement officials. </p><h2>  Church of the Nativity </h2><p>  Those who are interested in the religious sights of Nizhnevartovsk should visit the Church of the Nativity, which was opened in 1998.  The domes and crosses of the shrine are covered <span>with gold leaf,</span> and inside the church there are four thrones. </p>

    <h2>  The memorial of glory of Nizhnevartovsk sports - the pride of citizens </h2><p>  This facility is located at the entrance to the Central Stadium, which was opened in 2002.  It is presented in the form of a large golden ball.  The lower part of the surface of the memorial is covered with asterisks.  On each of them is written the name of one of the city‚Äôs athletes who brought Russia many victories in international competitions.  We are talking about such personalities as boxers Alexander Maletin, Evgeny Makarenko, Georgy Balakshin, Stanislav, a volleyball player, and others, no less famous. </p>
