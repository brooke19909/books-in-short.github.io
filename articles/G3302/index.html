You will need 25 g of yarn in two colors.  This color is used to improve the contrast of the product.  Need a pair of knitting needles and thread with a needle. </p><p>  Knitted booties for boys schemes and description have all sorts.  But the following are most optimal: </p><ol><li>  Dial 30-35 loops.

There are many options for finishing the product.  Knitted booties for a boy can be decorated as follows: </p><ul><li>  Pick up a wide satin ribbon of the same color as the extra yarn used to form the toe strips.  Fold the ribbon in a bow and sew in the center of the sock, where it was pulled together. </li><li>  Weave a small pendant from beads and beads.  Beads can be of different shapes, sizes and colors.  After manufacturing, the element is fixed in any part of the toe. </li><li>  You can knit jewelry from threads.

You need to take the threads (two colors can be), the hook of the corresponding number.

The first row of the transition is knitted so that the hook captures only the back thread of the loop.  When using two colors, all work is so far done from one type of yarn. </li><li>  Then a toe is formed (it is possible from a thread of a different color).  Knit the first row with half crochets connecting in one loop.  Each next row knit in the same way.  As a result, the number of loops is gradually reduced. </li><li>  After making the toe, the rest of the booties are circularly knitted.  Do not short knitting in the center of the toe! </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="davidgarlandjones.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet boot foot formation" class="if uuid-3174953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3174953.jpg"></div><p>  Tighten the top of the booties.
