    <p>  Since even less than a fifth of a century has passed, then, most likely, ahead of all are waiting for the most unusual inventions of mankind, designed and created in the future.  To date, open innovations show what technical progress has reached and what previously unknown opportunities a person can take. </p><p>  Let us consider in more detail some of the unusual inventions of man created at the beginning of the twenty-first century. </p><h2>  Artificial retina </h2><p>  This discovery belongs to Japanese scientists.  The retina produced is an aluminum matrix using silicon semiconductor elements.  Resolution is 100 pixels. </p><p>  The retina will perform its functions if it was installed complete with special glasses and a small computer.  Glasses with a built-in video camera are used to receive and transmit images to a computer, where processing takes place.  A camera with glasses converts light into portions of electronic pulses.  After processing the image, the computer divides it in half and transfers it to the left and right eyes, to infrared emitters located on the back of the lenses of the glasses.  Glasses emit short pulses of infrared radiation, which activates the photosensors on the retina of the eye and forces them to transmit electrical pulses encoding the picture into optical neurons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  With its help, it becomes possible to design keys on the surface, where they are pressed.  The video projector that designs the keyboard has a sensor that can track finger movements, after which it calculates the coordinates of the pressed keys and displays correctly typed text on the display.  However, such a keyboard also has disadvantages; it cannot be used outdoors. </p><h2>  Electronic Cigarette </h2><p>  This discovery was made by a Chinese scientist after his father died of lung cancer.  Nicotine addiction is one of the strongest in the world.  What does a person quit smoking do.  He is trying to replace this habit with something else, for example, gluing a <span>nicotine patch,</span> buying gum, trying to find an alternative to smoking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An electronic cigarette is a device that simulates the smoking process.  When using such a novelty, a person does not give up his habit, does not seek replacements, but usually spends time.  However, the smoker does not spoil his lungs with poisonous tar and combustion products, since they are not present in this type of device.  Thus, a person smoking an electronic cigarette can get rid of nicotine addiction. </p><h2>  Brain interface </h2><p>  The unusual inventions of the 21st century are quite diverse, and one of them is the brain interface. </p><p>  An example of managing objects with thought was demonstrated by a Japanese company.  Man, by the power of thought, forced a switch mounted on a <span>model of a train of a</span> large-scale railway to switch. </p><p>  Principle of action: in the infrared spectrum, transillumination and recording of the cerebral cortex occurs.  When carrying out such a procedure, the passage through the blood vessels of hemoglobin, both with oxygen and without, is clearly visible, while the volume of blood in various parts of the brain is also visible.  The machine translates such changes into voltage signals that control external devices.  In this way, the train switch is controlled. </p>

Receiving execution signals will be the pinnacle of the development of the human-machine interface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Digital Odor Synthesizer </h2><p>  Today you will not surprise anyone with 3D sound or 3D video.  Today these are quite popular inventions.  Unusual technologies entered our lives at the beginning of the 21st century.  The French company presents its digital odor measurement solution.  The appearance of such a novelty brought diversity to the digital life of society.  A variety of odors will be synthesized from cartridges.  This will add a twist to watching movies and video games. </p><h2>  Electronic paper </h2><p>  It is the same as electronic ink.  Information is displayed on a special display.  Electronic books use electronic paper, and it is also used in other areas.  Electronic ink in reflected light can display graphics and text for a long time without spending a lot of energy. </p><p>  The advantages of such paper: </p><ul><li>  energy saving; </li><li>  This type of reading does not burden the eyes, like ordinary paper, which means it does not spoil a person‚Äôs vision. </li></ul>

    <p>  Electronic paper can reflect a video with a frequency of 6 frames per second, transmits 16 shades of gray. </p><p>  Work continues on improving the present invention and increasing the speed of display. </p><h2>  3D desktop scanner </h2><p>  The principle of operation of such a device consists in the use of two cameras, the image from which is formed and compared.  With the help of such a scanner, accurate three-dimensional models of the necessary objects are created.  They are reflected with the maximum accuracy of various details.  Information is transmitted in mathematical, computer and digital form, carries data on the size, shape, color of the scanned element. </p><p>  The computer controls image settings.  All received data is analyzed, and the image appears on the screen already in three-dimensional space. </p><h2>  Smart Chinese Chopsticks </h2><p>  One of the <span>Chinese companies</span> in the twenty-first century presented to the audience "smart" chopsticks.  The essence of this invention is that when the chopsticks are immersed in food, information on the quality of food is reflected on the screen of the gadget on which the necessary application is installed.  That is, dropping, for example, sticks into the oil, you will see the message ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù on the screen, based on the quality of the product being tested. </p><p>  To release such an invention, scientists were prompted by the situation with products in China.  In the country, many diseases have been identified precisely because of the use of poor-quality food.  Often products are cooked in the same oil, which leads to the appearance of toxic substances in it. </p>

Such an invention will make it possible to produce molecular materials.  It will be possible, for example, to make oxygen or water.  Also in the economic sphere, they will be able to create food products, fuel and participate in other processes that ensure human life.  Such robots will be able to create themselves. </p><p>  Nanotechnology is a symbol of the future and one of the vectors of the development of civilization.  Their use is possible in almost all areas of human life. </p><p>  In medicine, the appearance of nanorobots will lead to a complete cure of the human body.  They can be launched into the body.  Correctly programmed machines will begin to destroy viruses and other harmful substances inside the body.  Using nanotechnology, you can give a beautiful and healthy look to human skin. </p><p>  In ecology, electronic machines will help stop pollution of the planet.  With their help, it will be possible to purify water, air and other vital sources of human health. </p><p>  Such unusual inventions of mankind can help in solving complex problems, but at the moment the development is at the research stage. </p><p>  To date, some components of future molecular machines have been created, various conferences are held on the issue of creating nanorobots. </p>

    <p>  There are primitive prototypes of future cars.  In 2010, DNA-based molecular machines that can travel in space were first shown. </p><p>  The world of nanotechnology does not stand still, and perhaps the 21st century will still be called the century in which the most unusual inventions will appear. </p><h2>  Virtual world </h2><p>  The new century brought with it virtual communication, dating, games.  A person builds his own horizons, creates his own virtual pages on the World Social Networks.  Therefore, we can say that unusual inventions created by oneself are social networks. </p><p>  The development of technology leads to a decrease in real meetings and is more inclined to virtual communication. </p><p>  New virtual inventions, the unusual functions of which help adaptation of a person in a virtual society, are: </p><ul><li>  Facebook is a social network where people from all over the world can chat.  Share photo and video news, discuss, advise, tell various facts of interest to them. </li><li>  Oculus Rift is a video game website. </li><li>  Apple iPhone is a phone that has Internet access.  It is also possible to watch movies, listen to music, take photos, and video.  The phone also performs many other useful functions, including the classic one: conducting conversations with friends. </li><li>  Amazon Kindle - an electronic library of books. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Inventions are stupid and smart, useful and not very.  However, every year, unusual inventions of the world are being improved, while others are developing against the background of some.  Humanity seeks to invent something extraordinary that will surprise everyone.  At the same time, the novelty should bring convenience to the life of people, make life easier for a person in something. </p><p>  The 21st century will still bring new inventions, unusual opportunities, thanks to which mankind will be able to explore previously unexplored spaces and acquire new knowledge. </p>
