Traveling to Indonesia is always a fascinating and memorable trip to the exotic, giving you the opportunity to plunge into past eras.  It is believed that the main attractions of the largest archipelago in the world are on the island of Java. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur indonesia information" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In its center is a temple complex of colossal proportions, which the Indonesians call the true wonder of the world.  A religious monument, revived to life only two centuries ago, can not be ignored. </p><h2>  Borobudur temple: description </h2><p>  A giant stone structure, the architecture of which exactly repeats the mountain landscape, appeared in the sacred valley of Kedu between the 7th and 8th centuries.  Built on a hill, it is built in the shape of a pyramid, and Buddhists call such a construction a stupa.  The high (over 34 meters) temple was built over about a hundred years, but the results exceeded all expectations.  The building of the religious monument with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 2500 kilometers is a step structure, the niches of which extend upward.  The square-shaped structure with a base length of 123 meters has four entrances, and Buddha statues in different poses are installed on each side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur indonesia" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to scientists studying the temple, it took about two million bricks of dark gray andesite to build it.  The eight floors of the temple complex symbolize the Buddhist model of the world, and on the upper level there is a classic stupa, made in the form of a huge bell.  It is believed that valuable relics were stored in the hollow structure, which were later plundered. </p><p>  The entrance, located on the east side, is the main one and symbolizes the moment of enlightenment of the founder of Buddhism.  It is intended only for monks and is closed for tourists.  Embossed reliefs in stones stretch from the main entrance, silently telling about the teachings of Buddha.  Each multi-level terrace and walls of the oldest building are covered with curious bas-reliefs depicting the many lives of the Enlightened One. </p><p>  Pilgrims arriving in Borobudur (Indonesia) must go around each tier seven times.  They overcome the way up, moving counterclockwise in a spiral through all floors.  The distance they travel is about five kilometers.  Now restoration is underway on some tiers, and it is not possible to go around all the levels. </p><h2>  Kamadhatu </h2><p>  The lower tier, where more than 160 panels depicting the world of human destructive passions are stored, is closed to tourists, since it is completely underground.  Only a small part of the temple and some bas-reliefs are visible to visitors.  Photos of all images can be viewed in the museum in the sanctuary. </p><p>  The level was covered with earth in order to give stability to the temple, which could be destroyed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rupadhatu </h2><p>  The second level of Borobudur (Indonesia) occupies five terraces and symbolizes the real world.  Tier panels tell interesting stories from the life of the Buddha.  One can see all the incarnations of a spiritual teacher who has visited both the human body and the animal, and everywhere he shows compassion, revealing the principles of religion.  And others will tell about all the journeys that the Enlightened man has made in search of wisdom.  On five tiers are more than 400 of its statues carved from stone, but almost none are intact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur indonesia photo" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Arupadhatu </h2><p>  The upper floor is the highest level, which symbolizes the approach of nirvana.  It is decorated in the form of three small rounded terraces.  There are no images at all, but in niches or under stupas reminiscent of inverted bells, 72 statues of Buddha are found, dwelling in nirvana and detached from the earthly world. </p><p>  In the heart of the floor is the closed stupa with the sculpture of Siddhartha Gautama, which is impossible to see, ending Borobudur (Indonesia).  The giant statue has no head, and scientists put forward several versions explaining such a strange fact.  Some claim that the work was not originally completed, others tend to blame the strong earthquake, which resulted in it falling off, while others consider it the work of thieves who stole souvenirs from private collections. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  History of the complex </h2><p>  In 1006, a tragedy occurred - the eruption of the volcano Merapi buried the Borobudur temple in Indonesia under a thick layer of ash.  In 1811, the island of Java came under British control, and an inquisitive British governor, interested in history, heard ancient legends about the building, which died many centuries ago.  Interested in the disappeared temple, he organized a scientific expedition.  About two months there was a clearing of the territory, overgrown with jungle, and the gaze of researchers revealed part of the structure with a bizarre ornament.  Only in 1885 did the sanctuary recognized as a World Heritage Site appear in all its splendor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Borobudur temple description" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the ‚Äústone chronicle of Buddhism‚Äù located far from civilization suffered from marauders who exported statues and bas-reliefs they liked outside the country.  Soon the Dutch began to own the island, proposing to dismantle Borobudur (Indonesia), whose history spans several centuries.  Fortunately, common sense triumphed, and the pristine complex was repeatedly restored, but the largest one occurred with the support of UNESCO in the 80s of the last century. </p><p>  An important monument of the country erected on a hill needed to be strengthened, otherwise at any moment it could simply fall apart.  It was completely disassembled and recreated in accordance with existing sketches.  True, some stones were never found, and therefore concrete slabs are in their place.  The temple, consisting of several tiers, regained its former beauty and grandeur. </p><h2>  The tragedies that occurred with the temple </h2><p>  Looking solemn, it attracted the attention of extremists trying to blow up a local attraction.  So, in 1985, Muslims planted bombs in the temple, but, as Buddhists believe, the spirit of the Enlightened one did not allow to erase Borobudur (Indonesia) from the face of the Earth.  The restoration of the monument and archaeological work is ongoing to this day.  However, an active volcano, whose eruptions occur every few years, is trying to destroy the temple.  In 2010, Merapi exploded, and the ashes that destroyed fertile lands rose 14 kilometers.  The Indonesians, clearing the island, did not disregard the oldest building, which again was seriously damaged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur indonesia story" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816975.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ashes containing acid corroded the largest Buddhist temple in the world.  Thousands of volunteers flew to the rescue of local residents, and work to save Borobudur lasted more than a month.  Electricity was conducted in the oldest building, and volcanic dust, causing great damage, was collected with industrial vacuum cleaners. </p><h2>  The object of mass tourism and the place of pilgrimage </h2><p>  Tourists entering the temple, first of all, strive to get up to enjoy the wonderful panorama.  It‚Äôs hard to go, because you have to overcome 26 meters, but the amazing views that open up are worth it.  Many believe that Buddha statues help to get rich and apply to them.  And even Muslims do it. </p><p>  However, local practitioners of Buddhism pay more attention to the walkways along the terraces, where you can relax, think about important lessons carved in bas-reliefs.  It is no coincidence that Borobudur (Indonesia), information about which can be found in documents dated by past centuries, has become for many a "bible in stone." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur indonesia how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The way up leads to nirvana, but not everyone can reach it, however, as one ascends, one approaches enlightenment.  Of course, our temple is more an object of mass tourism than a place of pilgrimage. </p><h2>  Borobudur (Indonesia): how to get there? </h2><p>  Those who travel independently need to know that there are no direct buses to the temple located in the Kedu Valley.  Therefore, you can rent a car or take a taxi from Yogyakarta Airport - a city located in the very center <span>of Java</span> and located 40 kilometers from the attraction. </p><p>  Or from the Jombor bus terminal bus station take buses 2A or 2B to Magelang, a small settlement in the province, and then transfer to public transport going to Borobudur (Indonesia). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borobudur temple in indonesia" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1816969.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Photos of the temple that took refuge in the valley, striking the imagination with a special atmosphere, cause real delight.  Unfortunately, the majestic monument may soon be lost forever.  Nobody knows what destruction a raging volcano will bring, and it is worth hurrying to see the mysterious structure with your own eyes. </p>
