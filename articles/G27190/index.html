    <p>  Many positive reviews are available regarding nutrition.  Tourists are satisfied with the taste of dishes and a variety of menus.  They note that in nearby 5-star hotels, meals were much more modest and worse in taste. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the water in the pool is always clean and there was enough space on the sunbeds around it for everyone.  Guests are pleased with the bartender's work in the snack cafe.  He always listens to the wishes of tourists and makes cocktails in all proportions. </p><p>  Guests are happy with the beach facilities.  They are pleased with the gentle entrance to the sea and the sandy shore.  Vacationers with children are happy with the opportunity to bathe their kids in clear water.  Here, guys can play with sand while adults are sunbathing. </p><p>  The guests of the complex praised the availability of cozy gazebos almost on the shore.  They often in the evenings after an active day there enjoyed the beauty of the sea and silence.  Cocktails and other drinks are served here from the bars. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are negative comments on the work of Kolibri Hotel 4 * in Turkey (Incekum, Alanya).  Young tourists say that after a few days of staying here it becomes boring.  Therefore, people who love noisy entertainment, it is better to look for hotels with animation and night clubs. </p><p>  Some guests note that the maids are cleaned every few days and the quality is clearly lame if you do not tip them.  In some reviews, there is dissatisfaction with the fact that Turkish families vacationing here are almost all the time in the pool, often there is very noisy and crowded, children splash and scream. </p><p>  Tourists also indicate that when checking into a hotel, you can get a good room only after an offer to tip the manager at the reception.  Without them, guests can enter the room no earlier than a few hours. </p><p>  You may find dissatisfaction in the comments about overpriced spa services. </p>
