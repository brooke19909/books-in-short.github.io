    <p>  This historical event and the results of the First World War went down in the history of mankind as one of the most cruel and large-scale actions directed against all mankind. </p><p>  The main impetus for hostilities was the assassination of Austrian Prince Franz Ferdinand, which occurred in Sarajevo in the middle of the summer of 1914.  More precisely, on the twenty-eighth of July.  It is this date that historians who summed up the First World War consider the official beginning of hostilities.  The killer was a Bosnian student, Gavriliy Princip, who had business relations with one of the most famous and cruel <span>terrorist organizations</span> at that time <span>.</span> </p><p>  The course of the First World War was inevitable, because long before the well-known murder, the most powerful states of Europe restrained their anger at each other.  Seven years before the hostilities, the first military-economic bloc was formed, allies in which were Russia, the French Republic and Great Britain.  Thus, these states agreed to provide all kinds of assistance to each other, thereby creating a huge danger for Germany, which, in turn, also created a similar bloc called the Triple Alliance.  In addition to the German power, Italy and Austria-Hungary entered it. </p><p>  In anticipation of the war, Germany experienced significant problems with the size of its internal armed forces due to the democratic policies of the Social Democrats, which, starting in 1912, carried out several reforms aimed at reducing the size of the army. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Surprising was the fact that, despite all the political and military contradictions between Russia and Germany, the German artillery troops continued to conduct their exercises on the territory of their future enemy. </p><p>  The summarized results of the <span>First World War</span> suggest that, starting in 1914, hostilities developed in several <span>parts of the world</span> at once <span>.</span>  In addition to the battles in <span>Russia</span> and France, the war had its turn in the African colonies and the Middle East.  The European colonies, which were in China and Oceania, also did not remain aloof from the war.  Based on this alone, we can say that before this in the entire history of the planet there have not been such large-scale military battles, and if not for World War II, then the consequences of World War I would have remained the most cruel times in the history of mankind. </p><p>  Despite such hostilities as the invasion of German troops in Belgium, border battles on the territory of almost all the countries of Europe and the world, France surprises historians by attacking Alsace and Lorraine under the guise of general fear and chaos.  These are the very lands that the French sacrificed as a result of defeat in the Franco-Prussian war.  Thus, one of the Entente members did not hesitate to achieve his personal goals, while hiding behind the First World War. </p><p>  It is worth noting the actions of the German fleet, which, purely by the geographical position of the country, should not be too strong.  Despite this, the German submarines managed to work wonders at sea.  And what can we say about the fact that they managed to defeat the British fleet, which at that time was famous throughout the world for its fighting efficiency and was considered one of the most powerful in the world. </p><p>  Summarizing the First World War, we can say that this was the first massive failure of Germany as an aggressor.  Although this state turned out to be a fairly powerful rival in military terms.  But now we can compare these opinions with the events of the second World War, where Germany also first defeated everyone and everywhere, and in the end turned out to be the loser and was defeated with shame. </p>
