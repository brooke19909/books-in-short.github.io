It seems that time itself has no power over them.  Many centuries have passed since the Sokolniki Bor, a protected grove for grand princely pleasures, approached Moscow from the Northeast.  Many generations of princes, and later kings - loved to arrange a falconry.  Sokolniki began to settle here, training birds for royal hunting.  Under Peter the Great, Sokolnicheskaya Sloboda appears.  Since 1742, the Sokolniki district has been part of the customs border of Moscow. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="16" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="37.66325660000007" data-lat="55.7917984"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/7/9/2/4792.png"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The expansion of Moscow required the protection of its borders, fixing new borders.  By a decision of the Senate of 1742, a new Chamber-College shaft began to be built around the city.  An earth embankment with a moat 37.3 km long and 18 outposts covered 70.9 square meters.  km  Since 1800, the official border of Moscow has been laid along the rampart.  The military-strategic importance of the new fortifications was quickly lost and the project was not implemented.  By the middle of the XIX century, it was decided to get rid of the shaft.  Outposts were eliminated, the shaft is hidden.  The name of the area is preserved.  Part of the Chamber-College fortification became Sokolniki rampart.  On the site of the grove, Sokolniki Park is equipped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of the 20th century, a decision was made to restore the historical borders of Moscow and 18 previously existing outposts. </p><h2>  Modern street </h2><p>  The modern Sokolniki Val starts from the Riga flyover and is laid in the direction of Sokolniki Park.  It runs along the border of the residential area and the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rochet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The border of the park and Sokolniki shaft" class="if uuid-2572003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2572003.jpg"></div><p>  Ends on <span>Sokolnicheskaya</span> Zastava Square at the main entrance.  Unfortunately, in the vicinity of the street there are no historically significant architectural monuments.  Among the notable buildings can be identified: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moleben-online.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Resurrection" class="if uuid-2572005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2572005.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Church of the Resurrection of Christ in Sokolniki.  The building was laid in 1908, and by 1913 the temple was consecrated.  This is one of the few buildings that has never been closed.  He was lucky to survive the severe communist persecution.  It was here that the local cathedral of 1945 was elected Patriarch Alexy I. </li><li>  <span>The</span> 1956 <span>Sokolniki Sports Palace</span> was renovated for the 1980 Olympics for a handball tournament.  After oblivion in the 90s, today the complex received a second youth.  Currently there are tennis courts, handball fields.  You can hold competitions in futsal.  There is a hockey ground, a town of general physical training, workout gyms and choreography. </li><li>  Residential building No. 24 with a memorial plaque on the residence of the writer Vyacheslav Shugaev. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="pastvu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sports Palace in Sokolniki" class="if uuid-2572006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2572006.jpg"></div><p>  Many significant events glorified Moscow.  Sokolniki Val was no exception. </p><h2>  Sokolniki Grove </h2><p>  From the hunting grounds during the reign of Peter I, the grove more and more began to acquire the features of a park.  The young king loved to walk here.  For its convenience, a glade was laid, which has survived to the present and is called the "May glade".  During the war with the French, local residents took refuge here.  For a quick exit to Elk Island, another clearing was laid.  By 1840, the grove began to acquire the features of a landscaped park.  Its modern layout has developed when the alleys diverge in rays from the central square.  Skillful gardeners tried to create a beautiful landscape park.  Today, four cascades of ponds with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 10 hectares have been recreated in the park, and a number of sports and recreational facilities are located.  Bike rental and various sports equipment were organized, outdoor recreation areas were equipped, and the Museum of Modern Calligraphy is working.  From the north along the border of the park passes Sokolnichesky Val.  In the east - Bogorodskoe highway, in the south - Rusakovskaya embankment, and from the west - the ring railway. </p><h2>  Sokolniki District </h2><p>  What interesting can you say about him?
