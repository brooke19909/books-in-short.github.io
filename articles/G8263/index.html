    <h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Most Spanish resorts were built up very chaotically, so hotels are not always located in convenient places for vacationers.  But the Costa Dorada is a completely different <span>region of Spain,</span> here all hotel complexes were created in strict accordance with the architectural plan.  They are slender along the coast, making it easier for tourists to access the sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This fact partly ensures the popularity of the Augustus 3 * hotel in Costa Dorada.  Of course, it does not belong to the new hotel complexes, but it is quite a worthy option for families with children who prefer a beach holiday to everyone else.  The hotel was built in 1971, in recent years it has significantly worn out and dilapidated, so in 2016 a large-scale reconstruction was carried out, reviving it to life.  However, tourists note that the rooms on the ground floor have not undergone very significant changes, so you should not settle in them. </p><p>  Hotel Augustus 3 * (Spain, Costa Dorada) is a charming four-story building, painted in pale blue.  It looks great against the backdrop of greenery and white clouds, creating the feeling of a fairytale castle.  The large hull has two wings and an elevator, making it easy to climb to the top floor. </p><p>  The hotel complex has three hundred and twenty-four rooms of several categories.  For families with several children, there are large two-room rooms, allowing absolutely everyone to stay comfortably and enjoy their vacation. </p><p>  Augustus 3 * (Costa Dorada) is a network hotel.  It is part of the large Augustus Hotels chain, known throughout the Mediterranean.  Nearby is Cesar Augustus 3 * (Costa Daurada), its territory is available to all guests resting in the hotel complex we are describing.  Many of our compatriots visited him to swim in the pool or take pictures. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a quiet resort town of Salou, two kilometers from its center.  It belongs to the hotel complexes of the first coastline and has its own access to the beautiful sandy beach.  Five kilometers from Augustus 3 * (Costa Dorada) - Cambrils.  This is another small city by the sea, which is very easy to reach by public transport.  It does not differ in a lot of entertainment, but can diversify the measured resort life of vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reus Airport, where most international flights arrive, is only twelve kilometers from the hotel.  Therefore, the road will take no more than half an hour in the morning and evening hours.  During the day, traffic jams are possible, but they resolve quickly enough. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  European hotels are not distinguished by an abundance of infrastructure and a vast territory, the Augustus 3 * hotel complex in Costa Daurada does not stand out from the general trend.  It has a fairly compact area, which fit two pools, sunbeds, umbrellas and a small playground.  Just immediately after the pool, the beach begins, so most of the time guests spend there. </p><p>  The hotel has one restaurant and bar, where you can order not only cocktails, but also a variety of snacks.  They are served at any time of the day and have an unusual exquisite taste. </p><p>  Around the large pool is a sun terrace and sunbeds with umbrellas.  Their number is enough to ensure that even with full occupation, there is no hype about empty seats. </p><p>  If you travel in Spain by car, then you will appreciate the ample parking.  But keep in mind that you will have to pay extra for a place on it.  It is not included in the price. </p><p>  Reception, like in many other hotels, is open around the clock.  Despite the fact that the tourist catalogs indicate the absence of Russian-speaking staff, in fact, it is available.  Therefore, you can easily solve all your problems in your native language.  Luggage storage and an exchange office are located at the front desk.  Thanks to this, you can not worry about the safety of your belongings and feel calm all the time allotted for rest.  If you have a large amount of money or other valuables with you, then you can leave them in the safe.  However, it is paid by a separate bill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For those who wish to go on an excursion, the hotel has a small office that will be happy to find the right tour for you.  The cost of such a service will not exceed the average price for excursions in Spain. </p><p>  Business travelers will appreciate the small but convenient business center where you can send a fax or make copies of documents.  Please note that these services are not included in the room rate. </p><p>  In Augustus Hotel 3 * (Costa Daurada) there is a small solarium.  It is intended for tanning on cloudy autumn days, but also works in the summer.  Hotel guests can use it for free. </p><p>  Of particular interest to all potential guests of the hotel complex is Internet access.  In the rooms it is wired, and you will need to pay extra for it.  But on the territory of the hotel there is Wi-Fi, the signal catches perfectly in restaurants and at the reception. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure for children </h2><p>  The hotel administration also thought about its youngest guests.  For them, several infrastructure facilities have been built that will not let the fidgets get bored. </p><p>  Very small children can freely frolic in a separate pool.  It has a small size and depth.  In addition, the children's pool is located next to the adult, so the kids will always be in sight. </p><p>  For especially active children, a small sports ground has been built where you can run and frolic without harm to health.  All designs are installed taking into account their active use, and their reliability is checked daily by employees of the hotel complex. </p><p>  In the building of the hotel is a compact but comfortable games room.  There, evenings with children are occupied by animators and mini-discos are held. </p><h2>  Entertainment for adult hotel guests </h2><p>  If you do not like to leave the cozy territory of the hotel in the evenings, then you will have to look for entertainment here.  And this is not at all difficult, as former guests of the hotel complex say. </p><p>  The hotel has a pool table, so every evening you can arrange tournaments and competitions for the title of the most experienced player.  Every day, after dark, various events are held on the ground floor with the participation of animators and guest artists.  Most tourists respond warmly to these shows. </p><p>  Adults can also take part in darts tournaments or rent a bicycle and arrange for themselves a truly unforgettable adventure.  In addition, views along the coast favor such walks. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of our compatriots about the hotel complex </h2><p>  The hotel is unequivocally rated by Russians for a solid C grade.  It fully meets the expectations of tourists, however, almost every guest can highlight the pros and cons of this hotel complex. </p><p>  The pluses of most guests include the following points: </p><ul><li>  excellent sound insulation in the rooms; </li><li>  good animation (in Spanish); </li><li>  proximity to the beach; </li><li>  convenient location close to shops, cafes and bus stops; </li><li>  the opportunity to get an early breakfast by appointment; </li><li>  clean and tidy area; </li><li>  Friendly and helpful staff. </li></ul><p>  Among the minuses are most often noted: </p><ul><li>  poor housekeeping; </li><li>  shabby furniture; </li><li>  <span>tasteless food</span> in lunch boxes; </li><li>  drinks during breakfast and dinner are available at an additional cost. </li></ul><p>  Often in reviews this hotel is compared with Cesar Augustus 3 * (Costa Dorada, Cambrils).  From the comments you can understand that both hotel complexes are on the same level and their main difference is the location to the sea. </p><p>  Summarizing all of the above, it is safe to say that Augustus 3 * is an excellent choice for those who want an inexpensive and relaxing holiday on the Spanish coast. </p>
