But for real divers, this is a real Mecca.  Photos of the underwater world are fascinating.  And the matter is not only in the colorful inhabitants of the <span>coral reefs</span> Samadai, El Finstone and Abu Dabab.  Here you can swim on the decks and holds of the Salem Express, which sank in 1991.  The town of El Quseir, located halfway between Hurghada and Marsa Alam, is not yet affected by the merciless hand of a tourist boom.  But here, each hotel has its own coral reef.  Such is the Flamenco Beach Resort.  We will tell you about this four-star hotel in our article.  The review of the hotel is based solely on reviews from tourists.  And the attached photos will help you make your own impression of the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Six kilometers separate the town of El Quseir from Flamenco Beach Resort 4 *.  Marsa Alam is closer to the hotel than Hurghada, so if you can choose the landing airport in Egypt, you should give preference to the first.  From him to the hotel sixty-five kilometers.  Those tourists who rested in Sharm, say that in El Quseir all the entertainment is on the territory of the hotels.  The population lives in its measured agro-cultural rhythm, despite the comparative proximity of Hurghada and Mars-Alam.  The only thing a tourist can count on outside the hotel is to smoke a hookah in a local teahouse and drink aromatic coffee.  But El Quseir has its own attractions.  This is the majestic Al-Farran mosque, the <span>impregnable fortress of</span> Sultan Selim (the very son of the great Roksolana) and the tomb of the Sufi sheikh Said al-Shazli.  In ancient times, a port rustled on this coast of the Red Sea, from which only ruins remained.  There is a mine nearby, where in the seventh century gold mining was in full swing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco beach resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109724.jpg" width="600"></div>

The first, Flamenco Beach, is really located on the first line.  What is there - actually, on the shore!  But his brother, Flamenco Las Palmas Resort, is across the street from Flamenco Beach.  So, if you can‚Äôt imagine a vacation without the sea within walking distance, book a room in advance.  However, the buildings in Flamenco Resort are built in such a way that all of its guests have the notorious "view".  And of course, guests can use the beach and the entire infrastructure of all two components of the hotel complex.  The territory of this oasis is very large - twenty thousand square meters.  Fit and get lost.  The territory is extremely well-groomed, rabbits jump on the lawn, everywhere flowering bushes, cacti and palm trees.  In the midst of this splendor there are bizarre-shaped pools. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Flamenco Beach Resort" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109733.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where vacationers live </h2><p>  The number of rooms in Flamenco Beach Resort 4 * is divided into the categories of "Standard" and "Suite".  The coastal part of the Flamenco Beach complex is larger (175 guest rooms versus 135 in the Las Palmas Resort).  There are also several Family Rooms (two Standards with a twin door) and rooms for people with disabilities.  Reviews note that the guest rooms are very spacious.  All of them are adjoined by a large balcony with sun loungers.  In the bathrooms, in addition to the standard for the "four" hygiene items, there is a hairdryer.  The bedrooms are decorated in soothing colors.  They are equipped with air conditioning, a fridge, safe and flat-screen satellite TV.  What incredibly pleased the residents of the hotel was the free Wi-Fi in the room.  There is also a minibar in the bedroom.  But its filling, except bottled drinking water, is paid.  The suites are complemented by a seating area.  Instead of a balcony, on the ground floor there is a beautiful terrace. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  All tourists who visited the Flamenco Beach Resort hotel ate on an all-inclusive system.  The main meals are served in the Flamenco and Las Palmas restaurants in buffet style.  There is also an ‚Äúa la minutes‚Äù service: a cook prepares a dish for you from the ingredients you have chosen.  Guests are allowed to visit both of these restaurants to choose from.  There are bars in the hotel complex.  Granada Disco has discos in the evenings.  Carmen Lounge and Valencia are located in the halls of the main buildings.  Also on the territory there are bars "Maine", "Cactus" and "Seville" (by the pools), "Ice Cream Corner" (on the beach).  For a meal between the main meals, there are two cafes.  These are the Sevilla Bistro and Ali Baba Tent.  In the latter, located in the greenery of the garden, you can smoke a hookah.  It offers a la carte restaurants.  Florence specializes in Italian cuisine, and the Sun Shine Grill on the beach specializes in barbecue and meat dishes cooked on the grill or grill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco Beach Resort reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109739.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to entertain </h2><p>  Reviews say that the lion's share of holidaymakers at Flamenco Beach Resort is smart, athletic youth who have come for the magnificent coral reefs of El Quseira.  Therefore, all the entertainment at the hotel is aimed at satisfying divers and snorkellers.  For them, a free shuttle bus runs to a special beach in the bay.  For them, as many as two dive centers with a highly qualified team of instructors work.  After scuba diving, young people from Western Europe pump their muscles in the gym or relax in the sauna or jacuzzi.  But the services of the spa center, reviews warn, the hotel paid.  The animation team unobtrusively encourages lazy tourists to play water polo or beach volleyball, do aerobics, or exercise in boccia.  You can rent a bicycle or ride a camel.  In the evening, live music is played in the bar.  The animation team entertains the audience after dinner with fun shows, lotteries and discos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco Beach Resort 4 Marsa Alam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109730.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  The coast at Flamenco Beach is sandy.  But entering the sea - only from the pontoon, because in Egypt they are very kind to corals.  Splashing in shallow water with the kids will not work - unless the whole family will have special slippers.  And to go down the ladder into the sea with the baby is possible only during full calm.  Therefore, reviews warn, if you plan to go on <span>vacation to Egypt with a child,</span> it is better to choose not Flamenco Beach Resort 4 * and not El Quseir.  However, for small guests in the hotel two shallow pools were built, and they also have a mini club and a playground.  A babysitter can be called upon request.  There are three swimming pools for adults, one of them is heated in the winter months. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Flamenco Beach Resort 4: reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1109736.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel Flamenco Beach Resort has four stars in its signboard, which means that vacationers expect first-class service.  The hotel has a conference room for thirty people and a fully equipped business center.  Secure parking adjacent to the hotel buildings is free.  On the territory of the complex there is a doctor's office, laundry, SPA center, diving school, nanny.  Room service is available for an extra charge, and round-the-clock.  The hotel has a tour desk and souvenir shops.  Textiles, fruits and other goods can be bought near the hotel or in Al Quseir (a taxi will cost about three dollars). </p><h2>  Flamenco Beach Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  The national composition of vacationers in the hotel is mainly German, French and Italian.  There are almost no Russians.  Many of our tourists really liked this fact.  But there were those who felt a language barrier.  Knowledge of English saves!  The cuisine in the restaurants was focused mainly on Italians: a lot of pasta and other typical dishes of the Apennine Peninsula.  Very tasty ice cream, but Flamenco Beach Resort, reviews warn about this, it works according to the ‚ÄúThree Free Meals‚Äù system.  Therefore, all snacks and cocktails with alcohol cost money.  There were no complaints about food.  Everything is very tasty, fresh and of high quality.  There is no need to line up before the restaurant opens or at six in the morning to take a sunbed. </p>
