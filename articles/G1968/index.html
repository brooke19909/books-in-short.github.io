    <p>  Everyone wants to get beautiful bright pictures when taking pictures.  However, it often turns out that when you see an interesting moment, you manage to shoot it, but the photo turns out to be somehow dark.  A lens with a weak aperture may be to blame for this.  That is why it is so important to know what the <span>lens aperture</span> means <span>.</span>  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  The aperture ratio of the lens is another very revealing parameter.  It is as important as the <span>focal length,</span> angle of view, and others.  This parameter characterizes the brightness of the image built on the lens matrix.  The more aperture lens, the brighter the image they create.  And at a lower rate, it will be darker. </p><p>  Aperture is characterized by the relative value of the hole, and is indicated in the form of a fraction.  For example, the inscription ¬º means that for a lens with a relative aperture size ¬º, the diameter of the aperture is four times smaller than the focal length parameter.  It is important to note that the size of the actual real objective hole is rather a virtual quantity.  This diameter usually does not match either the diaphragm diameter or the front <span>lens of the lens.</span> </p><p>  It is quite possible to calculate the size of the actual objective hole, but it cannot be measured.  Relative values ‚Äã‚Äãtraditionally depend on the size of the image field for which the device is designed.  We can say that lenses with a constant focal length have a very high aperture, for example, f / 1.4-f / 1.8, in contrast to those in which the focal length is variable.  Typically, optics with variable focal lengths also have a variable aperture parameter, since their design is much simpler. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about this, based on some example, then we can say that if the optics are marked 20-80 / 3.4-4.7, this will mean that with a focal length of 20 millimeters the relative size of the hole will be f / 3.4, and if the focal length becomes 80 mm, the hole will change and become f / 4.7.  However, the higher the lens aperture, the more expensive the device itself. </p><p>  It would be ideal to have in your arsenal a set with a different indicator of this parameter, but for ordinary people this option is not suitable, since spending on them is incommensurable with nothing.  It makes sense to acquire such expensive equipment only if the photos are printed in magazines or elsewhere, otherwise not. </p><p>  In the absence of such a goal, it is enough to purchase a conventional camera.  You should not take cameras that have a low aperture ratio, since very soon you yourself will feel that the photos are not beautiful and bright enough, and this defect cannot be removed.  However, modern devices, even the simplest ones, have very high-quality built-in automation. </p><p>  At its core, the lens aperture is a property that demonstrates the amount of light passing through this device.  Based on this position, the lenses that have only a small aperture have the lowest aperture.  Lenses can be slow or fast, that is, with a greater or lesser aperture, depending on the size of the aperture, usually it compares different cameras, whose focal length is the same. </p><p>  By such a parameter as the lens aperture, most often different types of photographic equipment are compared.  It is believed that with the maximum value of this indicator, the best pictures are obtained at various degrees of illumination.  If you use a <span>varifocal lens,</span> then you have the opportunity not only to change the focal length, but also to get a different aperture value. </p>
