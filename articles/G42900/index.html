They are located in the lowlands on the site of a flat sea.  The banks of the largest among them have a flat structure.  At the end of their journey, the waters of the lakes merge with the Kulunda River.  They feed on this water stream, as well as underground keys.  Previously, Kulunda lakes were connected, due to which the people were considered a single body of water, now they are separated by dams. </p><p>  For travelers with cars, the coastline clearly does not seem too convenient: in the spring, a viscous salt marsh appears.  It is almost impossible to leave it; you have to push the car and dig out the adhering soil. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is constantly changing.  This is due to the fact that in summer evaporation occurs due to the dry climate.  In principle, this natural phenomenon is a way to get rid of excess water. </p>

    <h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Kulundinskoye <span>Lake (Altai Territory)</span> is a shallow body of water: the bottom is at a distance of 5 m, although this mark is more often located at 2.5-3 m. The coastline is not very large (105 km).  The water in the pond is practically unsalted and warm, even in winter.  In the summer season, the lake can literally warm up to +30 degrees.  The surrounding area around the Kulunda stream has a mostly steppe appearance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Convenient and comfortable beaches are located in the west and north.  The only drawback of the reservoir is the lack of the ability to dive from the bridge: to get to a place where at least waist-deep, you have to pass a decent gap in shallow water.  However, for those who have children, this option will be very successful.  Near the reed, it is better not to swim, as midges are constantly found near plants.  Kulunda lake (the map shows the terrain in the map) is shallow, but even in the driest periods it does not dry out.  Only small bays can be exposed for a short time.  This phenomenon is explained by the fact that <span>groundwater</span> nourishes the lake itself well.  After liquid gets on the skin, there will be no salt deposits, as, for example, after the spring stream water (also located in the Altai Territory). </p><h2>  Travel amenities </h2><p>  There are no recreation centers on the shores of the lake.  Everyone who came here to live is either in tents or in one of the houses of the nearby village.  There are no prohibitions;  the only problem is that firewood cannot be found for making a fire (they will have to be bought), and water for drinking and food can be collected in any well of the nearest settlement.  In order to rinse after swimming in the <span>salt lake, you</span> have to go to the Znamenka pond. </p><p>  To get to the Altai Sea (as the locals call the lake), it is enough to drive to the city of Slavgorod.  And from there a direct bus is already going.  Those who do not want to live in a tent can rent a room in a private holiday home. </p>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Historically, Kulunda lakes are a nesting and living place for many rare birds and animals.  Quite often, when flying, birds in huge flocks stop for a while here to rest.  As a rule, each season their number for one trip to the south is more than 200 thousand individuals of various species: from geese to gulls.  Some of them remain in this place for summer nesting.  Kulunda lakes have become a permanent home for 150 species of birds.  In order to protect rare representatives, reserves and special parks were created.  In the steppes you can meet jerboa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, the fish here are much smaller than nesting birds.  Due to the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Altai Sea is constantly decreasing, there is more salt, the fish is dying out.  Fishermen who really want to catch prey in the proposed area will have to do this only at the confluence with the river.  Although there is already a luxury to get a perch, but you can do it. </p>

    <h2>  pros </h2><p>  Getting from the village to the lake is easy enough.  This can be done on foot - who doesn‚Äôt like such walks in a beautiful area?  But if you wish, you can take a bus and drive directly to the shore.  In general, the reservoir has life-giving energy and tremendous power.  It has a pleasant climate, which is so similar to the sea.  The birds singing is pleasing.  You can see flamingos, they are quite often in the Altai Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Healing properties </h2><p>  Kulunda lake (its photo is presented in the article) began to gain popularity, thanks to the healing properties of the soil and the waters themselves.  Those patients who have lung problems will have a good rest in these places.  This fact can be explained by the fact that the vapor has a lot of bromine in itself, which positively affects the breathing process and simply calms the nerves.  Diseases associated with dermatology and nasopharynx can be treated with water from the Altai Sea.  It‚Äôs easy to forget about joint problems by making masks from the local clay.  Moreover, it will help rejuvenate the skin, make it softer. </p>
