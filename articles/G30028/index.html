As for drinks, tourists also had no complaints about their quality. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, by no means all the guests of Ozkaymak Alaaddin were satisfied with their rooms.  So, one part of the guests was dissatisfied with the quality of furniture and sanitary ware, the other was not satisfied with the view from the window.  Also, many were confused by the poor performance of the air conditioners, as a result of which the rooms during the day were sometimes hot and sultry. </p><p>  Also, complaints from travelers caused the fact that both near the pool and on the beach there are too few sun loungers.  Therefore, in order to take loungers for themselves and their relatives or friends, people had to get up early in the morning.  If tourists went to the pool and the beach after breakfast, then finding free sunbeds was very difficult. </p><p>  For the rest, the vast majority of tourists from Russia and other CIS countries liked to relax here.  Many travelers would recommend this hotel to their friends and relatives. </p>

The tourist infrastructure of this region also deserves attention.  So, there is a mass of various hotels of various "stars" for every taste and size of the wallet.  Also in Alanya you will find many bars, restaurants, shops, night clubs.  This region is equally well suited both for a calm and measured comfortable family vacation, and for a fun pastime for a company of young people. </p><p>  As for the local climate, since Alanya is the southernmost Mediterranean resort of Turkey, the air temperature here is two to three degrees higher than in Antalya and Side.  It is dry and hot in the daytime, and at night it is quite cool because of the proximity of the mountains.  The tourist season in Alanya is very long.  So, it starts from the end of April and lasts until the last days of November.  The hottest month here is August, when in the afternoon the air warms up to 31 degrees Celsius.  The water temperature in August is 27 degrees. </p><p>  The resort region of Alanya includes six tourist settlements: Avsallar, Konakli, Inzhekum, Karabura, Mahmutlar and Okurcalar. </p><h2>  Alanya Attractions </h2><p>  Most of the historical sights here are located on a high hill dividing the city of Alanya into two parts.  So, the main monument here is Kyzyl Kula, or the Red Tower.  For many years she faithfully served the inhabitants of the city as a defense against attacks from the sea.  Kyzyl Kula is even depicted on the flag of Alanya.  It was built in the XIII century, and is called red because of the color of the brick.  The tower has an octagonal shape and consists of five floors.  Now at the bottom of this building is an ethnographic museum, open to tourists. </p><p>  Another historical monument, which was also built in the XIII century, is the fortress of Alanya, located on the very top of the hill.  Previously, in its place were defenses erected by the ancient Romans.  The fortress is surrounded by three rows of walls, the length of which is almost seven kilometers.  They have 83 towers and 140 bastions.  There are several noteworthy structures on the territory of the fortress: the mosque and tomb of Sultan Akshebe, as well as the Suleyman mosque, famous for its incredible acoustics. </p><p>  Not far from Kyzyl Kula in the city port is the old Tersane shipyard, which was built by the Seljuks in the first half of the 13th century.  Its length is 56 meters and its width is 44 meters.  Nearby is the arsenal built to guard the shipyard.  Today, the city authorities are developing a plan to turn both the shipyard and the arsenal into a single interesting maritime museum. </p><p>  As for the natural attractions of Alanya, then, of course, <span>Damlatash Cave</span> deserves special attention <span>.</span>  It is located in the western part of the peninsula, at the very foot of the Alanya fortress.  The cave was discovered only in the middle of the last century, and today it is equipped for everyone to visit safely.  You can get into the depths of the cave by walking along a 50-meter narrow passage.  Inside your eyes you will see a magnificent picture: incredible beauty and colors of stalactites and stalagmites, whose age exceeds 15 thousand years. </p><p>  Also noteworthy is the Kizlar Magarasy cave, where, according to legend, the pirates hid the abducted women.  In addition, it is interesting to visit the Phosphoric Cave, whose walls glow in the dark.  You can get into both of these caves only by sea by boat. </p><p>  An interesting natural site in Alanya is Cape Gilvarda.  It is located in the southwestern part of the Alanya Peninsula and is a narrow rocky stretch of land, extending into the sea for four hundred meters.  It houses a group of ancient monasteries of great historical value. </p><p>  Near the Cleopatra beach is the Archaeological Museum of Alanya, founded in the 60s of the last century.  Here you can see a variety of exhibits related to different cultures and eras, and allowing you to trace the history of this region.  For example, fragments of real Alanian houses, weapons of warriors of the times of the Ottoman Empire, etc. are stored here. The main exhibit of the Archaeological Museum is a bronze statue of Hercules.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its height is only 51 centimeters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Her age, according to scientists, dates back to the second century BC.</font></font></p>
