It has long been popular all over the world, if only for the reason that it was the first to create a unique <span>Teflon coating.</span>  Such a layer, which does not allow food to burn, is also present in multicookers produced by the company. </p><p>  This technique has good characteristics, however, such devices are suitable only for small families consisting of 1-4 people.  They have a capacity of 450 to 630 watts, and the volume of the bowl is 3-4.5 liters.  The Tefal crock-pot, reviews of which can be seen below, has a concise and minimized appearance.  The case is made of a special material that does not conduct heat.  "Contact" of the user with the device is carried out through the <span>touch panel.</span>  You can cook in one of six modes.  We are talking about processes such as cooking, stewing, baking.  The listed modes are standard for any multicooker from this company, the remaining three or more depend on the features of a particular model.  Basic are also the functions of yogurt preparation and a steaming mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crock-pot tefal" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188466.jpg" width="500"></div>

They have the same modes, but differ in technical characteristics - power and volume.  It was they who proved the qualitative superiority of such a device as the Tefal multicooker.  The reviews written by the owners suggest that its main advantage is the inner bowl.  Since it has a Teflon coating, the food does not burn and cooks evenly.  The bowl is resistant to mechanical stress. </p><p>  The basic functions include a timer - it is present on all models.  Its maximum value is 9 hours, which will be more than enough for the optimal use of the multicooker.  You can warm up a finished dish and prepare a mixture for yogurt using the special function - Keep Warm.  It allows you to keep the temperature inside at a certain level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker tefal reviews" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188468.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Crock-pots "Tefal", all models of which are delivered with a certain complete set, will be excellent helpers for any housewife.  You can buy them together with certain accessories: a measuring cup, a scoop, a spatula and a steam basket.  They are made of special plastic, resistant to temperature extremes and not amenable to the influence of the external environment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main advantage of the Tefal multicooker is not its pleasant appearance and amazing characteristics, but the build quality and confidence in long-term operation.  The company, being in the market for more than one year, has long become a leader and has established itself as a reliable and loyal manufacturer.  Prices for the Tefal multicooker range from 1.2 to 60 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  <span>Functions</span> of multicookers from "Tefal" </h2><p>  It should be noted immediately a very worthy function - getting rid of steam.  Thanks to this program, the Tefal multicooker is able to normalize the pressure inside it itself after the completion of the cooking process. </p><p>  It would seem that not everyone may need a timer that delays the start of cooking.  However, sometimes there are situations when it is necessary to cook food in the morning or get up early in the evening after work so as not to be left without breakfast.  In such cases, when there is no desire to fight laziness, fatigue, or just want to sleep longer, a crock-pot will come to the rescue.  Delay will allow you to cook dishes, for example, half an hour or an hour before the hostess wakes up. </p><p>  The Tefal multicooker is equipped with a heating function, which is automatic, but can be turned off if desired.  The cook chooses the temperature according to his desire, exposing it at around 40 ¬∞ C to 120 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The device itself is the most reliable and safe.  It is covered with a special material that is not able to transfer heat (and, accordingly, heat up).  So that a person does not receive a burn, the manufacturer installed a special valve.  And the service life was increased due to the non-stick layer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crock-pot tefal rk812832" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188469.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Important Features </h2><p>  The Tefal crock-pot is distinguished by the fact that it does not have a bowl for collecting condensate, that is, droplets of liquid that appear after the steam has cooled.  It should be noted that the external cover both closes and opens in automatic mode - just turn on the device.  In the kit you can find a small book with recipes.  In the global market, the average cost of such a slow cooker is $ 286. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker tefal Price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188471.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance RK812832 </h2><p>  Slow cooker "Tefal" RK812832 has a nice color and has a special finish, which is made of stainless steel.  The window lid has a removable structure.  The control panel is located on the side face.  The display has a liquid crystal structure;  buttons are located near it for convenient control of the program.  It is easy to move the device at the expense of a special handle. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of the RK812832 model </h2><p>  The Tefal crock-pot RK812832 has a bowl with a very non-standard spherical shape.  It easily distributes heat.  Specific to this model are functions that are called ‚ÄúRice / Grains‚Äù and ‚ÄúPilaf / Risotto‚Äù.  They are automatic - just put the products and select the appropriate program.  The Tefal multicooker itself will choose the temperature and time during which the dish will be prepared.  You can also note the usefulness of functions such as "Heating", and a program with a delayed start <span>(standby time is</span> not more than a day). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multicookers tefal all models" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1188467.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The minus cooker has one, judging by the reviews.  The disadvantage is an element not provided for by the manufacturer, which would collect condensate.  However, it is not so significant: moisture droplets can be wiped with a napkin manually. </p>
