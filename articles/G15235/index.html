On one of these trips, which took place on June 5, at night (at the time of the accident the clock was already 22:45), the ship entered at full speed under the passage of the Ulyanovsk bridge.  It was not intended for passage of ships, therefore, as a result, an accident occurred - the supporting structure was hit by the ship ‚ÄúAlexander Suvorov‚Äù.  The motor ship, for which the catastrophe turned out to be fatal, was badly damaged.  The wheelhouse turned out to be demolished, all the <span>chimneys were</span> cut off <span>,</span> and there was no cinema hall on board.  The speed of the vessel at the time of the accident was 25 km / h, and this led to such a strong blow.  In addition, it by inertia passed another 300 meters after the collision.

    <p>  But damage to structures would not be so terrible if the tragedy did not lead to mass deaths.  Just at the indicated time, many were in the cinema and on the dance floor, which were located on the upper deck.  It is known about 176 dead.  But their exact number will not be able to find out.  The fact is that during the flight "Alexander Suvorov" was overloaded.  In addition to the official 330 passengers, 50 crew members and more than 30 maintenance personnel, the ship also had acquaintances, which were carried out without tickets by the ship‚Äôs staff. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The reasons for the tragedy and the fate of passengers </h2>

    <p>  After the accident, experts began to find out why it happened.  So, in the same year, it was found that the main causes of the disaster were the negligence of the helmsman and the first navigator, as well as the fact that there were no signal lights obligatory at night.  In addition, at the scene of the accident - on the sixth passage - there was a railway box, which in the dark can be confused with a signal board indicating the ship's passage.  All of these factors in the complex led to the accident with the ship ‚ÄúAlexander Suvorov‚Äù.  The ship (a catastrophe led to numerous casualties) could have avoided such a fate. </p><p>  According to a fateful combination of circumstances, a freight train, in which there were 53 wagons, was going through the bridge into which the ship crashed at full speed.  After the collision, 11 of them went off the rails, some of them rolled over, cargo fell on the ship.  It was coal, logs and grain.  Part of the wagons suffered due to the fact that as a result of the <span>disaster, the railway</span> tracks were shifted by 40 cm. </p><p>  Fortunately, most of the people still managed to save.  This was achieved thanks to the operational actions of the few railway workers who were at the scene of the tragedy, and the good organization of the medical staff who promptly received and rendered assistance to the victims. </p><h2>  2008 accident </h2><p>  But the tragedy in 1983 was not the only one for the ship.  In 2008, he also could not avoid disaster.  Of course, this was no longer the wreck of the ship "Alexander Suvorov", but just a small accident. </p><p>  On May 30, the ship sailed along the Moscow Canal towards Tver.  But when passing through the gateway, it touched it with one of the sides.  This caused damage to the steering.  Immediately after the incident, the floodgate was filled with water, and the ship was able to exit.  All passengers on board at that time were returned to Moscow by bus. </p><h2>  Ship infrastructure </h2>
