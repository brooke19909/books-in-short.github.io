  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jomtien hotels in Pattaya: how to choose the right one</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most popular tourist destinations is Thailand.  Only here, the developed infrastructure is combined with unique exoticism in such a way that the European person feels completely comfortable, all the benefits of civilization are available to him, but at the same time he gets a lot of impressions from getting to know this unusual country.  Here, amazing nature, lots of exotic fruits, beautiful warm sea and marvelous climate, and the friendliness and friendliness of the local population knows no boundaries. </p><p>  One of the most developed resorts is Pattaya.  There are a huge number of restaurants, clubs and, of course, hotels, among them there are a lot of hotels on the Jomtien coast.  I must say, <span>Jomtien hotels</span> in Pattaya are very popular.  The largest of them is AMBASSADOR CITY JOMTIEN 4 *, which consists of five large buildings that make up the hotel town, with a total of almost five thousand rooms. </p><p>  The largest building is the 42-story Marina Tower, which includes 2000 rooms.  The higher the floor, the more luxurious and larger the rooms.  The second tallest is the 17-story Ocean Wing with 1,400 rooms, followed by the 7-, 6- and 4-story Ambassador Wing, Garden Wing and Inn Wing.  Among the free services of the hotel complex are the use of 4 adults and 2 children's pools, <span>a gym, conference rooms,</span> safes, parking and garages, all types of beach sports.  You will have to pay for the use of <span>sports fields,</span> for example, courts.  Paid services include billiards, bowling, hairdresser and beauty salon, laundry and dry cleaning services, Thai massage, doctor and babysitting services, use of sauna and jacuzzi.  The hotel complex has five restaurants with different cuisines, several bars and cafes, a night club.  There is a private beach on site.  This is one of the most popular hotels in Thailand, mainly due to a very developed infrastructure - not all Jomtien hotels in Pattaya can boast of such a service.  The main problem of the hotel is the cleanliness of the beach, this is noted by many of those who chose a vacation in Pattaya, so many tourists prefer to go swimming in other places where it‚Äôs cleaner and less crowded.  If you look at reviews on Jomtien hotels, then this is one of the main problems of the entire coast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, there are exceptions, for example, PINNACLE GRAND JOMTIEN RESORT &amp; SPA 3 * with its own beach: guests note its excellent condition, apparently this is due to the fact that the hotel is not located in the center - and that‚Äôs why reviews are also negative: from here far to places of entertainment, so you have to choose which is more important.  The service and comfort of the rooms at the level, the food, although not very diverse, but decent.  By the way, almost all Jomtien hotels in Pattaya do not please their guests with a wide range of breakfast dishes.  The hotel itself is quiet and comfortable, vacationers are mainly Europeans, Russians and Thais. </p><p>  Basically, the rest do not have their own beach, but they are located near the city.  On the one hand, it is convenient, but in the center the beach condition is rather poor due to the large number of vacationers, but all the entertainment is within walking distance.  Those who choose hotels in the city center usually go for a swim on the islands or out of town - the water there is clean and clear, and the beaches are not littered.  True, most likely, a secluded place will still not be found, since there are many people who want to do this. </p><p>  Thus, before the trip, you must first carefully examine all the Jomtien hotels in Pattaya and the reviews on them, and only then choose, depending on what you need, clean beaches or a convenient location of the hotel, because it is unlikely to find a middle ground, and still have to go somewhere, either for entertainment, or for a beach holiday.  Pattaya is a wonderful city and one of the most popular resorts in Thailand, providing a lot of opportunities for recreation, you just need to decide what you expect from it. </p>
