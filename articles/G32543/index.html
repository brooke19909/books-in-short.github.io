This gadget has attracted the attention of many users.  But why did this happen?  Why is this product good?  Or maybe we just have a well-advertised tablet?  The Xperia Z4 Tablet is the dream of many.  And now we will understand why it is worth paying attention to this particular model.  In this case, we will help owners reviews, as well as technical specifications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia z4" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/980219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Xperia Z4, like many tablets, has a pretty good screen.  And already for it you can praise this device.  After all, the diagonal here is very large - 10.1 inches.  But by modern standards, this is considered the norm.  The resolution in this model is also pleasing - 2560 by 1600 pixels.  This means that you can easily watch movies in high quality, as well as read books and surf the Internet.  And all this without harm to their own eyesight. </p><p>  In addition, the Xperia Z4 transmits just a gorgeous image.  16 million colors and shades, excellent quality even in the sun or in cloudy weather - this is what customers respect this tablet for.  In addition, the screen is protected by glass made using new technologies.  It prevents the Xperia Z4 from getting damaged quickly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The dimensions of the device itself also play an important role.  And his weight as well.  Nobody wants to carry not just a gadget in their bag, but a multi-functional ‚Äúbrick‚Äù.  So much attention is paid to this moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z4" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/980218.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the Sony Xperia Z4 with a large screen can not have small dimensions.  But they are acceptable.  It is 254 millimeters long and 167 millimeters wide. And the device‚Äôs thickness is small.  Only 6.1 millimeters.  For a modern smartphone, these are very good indicators.  And Sony Xperia Z4 weighs not so much - about 400 grams.  Compared to Samsung, for example, this is extremely small.  So it is convenient to walk with such a tablet, even if there is not enough space in the bag. </p><h2>  System Basics </h2><p>  Xperia Z4 is not only a display.  Do not forget about the "insides" of the device.  The thing is that a lot of attention is usually paid to the operating system.  And to the processor.  Without these components, one cannot imagine the choice of a normal gadget.  And the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet tablet pleases the owners in this regard. </p><p>  The thing is that the system here is very good.  But she is familiar to many.  It's about Android.  The assembly is installed by Lolipop, and the version is the latest and newest, 5.0.2.  It has only a small number of similar gadgets.  But this does not make you refuse to buy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet sony xperia z4 tablet" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/980217.jpg" width="600"></div>

It consists of 8 cores: 4 to 2 GHz and 4 to 1.5 GHz.  To be honest, according to the data obtained, we can say that we have the most gaming tablet.  And he can give his owners many opportunities that are not found anywhere else.  So, you can pay attention to the model already because of the operating system and processor. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  Also, do not forget that the <span>Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet is also</span> endowed with decent RAM.  Such an indicator is available only in some analogues.  After all, the owner of this brainchild of "Sony" will be offered as much as 3 GB. </p><p>  What does it mean?  For example, the fact that now you can run all the coolest and newest games, applications and programs directly on the tablet.  And at the same time about 20 various windows can "work".  This excludes an open e-book, as well as an Internet browser.  So, our device, thanks to such an amount of RAM, is also multifunctional.  This is exactly what many buyers want.  But finding such opportunities is now extremely difficult. </p><h2>  Place for data </h2><p>  Free space on the gadget is another point that should be considered when choosing.  The thing is that the Xperia Z4 this indicator, like everyone else, is at the highest level.  Here we will be offered 32 GB of free space.  But of these, 1.5-2 will go to the operating system and <span>tablet capabilities.</span>  So in reality, you get about 30 gigabytes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia z4 price" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/980216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As practice shows, this is not so much.  Especially when it comes to a gaming tablet.  Thus, you have to look for options to add space for data.  But, unfortunately, the solution is not always found.  Some models do not have this feature.  But not at Sony Xperia Z4. </p><h2>  Map </h2><p>  After all, it is here that anyone can connect a special memory card to the tablet.  And she will add some space to the device.  In addition, data will now become mobile.  After all, the format of the available memory card is MicroSD.  This type of card is inserted into smartphones, tablets, cameras, and cameras - everywhere and everywhere. </p><p>  True, there are small restrictions.  For example, regarding the maximum permissible size of a memory card.  It is 128 GB.  Perhaps, so far, more additional space has not yet been invented.  So, in fact, there are no restrictions here. </p>

    <p>  A small piece of expert advice - do not fill the entire space with data.  Leave a few gigabytes free.  This will not allow many negative consequences, especially if you have a lot of small documents.  So you can keep the operating system in a healthy state. </p><h2>  Camera and battery </h2><p>  Xperia Z4, the release date of which pleased many buyers, is also endowed with a decent camera, as well as a battery.  Perhaps, without these features, it is now also very difficult to imagine a modern gadget. </p><p>  For example, you should pay attention to the fact that there are two cameras.  Rear - with autofocus, but without a flash.  And she shoots with a quality of 8 megapixels.  The front has neither autofocus nor flash.  The quality of shooting, however, is noteworthy - 5.1 megapixels.  This is more than many manufacturers can offer. </p><p>  The battery is not removable.  And its average volume is 6000 mAh.  Not so much.  But if you listen to users, then Xperia works extremely long.  Even if you constantly play and fully use the capabilities of the tablet, it will not turn off even after 5 days of such work.  In standby mode, the time increases to 2 months.  With regular, but inactive contacting, you can expect a whole month of work without recharging.  Very convenient, practical and reliable. </p><h2>  Price tag and conclusions </h2><p>  Since we are dealing with a game and a new tablet, then the price for Xperia Z4 will be appropriate.  Do not wait for this model to be cheap.  It will cost lovers of tablets at 42,000 rubles.  A lot, but it's worth it. </p><p>  As many buyers say, it is worth looking at this device if you need the best of the best.  Regardless of the cost.  After all, Xperia has always demonstrated very high-quality <span>gaming tablets.</span>  Just what so many buyers need.  So, if you are a gamer, then this tablet is created just for you.  Otherwise, for work or study, you can pick up something less expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xperia z4 release date" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/980214.jpg" width="600"></div>
