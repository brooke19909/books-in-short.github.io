    <h2>  How to choose a model? </h2><p>  Choosing a good model is not easy.  If you look at a compact washing machine, then the capacity of the drum should not exceed 4 kg.  In this case, the power of the device must be about 3 kW.  In this case, the power consumption will be 120 watts.  Modern devices are made with a display and a diode display system. </p><p>  The controller is used to set the washing mode.  In order to protect the model from leakage, filters are installed.  The spin speed of a good model is 1300 rpm.  If you select a large washing machine, then its power should be 6.5 kW at a frequency of 55 Hz.  The spin speed, in turn, is required to leave no more than 2300 rpm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General features of operation </h2><p>  First, select the type of fabric.  If you deal with synthetics or cotton, you should not set a high temperature.  Depending on the number of things, the push-up time is selected.  Many experts do not recommend using a lot of powder.  It is also necessary not to use a large amount of emollient.  In order to clean the nozzles, you need to call a specialist. </p><p>  If you encounter any problems, you must disconnect the device from the network.  It should also be noted that before using the washing machine, you need to adjust the legs.  Thus, the level of vibration is minimized. </p>
