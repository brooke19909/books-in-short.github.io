Rules and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Having gathered with friends you can not only talk, enjoy dinner or have a drink, but also have fun.  There are many different exciting games in which certain skills are not needed, but only activity and a good mood. </p><h2>  Mafia - what kind of game is this? </h2><p>  How to play the <span>"Mafia"?</span>  <span>Mafia</span> is a popular modern game for a group of friends.  It is useful for training strategic thinking and the ability to build actions based on logic, provided that you know the rules.  Of particular interest to the game is its psychological component - participants learn the intricacies of communication between individuals and begin to feel each other deeper. </p><p>  Many are interested in the question - is it possible to play "Mafia" for teenagers?  The answer will definitely be positive.  The fact is that this entertainment socializes and adapts the guys as part of the team.  For this reason, it is often practiced in schools, summer camps and other children's institutions. </p><p>  Such fun is available to everyone.  You can purchase a special set consisting of special cards and masks or even go to a thematic institution.  For many novice players, at first it‚Äôs difficult to get the rules of the game ‚ÄúMafia‚Äù with cards.  However, understanding the rules of the game is not so difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nerdcollab.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card mafia" class="if uuid-2388700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72333/2388700.jpg"></div><h2>  The essence of the game </h2><p>  All existing games are divided into two classes: the option of competition (struggle) and performance (masquerade).  The Mafia combines in its process the characteristics of these two species.  The peculiarity of the game is that it is not interconnected with cash expenses, in comparison with cards, and with the presence of a sports physique (basketball and other sports).  In addition, she pleases with intellectual pleasure.  In the disinterested carelessness of the game, its possibilities lurk. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This game is exceptional.  Its basis is live communication of the participants, saturated with lies, meanness and treachery, and this, by the way, is the norm.  During the game, her condition is discussed - opinions are clashed in a vehement dispute, and someone prefers to sit silently, while others are actively trying to convince others of their words.  Thanks to this structure, the game differs from the calm fights of the minds that are characteristic of chess, which makes it look like real life.  The goal of the mafia is to defeat a group of citizens, the goal of the latter is the exact opposite. </p><h2>  Game aspects </h2><p>  Before playing the "Mafia", it is important to note that it includes two main components: psychological and mathematical. </p><p>  The first means that players must note in their head - against whom the participants vote, and who they actually are.  If necessary, it will simply be concluded that the mafia usually speaks against an honest person. </p><p>  The second component means the presence of minimal acting data, as it will be necessary to convincingly lie or, on the contrary, to convince participants of the veracity of their words.  In addition, it is important to have the ability to persuade people to their side (helps in choosing a dishonest player). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sets for the mafia game" class="if uuid-2388718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72333/2388718.jpg"></div><h2>  Basic concepts </h2><p>  What are the rules of the game and how to play the "Mafia"?  The game has the ability to stipulate and adjust the rules depending on the situation, but there are fundamentals that never undergo changes.  So, for example, each action is performed using a common vote.  The game is divided into 3 groups: the mafia, civilians and the third category - with power.  The organizer determines the number of people playing.  The smallest number of participants: host, 5 civilians, two people from the mafia.  The best composition: the leader, 5 civilians, two from the mafia and the commissar.  It is permissible to play with any size of the assembled company. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Existing roles: </p><ul><li>  A civilian (sleeping at night, during the day - looking for the mafia; if he was killed, he has the right to say the last word - who, in his opinion, is the mafia). </li><li>  Mafia (at night they decide who to kill, inform the host about this). </li><li>  Doctor (treatment of any character the mafia shot at). </li><li>  Mistress (plays for the side of the townspeople, comes to any player at night, after which he does not participate in the discussion for one day and defends himself against voting against him). </li><li>  Commissioner (disclosure of identity - the mafia or not?). </li><li>  Maniac (located not on the side of the mafia and not on the side of civilians, so his goal is to kill any player). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.gamesmen.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cards for the mafia" class="if uuid-2388720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72333/2388720.jpg"></div><h2>  Without which the game will not take place </h2><p>  Before playing the game "Mafia", you must make sure that there are: </p><ul><li>  Special cards "Mafia" (you can play with regular playing cards, specifying the meaning of the pictures). </li><li>  The right number of players. </li><li>  The leader who keeps order. </li><li>  A piece of paper and a pen for the host to record key moments of the game. </li><li>  Good mood. </li></ul><p>  All of these conditions are important for the company to be able to play this exciting game.

The presenter is chosen using a card or appointed by voting. </li><li>  The first night - the leader reveals all the players (who are mafiosi and who are civilians). </li><li>  Day - Mafia members are discussed and searched.  Meanwhile, the mafia is also participating in the discussion and decides who to shoot at.  Their task is to substitute the townsman, convincing everyone that he is the bandit.
