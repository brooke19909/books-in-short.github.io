  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lithium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. in medicine and food industry</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lithium hydroxide is an inorganic (i.e., carbon-free) base of lithium, an <span>alkali metal.</span>  The substance has the formula LiOH. </p><p>  Under standard conditions, hydroxide is a colorless crystal.  Outwardly, they have the shape of polyhedra with the correct arrangement of angles and sides.  The crystals are based on a tetragonal lattice. </p><p>  Lithium hydroxide is a very aggressive substance, therefore, when working with it, safety measures must be taken: avoid contact with open skin and, especially, mucous membranes.  Do not work with this substance without protective equipment.  Contact with mucous membranes or eyes will result in very severe chemical burns or blindness. </p><p>  Lithium hydroxide can be obtained by conducting chemical reactions of lithium metal, or oxide with water, <span>lithium carbonate</span> with calcium hydroxide, or by exchange reactions. </p><p>  Reacting with acids or acid oxides, LiOH gives salt and water.  If the metal is heated in an inert atmosphere, it decomposes into lithium oxide and water. </p><p>  Lithium hydroxide is necessary to obtain salts of this metal.  These salts are part of the fillers for <span>alkaline batteries.</span>  They are also used in gas masks, underwater and space vessels for the absorption of carbon dioxide.  Without lithium salts, polymerization is impossible (it acts as a catalyst).  The substance is widely used in the glass industry, in the production of ceramics, lubricants that can tolerate large temperature differences.  Today, more and more of this substance is spent on lithium-ion power sources. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, lithium was used to treat gout.  Today it is known that metal is included in the complex treatment of drug addicts and pathological aggression.  It has been established: if there is a lot of lithium in drinking water in a region, people in this area are calmer, more balanced, kinder.  Among them, there are almost no snappers, buoys, brawlers.  Lithium prevents hypertension, activates the regeneration of bone marrow cells. </p><p>  Colorless hygroscopic crystals (namely, potassium hydroxide has this form) are often called potassium hydroxide or caustic or caustic potash in everyday life.  The substance (KOH) is necessary for the production of liquid soap, some potassium compounds.  Water crystals of caustic potassium have a pronounced alkaline reaction.  <span>Potassium</span> hydroxide KOH is <span>obtained</span> by electrolysis of KCl solutions without the use of mercury cathodes.  Such reactions give a very pure substance with a minimum amount of impurities. </p><p>  Potassium hydroxide is able to enter into <span>a neutralization reaction</span> with acids, to react (forming salt and water) with acidic oxides. </p><p>  In industry, KOH is used to <span>produce methane,</span> determine cations in chemical solutions, obtain potassium salts or absorb acid gases.  The product is widely used in the manufacture of soaps, shampoos, bleaches, foams or shaving gels. </p><p>  If some lithium compounds are widely used in medicine (for the treatment of bipolar disorders, cyclothymia, schizophrenia, etc. disorders), then potassium hydroxide is used by the food industry.  This is one of the most common <span>nutritional supplements</span> - E525.  The additive is used as an emulsifier and acidity regulator.  The dangers of this supplement are actively debated.  However, the prevailing opinion is that in small quantities it does not cause much harm to health.  It is not included in the list of food additives categorically banned in our country. </p><p>  Potassium hydroxide is an extremely aggressive and dangerous substance.  Burns paper, destroys skin and other organics.  That is why it is possible to work with KOH only in special rubber gloves and glasses.  Eye contact with this caustic substance often leads to blindness. </p>
