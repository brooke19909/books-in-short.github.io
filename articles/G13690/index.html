  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow - Kerch route: how to get to the Crimea?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer is coming, time for vacations and trips to the sea.  Where to go to a Russian tourist?  Crimea is an excellent option, especially considering that the automobile part of the Kerch bridge has already been commissioned.  However, you still need to get to this very bridge, for example, along the route Moscow - Kerch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Route Moscow-Kerch" class="if uuid-2622188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2622188.jpg"></div><h2>  Subject of national pride </h2><p>  Recently, Crimea has been a matter of nationwide pride for Russians, however, like a bridge.  Today, when there are no problems with getting to the peninsula without queues for a ferry, Russians are simply obliged to support the domestic resort region.  Many vacationers are already actively sharing their impressions of the trip along the Kerch-Moscow route.  Basically, of course, they admire the bridge and the quality of the roadbed of a new section of the federal highway passing through the territory of the Krasnodar Territory. </p><p>  To get to Crimea through Ukraine is theoretically possible.  Yes, it is shorter and faster.  However, it is very difficult to explain the purpose of the visit to Ukrainian border guards.  It will be especially difficult to drive to the peninsula.  Therefore, the option of transit through Ukraine is best not considered at all. </p><p>  The road around Russia makes a slight bend and takes a lot of time.  It passes through Rostov-on-Don and many other noteworthy Russian cities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The train doesn't go any further </h2><p>  There are currently no trains operating on the route Moscow - Kerch.  This is due to the fact that the railway part of the Kerch bridge has not yet been completed.  The ferry service does not accept railway rolling stock. </p><p>  However, this does not mean that this type of transport is not available.  Numerous travelers travel by train to cities such as Anapa or Krasnodar.  Regular bus routes run from there, for which you can purchase a ticket directly at the ticket offices of railway stations.  You can, of course, take a taxi and rent a car for the whole vacation, such a service is also in great demand. </p><h2>  Bus tours </h2><p>  The second most popular form of transport is the bus.  Surprisingly, in the age of affordable air travel, it is still in demand.  The Moscow - Kerch bus runs along the general road route and crosses the bridge.  The only plus of this type of transport is that the ticket price is cheaper than the total cost of a trip by private car.  This is a great option for those who suffer from aerophobia, do not like reserved seats for train cars and do not have a personal car. </p><h2>  By air </h2><p>  The most popular transport is air.  Today, a ticket for a flight to the Crimea is comparable in price to the cost of a train ticket to Krasnodar in a compartment car.  Only from Krasnodar to Kerch you can take a bus for about four hours, and if you need to get to the South Coast of Crimea, then more than 10 hours.  The plane, in just two and a half hours, will fly to Simferopol.  From there, even a bus will be cheaper and faster to get to any point in the Crimea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Personal car </h2><p>  Getting from Moscow to Kerch by car is quite simple.  The state of federal highways is very decent.  If the total amount of fuel does not spoil the trip, then the trip will be very memorable.  Many interesting cities, changing landscapes and complete freedom of choice of road - all this makes the romance of car travel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="atlanticsentinel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea roads" class="if uuid-2617965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2617965.jpg"></div><p>  However, you should be careful with navigators.  Maps of companies such as Yandex and Google pave the way not across the bridge, but through the Kerch ferry.  Unlike the bridge, you will have to pay for the crossing. </p><h2>  Distance </h2><p>  Between Kerch and Moscow, the distance is quite large.  According to the most popular road route, it is about 1530 km!  Cut it is unlikely to succeed.  It should also be understood that the time spent on the road to the bridge is still less than the waiting time for the ferry.  Thus, the Kerch bridge is the best option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hmroads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roads in Kerch" class="if uuid-2617964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2617964.jpg"></div><h2>  To Simferopol </h2><p>  The distance from Moscow to Simferopol via Kerch is about 1760 km.  It should be taken into account that the Crimean section of the federal highway is still unfinished.  Most of the road to Simferopol is in satisfactory condition. </p>
