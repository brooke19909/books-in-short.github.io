This is not just a performance with individual numbers, but a whole theatrical show, which is breathtaking.  Three hours of fairy tale and magnificence make viewers believe in magic, and adults - again to plunge into the world of childhood.  What shows are available in the arsenal of the circus master, let's talk in the article. </p><h2>  Who is Gia Eradze? </h2><p>  The "Royal Circus" by Gia Eradze is known all over the world.  The tour program is so extensive that it covers every corner of the globe.  Many people ask what the circus artist is so famous for. </p><p>  Gia Eradze was born in Georgia in 1978.  From childhood, the boy dreamed of an arena, so at the age of 11 he began working at the Tbilisi Circus.  However, he did not forget about studying at school. </p><p>  The artist has a lot of merits and regalia.  Since 2007, Georgy Giulevich began working with Rosgoszirk, and a year later he was appointed head of this team. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the artist chooses the staff personally.  This applies not only to the main performers of numbers, but also extras.  Each participant in the show must have a choreographic or ballet education.  Stage images and costumes are agreed with the troupe, everyone can make their own adjustments and wishes. </p><p>  The "Royal Circus" by Gia Eradze, reviews of which are only positive, deservedly takes prizes at various festivals.  It is very difficult to win the love of the spectator, but the troupe managed to do this thanks to painstaking work and dedication. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gia Eradze show" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1298913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We come to the performance, we find ourselves in a fairy tale </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúRoyal Circus‚Äù Gia Eradze has in its arsenal various shows that fascinate the audience.  The most popular is the Five Continents program.  All rooms are thought out to the smallest detail.  From the beginning of the performance, the viewer is at the ball, ladies in peacock feathers and gold masks, gentlemen in chic costumes dance, dipping those present during the reign of kings. </p><p>  Soon, Gia Eradze himself, dressed in a <span>royal mantle,</span> appears in the arena <span>.</span>  He dreams of a circus, but the courtiers do not let him go.  Suddenly, a white horse appears on the stage, which carries the artist to his dream. </p><p>  The show goes on at an increasing pace.  Camels, birds, tigers, lions, panthers and many other animals appear in the arena.  The organizers of the program offer viewers a journey through the five continents of our planet.  Here you can visit the <span>Brazilian carnival,</span> get into the jungle of Africa, see the battle of gladiators, passionate dances of the Spaniards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal circus gii eradze" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1298915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  New show "Baronets" </h2><p>  Relatively recently, viewers were lucky to see a new show by Gia Eradze ‚ÄúBaronets‚Äù.  It is as great as previous programs.  The number of animals is amazing: dogs, huskies, Dalmatians, bears, camels, deer, greyhounds, tigers, lions, panthers, horses ... </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rooms are truly amazing and unusual.  Viewers most like the performance dedicated to the Russian winter.  Even in the summer, it seems that the snow in the arena is real. </p><p>  Spectators note the well-groomed appearance of animals.  No unpleasant odors.  This is very important, because the performances are attended by children.  In addition, one cannot fail to note the dedication of the artists.  All rooms are worked out to the smallest detail.  It's nice to watch them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal circus gii eradze reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1298912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Technical points </h2><p>  From a technical point of view, all rooms are built quite complicated.  Artists work with great dedication.  I would also like to mention the costumes.  For the show, they were sewn in large quantities.  All of them are made according to individual sketches by leading fashion designers and designers.  Rumor has it that Valentin Yudashkin himself took part in creating the images. </p><p>  The most expensive materials were used: brocade, silk, guipure, velvet.  Swarovski stones act as decorations.  A total of about 2,000 costumes were sewn.  The head paid special attention to the general surroundings.  The show uses only gilded elements, crystal chandeliers, candles, <span>Bohemian glass.</span> </p><p>  120 artists and 300 animals take part in the performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="royal circus gii eradze yaroslavl" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35765/1298914.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Touring tour </h2><p>  The Royal Circus by Gia Eradze lit its lights in different cities of Russia.  Yaroslavl saw the performance at the end of October 2015.  Tickets at the box office cost from 500 to 2000 rubles.  There was a real full house in the hall.  The children clapped their hands happily, while the adults enthusiastically looked at the artists showing their numbers. </p><p>  Many people ask: ‚ÄúWhat animals are participating in the Royal Circus program of Gia Eradze?‚Äù  Yaroslavl was visited by tigers, lions, antelopes, kangaroos, zebras, porcupines, horses, llamas, yaks, lemurs and various species of birds.  Viewers have not seen such an abundance of animals in one program.  The tour lasted about a week, everyone could visit the show. </p><p>  "Royal Circus" Gia Eradze - a new generation show.  The head moved away from the usual numbers and images, making the performance truly theatrical.  In the program you will not see the entertainer who announces the artists.  The viewer is given the opportunity to look at the arena without being distracted by extraneous actions, sometimes thinking up the meaning of the planned numbers himself. </p>
