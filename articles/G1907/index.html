  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is the quadriceps femoris muscle and what are its functions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The front surface of the thigh and some part of its lateral surface is occupied by the quadriceps muscle, the heads of which begin separately.  And in the knee they are combined in a tendon, attached to the tuberosity, located on the <span>tibia,</span> and covering the patella. </p><p>  The quadriceps femoris is a combination of four heads, and the longest of them is the rectus, which fully occupies the anterior femoral surface.  It begins in the supraclavicular groove, heading down from its anterior lower axis, passing into a narrow tendon, which is part of the common tendon. </p><p>  The wide medial muscle is located in the lower half of the thigh and occupies its front medial surface.  It originates from the rough line, and from its medial lip passes down, transforming into a wide tendon, partially intertwined with the rectus muscle and attached to the edge of the patella, forming its supporting ligament. </p><p>  Another head occupies the anterior lateral surface and is called the <span>broad lateral muscle of the thigh.</span>  It is slightly covered by the rectus muscle and the muscle that strains the wide fascia.  It starts from the broad line of the thigh, in the area where the <span>greater trochanter, the</span> intertrochanteric line and the lateral lip are located.  From top to bottom, it passes into the wide tendon, which is part of the common tendon, and takes part in the formation of the supporting lateral ligament of the patella. </p><p>  The fourth head is the broad intermediate muscle, which is located between the medial and lateral muscles.  It is located under the rectus femoris muscle and is the weakest of the heads.  Originating in the anterior plane of the <span>femur, the</span> intermediate muscle from half the length passes into the wide tendon, which, in turn, is attached to the tendon of the rectus muscle and passes into the common tendon. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The quadriceps muscle, like the triceps muscle of the thigh, solves the main problem, which is to extend the legs in the knee, and the rectus also helps to bend the hip.  It is very strong and large, as it helps the knee joint to support body weight.  The quadriceps muscle of the thigh performs two functions: it is dynamic, which consists in straightening the maple during movement, and static, which prevents bending of the knees when standing in place. </p><p>  All muscles require a certain load.  In order for the quadriceps muscle of the thigh to successfully fulfill its basic functions, it must be constantly maintained in good shape.  For this, exercises such as classic <span>squats, squats</span> with a dumbbell or barbell, leg presses, lunges with dumbbells are good. </p><p>  Bruising of this muscle can occur with a front or side impact.  It is accompanied by pain and swelling, the range of motion in the knee and <span>hip joint</span> decreases.  The severity of these symptoms depends on the strength of the impact.  A little later, a bruise or hematoma may appear, eventually increasing in size and going down.  There are times when she goes to the shin or foot.  The diagnosis of quadriceps bruise is made by the doctor, since other possible injuries must be ruled out.  To check for a fracture, an X-ray is taken, and the size of the hematoma and muscle defect are measured using ultrasound. </p><p>  In some cases, muscle complications such as subfascial <span>hypertension syndrome,</span> that is, impingement and <span>ossifying myositis,</span> characterized by deposition of calcium salts, can occur.  After bruising, the quadriceps femoris muscle is treated with painkillers, its strength, as well as the mobility of the knee joint, are preserved, myositis is prevented with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. </p>
