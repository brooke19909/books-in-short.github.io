No wonder Robert Rozhdestvensky dedicated his lines to him. </p><p>  The locality got its name from the name of the village of Peremilovo.  It was here that from 11/27/1941 to 12/05/1941 bloody battles took place.  In memory of the heroism of those who defended the homeland, a memorial was erected at a height. </p><h2>  Location Peremilovskoy heights </h2>

    <p>  The modern village of Peremilovo is part of the city of Yakhroma.  The height is located one and a half kilometers from the eastern part of the city of Dmitrov, which is the regional center.  The Moscow-Volga canal flows here. </p><p>  Peremilovskaya height in the east stretches along the canal for 2 kilometers.  It rises above him for more than 50 meters, as if hanging over a bridge connecting both parts of Yakhroma.  Due to the rugged landscape, it seems that the height is not one.  Therefore, you can often hear another name for this area, namely Peremilovskie heights. </p><p>  On the west bank, the height is represented as a gentle rise.  Opponents who tried to take the height on such a long climb were visible and vulnerable. </p><h2>  The role of height in World War II </h2>

This is the most important water, energy and transport artery for the capital.  There were road and rail lines. </p><p>  The Germans themselves hoped to flood Moscow with the help of a canal, so they did not bomb it from the sky.  Although the water artery was a significant obstacle for them when approaching the capital. </p><p>  Peremilovskaya height allowed observing the canal, as well as automobile and railway tracks.  The most important defense center, the city of Yakhroma, was also under control from above.  In the village, the evacuation of people and enterprises began by November 1941, when it became clear that the German troops were inexorably approaching the canal.  At the time of the start of the fighting, only the military remained in the nearest settlements for the most part. </p><h2>  Fighting for height </h2><p>  The fighting began on 11/28/1941, when at 7 in the morning the opponents attacked the territory with the forces of tanks and infantry.  Soviet troops did not have anti-tank weapons, even <span>hand grenades,</span> so the enemy soon took Yakhroma.  The Germans immediately rushed to the village where Peremilovskaya height was located. </p><p>  A bridge passed through the canal, on which the Germans landed.  They managed to remove the sentries guarding the way across the river.  This allowed <span>German tanks to</span> force the waterway and gain a foothold on the east coast.  The village of Peremilovo was taken, and the persecution of a retreating group of Soviet troops began. </p><p>  Fighters under the command of Lieutenant Lermontov became on the enemy‚Äôs path.  At their disposal were only two guns against 14 tanks.  Armored train No. 73, standing at the Dmitrov station, also set about repelling the enemy.  Captain Malyshev commanded them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In order to throw the Germans behind the canal, as Stalin demanded, the 1st shock army was involved.  It was created from the reserve of the local population, which was called up in a hurry in November 1941.  It was commanded by the commander of the First Shock <span>Army, Lieutenant General</span> V.I. Kuznetsov. </p><p>  At the disposal of the commander were: </p><ul><li>  rifle brigade scattered 10 kilometers along the front; </li><li>  construction battalion; </li><li>  Katyusha division with a single ammunition; </li><li>  armored train number 73. </li></ul><p>  With these forces, the lieutenant general decided to attack the enemy.  11.28.1941 at 14 o'clock a counterattack with the rifle brigade began, which ended unsuccessfully. </p><p>  The counterattack was repeated on November 29, 1941 at 6 a.m.  Rifle brigades managed to quietly get close to the enemy and break into the village of Peremilovo.  German troops were forced to retreat.  Thus, Peremilovskaya height (Dmitrov) helped to delay the enemy, and a lightning strike on the capital was disrupted. </p><p>  So that the German troops could not repeat the attack, it was decided to blow up the bridge.  The task was completed at the cost of the life of 12 out of 13 sappers who died during the execution of the order.  In early December, the Germans tried to pass tanks through a frozen channel, but the cars fell through the ice. </p><p>  The Germans still managed to break through the defense, but a few days after that the <span>battle for Moscow began.</span>  By December 8, Yakhroma was liberated from the German invaders, and two days later - the whole Dmitrovsky district.  This victory was a turning point in the war.  A victorious counterattack began near Moscow under the command of the generals Rokossovsky and Lelyushenko. </p><h2>  Memorial Creation </h2>

    <p>  The memorial ‚ÄúPeremilovskaya Vysota‚Äù was created for the 25th anniversary of the battle for the capital.  It was opened on December 6, 1966.  Many people took part in its creation: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 426px; height: 145px;"><caption>  The creators of the memorial "Peremilovskaya height" </caption><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="155"><p>  Sculptors </p></td><td valign="top" width="119"><p>  Architects </p></td><td valign="top" width="142"><p>  Engineers </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="155"><p>  Postol A. </p><p>  Glebov V. </p><p>  Lyubimov N. </p><p>  Fedorov V. </p></td><td valign="top" width="119"><p>  Krivushchenko Yu. </p><p>  Kaminsky A. </p><p>  Stepanov I. </p></td><td valign="top" width="142"><p>  Hadzhibaranov S. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The monument was created from fragments in different parts of the USSR.  So, the figure of the warrior was cast in Leningrad, granite for the bas-relief was brought from the Ukrainian SSR, the bas-relief was made in Mytishchi.  Mounted everything in place.  One of the most difficult tasks was to deliver a bronze figure to a height.  Moreover, doubts arose whether the figure would tip over after installation from a strong wind.  But <span>aerodynamic tests</span> refuted these fears. </p><p>  Driving along the canal named after Moscow, it is impossible not to pay attention to the so-called Peremilovsky heights.  In Yakhroma, for the first time, Soviet troops managed to stop the attack on Moscow and turn it into a successful counterattack. </p><h2>  Monument Description </h2><p>  The monument has a height of 28 meters, of which 15 meters is a granite pedestal, and 13 - a figure of a soldier cast in bronze.  The figure is a warrior who rushed to the attack and holds a machine gun in his raised hand. </p><p>  The monument is visible from two opposite sides of the canal.  Rising to it, you can see a beautiful view of Yakhroma and its surroundings. </p>

    <p>  The famous words of Robert Rozhdestvensky are carved on a granite pedestal, which he wrote at the request of local residents: </p><p>  <em>Remember!</em>  <em>From this threshold</em> </p><p>  <em>In an avalanche of smoke, blood and adversity,</em> </p><p>  <em>Here on the forty-first road</em> </p><p>  <em>In the victorious forty-fifth year.</em> </p><h2>  The current status of Dmitrov </h2><p>  According to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation D. Medvedev, in 2008 the city of Dmitrov was awarded the title <span>City of Military Glory.</span>  The courage and valor of the defenders of the city made Peremilovsky heights famous.  The story of mass heroism is immortalized in the monument. </p>
