Let's consider how to choose an engine for a quadrocopter, what characteristics to pay attention to, which types of batteries for drones are encountered and how to install them. </p><h2>  Varieties of drones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.popsci.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Characteristics of motors for copters" class="if uuid-3116134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116134.jpg"></div><p>  The concept of ‚Äúdrones‚Äù is quite extensive.  This term means not only quadrocopters, but also some models of airplanes and helicopters for radio control.  This concept can also be replaced by the word "multicopter" which includes all devices equipped with at least three screws. </p><p>  Types of drones: </p><ul><li>  Tricopter  These are flying structures, where on a moving platform there are three supporting propellers.  You can rotate the drone by changing the angle of the platform.  This option is quite difficult for beginners to manage, but is quick and maneuverable. </li></ul><ul><li>  Quadrocopters.  The most common type of drones, which consists of 4 engines and the same number of propellers.  They are easy to operate and can lift different loads if equipped with a mounted attachment.  This is the best option for beginners.  But in order to get an aircraft with good characteristics, it is important to pay how much the quadrocopter costs.  Prices range from 2 to 70 thousand rubles.  depending on the engines, build quality, and the availability of additional features. </li></ul><ul><li>  Hexacopters.  The design contains 6 motors and 6 propellers.  This is the best option for photo and video shooting, as the design remains stable in the air even in windy weather.  In addition, this type is equipped with increased carrying capacity. </li></ul><ul><li>  Oktokopter.  This type, equipped with 8 screws at once, is quite rare.  The option relates more to professional models.  The design is distinguished by reliability, the ability to lift large loads and can work regardless of weather conditions. </li></ul><h2>  Features of engines for quadrocopters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hobbyking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadropet engines selection features" class="if uuid-3116138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116138.jpg"></div><p>  Motors for drones, depending on size, can consume significant currents.  But at the same time, the weight of the battery should be as small as possible.  Therefore, one of the main requirements for the battery is a high current efficiency.  But not everything depends on this element.  It is important to choose the right motor, on which it depends on how high, accurately and how long the drone will fly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cheap collector motors are equipped with drones, costing up to $ 150.  They have little reliability, but can be replaced if desired.  UAVs with such an engine do not develop high speed, moreover, with their help it is impossible to lift additional load.  Among the advantages of cheap quadrocopter models, one can note a wide variety of models on the market, as well as an ideal choice for beginners.  The aircraft is quite easy to fly. </p><h2>  Characteristics of motors for copters </h2><div class="photo" data-original="alselectro.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much is a quadrocopter?" class="if uuid-3116141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116141.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing an engine for a quadrocopter, you should pay attention to its characteristics.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  power consumption (W) - the higher its indicator, the more often it will be necessary to charge the battery, which means the drone will not fly for a long time; </li><li>  weight - usually, the greater the weight of the motor, the higher its power, but here you need to take into account the mass of the drone itself, since it must be able to lift a certain weight; </li><li>  Efficiency - a concept that depends on many components (battery, propeller, controller and wires), for brushless motors, the energy efficiency indicator should be 90%, for collector type motors - 70%; </li><li>  heating temperature in working condition - directly depends on the previous indicator, the more it heats up, the more energy is wasted; </li><li>  balancing and vibration - cheap models equipped with the least powerful motor are subject to increased vibration, which can affect the operation of the drone (in this case, it wears out faster); </li><li>  lift is the weight that the engine can lift. </li></ul><h2>  Collector engines for drones: features </h2><p>  Collector motors are mainly used for cheap drone models that are designed for beginners.  Designs with such an engine cannot develop large revolutions and have high power, which means they have a small payload.  At the same time, they are bulky, often fail, because the parts inside the motor wear out in a short time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The quadcopter collector motor consists of a fixed housing, inside which magnets (plus and minus) are contained.  The motor is driven by a rotor with a winding using brushes that supply electricity.  It is the presence of brushes that reduces the life of the motor, since they create friction and wear out over time. </p><p>  Advantages of the collector motor: </p><ul><li>  small size and weight; </li><li>  low price; </li><li>  easy to repair or replace. </li></ul><p>  But in this type of motors for copters there are also disadvantages.  The engine has a low efficiency, often overheats and wears out quickly. </p><h2>  Brushless quadcopter </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.photopoint.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation and replacement of motors for copters" class="if uuid-3116136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116136.jpg"></div><p>  Brushless motor equipped with more expensive models of drones.  Most often installed on professional or racing quadrocopters.  They are distinguished by high traction, speed and power.  At the same time, they are quite compact and durable. </p><p>  The brushless motor is divided into two parts - the bell (the upper moving part, firmly fixed to the rotor) and the base.  Neodymium magnets are placed inside the bell. </p><p>  The brushless motor for the copter has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  acceleration and deceleration of the quadrocopter occurs quickly (all this is due to the presence of high revs of the quadrocopter engine); </li><li>  long service life; </li><li>  protection against environmental factors. </li></ul><p>  But there are also disadvantages to this type of engine.  They are expensive, and repairs are difficult to carry out. </p><h2>  What motor is needed for racing and shooting drone? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="oscarliang.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quadcopter Motors" class="if uuid-3116126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116126.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing a racing quadrocopter engine?  Pay attention to brushless motors.  Such a drone is important speed, high traction, to instantly gain momentum and accelerate.  For example, an engine marked KV 2300-2600 (revolutions per minute per volt) will accelerate the copter to 100 km / h. </p><p>  For a shooting quadrocopter, which needs less speed, brushless motors are also suitable, but the KV indicator can be 930‚Äì1000.  Due to the low speed, the engines are economical, in addition, large propellers are placed on such copters.  You can also choose drones with collector motors for shooting, which will cost significantly lower in cost. </p><p>  How much is a quadrocopter with a brushless and collector motor?  The first option with a more reliable brushless motor will cost from 10 thousand rubles, with a collector motor - from 2 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.banggood.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varieties of engines for copters" class="if uuid-3116131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75749/3116131.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing an engine for a quadrocopter, you should be guided primarily by its purpose.  It is necessary to determine why it is acquired, that is, for what purpose.  It is also important to pay attention to such factors: </p><ol><li>  Total weight and traction.  To achieve good performance, the engine must lift twice as much weight as itself. </li><li>  The size of the frame and propeller.  From these indicators depends on how many motors you need to put in the design. </li><li>  Marking.  V indicates high build accuracy (racing quadrocopters usually come with such an indicator), X is a good copter quality, suitable for the middle class, A is a budget option that can also work well. </li></ol><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  When installing motors on a quadrocopter, it is important that they rotate in different directions.  For example, two motors - clockwise, and two - against.  At the same time, they are located opposite each other.  If all the screws rotate in one direction, the copter will simply spin and will not be able to fly. </p><p>  How a drone will behave in the air depends on the different engine speeds.  In order for the drone to have a correct and balanced movement, the rotation of the screws should be directed along the hull.  The air flow from below will create a difference between atmospheric pressure and its reading under the wing. </p><p>  If the propellers rotate, but the drone does not take off, it is worth checking the marking on the beams and screws.  They must match.  When buying a motor, an instruction is attached to it with a detailed description of how to install a particular type of engine on certain quadrocopter models. </p>
