  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a sword from Minecraft from paper: a detailed instruction with templates</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to modern psychologists, the human mind is at the tip of his finger.  Therefore, it is useful to do different crafts for both children and adults.  It develops fine motor skills, imagination and is just very interesting and exciting.  But recently, an increasing number of people are interested in computer games, including Minecraft.  Combine business with pleasure and see how to make a Minecraft sword out of paper.  We will get a very original three-dimensional craft that can be used as an accessory to a fancy dress or just as a souvenir. </p><h2>  What is Minecraft </h2><p>  Before you figure out how easy it is to make a sword from Minecraft out of paper, you need to clarify what this computer game is all about.  Minecraft translates as "mining craft."  This is an open-world first-person game with somewhat strange simplified graphics that vaguely remind us of Lego constructors.  Even the goal of the game is similar, and is to create a variety of things out of cubes.  If you are completely unfamiliar with the game, you can register on the site and try yourself in the simplest version, where you are offered an unlimited number of blocks for construction, and you cannot die.  But do not get too carried away with computer games, because real life is much more interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kerryannmorgan.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://kerryannmorgan.com/2013/10/how-to-make-minecraft-diamond-sword-and-diamond-pickaxe.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Minecraft paper sword" class="if uuid-2235995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235995.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a Minecraft sword out of paper </h2><p>  Making paper crafts in the style of the Minecraft game is a very exciting activity that will help to spend a pleasant evening with the children.  The peculiarity of such crafts is that they look three-dimensional, voluminous.  Such toys contribute to the development of logic and spatial thinking, help to show creative abilities in a child and distract from a real computer game.  Thanks to such activities, children become more attentive, assiduous and accurate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alexandramartazan.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make paper from minecraft sword" class="if uuid-2235963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235963.jpg"></div><p>  Note that in the game the main character is always building, mining, defending his creations.  Therefore, the pickaxe and the sword became the most necessary tools.  Of course, now in the store you can find many plastic toys in the style of this game, but we will learn how to make a sword from Minecraft out of paper quickly and without much cost.  And, as a rule, children don‚Äôt appreciate the purchased toys and quickly break them or put them away, but a sword made with their own hands can become your favorite toy, and it is completely safe. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  To make a sword, we need: </p><ol><li>  Corrugated cardboard or old box. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Pencils or color printer. </li><li>  Plain cardboard or paper. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li></ol><p>  The main highlight of crafts in the style of "Minecraft" - "square".  Cut several 5x5 cm squares from thick cardboard and, using them as a pattern, draw a sword on corrugated cardboard.  Make another similar detail, cut and glue together with glue to make it stronger.  Two more details need to be cut out of white paper or cardboard.  Glue them on top and bottom of the sword.  Now it remains to give the child colored pencils and let him personally decorate his sword.  Similarly, you can make a pick and other tools.  Here's how to make a Minecraft sword out of paper. </p><p>  A sword can be made of wood if the head of your family knows how to carve various shapes from particleboard.  Simply transfer the blank of the sword with a pencil to a sheet of chipboard, cut it out and decorate it with acrylic paints.  The top of the sword must be varnished. </p><p>  Another option is to print the presented templates on the printer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kerryannmorgan.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://kerryannmorgan.com/2013/10/how-to-make-minecraft-diamond-sword-and-diamond-pickaxe.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="how easy it is to make a sword out of paper" class="if uuid-2235988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235988.jpg"></div><p>  We cut out the patterns, glue them on cardboard and glue the parts together.  This option is much simpler and faster, but almost devoid of a creative component. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kerryannmorgan.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://kerryannmorgan.com/2013/10/how-to-make-minecraft-diamond-sword-and-diamond-pickaxe.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper sword patterns" class="if uuid-2235991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32890/2235991.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know two ways <span>to make a Minecraft sword</span> out <span>of paper</span> .
