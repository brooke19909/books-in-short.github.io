    <h2>  Cost of living: budget category of rooms </h2><p>  Pullman Pattaya G Hotel is a 5 star hotel, so there are no cheap rooms.  However, there are more expensive and budget options.  It‚Äôs worth starting with cheaper rooms.  So, the double ‚Äúlanai‚Äù - 42 square meters, air conditioning, bathroom, private toilet and free Wi-Fi.  Booking such an apartment will cost approximately 100,000 rubles for two (15 days and 14 nights).  If you are lucky enough to get during discounts or special offers, you can reserve a room for less than 90 thousand.  The same room, but with breakfast included in the price, will cost much more - about 150-170 thousand rubles.  But the conditions in the apartments are excellent.  Modern comfortable furniture, a TV, a balcony with a picturesque view of the sea, a toilet, a shower, a minibar, plus what was listed above. </p><p>  Double room ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù is also a good option.  The cost is the same, the conditions are slightly different.  Firstly, a different design of the apartments, and secondly, a smaller area (not 42, but 38 sq. M, but the difference is small).  The room has, in addition to two large beds, its own seating area, satellite and cable channels, a flat-screen plasma TV, a safe, air conditioning, a work area, as well as such pleasant things as bathrobes, a coffee maker with a kettle, slippers and toiletries.

    <h2>  What you need to know about booking </h2><p>  Finally, a few words about how to reserve a number.  Naturally, this must be done in advance.  The hotel is popular, so at least the booking process should be puzzled about two months before the trip.  Fortunately there is a function of "payment on the spot" and "cancellation."  So, check-in is done after two in the afternoon until midnight, and check-out is from nine in the morning and, accordingly, until 14:00. </p><p>  It happens that guests come with children - then special conditions apply.  If the child is under 12 years old, he will be placed on the existing bed in the apartment for free.  If the baby is not even two years old, then a crib will be put in the room.  Accommodation will also be free.  But if the teenager is over 12 years old, then you will have to pay about 4,800 rubles (in Thai currency this is 2236 THB). </p><p>  All in all, this is a great place to spend a truly luxurious vacation.  Positive impressions guaranteed. </p>
