    <h2>  Who are insurers? </h2><p>  An insurer acts as an insurer <span>,</span> which has the right to do so, since it has received an appropriate license to conduct this activity. </p><p>  The activities of the insurer are based on the conclusion of insurance contracts with citizens or legal entities who are trying to protect their property, life, health or other values. </p><p>  Insurers can join in groups if several large companies take major risks at the same time. </p><p>  There are times when insurance contracts require reinsurance.  In these cases, the insurer is replaced by the reinsurer. </p><p>  For companies operating abroad, the inclusion of so-called intermediaries in the contracts of interested parties is typical. </p><h2>  <span>Who are policyholders</span> in insurance? </h2><p>  These are citizens or business entities that enter into relationships with insurers and pay insurance premiums. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Between the subjects of insurance contracts are governed by <span>federal laws.</span> </p><p>  When paying insurance premiums, a citizen or an economic organization has the right to receive money from the insurer in the event of an accident resulting in the loss of property or other human values.  If it is liability insurance or personal insurance, then the compensation is transferred to another person specified in the contract. </p><p>  The insurers in this process insure their interests or those of the other party, that is, they can conclude insurance contracts for their property or other values, as well as register third parties in the document. </p>

    <h2>  What types of insurance can be divided? </h2><p>  Allocate insurance compulsory and on a voluntary basis. </p><p>  In the mandatory rights and obligations of insurance entities are regulated by legislative acts. </p><p>  In voluntary insurance, a contract is concluded between the participants in the process, by which the rules are established.  At the same time, other parties may also take part in personal insurance, in whose favor they have concluded an agreement. </p><h2>  Features of voluntary insurance </h2><p>  In most cases, contracts between insurance entities are concluded on a voluntary basis in the event that an unforeseen situation arises in the life of the policyholder that would deprive him of certain values.  Therefore, it is generally accepted that here the concepts of "policyholder" and "insured" coincide. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, there are cases when these subjects do not match.  For example, if an organization insures its subordinates against an industrial accident.  At this point, the company acts as the insured, and employees as insured. </p><p>  It is common among people to insure the life of children or to the procedure for the birth of a new family (for marriage).  In this process, parents act as insurers, and children as insured. </p><p>  We can say that the insured person is a citizen whose life, health, property or pension is insured by the relevant organization.  At the same time, he either voluntarily agreed to this, or it was his duty in accordance with special federal law. </p>

    <h2>  What is compulsory insurance? </h2><p>  This is the form in which compulsory insurance entities build their relations at the law level. </p><p>  The difference from voluntary is that the policyholder is obliged to insure the property or life of other people.  And also his responsibility to them. </p><p>  The insurers are the ministries and federal executive bodies, which are allocated funds for this from the budget at a certain level. </p><p>  The law provided for a state insurance procedure in order to ensure not only the social interests of citizens, but also the interests of the state itself. </p><h2>  What is property insurance? </h2><p>  The subjects of insurance in this case are both individuals and <span>organizations, enterprises,</span> institutions and even tenants who take property for storage. </p><p>  In the property insurance contract, the second owner may be indicated, which becomes the main insurer in the event of the death of the first. </p>
