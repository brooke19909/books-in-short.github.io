He always strives for something new.  In every generation, such restless people are born who try to open the veil of secrecy over inexplicable phenomena, go on a journey to uncharted places or after a dream.  How many of them in childhood dream of visiting distant planets, meeting a friendly alien mind?  Getting closer to heavenly wonders can help a planetarium. </p><h2>  What is a planetarium? </h2><p>  The first device capable of demonstrating stellar grandeur was presented to the public in 1923.  A long 11 years passed from the idea to its implementation, of which the whole five-year period was swallowed up by the First World War.  Maximilian Wolf threw the idea, and a viable option was the product of the mind and hands of Walter Bowersfeld.  The first was the great German astronomer, and the second was the same engineer. </p><p>  The device was created at the Zeiss factory.  It was designed for the simultaneous display of only 4.9 thousand celestial bodies.  Only two years later, this venture grew into something more - a whole domed building, called a planetarium. </p>

    <p>  Over time, the technique for displaying the sky was improved more and more, and the buildings expanded in area.  The possibilities of the demonstration also grew.  It began not only to cover much larger areas, but also became voluminous.  Allowed to display not only stars and planets, but also astronomical events. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The history of the Novokuznetsk planetarium in Novokuznetsk, Kemerovo region </h2><p>  The oldest planetarium in Russia is Moscow.  The planetarium in Novokuznetsk appeared later a little more than two decades.  Despite this, he holds the palm as the first such institution, opened beyond the Urals. </p><p>  It was originally a mobile planetarium.  It existed from about the 51st to the 59th year of the twentieth century, based in Kemerovo, traveling around the region.  A very small part of the sky was shown, and the clarity of the demonstration was limited by the capabilities of the equipment.  After all, it was made in a makeshift way from cardboard. </p><p>  Since 1959, the planetarium in Novokuznetsk finally found its permanent shelter, and in 1966 a decision was made to erect a capital stationary facility.  The construction of the building took almost 4 years.  The opening and first demonstration took place in early May 1970.  Over the following years, only equipment was improved.  Until 2013, the building was not even repaired.  Therefore, four years ago I had to make a fairly large reconstruction.  So far, she was the last. </p>

    <p>  The planetarium bears the name of A. A. Fedorov, who made a considerable contribution to its formation.  The name of this person - a veteran of the Second World War and an honorary citizen of the city was assigned to the institution in 2010. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Planetarium equipment </h2><p>  Initially, the main equipment of the planetarium in Novokuznetsk was a <span>projection apparatus of</span> the same German Zeiss plant.  It was the Zeiss Small Planetarium - a modest-sized projector (the Zeiss Big Planetarium had more opportunities, according to the name), but the most modern at that time.  He could demonstrate up to 6 thousand celestial bodies, reproduce sunrises and sunsets, auroras, flights of artificial satellites and rockets. </p><p>  The planetarium in Novokuznetsk celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the first man‚Äôs flight into space with the unveiling of a monument to this very first astronaut - Yu. A. Gagarin.  It stands to this day. </p>

    <p>  In 1972, a real observatory was erected on the planetarium.  It is low, only about ten meters, but equipped with a Zeiss telescope, which allows you to bring objects almost 400 times closer.  It functions today. </p><p>  From 1980 to 2000 on the planetarium in Novokuznetsk there was an IL-18 aircraft in good working condition.  On its basis, pilots were trained without the possibility of take-off.  Guided tours were held for children, and educational and entertaining thematic films were shown.  The plane was later dismantled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 2009, the regional administration supported financially the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãupdating equipment.  The Skymaster ZKP4 projector was purchased from the same German factory.  This is the most advanced equipment even today, providing a realistic display of stellar bodies and phenomena.  With its compact size, it is capable of showing 7 thousand stars at a time.  This is not only the optimal brightness, but also the perfect color rendering of celestial objects.  Few visitors make photos at the Novokuznetsk planetarium.  From such wonderful shots the soul freezes and admiration comes. </p><p>  The new projector provides a display of the movement of the heavenly vault, is able to highlight its individual sections, and can demonstrate astronomical and natural phenomena. </p><p>  In 2014, the planetarium was enriched with another exhibit - a sculptural model of a sundial.  They are created by the equatorial type and are able to show the actual time.  But it should be remembered that it differs from the physical time in the region. </p>

    <p>  The showroom can accommodate up to 70 people at a time.  Demonstration of celestial miracles is carried out not only using projectors.  There are planetary globes and maps of the starry sky, many interactive exhibits. </p><h2>  Planetarium Events </h2><p>  The planetarium is interesting for both adults and children.  Therefore, many events have been developed that are selected not only by topic, but also by the age of visitors.  All relevant information on the programs is available on the official website of the institution.  It is accompanied by recommendations on the age threshold of participants. </p>

    <p>  Often, a planetarium becomes a venue for astronomical and physical competitions for students.  Such events are usually dedicated to significant dates and special events.  Registration for participation is carried out in advance.  Traditionally, only the annual February Olympics are held. </p><p>  The planetarium building can also become a conference center.  The annual gathering is held in March, in honor of World Earth Day, and in April, to Cosmonautics Day.  Applications are also submitted in advance. </p><p>  Competitions and quizzes are often held in the planetarium building and on its territory.  Especially wonderful are children's events at the New Year holidays.  After all, science can become fabulous if it is told by Santa Claus and his granddaughter - Snegurochka. </p><h2>  How to get to the planetarium? </h2><p>  The institution is located on 16a Metallurgov Avenue, in the territory of Gagarin PKiO.  It is practically the center of the city, so there can be no problems with public transport. </p>

    <p>  The closest stop is the "Cinema Kommunar".  About two dozen buses and trolleybuses from different parts of the city come to it.  In addition, there are tram routes - five, sixth and eight. </p><p>  You can also arrive at PKiO from Bardin Avenue.  There is a stop of the same name with the park, which again takes about 20 buses and trolleybuses of different routes. </p><h2>  Opening hours and cost </h2><p>  Demonstration is carried out exclusively in strictly established sessions.  From Tuesday to Friday it is 10:00, 11:30, 13:00, 14:30, 16:00.  The first two sessions are absent on Saturdays and are not available on Sunday and Monday.

Today, children and adults can visit the star room by paying 150 and 200 rubles, respectively.  Children are considered to be people under 16 years old inclusive.  Group visits are made upon prior request and only on weekdays. </p><p>  The time of specific events must be found on the official planetarium resource.  Information is regularly updated.  Additionally, everything can be clarified by contact phone. </p>
