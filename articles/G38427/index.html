  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The microphone does not work on the phone: reasons and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very often, owners of smartphones encounter a problem when the microphone does not work on the phone or works very poorly.  There are actually several reasons why this happens, from a banal software failure to a hardware failure.  Actually, this will be discussed in our article.  Also, the question of why the microphone does not work on the headphones, which is also a fairly common problem, will be further discussed.  In general, it will be interesting! </p><h2>  Software crash </h2><p>  The first reason the microphone on the phone does not work is because the operating system is malfunctioning.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what OS is installed on the device - Android, iOS, Windows or any other, failures happen everywhere and they happen spontaneously. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="software crash on the phone" class="if uuid-2526458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526458.jpg"></div><p>  How can I deal with a malfunction?  There are several options, and the simplest is to reboot the device.  As a rule, in most cases, this completely eliminates the malfunction, and the microphone starts functioning again.  The second option is more radical - resetting to factory settings.  Sometimes a software failure can be much more serious than it might seem at first glance, and a simple reboot will not fix it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dust and dirt </h2><p>  The next reason the microphone on your phone may not work well is dust and dirt.  The microphone holes on the casing of your device are quite small and often clogged with small specks of dust and particles of dirt.  As a result of this, the microphone sensitivity is significantly reduced, and with very strong pollution it almost disappears. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chargingport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the microphone does not work due to dirt and dust" class="if uuid-2526459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526459.jpg"></div><p>  This problem is fixed quite easily: </p><ul><li>  First you need to try blowing the microphone with air.  You can try to blow yourself or take on a can of compressed air. </li><li>  This may not always work, since dust with particles of dirt can accumulate quite strongly.  In this case, you have to use a thin needle (or any other thin object).  It should easily penetrate the microphone hole, and with it you can remove all the dirt collected there.  You just need to act as carefully and carefully as possible, without pushing the needle too deep, otherwise there is a risk of damaging the microphone itself. </li></ul><h2>  Bad contact </h2><p>  Oddly enough, smartphone crashes also often become the reason why the microphone on the phone does not work.  This is especially true for budget devices from little-known manufacturers, since the build quality of them is very lame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Actually, what is the danger of a device dropping for a microphone?  Everything is simple.  In the event of a fall, there is a risk that the loop of the microphone that is connected to the main board may break the contact or it will completely disconnect from its connector.  As a result, the microphone will work either with serious interference, or it will completely stop. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone does not work due to poor contact" class="if uuid-2526462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526462.jpg"></div><p>  There is only one way to fix this problem.  You need to disassemble the device and connect the cable to its place.  You can do this yourself or take the device for repair. </p><h2>  Moisture </h2><p>  Moisture is also becoming a common reason why the microphone does not work on the phone.  It‚Äôs not even worth particularly explaining how moisture gets inside: wet hands, using the device in the rain, in a shower, bath, sauna, etc. If it gets inside, moisture can not only disrupt the microphone, but completely damage it .  The only way to fix this problem is to replace the microphone with a new one. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tigermobiles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the microphone does not work due to moisture" class="if uuid-2526460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526460.jpg"></div><h2>  Microphone malfunction </h2><p>  And finally, the last reason why the microphone does not work on the phone is the malfunction of the micro itself.  It often happens that without any apparent reason, the microphone simply breaks.  Of course, sometimes a breakdown during production can become a factor for breakdown, but, as practice shows, even the correctly assembled microphones also break. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone is replaced with a new" class="if uuid-2526461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526461.jpg"></div><p>  The way to fix the problem here is exactly the same as above - the complete replacement of the faulty part with a new one. </p><h2>  Headphone microphone </h2><p>  Well, as a bonus, it‚Äôs worth saying a few words about why the headphone microphone on the phone does not work.  This is a fairly common problem, which, in turn, is divided into two: </p><ul><li>  The first reason why the microphone on the headset does not work is a commonplace malfunction of the microphone itself or the 3.5 mm input on the phone.  The easiest way to check whether this is so is on another device. </li><li>  The second reason is that the microphone sensitivity through the headset is set to almost 0. Such a malfunction is very rare and can be corrected through the engineering menu. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="updato.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the microphone does not work on the headphones on the phone" class="if uuid-2526463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2526463.jpg"></div><p>  Access codes for the latter need to be searched for for a specific model, since they are all different.  Once in the engineering menu, go to the Hardware tab and select Earphones and Mic (the name may vary). </p><p>  For adjusting the sensitivity, the Speech Enhancement item is responsible.  It is necessary to experiment with the parameters and select the necessary values ‚Äã‚Äãat which the microphone on the headphones will begin to function.  It is also recommended to write the initial values ‚Äã‚Äãof the parameters in the menu in case something goes wrong. </p>
