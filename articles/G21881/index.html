  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Subject of economics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The subject of the world economy, acting as a methodological basis in a complex set of industries, has a significant impact on the development of <span>social sciences.</span>  The theory of economic activity, for example, according to Keynes, is not a set of ready-made recommendations that are applicable exclusively in economic policy.  Economic doctrine is considered to a greater extent as a technique of thinking, an instrument.  Science helps to make the right conclusions. </p><p>  The subject of studying economics is what <span>this science</span> explores <span>.</span>  The name of the discipline comes from a combination of two Greek words.  Literally, the term "economy" means "the art of household management."  This science studies economic patterns and problems. </p><p>  At the same time, many experts say that in the study of this discipline, <span>economic problems</span> do not come to the forefront most often <span>.</span>  They exist and are solved within the framework of society, within the framework of the economic system formed in it.  The system itself is only a part, an element of social structure.  The society is a fairly complex structure.  It contains politics, and family, and ideology, and national relations, and religion, and so on.  The most important place in the social structure is occupied by the economic system. </p><p>  Inside the structure of management is the exchange, production, consumption, distribution of products, factors of production, services.  All these activities at a certain stage have their own significance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The subject of economics is studying part of the social structure - the system of economic activity.  This definition, however, according to some authors, is considered too general.  <span>The economic system</span> is studied by various economic scientific disciplines.  In particular, they include accounting, finance and credit, statistics, economic international relations and others.  However, all these sciences are special specific disciplines.  This distinguishes the subject of the economy from them, since it covers all sectors as a whole.  This is a general theoretical discipline.  The subject of economics is the basis for the development and study of other economic sciences. </p><p>  This discipline studies activities that are associated with money transactions and exchanges between people.  The subject of economics is the daily business life of people, methods of extracting livelihoods, as well as methods of their application. </p><p>  Economic doctrine is a social science.  It examines the behavior of a person and groups of people in the distribution, production, consumption and exchange of material <span>goods.</span>  <span>Economic</span> theory studies the ways in which humanity solves problems in the consumer and production fields.  According to the formulation of Engels, this science explores the laws by which it becomes possible to control the exchange and <span>production of material</span> values ‚Äã‚Äãat different stages of development of society.  Marshall reduced the <span>subject of science</span> to the study of wealth, motivations to counteract and the incentives of human action. </p><p>  Economic theory studies the social relations of people within production.  Science also explores the manufacturing system.  The economic world is a fairly complex structure.  Within this system, there is an interaction of millions of people, business sectors, prices for services and goods, enterprises and other things.  In this regard, there is such a variety in determining the subject of the economy.  It is in close contact with various industries and academic disciplines.  In particular, the relationship of economics with sociology, political science, history, psychology is noted. </p>
