This model in 2013 was sold for about 9 thousand rubles.  It has one indisputable advantage - a powerful battery.  Performance characteristics may not appeal to the modern user, since the device is controlled by the fourth version of Android.  But, as they say, to each his own.  For those for whom the battery life is a decisive factor, this smartphone will appeal to you.  So let's get started with a review of the features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imei.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fly iq4411 quad specifications" class="if uuid-2476932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2476932.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  What is this smartphone model?  Outwardly, it looks like a classic gadget.  Design, by and large, does not cause either admiration or negativity.  Everything is pretty typical.  The plastic case is pleasant to the touch.  A texture pattern is applied to the back cover.  The quality of the material is not bad.  There is no deflection under pressure on the back cover.  There are no gaps or backlashes. </p><p>  Given the <span>characteristics of the Fly IQ4411</span> Quad, the manufacturer brought to the body jacks for connecting headphones and a USB cable.  With the help of the latter, not only the battery is charged, but also synchronized with a PC. </p><p>  The front panel has standard control keys.  They are touch type.  There are three of them.  Above the screen displays the "window" of the camera, sensors.  There is also a speaker hole used for talking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mechanical control keys are located on the side ends.  The volume control is displayed on the left side.  On the right there is a lock button.  When you click on it, you feel a slight backlash, but it is quite convenient to use it. </p><p>  There are two speaker holes on the rear panel.  The camera lens is also displayed here.  Emblazoned on the case and the logo of the manufacturer.  Under the battery cover is a battery, SIM slots in a standard format and a memory card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imei.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fly iq4411 quad specifications" class="if uuid-2476934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2476934.jpg"></div><h2>  Fly IQ4411 Quad Energie 2: screen and camera specifications </h2><p>  We begin the study of characteristics with a description of the cameras.  Unfortunately, in the optics of a smartphone there is nothing attractive.  The front camera is installed, so to speak, just for show.  Its resolution is only 0.3 megapixels.  Naturally, there‚Äôs no question of selfie at all.  All it‚Äôs good for is video calling.  The matrix of the main camera is better, but not by much.  It uses a 5 megapixel sensor.  There is no autofocus, which makes it impossible to get a high-quality and detailed shot.  Recording function is available.  Video resolution - 1280 √ó 720 px. </p><p>  What are the features of the Fly IQ4411 Quad screen?  It is worth noting that pretty good.  The diagonal of the display is 4.65 ∫.  The pixel density is high - 212 ppi.  The resolution for such a screen is sufficient - 864 √ó 480 px.  Unfortunately, the TFT matrix failed a bit.  Its capabilities are not enough for high-quality images.  It is also worth noting that the viewing angles are quite narrow.  But the manufacturer has provided a wide range of brightness.  In the bright sun, the picture does not fade.  The multitouch option only supports 5 touches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="eng.fly.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fly iq4411 quad energie 2 specifications" class="if uuid-2476957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2476957.jpg"></div><h2>  Fly IQ4411 Quad Energie 2: performance characteristics </h2><p>  Considering the characteristics of the smartphone, you can not help but pay attention to performance.  The performance of the gadget is provided by a pretty good processor of the Qualcomm brand.  The chip model is Snapdragon S4 MSM8225Q.  It is based on four computing modules.  The maximum capacity of each of them is 1200 MHz.  The video card is also decent.  The accelerator Adreno 203 is responsible for the graphics, which, together with the main processor, forms a rather powerful platform. </p><p>  At the time of release, the smartphone belonged to middle-class gadgets and the characteristics of the Fly IQ4411 Quad are fully consistent with this segment.  In the work proved itself only on the positive side.  The Android 4.1.2 operating system functions without delays or freezes.  Smooth operation is provided by 512 MB of RAM.  To store application files, there is a built-in storage capacity of 4 GB.  It expands with an external drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eng.fly.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fly IQ4411 Quad Energie 2" class="if uuid-2476958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2476958.jpg"></div><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In Fly IQ4411 Quad, battery life specifications will satisfy even the most demanding user.  The manufacturer installed a battery of 3 thousand milliamps per hour.  This capacity is enough for a long time.  The characteristics indicate that the gadget can work in standby mode for up to 500 hours.  And this, just imagine, about 20 days.  In the talk mode, the smartphone is capable of functioning for approximately 8 hours, provided that the battery is 100% charged.  The test in AnTuTu Tester showed 776 points, and for a phone of this level this is quite a decent value. </p><p>  What results of autonomy can a user expect during active operation?  Even with Wi-Fi turned on, the phone does not need to be charged for two days.  To restore the resource of the battery, you will need to spend up to 3.5 hours. </p>
