And if the trip is supposed to be on holidays or weekends, then you have to plan an interesting and compact route.  The path from Kostroma to the vicinity of Chukhloma will be impressive. </p><p>  Kostroma is one of the points of the Golden Ring of Russia.  Here is the largest number of attractions in the <span>Kostroma region,</span> and it will take at least a day to explore at least the most significant of them.  We will not describe the advantages of the city, since this requires a separate article, but we will talk about less significant, but also interesting places. </p><h2>  Galich, Kostroma Region: Attractions </h2><p>  The city stretched along the largest lake in the Kostroma region.  He best preserved his epochal primeval.  Many beautifully preserved temples and centuries-old buildings, the mysterious history of the city, its once distinctive culture preserve a special atmosphere and make the appearance of Galich unique. </p>

    <p>  The city became famous for its original architecture, made in different styles.  Therefore, it is better to start the inspection from the center, where wooden and brick public buildings and mansions of the century before last are perfectly preserved.  The fire tower, the gymnasium building, the wooden estates of Rybnaya Sloboda, the Kalikins' house, the ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù house, the former almshouse and other buildings seemed to freeze in time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Galich's heart </h2><p>  Shopping arcade - a colorful decoration of the city in the style of classicism, located in its very center.  The ensemble of buildings was designed by the best architects in the <span>Kostroma province</span> : N.I.  Metlin and P.I.  Fursov.  The construction of the main and additional buildings was carried out in the years 1820-1830, and at that time it was a grand trading facility for the county town.  Both rows, Upper and Lower, look impressive, slightly inferior to Kostroma.  The complex deservedly belongs to the famous sights of the Kostroma region.  The photo of the commercial buildings, taken from various angles, makes a completely different impression.  Today, trade in the ranks continues, and for the guests of the city, perhaps, a delicious smoked fish of <span>Lake Galich</span> will become a pleasant purchase <span>.</span> </p>

The wooden temple, after the blessing received in 1680, was recreated in stone.  Since then, his appearance has not changed.  The church belongs to the most important historical sights of the Kostroma region. </p><p>  An elegant church complex of the mid-18th century, consisting of two temples: Introduction and Basil the Great, is located in Ryboda Sloboda.  The first, with its characteristic wooden porch, has been restored, while the second is underway.  Visitors note the presence of a particularly cozy and warm atmosphere in the complex.  In addition, Rybnaya Sloboda is a picturesque area adjacent to the lake, and it is quite interesting to walk here. </p>

    <h2>  Chukhloma </h2><p>  Time seemed to stop in this town surrounded by forests and swamps, conveniently located on the shores of <span>Lake Chukhloma.</span>  Streets with wooden huts picture down the hill to the very shore.  It seems that you are transported into a quiet Russian outback for a century and a half ago.  Indeed, almost all brick buildings in the center and a considerable part of wooden houses belong to this period. </p><p>  The once flourishing agriculture, brewing business, the Chukhloma carpentry known throughout the region, the famous merchant dynasties - everything has sunk into the past.  Only the old architecture remained a witness to past prosperity and prosperity.  Brick buildings in the city center are former public, commercial buildings and merchant houses.  The rest of the Chukhloma huts are built of wood, many hundreds and a half years old, and many of them are decorated with carvings. </p><h2>  Chukhloma attractions </h2><p>  The main subject of attention of these places is the Abrahamiev Gorodetsky monastery, the beginning of which in the 14th century was laid by Abraham Chukhlomsky, a disciple and follower of Sergius of Radonezh.  The monastery, rich and vast before the revolution, was considered a miraculous and revered place.  Many members of eminent families, including the Lermontov clan, are buried in the cemetery near its walls.  Having fallen into decay and significantly destroyed, the monastery began its restoration in 1991.  On the territory you can now see the remains of the ruins.  This beautiful and important complex for Russian Orthodoxy rises above the lake in the village of Nozhkino, 11 km from the city. </p>

    <p>  Other attractions of the Chukhloma of the Kostroma region: the well-restored active Assumption Church of the first half of the 18th century and the earthen ramparts of the mid-15th century, framing the territory of the city park.  And of course, the local pearl is of glacial origin, Lake Chukhloma. </p><h2>  Mysterious Terema </h2><p>  It would seem that you can finish your voyage in Chukhloma.  But if you travel by your own car and not be afraid of difficulties, and the weather is favorable, then you can see two unique treasures of the old wooden architecture.  You can‚Äôt even call them houses - palaces in miniature, and now, thanks to the Internet, they have become famous sights of the Kostroma region. </p>

    <p>  Both towers are located in the already defunct villages of Ostashevo and Pogorelovo.  And if the road to the first point is quite acceptable, then only enthusiasts get to the second point.  In Chukhloma, at the first gas station, turning right, you can get to the village after 25 km.  Petrovskoe.  At the fork where the Vedeno Church is being restored, you should choose the direction: to the right - Ostashevo, to the left - Pogorelovo. </p><p>  There are many historical, Orthodox, architectural, and simply outstanding places of beauty on the land of Kostroma.  Impossible to see everything.  But when you manage to plunge into the atmosphere of domestic provincial cities, even for a short while, you are imbued with the spirit of Russian antiquity, you begin to feel your roots, you turn to history.  A short trip from Kostroma to Chukhloma with its environs leaves such impressions for a long time. </p>
