Tourists should know that this part of the resort is located on a mountain, so any movement is an uphill or descent.

The southern part of Pattaya is a very beautiful place.  And the location of the area is quite convenient.  The resort area is small and compact.

In order to attract tourists to the resort, much attention was paid to the development of good infrastructure.  Pratamnak boasts an excellent selection of shops, restaurants, cafes and other objects of interest to vacationers.  Literally at every step you will see more and more new establishments. </p><p>  If you move a little offshore, deep into Thai areas, you can see elements of the usual life of the local population.  But it is worth considering that such walks do not always leave a pleasant impression.  Still, it is much nicer to travel to the recommended tourist attractions.  Pratamnak is equipped with observation platforms from which you can admire the sea views and take excellent photographs in memory of the time spent in an exotic country.  Further in our article we will tell you which tourist sites are worth visiting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain beach 3 pattaya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2105504.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Pratamnak as a separate resort area has several advantages, thanks to which vacationers choose it.  Firstly, a busy highway does not pass through it, as in other parts of Pattaya.  Secondly, the resort has a separate compact and isolated beach, surrounded on all sides by high cliffs.  In addition, within walking distance are several of the main attractions of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Pratamnak is a fairly quiet place.  Here you will not be disturbed by the noise of night clubs and discos.  The resort is good for children and their parents.  In addition, it is believed that the sea in this area is much cleaner than in the center of Pattaya.  And a well-developed infrastructure is quite conducive to a comfortable stay in an exotic country. </p><p>  Despite such a number of positive characteristics, the area still has one drawback.  Although it’s not far to get to the center of Pattaya, you will have to use taxi services all the time, since tuk-tuks do not go here, and there is no public transport.  It takes about twenty minutes to get to the nearest stop where you can take a tuk-tuk.  Such isolation of the resort makes it calmer and even safer in terms of theft than other regions. </p><h2>  Resort beach </h2><p>  Pratamnak Beach is not as big as other Pattaya beaches.  But at the same time it is very beautiful and is closed from the winds by the mountains.  On this stretch of the coast, only those tourists who live in the nearest hotels have a rest, so there is no noise and fuss, as well as large crowds.  Of course, during the high season there are many vacationers here, but still not as many as in the center of Pattaya. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand mountain beach 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2105506.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And in the evenings, the coast is generally very calm and quiet, because there are no noisy restaurants and cafes.  To get to the nearest establishments, you must climb the hill by stairs.  Top of the coast offers an incredibly beautiful view.  A little further from the coast there are shops, restaurants and cafes, bike rental points, tour agencies, massage parlors and much more.  Experienced tourists believe that Protamnak is a very calm and quiet resort, in contrast to the bustling center of Pattaya. </p><h2>  Reviews for Mountain Beach 3 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, it is worth discussing the reviews of vacationers who have already visited it.  Mountain Beach 3 * (Pattaya) is a three-star complex in the heart of Pratamnak.  Its location can be called very successful.  As we have already said, this area of ​​Pattaya is a great place for a relaxing holiday.  Well, if you are looking for nightly entertainment in the form of clubs and discos, then you should choose a different region.  Here, of course, there are entertainments, but they are of a slightly different nature.  But the night club has not yet been built. </p><p>  The remoteness of Pratamnak provides many benefits for holidaymakers.  The only drawback is the fact that local transport is presented only by taxi.  According to vacationers, it is not very convenient.  And the next tuk-tuk need to go twenty minutes.  The rest of Pratumnak is a very convenient place to relax.  Even the famous Walking Street can be reached from here in seven minutes. </p><p>  Mountain Beach 3 * (Thailand) is located in a picturesque place and is a single seven-story building.  The hotel building is located on a mountain, as Pratamnak itself extends into the mountainous terrain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain beach 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2105507.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel complex has a small compact area on which everything is within walking distance.  The only place you need to go is the beach, because you need to go down to it and climb stairs.  According to tourists, the number of rooms of Mountain Beach Hotel 3 * is quite good.

Moreover, it is worth knowing that the glass containers can not be thrown away, it is taken away by the maids for exchange.  If they do not find empty bottles, then they will have to pay for them upon departure. </p><p>  Not all apartments have balconies.  But in the rooms there are large windows, which allows you to ventilate the rooms during periods of shutdown of air conditioners.  Maids conduct daily high-quality cleaning.  Towels and bedding are also changed quite regularly.  Of the detergents in the bathrooms, there is only soap and shampoo, the stocks of which are also replenished regularly.
