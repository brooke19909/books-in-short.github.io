Casco insurance companies, whose rating we present below, are evaluated primarily by independent experts that take into account objective parameters.  The assessment is also carried out by professionals "from the people" who express a subjective opinion.  Below we will consider the reliability rating of Casco insurance companies.  It was made up by experts of the Expert RA agency in the top 5 category.

    <h2>  Insurance company RESO-Garantia </h2><p>  The Casco insurance company rating allows RESO-Garantia to firmly establish itself in fourth place in the top 5 ranking.  1991 is considered the year of foundation of the company. Now more than 800 branches with 19 thousand employees work.  The rating of insurance companies ‚ÄúCasco‚Äù (SPB) also takes into account the client base of the company, which is represented by more than 8 million legal entities and individuals. </p>

For example, the service "RESOauto GAP" allows you to cover the difference in the cost of the car and reimbursement of insurance payments under the standard CASCO policy.

    <p>  A lot of good reviews can be heard about the VIP service program, which provides a personal manager for service.  This package allows round-the-clock dialing to the dispatch service, provides step-by-step instructions for insured events, and allows you to get a repair direction remotely from the insurance company.  In case of minor damage to the car, damages are made without the help of the traffic police. </p><h2>  Insurance company Alfa Insurance </h2><p>  The fifth leading position in the expert rating of Casco insurance companies belongs to Alfa Insurance.  It was founded in 1992 as an open joint-stock company under the name ‚ÄúEast European Insurance Agency‚Äù (V.E. St.A.), which in 2000 joined the Alfa Group consortium and received a new name.  The company is represented by 270 regional branches.  Clients are about 25 million individuals and more than 400 thousand legal entities. </p>

Several types of Casco are offered.  The reviews show that the AlfaCASCO 50x50 package will allow the client to save half the cost of the traditional policy in the event that no incidents occur for the period of insurance with the car.  Also, upon the occurrence of such a situation, it is possible to supplement 25% of the cost of the policy and receive a full insurance payment.

    <p>  The company's attention to customers is also evident in the development of AlfaBusiness policy.  In its framework, with minor damage to the car, repairs are carried out without the need to provide certificates from the traffic police.  At the same time, the policy ‚ÄúAlpha.  All Inclusive ‚Äùoffers insurance, in which a reimbursement of up to 50% of the sum insured occurs without providing any certificates.  And "CASCO in the top ten", developed by the company, compensates for losses from theft or troubled accident, in which the perpetrator does not have a policy. </p><h2>  Summarize </h2><p>  An expert rating of <span>insurance companies</span> was reviewed <span>.</span>  <span>These are the</span> best organizations in the industry, according to experts.  The national rating of Casco insurance companies is subjective.  Although in many respects customer reviews coincide with the opinions of qualified experts. </p>

Feedback from Casco insurance companies is not always true.  Before you make a deal, you should weigh the pros and cons.
