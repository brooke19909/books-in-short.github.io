    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated </h2><p>  Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel is located at some distance from city bustle and many infrastructure facilities.  So, Alanya International Airport is already 90 km from this resort.  If you want to walk around the city, you will have to overcome 30 km to its center. </p><p>  The remoteness of the Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * (Okurcalar) hotel from many benefits of civilization is compensated by the incredibly beautiful natural sites located near the hotel complex.  So, not far from the resort is the famous <span>Manavgat waterfall,</span> which is certainly worth a visit while in Alanya. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Tourists from all over the world have long loved the Vikingen Quality Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel.  Reviews about him contain a lot of positive, as well as some comments.  And indicate the following: </p><ul><li>  The hotel is located in close proximity to the sea and has its own well-kept beach.  The impression is slightly spoiled by an uncomfortable entry into the water, strewn with stones and laid out with slippery slabs. </li><li>  Great varied food.  From a huge assortment of dishes, everyone will choose something to their taste.  Pleased with the opportunity to negotiate with the cooks a diet or vegetarian menu. </li><li>  Regular cleaning and replacement of bedding and bath accessories (although, in the absence of a tip, the quality of service is noticeably reduced). </li><li>  In the rooms everything is working properly.  The only gripe is caused by old air conditioners, which practically do not cope with the function of cooling the air. </li><li>  A good exciting animation program for both children and adults. </li><li>  Despite the fact that there are plenty of sun loungers on the beach, they are sorely lacking mattresses. </li><li>  The hotel is located very far from any infrastructure.  The only thing nearby is the local rural market and a small water park. </li><li>  For those who do not want to leave the hotel, there is the opportunity to ride a roller coaster in the pool. </li><li>  Despite the fact that cable TV shows a huge number of channels in the hotel, there are only two Russian-language channels. </li></ul>
