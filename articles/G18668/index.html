A photo, a step-by-step description of the process of making textile crafts in different techniques, detailed workshops in pictures and secrets from experienced needleworkers are all in this article. </p><h2>  DIY materials </h2><p>  What needs to be prepared before starting work?  The basis of most textile colors is satin ribbons of different widths.  For small corollas and buds, narrow strips of 1.5-2 cm are needed. They are also useful for forming the middle of the product.  But lush flowers from ribbons of such width cannot be made, for this it is better to use a five-centimeter braid. </p><p>  Most needlework stores sell satin stripes in various colors.  Thanks to a wide range of source material, craftsmen can create very naturalistic flowers from ribbons.  But, in addition, it is worth paying attention to the braid of organza, velvet and rep.  These types of ribbons are not as bright as satin, they have more muffled, soft tones, and the products from them are special, stylized as vintage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.road2cablog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful flowers from ribbons" class="if uuid-2472848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472848.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to tapes acting as the basis for crafts, you need to stock up with other materials: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  threads for stitching and fixing the buds on the basis of; </li><li>  beads, beads, rhinestones and stamens to decorate the middle of the corollas; </li><li>  floral ribbon, wire for the manufacture of stems. </li></ul><p>  Most of the master classes presented in our article are accessible for understanding, and their implementation will not be a problem even for beginners.  Making flowers from ribbons with your own hands is not as difficult as it seems at first glance, especially since for simple fakes you do not need to have special tools. </p><h2>  Tools for making flowers </h2><p>  The minimum set required for work consists of the following items: </p><ul><li>  scissors; </li><li>  needles </li><li>  pins </li><li>  lighter or candle; </li><li>  tweezers. </li></ul><p>  In addition, it‚Äôs good to have a glue gun, with its help it is easier and faster to connect the parts of the craft to each other.  Those who plan to seriously produce flowers from ribbons will not hurt to purchase a set, as in the following photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tools for making flowers from ribbons" class="if uuid-2472842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472842.jpg"></div><p>  The standard kit includes bullets of different diameters, cutters and a heating device.  Using these tools, natural bends and creases are formed on the petals and leaves. </p><h2>  Simple flower on an asterisk </h2><p>  To begin with, we propose to master the production of elementary crafts for beginners.  Flowers from ribbons made according to this instruction will surely turn out to be very cute.  They are suitable for decorating children's hair accessories, notebooks, cards, photo frames and other items. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fashionornaments.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A flower from a narrow ribbon on an asterisk" class="if uuid-2472849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472849.jpg"></div><p>  Such flowers are made of narrow braid (5 mm) using a paper blank (frame in the form of an asterisk).  First you need to prepare blanks for five or seven rays with a hole in the middle.  To form flower petals, a ribbon is wrapped around each ray of an asterisk, then, through an opening in the center, the craft is fixed and removed from the base.  The flower can be left single-layer or made lush by adding one or two rows of petals to its center.  For their manufacture, an asterisk of a smaller diameter is used.  The middle is decorated to your liking: beads, a button or rhinestones. </p><h2>  Kanzashi - textile modeling </h2><p>  How else can I make flowers from ribbons with my own hands?  The master class presented below is a brief instruction on making jewelry using the kanzashi technique.  This is the Far Eastern art of composing compositions, very similar to origami, but the material for the crafts is not paper, but ribbons or shreds of different fabrics.  In the kanzashi technique, there are about ten ways to create modules for crafts, but the main ones are two, they are presented in the following picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ameblo.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kanzashi master class" class="if uuid-2472847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472847.jpg"></div><p>  How to make a red petal can be seen in the same photo.  To make kanzashi flowers from a ribbon, you need to stock up with satin squares with sides of 4 or 5 cm. The blank is folded twice diagonally once, then the resulting triangle needs to be bent again.  A petal is formed from the small triangle thus obtained.  After fixing it with your fingers or with tweezers, you need to trim the tip of the tape protruding from the bottom, and scorch the cut with a lighter.  The burnt edges must be pressed quickly so that the edges of the petal stick together securely.  The number of elements in one flower can be anything - it all depends on its shape and size.  Between themselves, the petals are connected with glue or sewn together with threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icreativeideas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kanzashi ribbon flowers" class="if uuid-2472843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472843.jpg"></div><p>  The second version of flowers is also made of ribbons (organza and satin), but, as can be seen from the photo, the process technology is slightly different.  In addition, the petals are not fastened together, but are sewn onto the base - a circle of fabric. </p><p>  Kanzash flowers do not have to be solid.  To diversify the craft, you need to put together two colorful pieces of ribbon and form a petal from this ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù. </p><h2>  Satin ribbon rose </h2><p>  Rosa is a real queen of flowers, beloved by many people, you can not only be alive with this beautiful plant.  You can make a bud from a satin ribbon.  The easiest way is pleating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ribbon Flowers for Beginners" class="if uuid-2472844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472844.jpg"></div><p>  For work, you need to take a piece of a narrow (2-2.5 cm) ribbon about a meter long.  First, it should be folded in half and, bent in the center obliquely, to form a right angle.  Further, the ponytails of the tape are alternately superposed one on top of another until approximately 5 cm remain from their entire length. The resulting ‚Äúgarland‚Äù is clamped with fingers and, pulling one ‚Äútail‚Äù, a flower is collected.  So that the rose does not fall apart, it must be sewn with threads in tone from the back.  Then you can trim the extra piece of tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.cutoutandkeep.net/projects/satin-ribbon-rose"><img itemprop="image" alt="Workshop on making flowers" class="if uuid-2472846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472846.jpg"></div><h2>  Living rose </h2><p>  Ribbon flowers are not only fantasy, but also very natural and truly beautiful.  The following master class demonstrates how to make a hair clip or elastic band for hair with beautiful satin roses.  For a large bud, which will be identical in size to the real one, you need to take a ribbon of 5 cm. For a single rose, you need about 15 pieces of 7-10 cm. To prevent the fabric from crumbling, cut the slices with a lighter or above a candle. </p><p>  Initially, a core is formed.  To do this, the tape is bent from one edge to the wrong side.  The formed corner must be folded again towards the center and hem the workpiece with threads.  Then the middle is wrapped with the remaining free edge of the ribbon and the inner part of the bud is finally formed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satin ribbon roses" class="if uuid-2472841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472841.jpg"></div><p>  The next stage of work is the manufacture of petals.  The process technology is the same for each of them, the sequence of steps is shown in the photo.  It should be borne in mind that the flower will turn out more accurately if shorter pieces of tape are used for the inner petals, and on the outside, on the contrary, those that are more authentic.  Each rose petal is sewn in turn, you need to arrange them symmetrically to each other. </p><h2>  Lush Organza Flower </h2><p>  The next corolla is not made from satin braid, but from organza.  You can use tape or fabric from a piece of fabric.  This is a multilayer flower, for it you need to prepare four types of petals: </p><ul><li>  5-6 large droplets; </li><li>  8-10 hearts; </li><li>  8-10 small droplets. </li></ul><p>  All blanks are cut out of the tape, then their edges are burned above the candle.  ‚ÄúWarm up‚Äù is necessary not only slices, but also the middle, thanks to this, the petals are obtained with beautiful bends and hold their shape better.  Work should be done carefully, as organza is a flammable material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organza Rose" class="if uuid-2472850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472850.jpg"></div><p>  A flower is formed from the middle, starting with small elements, then the bud is gradually ‚Äúopened‚Äù with the help of large petals.  From below, the corolla can be supplemented with leaves and ribbons, and inside - with artificial stamens. </p><h2>  We make a dahlia from the atlas </h2><p>  How to make a flower from a ribbon, our mothers and grandmothers also knew.  At their disposal were such illustrated instructions: </p><div class="photo" data-original="midvalevintagepost.blogspot.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make flowers from ribbons" class="if uuid-2472851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472851.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see from the picture, for the flower you need to prepare the petals, which are sewn on a round base.  For her, it is best to use a non-flowing fabric - felt or felt.  As a result, the master will receive a beautiful magnificent dahlia. </p><h2>  Wide ribbon decorative poppy </h2><p>  To make a flower from a satin ribbon, it is not necessary to sew a bud from a huge number of petals.  From a cut of a five-centimeter tape 4 meters long, you can make just an amazing lush nimbus that resembles a peony or a decorative poppy in appearance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoinstructions.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lush Satin Ribbon Flower" class="if uuid-2472845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472845.jpg"></div><p>  This craft is very simple to execute: </p><ol><li>  Draw a ribbon with diagonal lines, the step from one corner to another should be 8 cm. </li><li>  Sew along the intended line of the seam ‚Äúforward needle‚Äù with small stitches. </li><li>  Pull the thread as tight as possible. </li><li>  Form a flower by spiraling the ruffle obtained from the ribbon. </li></ol><p>  You can also use several types of ribbons of different shades, for example, make the lower part of the corolla from a wide braid of a lighter color, and for the top, take the tape narrower and a tone or two darker.  The middle of the flower is decorated with one or more beads or sewn up with loose beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Painted Ribbon Flowers" class="if uuid-2472902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472902.jpg"></div><h2>  Flower Kingdom Helen Gibb </h2><p>  Finally, we will show our readers a collection of works by a true master of his craft - American Helen Gibb.  This woman creates unique crafts from ribbons, real masterpieces.  She has developed her own unique manufacturing technology for a wide variety of colors and is happy to share it with everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Helen Gibb Ribbon Flowers" class="if uuid-2472839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2472839.jpg"></div><p>  Helen‚Äôs idea is that she uses materials of natural shades to create plant elements, and to give corollas and leaves maximum naturalness, she paints ribbons in several colors at once. </p>
