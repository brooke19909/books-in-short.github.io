As soon as you reach the cliffs, you will find the place you were striving for.  Since many Ukrainians have a rest at the resort, the prices here are often quoted directly in hryvnias, but they are ready to accept another currency from you.  Here, in a matter of days, you will be trained to dive into the sea with flippers, arrange diving on a sunken ship, help you learn the basics of diving and even get the appropriate PADI certificate. </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">According to many who spent their holidays in these places, Kvariati is one of the best resorts in Adjara, of course, not counting Batumi.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Many, having come here once, then return again and again.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Some rent houses near the beach, others in the upper part of the resort village.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The northern part is more noisy, there are always more discos.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">There are more entertainment, bars and cafes in Kvariati (Georgia).</span> </p><p>  In reviews of these places, tourists say that in terms of price and quality, this is one of the best places on the country's coast.  And if you still do not have enough entertainment, of which there really are not many, you can always get to Batumi. </p>
