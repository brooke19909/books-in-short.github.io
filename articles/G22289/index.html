Empire of Alexander the Great after his death</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to ancient documents, the death of Alexander the Great came on June 10, 323 BC.  e.  The greatest commander was only 32 years old.  Until now, historians cannot find out the reason for his passing away.  The sudden death of Alexander of Macedon, who did not determine his heir, led to the collapse of his empire and the creation of several states, headed by military leaders and close associates of the great king. </p><h2>  Return to Babylon </h2><p>  In 323 BC  e.  the Hellenic army was returning to the west.  Alexander of Macedon ended his campaign east, reaching India.  He managed to create a huge empire, stretching from the Balkans to Iran and from Central Asia to Egypt.  In the history of mankind, such huge states did not yet exist that appeared literally overnight by the will of one commander. </p><p>  The death of Alexander of Macedon overtook in Babylon.  It was a huge oasis with many canals taking water from the Euphrates.  The city often suffered from diseases and epidemics.  Perhaps it was here that the King of Kings caught the infection. </p>

    <h2>  Hephaestion's funeral </h2><p>  In the last year of his life, Alexander became plagued and suspicious.  His mourning was caused by the death of his best friend and close commander Hephaestion.  All May was spent in the chores associated with the organization of the funeral.  A huge ziggurat was built for Hephaestion, which was decorated with numerous trophies received during the campaign in the east. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The king ordered that a decree be sent to all ends of the empire that his friend should be revered as a hero (in fact, this was the status of a demigod).  Being an extremely religious and superstitious person, Alexander attached great importance to such things.  Among other things, he surrounded himself with numerous prophets and oracles. </p><h2>  Euphrates Travel </h2><p>  Babylon annoyed Alexander.  He briefly left the bustling city to explore the shores of the Euphrates and neighboring swamps.  The king was about to organize a sea expedition around the <span>Arabian Peninsula.</span>  He explored the banks of the river, trying to figure out how to place 1200 ships near Babylon, which were about to set sail soon. </p><p>  During this voyage, the wind tore from the ruler‚Äôs head his red hat with a gilded ribbon, which he wore as a diadem.  The prophets to whom the monarch listened decided that this incident is a bad omen that does not bode well.  When the death of Alexander the Great became a fait accompli, many associates recalled the incident on one of the channels of the Euphrates. </p>

    <h2>  Disease onset </h2><p>  In late May, the king returned to Babylon.  He stopped his mourning on the occasion of the death of a friend and began to feast with his associates.  Holiday sacrifices were brought to the gods, and in the army began to give out the long-awaited gifts - a lot of wine and meat.  In Babylon, the success of the Newarch expedition in the <span>Persian Gulf</span> was noted <span>.</span>  The king was also eager to go on another campaign. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the early days of June, Alexander developed a strong fever.  He tried to get rid of the disease by taking baths and making generous sacrifices to the gods.  Rumors about the king‚Äôs illness leaked into the city.  When on June 8 a crowd of excited Macedonians broke into the residence of their ruler, the king greeted his supporters, but his whole appearance indicated that the monarch was held in public by force. </p><h2>  The death of Alexander </h2><p>  The next day, June 9, Alexander fell into a coma, and on the 10th, doctors ascertained his death.  For many centuries, historians of different generations have proposed a variety of theories about what caused the death of the young commander, always distinguished by good health.  In modern science, the most common point of view is that the cause of the death of Alexander the Great is far from mysticism. </p><p>  Most likely, the king caught malaria.  She significantly weakened the body, and he could not cope with pneumonia (according to another version - leukemia).  The discussion about the second fatal disease continues to this day.  According to a less common theory, the cause of Alexander the Great's death was West Nile fever. </p>

    <h2>  Poisoning Versions </h2><p>  Important is the fact that not one of the king‚Äôs comrades-in-arms died from an infectious disease.  Perhaps the monarch spoiled his health with regular drinking.  During the last holiday, he did not stop feasts for a single day, where alcohol was consumed in large quantities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Modern researchers drew attention to the symptoms that accompanied the commander's disease.  He suffered from convulsions, frequent vomiting, muscle weakness and a confused pulse.  All this indicates poisoning.  Therefore, the versions of the death of Alexander the Great also include the theory of the improper treatment of the monarch. </p><p>  Doctors could give him a white hellebore or hellebore to alleviate his first ailment, but in the end only aggravated the situation.  Even in Antiquity, the version about the poisoning of Alexander by his commander Antipater, who was threatened with the removal from the post of governor in Macedonia, was popular. </p><h2>  Tomb of the king </h2><p>  323 B.C.  e.  (the year of the death of Alexander of Macedon) became mourning for the entire vast empire.  While ordinary residents grieved over the untimely death of the monarch, his entourage decided what to do with the body of the deceased.  It was decided to embalm. </p><p>  In the end, Ptolemy took possession of the body, who began to rule in Egypt.  The mummy was transported to Memphis, and then to Alexandria - a city founded and named in honor of the great commander.  Many years later, Egypt was conquered by the Romans.  The emperors considered Alexander the greatest role model.  The rulers of Rome often made pilgrimages to the <span>tomb of the king.</span>  The latest reliable information about it dates back to the beginning of the III century, when this place was visited by the emperor Caracalla, who placed his ring and tunic on the tomb.  Since then, the trace of the mummy has been lost.  Today, nothing is known about her future fate. </p>

    <h2>  Regency Perdiccas </h2><p>  Controversial remains information about the king‚Äôs latest orders made before he finally fell into a coma.  Empire of Alexander the Great after his death was to receive an heir.  The monarch understood this and, feeling his approaching end, could appoint a successor.  In Antiquity, the legend was circulated that a weakening ruler handed over his ring with a seal to Perdicke - a faithful military leader who was to become regent under Queen Roxanne, who was in the last month of pregnancy. </p><p>  A few weeks after the death of Alexander, she gave birth to a son (also Alexander).  Regency Perdikki from the very beginning was unstable.  After the death of Alexander the Great, the successor began to challenge the other close associates of the deceased king.  In historiography, they remained known as diadochi.  Almost all governors in the provinces declared their independence and created their own satrapies. </p><h2>  Dyadochi </h2><p>  In 321 BC  e.  Perdiccas during a campaign in Egypt died at the hands of his own military leaders, dissatisfied with his despotism.  After the death of Alexander of Macedon, his power finally plunged into the abyss of civil wars, where every applicant for power fought with everyone.  Bloodshed lasted twenty years.  These conflicts went down in history as the wars of the diadoches. </p><p>  Gradually, the generals got rid of all close and relatives of Alexander.  The brother of Tsar Arridey, sister Cleopatra, mother of the Olympics, were killed.  The son (formally named Alexander IV) lost his life at age 14, in 309 BC.  e.  The great monarch had another child.  The illegitimate son Hercules, born of the concubine Barsina, was killed at the same time as his half-brother. </p>

    <h2>  Empire Section </h2><p>  Babylon (the place of death of Alexander the Great) quickly lost its power over the provinces.  After the death of Perdiccas, an important role on the wreckage of the formerly united empire began to play the dialects Antigonus and Seleucus.  At first they were allies.  In 316 BC  e.  Antigonus came to Babylon and demanded from Seleucus information about the financial costs of the war against neighbors.  The latter, fearing disgrace, fled to Egypt, where he took refuge with the local ruler of Ptolemy. </p><p>  The death of Alexander the Great, in short, has long been a thing of the past, and his supporters continued to fight against each other.  By 311 BC  e.  The following balance of forces has developed.  Antigonus ruled in Asia, Ptolemy in Egypt, Cassander in Greece, Seleucus in Persia. </p><h2>  The Last War of the Diadoch </h2><p>  The last, fourth war of the Diadoch (308-301 BC) began due to the fact that Cassander and Ptolemy decided to unite in an alliance against Antigonus.  They were joined by the king of Macedonia Lysimachus and the founder of the Seleucid Empire Seleucus. </p><p>  Ptolemy attacked Antigone first.  He captured the Cyclades, Sikion and Corinth.  To do this, a large Egyptian landing landed on the Peloponnese, where he took the garrisons of King Phrygia by surprise.  Ptolemy's next target was Asia Minor.  <span>The king of Egypt</span> created a powerful bridgehead in Cyprus.  His army and navy were based on this island.  Upon learning of the enemy‚Äôs plans, Antigon regrouped his troops.  His army temporarily left Greece.  This army went to Cyprus in 160 ships.  Having landed on the island, 15 thousand people, led by Demetrius Poliorket, launched a siege of Salamis. </p><p>  Ptolemy sent almost his entire fleet to the rescue of the fortress in Cyprus.  Demetrius decided to give a naval battle.  As a result of the collision, the Egyptians lost all their ships.  Most of them were flooded, and transport ships went to Antigonus.  In 306 BC  e.  Salamis isolated capitulated.  Antigonus conquered Cyprus and even proclaimed himself king. </p><p>  A few months after this success, the diadoch decided to deliver a crushing blow to Ptolemy on his own land and equipped an expedition to Egypt.  However, the satrap army was unable to cross the Nile.  In addition, Ptolemy sent to the camp of the enemy agitators, who actually outbid the opponent‚Äôs soldiers.  Discouraged Antigonus had to return home empty-handed. </p><p>  For several years, the opponents individually attacked each other at sea.  Antigonus managed to expel Lysimachus from Phrygia.  At the same time, Demetrius finally ended the campaign in Greece and went to Asia Minor in order to unite with his ally.  There was no general battle.  It happened only 8 years after the start of the war. </p>

    <h2>  Battle of Ips </h2><p>  In the summer of 301 B.C.  e.  the battle of Ips occurred.  This battle was the final chord of the wars of the Diadoch.  The cavalry of Antigonus, led by Demetrius Poliorket, attacked the heavy cavalry of the allies, led by the son of Seleucus Antiochus.  The battle was fierce.  Finally, the cavalry of Demetrius defeated the enemies and rushed after them in pursuit.  This act was a mistake. </p><p>  Chasing the enemy, the cavalry broke away too far from the main forces of Antigonus.  Seleucus, realizing that the enemy made a mistake, introduced elephants into the battle.  They were not dangerous for the Macedonians, who learned to use combustible means and nailed boards against huge animals.  However, the elephants finally cut off the riders from Antigonus. </p><p>  The heavy phalanx of the Phrygian king was surrounded.  She was attacked by light infantry, as well as horse archers.  The phalanx, unable to break through the blockade, stood under fire for several hours.  Finally, the soldiers of Antigonus either surrendered or fled from the battlefield.  Demetrius decided to leave for Greece.  The 80-year-old Antigonus fought to the last, until he fell, struck by an enemy dart. </p><h2>  The legacy of Alexander </h2><p>  After the battle of Ips, the allies finally divided the former empire of Alexander.  Cassander left Thessaly, Macedonia and Hellas.  Lysimachus received Thrace, Phrygia and the Black Sea.  Seleucus went to Syria.  Their adversary Demetrius retained several cities in Greece and Asia Minor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the death of alexander of macedonia briefly" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1266069.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All the kingdoms that arose on the ruins of the empire of Alexander of Macedon took over from it their cultural basis.  Even Egypt, where Ptolemy reigned, became Hellenistic.  Numerous countries in the Middle East have a link in the form of the Greek language.  This world lasted about two centuries, until it was conquered by the Romans.  The new empire also absorbed many features of Greek culture. </p><p>  Today, the place and year of the death of Alexander the Great is indicated in every textbook of ancient history.  The premature departure from the life of the great commander has become one of the most important events for all contemporaries. </p>
