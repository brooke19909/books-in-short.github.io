During the construction and arrangement of the territory, its creators made sure to adhere to the eco-concept in everything, and now this is reflected both in the quality of the services offered and in each segment of its infrastructure.  Made of purely natural materials (even wooden decoration predominates in decoration), the LEXX Hotel (Koktebel) fits perfectly into the natural landscape. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The very vast territory of the hotel-club is carefully ennobled, but so that it does not look like a foreign interspersing in the pristine Crimean landscape.  A special pride of the creators is the large and well-groomed trees that were exported from Italy by small seedlings.  Ecotourism is the main component of leisure offered by the LEXX hotel (Koktebel).  This is because a more suitable place for this purpose is unlikely to be found - only the Crimea and only Koktebel with its cleanest peninsula, including beaches and the sea.  The landscapes here are amazing!  Service and comfort are at an exceptionally high level.  Hotel LEXX (Koktebel) will be able to accept and occupy all comers, regardless of age, gender and preferences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Within the boundaries of the peninsula, literally everything is available to hotel guests: any departure, any transport, and for any company.  In the immediate vicinity of the hotel there are a diving center, water park, dolphinarium, many restaurants.  All kinds of festivals, concerts, exhibitions, creative evenings and master classes (from poetry to hang gliding) are constantly held in Koktebel itself.  Exactly no one will get bored.  Hotel LEXX (Koktebel) loves its guests very much.  Address of the institution: Armatlukskaya street, 2a. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In addition to all kinds of activities on interests, which will be discussed below, the hotel organizes excursions, the choice of which is truly huge.  Crimea is famous for its famous natural and historical places, a tourist who came from afar would be offended not to visit even the most important ones.  This is primarily Kara-Dag, from which the spa hotel LEXX <span>(Koktebel, Crimea)</span> is within walking distance.  You can order unique excursions, where Massandra, Vorontsov, Livadia palaces on the southern coast of Crimea await vacationers, as well as the <span>Bakhchisaray palace</span> sung by Pushkin <span>.</span> </p><p>  Truly impressive are the magnificent caves - Marble and Red.  The beauty of the one and only Crimean parks will be remembered forever: Nikitsky, Paradise.  Many people come to <span>LEXX (hotel, Koktebel, Crimea)</span> every year on their holidays <span>.</span>  Thanks, give advice.  In addition to sports and tourism, vacationers are expected to hike in the Khersones reserve and many wonderful Crimean museums: Green, Chekhov, Aivazovsky, the House of the poet, built in Koktebel by <span>Maximilian Voloshin ... It is</span> truly impossible to list everything you need to see.  Yes, and it‚Äôs also impossible to see everything for one season, and therefore come here more than once.  There is no problem here with organizing the most varied holiday, because LEXX (hotel, Koktebel, Crimea) receives the most favorable reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Kara-Dag </h2><p>  Excursions to the reserve are exclusive, only for hotel guests with their own guide, for other vacationers this part of the Crimea is closed.  There are many reasons for this: the flora and fauna of this picturesque place on the peninsula are unique, in the Red Book there are 125 endangered species of animals left only in Kara-Dag.  Here visitors can meet wild boars, European roe deer, <span>stone martens,</span> black vultures and many other rare fauna species in wildlife.  The excursion to the research biostation, which is also provided only by the LEXX spa hotel (Russia, Koktebel), is extremely interesting and informative. </p><p>  But the local flora looks especially jubilant: feather grasses (eight species!) Sway in the hills, among which flowers of a fabulous beauty erupt.  Only here you can touch real relic trees, and the only volcano in the world, preserved from the time of the Jurassic period, will leave impressions truly unforgettable.  The walk will not be easy, but it is worth the effort!  Here, hotel guests love to do yoga, and the "enlightened" claim that Kara-Dag is a place of power.  Hiking enthusiasts come here.  Club-hotel LEXX in Koktebel, reviews of which are presented in the article, does not leave anyone indifferent, everyone knows about the incredibly beautiful nature of this famous corner of Crimea.  The magnificent bay has been described many times, the mountainsides twined with grapes and centuries-old pine trees tending to the sky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  One of the most wonderful places to stay in Crimea is LEXX (hotel, Koktebel, Crimea).  The tour operator will certainly tell those who wish to come here, what is the best way to choose housing for the settlement: 120 separate rooms are offered at the hotel, for every taste, and there is not one close among them.  The design of each room is made in the same style, and this does not depend on the category of housing.  Differences (and cost) depend more on the view outside the window, on how breathtaking it is (they are all interesting, even those that go to the hotel), as well as on the total area and number of rooms in this room.  Nothing depends on the quality of the service, since it is the same everywhere - at the highest level.  Convenience is also absolutely equivalent.  The number of services is everywhere maximum. </p><p>  On the balconies and terraces, summer furniture is required, where guests spend the most beautiful morning hours with a cup of coffee, admiring the sunrise, and evening - at sunset with a cup of tea.  The smallest rooms are 23 square meters, not counting the terrace or balcony.  An extra bed is a very comfortable chair-bed, which folds out into a full-fledged berth.  Accommodation in cottages of an even higher level of comfort.  Here live people who love solitude, silence, peace and care.  And all this is provided to them by the LEXX hotel (Koktebel).  Reviews about the responsiveness of the staff and the various conveniences created for the guests are full of gratitude. </p>

    <h2>  Tariffs </h2><p>  Club Hotel LEXX (Koktebel) has a sufficient number of one-room rooms, but since they are all very extensive, most of them can be transformed into two-room ones.  The buildings were designed and the construction and decoration were completed at the highest level.  All rooms are soundproofed and air-conditioned.  Meals are included in the price, the guest chooses the tariff, as well as the use of beach towels, sun loungers and all three pools.  Included in the tariff and the favorite entertainment of little vacationers - children's animation.  Parking, luggage transfer and a maid with an alarm clock are also free.  Wireless internet is free too. </p><p>  Each room has either a balcony or a terrace.  Summer furniture, a refrigerator, air conditioning, a flat-screen TV, a bathroom, a shower, perfume sets, bathrobes and slippers, lightproof curtains, a hairdryer, a safe, and a telephone are available in each room.  All beds have orthopedic mattresses.  Extra beds are very easy to arrange in almost any room.  Two-story cottages with terraces are located in a row on both sides of a wide alley - perpendicular to the location of the main pool.  Therefore, from any number of any building you can quickly reach any piece of infrastructure - everything is close.  In the cottages, each room is designed for two main places plus an additional one.  The rooms on the ground floors are simply huge - 45 square meters each. </p><h2>  Children </h2><p>  Children's leisure at the hotel is varied and is distinguished by a special kind of cognition.  But first, it must be said that what concerns parents most of all is the arrangement.  No problems.  Baby cots are provided free of charge, extra meals not included in the tariff, children under twelve are entitled to a 50% discount on the price, and children under five years old not only live, but also eat for free, these are the conditions provided by LEXX (spa hotel, Koktebel).  If there are more than one children under five, an extra bed will have to be paid. </p><p>  The microclimate in the hotel is unique, therefore, health improvement for children of any age is provided.  Even if the weather has not set, the kids with great pleasure visit the game room, where you can frolic without fear.  Here they are waiting for a huge variety of toys, so interesting that many parents can not help joining their offspring in games.  The pool has a children's area (80 centimeters), so bathing takes place in comfort and safety.  On the territory, directly in the open air, there is a labyrinth, where both preschool children and older children spend their time with enthusiasm.  Children sunbathe everywhere: on the beach by the sea, and by the pool, and even on the soft grass of lawns, near cottages. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel LEXX (Koktebel, Russia) only supplies ecologically clean, local, seasonal, natural farm products, the quality of which is strictly controlled, to the table.  The quality of deliveries is also under constant control.  The buffet with three meals a day is so diverse that even children - famous picks - can always find something not only healthy, but also tasty. </p><p>  The range of dishes is impressive and changes daily.  Parents and children are fed varied, tasty, fast, on time.  That is why tourists like the local service.  Instead of two weeks, many people spend here the whole month, or even a half.  The question of what to feed the child today never rises here. </p>

    <h2>  Animation </h2><p>  These are real professionals - the animation team at the LEXX Hotel.  They create a daily festive atmosphere for children: they hold master classes, engage children in developmental games, and also work in an outdoor activities club.  Kids up to five years old ride ponies, love to communicate with them and take care of them.  Then they dress up as pirates and travel on a real sea ship, it even happens that they abduct charming princesses of their age.  Such holidays are remembered for the rest of their lives and are subsequently remembered with extraordinary warmth. </p><p>  The school of cooks is constantly working, in which even the smallest children discover the talents of pizza or pastry chef.  And incendiary music at children's discos, competitions and concert programs not only carry away into the dance, but also broaden their horizons and replenish their knowledge.  The whole family can relax and have fun at the spa programs, and at the same time improve the body.  This is a very beautiful and exciting vacation.  Little ladies are delighted with the rituals when they, together with their mothers, are engaged in their own appearance in the spa.  Well-being becomes excellent, time spent with benefit, besides everyone has fun. </p><h2>  Types of outdoor activities </h2><p>  It is as if this region was specially created so that people appreciate the charm of outdoor activities.  Riding ATVs is a complete pleasure: there are mountains and fields, steppes and valleys, forests and ravines.  Impressions remain the most unforgettable.  Routes are individually - any complexity and range depends on experience.  You can come with your ATV, there is someone to take care of it: there is parking and workshops for maintenance. </p><p>  Ballooning in Koktebel is a special topic.  This is the cradle of gliding.  It was here that Sergei Korolev first knew heaven, it was here that all the first pilots were trained.  <span>Klementyev‚Äôs mountain,</span> the very famous one, is absolutely nearby, this is exactly what allowed the hotel to occupy guests with paragliding, hang gliding.  For this, the hotel has professional instructors.  Flying in a bright balloon is very popular.  The bravest are parachuting.  And how not to say about the underwater world of the Black Sea, how rich he is, how interesting!  This applies specifically to Koktebel, and precisely its bay.  Divers are trained in the hotel right from scratch, and advanced ones immerse themselves, but you can also attract instructors. </p><h2>  With and without motor </h2><p>  This is not a sport already, but a lifestyle - a bicycle.  Crimea provides simply ideal conditions for bike rides: the terrain is multilevel, suitable for everyone with any level of training.  And what a beautiful scenery!  This applies to motorsport to the same extent.  You can come with your own vehicles, there are always parking places.  Who comes light, can rent absolutely any unit.  On the water, too, the rest is wonderful. </p><p>  This region of the peninsula is full of places inaccessible, and this delights all yachting enthusiasts.  The club of active leisure at the hotel offers a boat rental for those who want to see the beauty of Crimea from the sea.  Vacationers with their own small boats can easily place them with the help of the hotel: the Yurkaffa center engaged in water-motor equipment is part of the spa hotel‚Äôs structure and will be happy to help with after-sales service. </p>

    <h2>  Go fishing or horseback? </h2><p>  Fishing seems to many people the main and best part of their life.  The leisure club has professionals who know exactly where the fish are found.  It organizes an unforgettable pastime - at least individually, at least for the company.  Not far from the hotel is the famous factory of vintage wines and cognacs.  Employees of the LEXX hotel for a healthy lifestyle, and most visitors also do not drink alcohol, but not to try the Golden Gate or Koktebel, and even after a successful fishing, is nonsense. </p><p>  Many charming corners of Crimea can only be visited on horseback, as for the most part they are mostly unavailable.  The horses in the hotel stable are well trained and will help you reach the most inaccessible places.  And the instructors will calculate the routes and give everything you need.  Club Hotel LEXX is always happy to please its guests! </p>
