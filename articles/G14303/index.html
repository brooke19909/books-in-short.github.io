And as it often happens, there is a lot of something unlike other Indian states.  Chic beaches, pleasant climate, calm and warm sea, picturesque nature, interesting cultural phenomena and culinary delights - these are just some of the reasons for the popularization of tourism in Goa. </p><p>  In terms of tourism, the state is divided into two areas: </p><p>  <em>1. South Goa</em> .  There are flat beaches, white or golden sand, warm sea, beautiful landscapes.  It is not as densely populated as other states of India.  And more like a "resort in the square."  In fact, this is an almost isolated piece of the Earth with a heap of expensive hotels, where only the wealthiest Indians, Americans and Europeans, lovers of a respectable, relaxing holiday, relax and have fun.  It‚Äôs such a unisex resort, where at the exit from a five-star hotel it‚Äôs not immediately possible to understand which country this hotel is located in. </p><p>  <em>2. North Goa.</em>  Yields to the southern brother in beauty and natural wealth.  The beaches here are not so beautiful: they mainly consist of sand of volcanic origin, it is a strange dirty gray color, it does not at all look like a golden beach "standard".  The entrance to the sea is often quite steep, the terrain is hilly, and cities and towns are often crowded with Hindus and original tourists who crave for existential impressed, young and not-so-young hippies and other fun fans of a free lifestyle.  Needless to say, that such tourists can appreciate all the delights of a holiday in the north of Goa.  Most people are immediately struck not by a special atmosphere, unforgettable energy, unlimited possibilities for finding themselves, but by poverty on the verge of poverty, unsanitary conditions and baseness of morals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose a hotel in Goa? </h2><p>  With the choice of hotels there are no problems.  In the area there are a lot of establishments of different price categories: from budget hostels and guesthouses to high-ranking luxury complexes with VIP services.  Those who believe in the prejudices associated with holidays in India should pay attention to hotels in the south of Goa, preferably chain hotels.  The concentration of inexpensive hotels and guesthouses in North Goa seems to be created for unpretentious and fun budget tourists.  When choosing a place to stay in the north of the state, you must first pay attention to the city.  Some villages in this region are suitable only for very specific categories of tourists.  The main administrative center of Mapusa - the most "Indian" of the cities of Goa - is very densely populated and not picky about cleanliness.  Anjuna and Calangute are real party Mecca.  Candolim and Sinquerim are a bit like resorts in the southern Goa region.  They are popular among foreigners, comfortable and not crowded, but, unlike the southern resorts, they are ready to accept non-pocket tourists. </p>

    <p>  Panjim is just a 20-minute drive away.  The city is very interesting, but not occupied by tourists.  Lovers of quiet but attractive sights, colorful settlements should go to it.  The most visited tourist sites are the Menezes Braganza Institute, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, the secretariat and the Church of <span>St. Lawrence.</span> </p><p>  Dabolim International Airport is 48 km away. </p><p>  The nearest large transport hub is the Tivim railway station, located only 18 km from the Goas Pearl 2 <span>*</span> hotel.  North Goa, Candolim in particular, is a very interesting place, relatively clean and safe, worthy of traveling and exploring it.  There are many good shops, restaurants and nightlife.  Natural beauty in the form of parks, tropical gardens with blooming lotus flowers and picturesque riverbanks attract more eager tourists for exotic than historical attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Orientation </h2><p>  Hotel Goas Pearl 2 <span>* is</span> focused mainly on young, dynamic budget tourists.  The hotel does not have a large territory, animation and other attractions that can keep a tourist in the hotel complex around the clock.  But at the same time, in Candolim the situation with cleanliness is not as critical as in some northern cities of Goa.  This is a fully developed, popular place for tourists.  It is especially popular among party-goers, lovers of trance music and young Indian majors.  So most hotels do not have a comprehensive range of services, but only offer accommodation, given that tourists will eat and have fun directly at the resort.  Very, very few will undertake to recommend this hotel and this resort for families with children, and all because of the specific cuisine, noise, remote beach and a very motley audience. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Hotel Goas Pearl 2 <span>*</span> features an outdoor swimming pool, umbrellas, sun loungers and a poolside bar. </p><p>  The complex has free car parking. </p><p>  <em>Free services:</em> </p><ul><li>  housekeeping; </li><li>  24-hour front desk </li><li>  wireless internet in the lobby; </li><li>  beach service (on request). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is the most common meal option ordered by guests of the Goas Pearl 2 * hotel.  India, North Goa - one of the most attractive gastronomic areas of Asia.  Naturally, tourists who come here want to try the culinary delights of spicy Indian cuisine, and they are not satisfied only with standard breakfasts, lunches and dinners at the hotel.  You can, of course, eat at the hotel in full board, but most of the guests rightly believe that this is sacrilege and a crime against their own taste buds.  Others believe that food experimentation in India is a very risky business.  Right, probably the first and second. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Goas Pearl 2 * (India), even by the standards of Goa, is a small hotel.  In it, as already mentioned, only 18 rooms.  The category is the same for everyone - ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù.  Area - 19-21 square meters  meter.  Maximum occupancy is 3 people. </p>

    <p>  Each room has: balcony, shower, toilet, air conditioning (for an additional fee), minibar, telephone, TV with satellite channels, kettle, set for making drinks, tea, coffee.  Rooms are cleaned daily, towels are changed every other day. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  It is worth noting that in Goa all the beaches are public.  Even the gates of the most pathos and expensive hotels adjoin public recreation areas.  The arrangement of the coast is mainly done by hotels or beach bars. </p><p>  Goas Pearl 2 <span>*</span> Hotel is the closest to Coco Beach (1.5 km) and Candolim Beach (3.5 km.) There is a promenade and a road between the guesthouse and the beach.  The hotel has a beach service.  There is no developed race schedule.  Service is available upon request. </p><p>  Umbrellas, sunbeds, towels on the beach are paid.  But often cafes and bars equip several areas with their own sunbeds and umbrellas for their customers.  So it‚Äôs easier to buy yourself a cocktail and settle down on the bar lounger than to pay for the same pleasure separately. </p>

    <p>  Among the evening and night entertainment in Goa, trans parties are leading.  In the north there are many clubs with trance music, a very psychedelic atmosphere and hippy color. </p><h2>  Goas Pearl 2 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Hotel reviews are an important source of information about hotels and holiday destinations for unprepared tourists.  Adequate comments by experienced travelers and tourism industry workers are especially valuable. </p><p>  The reviews about this hotel are very mixed.  Some tourists praise the hotel, while others criticize tirelessly.  Satisfied people note the low price of accommodation, good breakfasts, a very convenient location, free internet in the lobby, service to the beach.  Most travel agents advise making an adjustment to the fact that, among other budget hotels in the north of Goa, the Goas Pearl 2 <span>*</span> guesthouse clearly wins. </p><p>  The authors of negative reviews note that the pool is dirty, the rooms are very superficial, the towels are old, and the service is practically absent.  Also, stones of discontented tourists fly towards food: they write that the food is tasteless and not always fresh. </p><p>  Be that as it may, Goas Pearl 2 <span>*</span> is a very popular hotel, in the high season it is almost always filled with tourists, because it offers optimal conditions at such a low price. </p>
