    <h2>  Palmet Resort &amp; SPA Hotel 5 *: tourist comments </h2><p>  It is no secret that for many travelers one of the most important factors when choosing a hotel is the presence of positive comments from people who have already visited it.  Therefore, we decided to summarize a number of reviews of our compatriots who stayed during their holidays in the hotel complex "Palmet Resort &amp; SPA" in Kemer (Turkey). </p><p>  So, as for the rooms, then all the tourists agreed that they are decorated very well, and the furniture and sanitary ware in them are new and in good condition.  The rooms are spacious and bright, and the furnishings are new and stylish.  Bed linens were always fresh and clean.  Many note the excellent view from the window.  There were no complaints about cleaning the rooms, as it was carried out daily, and the minibar was always filled.  Bed linen was also changed regularly every day, and towels - as needed, so that they were always clean.  Toiletries (shampoos, soap, etc.) were regularly replenished.  At the same time, quite often the cleaners made various cute figures on the beds for the guests.  Moreover, as the guests noticed, the hotel staff pleased the guests in a similar way, regardless of whether they left a tip or not. </p><p>  The only thing that caused a number of complaints from our compatriots was the condition of the air conditioners in the rooms.  Often they worked weakly and could not cope with their function, and therefore the rooms were stuffy and excessively humid.  Therefore, guests had to complain about the reception and call the master.  According to many tourists, a five-star hotel should pay more attention to such things. </p><p>  The design of the Palmet Resort Hotel 5 * itself was appreciated by many travelers.  So, guests especially remembered the beautiful fountains, antique statues at the entrance, as well as an amphitheater decorated in the same style, where entertainment events took place in the evenings. </p><p>  However, a number of complaints from guests this year was caused by problems with checking into a hotel.  So, upon arrival at the Palmet Resort 5 * hotel, some of our compatriots were informed that, despite the paid reservation they had in their hands, there were no free rooms in the hotel complex.  Of course, tourists were not enthusiastic about such news.  However, to the credit of the hotel administration, it should be recognized that travelers for one night were also provided with accommodation in a good hotel.  The next day they were accommodated in booked rooms at Palmet Resort &amp; SPA.  They were also given a large basket of fruit and wine, as well as the possibility of using the safe in the room for free.  Nevertheless, this situation left an unpleasant impression on tourists, especially those who arrived on vacation with young children. </p><p>  Many guests were satisfied with the territory of the hotel complex Palmet Resort 5 *.  It is medium in size, very clean and green.  There are many great places for walking and photo shoots.  Also, most tourists appreciated the location of the hotel.  After all, the center of Kemer can be reached on foot in just 15 minutes, and near the hotel there are a lot of shops, shops, bars, nightclubs, etc. </p>

    <p>  An exceptionally favorable impression was also left by the staff of the Palmet Resort &amp; SPA hotel.  All the staff here are very friendly, helpful and quick.  In restaurants, waiters always worked very quickly: dirty dishes were removed from the tables almost instantly, and tablecloths were replaced with clean ones.  The bartenders also worked great.  The only minor drawback, some guests considered the fact that few of the staff understand the Russian language.  However, they all speak excellent English, therefore, remembering the elementary school curriculum, it is quite possible to explain. </p><p>  Tourists really liked the beach of the hotel Palmet Resort SPA 5 *.  It is quite wide and clean, there is a pier and a convenient entry into the water.  Despite the pebble beach, the pebbles are small, so there is no inconvenience.  Sun beds are new and comfortable.  Also, there is always a sufficient number of sun loungers and umbrellas for all hotel guests.  The sea is clear, azure, very warm and pleasant.  Tourists also noticed that several lifeguards are constantly on the beach, so you can not worry about your safety in the water. </p><p>  As for food at Palmet Resort &amp; SPA, here the opinions of vacationers diverged.

They also liked the fact that waiters and bartenders poured wine here from bottles, and cocktails are made exclusively from quality ingredients. </p><p>  Our other compatriots were dissatisfied with the choice of dishes.

Nevertheless, another part of tourists assures that throughout the day you could play boccia, volleyball, water polo and do aerobics.  In the evenings, on the territory of the hotel in the amphitheater various funny shows with funny contests and incendiary discos were regularly held. </p><p>  In general, most of our compatriots, who have ever spent their holidays in the hotel complex "Palmet Resort &amp; Spa", agreed that the hotel is good and quite consistent with its value.  Many of the tourists are ready to return here again as part of a new trip to Turkey and will advise the Palmet Resort Hotel 5 * to their friends and relatives. </p>
