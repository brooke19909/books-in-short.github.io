The story of a lake wandering from place to place seemed like a fabulous fiction for a long time, but such reservoirs actually exist. </p><h2>  History of the study of the lake </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century, the famous traveler N.M. Przhevalsky went on a new expedition to Central Asia.  His first trip to the Ussuri region was an exciting adventure that tempered the young explorer.  Expeditions to Central Asia were incredibly difficult, but the scientist steadfastly stood all the tests and kept records under the scorching sun and in the burning sands of the desert. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lobnor lake" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1279487.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  A new expedition went to where Lake Lobnor is located.  Today it is marked on a map in the southeastern part of the Tarim (Kashgar) plain, located in China. </p><h2>  Expedition difficulties </h2><p>  The lake, which few knew about at that time, was depicted on ancient maps by ancient geographers as early as the 7th century, and new information about it was missing.  This journey was accompanied by a suspicious attitude of the Chinese government to the Russian expedition.  With great difficulty, Przhevalsky received documents for a new study, but the authorities kept an eye on his actions and even interfered with him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shallow river </h2><p>  Having reached the Tarim River, which spilled into a huge but shallow lake, the travelers stopped.  Local residents gave it the name Kara-Buran, which translated means "Black Storm."  Often with strong winds, it overflowed its banks, flooding everything around. </p><p>  In the east, the river grew smaller until it completely disappeared from sight.  The traveler described his observations in this way: ‚ÄúComing out of Kara-Buran, Tarim decreases in size, as the desert in the neighborhood presses on it.  It absorbs all moisture with its burning breath. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is lobnor lake" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1279471.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  The river dies, but before it dies of its last strength, it spills over into a small lake, which in fact turned out to be a swamp, which has long been called Lobnor. " </p><h2>  Found lake </h2><p>  The purpose of the trip was achieved: the lake, which was mentioned by Chinese geographers, stretches for 100 kilometers.  Przhevalsky tried to cross it in length, but could not do it because of the thick reed that covers almost the entire water surface. </p><p>  The indigenous population said that 30 years ago, Lake Lobnor was distinguished by depth and lack of thickets.  But every year it grew with reeds, and the water, which had nowhere to go, overflowed the banks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Valuable material for science </h2><p>  Having carefully studied all the environs, the scientist has gathered enormous material of scientific value.  In the report, the researcher pointed out that the water in the lake itself is fresh, and near the coast it has a salty taste, as it dissolves the salts of the soil.  He compiled a detailed map on which he plotted the location of Lake Lobnor and the Tarim River. </p><p>  The material became a real sensation in the scientific world and was translated into different languages.  The description of the amazing reservoir has sunk into the soul of other researchers, including the German expert on China - Richthofen. </p><h2>  Scholars disagreement </h2><p>  He suggested that the Russian traveler was mistaken in describing Lake Lobnor.  The main reason for his doubts was the old maps on which the reservoir was marked elsewhere, much further from where the scientist found him.  The Germans were embarrassed by the statement of Przhevalsky about fresh water, because earlier it was believed that it should be salty. </p><p>  A Russian scientist pointed out errors in Chinese maps, noting their imperfection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riddle of lake lobnor" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1279466.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For a long time there was heated debate about who was right after all.  Several foreign expeditions were gathered in the wake of Przewalski‚Äôs journey to determine the winner.  The Russian explorer, along with his assistants, set off on a new path to the lake, which was haunting. </p><h2>  The riddle of Lake Lobnor </h2><p>  The successor to the scientist Kozlov turned out to be the same person who put an end to, resolving all disputes.  Examining the map made by Przhevalsky, he drew attention to the dried up river bed in the east, which the locals called sandy, and came to the conclusion that the map of the surroundings of Lobnor had been completely different earlier. </p><p>  Tarim, deprived of the source of water that once gave him life, fell into decay, which affected Lake Lobnor, which was disappearing before his eyes.  Surprisingly, with its drying, another reservoir was restored, which was exactly where the Chinese scientists depicted it.  It turns out that there were no losers in the dispute, each of the researchers was right in his own way. </p><p>  Lake Lobnor, displaced by 30 kilometers, turned out to be a very rare natural phenomenon, wandering from one place to another and obeying a river-changing riverbed. </p><h2>  Research continues </h2><p>  In 2014, a large-scale study by Chinese researchers of the missing lake began, which repeats the fate of the <span>Aral Sea.</span>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLobnor, the remains of an ancient civilization were discovered.  It is believed that the <span>Great Silk Road</span> passed along its shores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lobnor lake location" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1279467.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The roaming Lobnor Lake is of keen interest not only to Chinese experts, but also to scientists around the world trying to unravel the mysteries of the disappearance of the Loulan kingdom, which was located near a pond and turned into ruins.  And let's hope that new research will shed light on many of the mysteries of civilization. </p>
