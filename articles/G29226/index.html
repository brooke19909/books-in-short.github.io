    <h2>  Exile of Olympus </h2><p>  It was originally believed that the <span>Roman god</span> Saturn was the patron saint of farmers.  That is why on the first sculptures he is depicted either with a garden knife or with a grain sickle.  Some scholars believe that the first Roman king became the prototype of this deity.  However, they do not yet have strong evidence in favor of this theory. </p><p>  More importantly, over the years, the gods of Saturn began to be compared with Kronos.  And the reason for this was the close contact of Roman civilization with Greek culture and religion.  Therefore, it is not surprising that a new myth about their deity was soon born among the people. </p><p>  According to him, Saturn was indeed the great titan god Kronos.  Thrown from the throne by his son Zeus (Jupiter), he was forced to go into exile.  Leaving Greece, he wandered around the world for a long time, until he came across an amazing village called Lacia (Italy).  Saturn liked the land so much that he decided to stay in these parts forever. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Great sage and intercessor </h2><p>  Having settled in Italy, the god Saturn endowed this country with his patronage.  So, the Romans are sure that it was he who taught the first farmers to <span>cultivate fields</span> and sow wheat.  Because of this, farmers always offered him sacrifices in order to propitiate and appease the great god.  After all, the only way to count on a good harvest and protection from pests.  Over time, the god Saturn also became the patron saint of scientists and inventors.  They believed that it was this great sage who helped them to spin the wheel of progress. </p><p>  It is also curious that Saturn was endowed with the abilities of the ancient Greek god Chronos.  Perhaps the reason for this was the banal consonance of the names Kronos and Chronos, or perhaps the Romans deliberately magnified their intercessor.  Ultimately, the Roman people believed that the god Saturn led their country to a golden age.  Therefore, every year at the end of December, they held great festivities - Saturnalia.  During this period, the Romans gave each other gifts and wished happiness and prosperity. </p><p>  Moreover, on one of the days of the Saturnalia, slaves received freedom and could command their masters.  What is true, such joy lasted only one day, after which everything returned to normal. </p>

    <h2>  The great honor that the god of the planet Saturn received </h2><p>  Most of the gods of ancient civilizations irretrievably faded from the memory of mankind.  And even those who live in myths will sooner or later forget themselves.  However, a completely different fate awaited the Roman gods - their names became an invincible legend. </p><p>  So, in honor of the great god, one of the most beautiful planets in the solar system was named.  Belted on a magic belt, she will forever fix in the consciousness of descendants the name of the god Saturn.  And, looking into the endless cosmic distance, they will always remember him. </p>
