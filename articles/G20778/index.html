Pay attention to the most mysterious city in Italy - Turin, which was originally the first capital of the country of pizza and pasta.  Today, a huge number of cultural monuments protected by UNESCO, which are definitely worth seeing, have been preserved here.  Locals proudly call their locality "Italian Paris" and believe that it is no less romantic than the capital of France. </p><h2>  From Julius Caesar to the present </h2><p>  The first mention of one of the oldest cities in Italy - Turin - is found in literature dating back to the 25-30th years BC, it was then that the Roman emperor Gaius Julius Caesar ordered to establish a colony on the site of the modern settlement.  Originally it was called Augusta Taurinorum, all its streets were perpendicular to each other and straight, to some extent resembled a chessboard. </p><p>  Over the course of several centuries, the city constantly passed from one hand to another, in 1280 it became part of the Duchy of Savoy, and in the 16th century it received the status of the capital of this state.  Monuments of those times are still preserved in the village, you just need to visit its historical part to see the famous palaces of Valentino and the Palazzo Madama, the armory and various museums that managed to preserve a huge number of monuments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveladventureeverywhere.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turin hotels Italy" class="if uuid-2387650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387650.jpg"></div><p>  In general, one of the main reasons to personally visit Turin and Italy is the sights, photos and descriptions of which cannot reflect all the greatness of bygone eras.  In the XVIII and XIX centuries, the settlement was alternately in the power of Sardinia, Italy and France.  In 1861, Turin became the capital of the country, existing to this day, thanks to this, a huge number of industrial enterprises appeared in it.  In particular, we are talking about the famous concern producing Fiat cars; he began his work here in 1899. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beginning of the 20th century was marked by serious economic growth, Turin became a place of concentration of various labor movements.  In the period from 1943 to 1945.  he was in occupation, after which for a long time he restored his own architecture and production facilities.  Now it houses the leading metallurgical, chemical, automobile and confectionery enterprises in Italy, which you can also visit if you wish. </p><h2>  Must-see places </h2><p>  When traveling to Turin and Italy, the sights to see are best chosen in advance.  There are too many memorable places, and to get around them all, you may need a lot of time.  You should definitely visit the miraculously preserved royal residences, which are carefully protected by UNESCO.  Every day there are guided tours that allow you to plunge into the mystical atmosphere of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  A large village named Turin in Italy, whose sights were inspired by more than one generation of musicians, architects and writers, today is called the real capital of modern art.  There are a huge number of galleries and museums of postmodernism, all year round there are exhibitions gathering thousands of lovers of beauty, the Turin Film Festival, Luci d`Artista, SettembreMusica and many others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="notizie.comuni-italiani.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="italy turin" class="if uuid-2387644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387644.jpg"></div><p>  Not so long ago, a museum dedicated to oriental arts appeared in the city, as well as a museum in memory of the famous criminalist <span>Cesare Lombroso.</span>  Locals are actively interested in the past of their own country, so the number of cultural monuments and attractions here is constantly growing.  Today Turin lives a vibrant life that anyone can touch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Superior rest </h2><p>  Hotels in Turin and Italy in general are an example of first-class service, so you can count on a luxurious vacation at affordable prices.  When buying a tour, the hotel is automatically offered by representatives of travel companies, but when traveling, the "savage" will have to deal with it independently. </p><p>  In this unusual village there are a large number of mini-hotels, with 2-3 rooms that can be rented for a day for 4-5 thousand Russian rubles and get excellent service.  Do not such institutions inspire confidence in you?  Then look at the NH Collection Piazza Carlina - this hotel is located in the historic city center, just a 5-minute walk from the metro and train station.  The cost of a single room per day is about 7700 rubles. </p><p>  If the purpose of visiting Turin in Italy is the sights, the photos of which you intend to bring to all your friends and acquaintances, then you need to choose a hotel next to them.  For example, you can consider a hotel called Principi di Piemonte, from which you can get to the Egyptian Museum in five minutes.  However, the prices there are not cheap; a room for one person will cost about 8.5 thousand rubles per day. </p><p>  Is your trip business related?  Then a hotel called Santo Stefano is suitable for you, all the necessary conditions for negotiations are created here: comfortable conference rooms, an exquisite restaurant menu, spacious rooms with views of the old streets of the village.  The cost of single rooms here is from 6 thousand rubles per night. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Original viewing platform </h2><p>  Turin is a city in Italy, distinguished from all others by its unique style.  One of its most interesting buildings is the Mole Antonelliana, its height is about 160 meters, and there are no analogues in the village so far.  Initially, it was supposed to play the role of a synagogue, and the Jewish community acted as a sponsor of the construction.  However, after the community left the financing project, the completion of the work was carried out using the budget of local authorities.  The latter decided to devote the resulting house to the first ruler of a united Italy - King <span>Victor Emmanuel II.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turin italy sights" class="if uuid-2387645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387645.jpg"></div><p>  If the weather in Turin in Italy is sunny and warm, you can climb to the observation deck of the Mole Antonelliana, located at 88-meter height.  From it the whole city is visible at a glance, you can even see the distant highways leading to Rome and other settlements of the country.  In addition, a cinema museum is located in the building today, where you can study the entire history of the industry that is popular today for just 6.5 euros (460 rubles).  A separate ticket to the observation deck costs 4.5 euros (318 rubles), you can also purchase a single counter-lock, it will cost 8 euros (566 rubles). </p><h2>  central square </h2><p>  Today, Rome is called the heart of Italy, in Turin there is a local analogue, which is called Piazza Castello.  One of the local masters of architecture and urban planning - Ascanio Vitozzi - designed it in the 16th century with the expectation that it will become the main one in the whole city.  Historical events have led to the fact that there are simultaneously a number of buildings of the XVII century, used by the royal families - a palace, a theater and even a library, miraculously preserving the portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, which he painted himself. </p><p>  In the XIX century the Armory Chamber appeared here, which today is the repository of the largest number of relevant exhibits in Europe.  Four central city highways start from this square, be sure to walk along Garibaldi Street, it existed even under the Roman Empire and today is the longest pedestrian highway in the European Union. </p><h2>  Fortress Residence </h2><p>  On the central square of the city is the Palazzo Madama - a former princely residence with a rich past.  And if you chose the small city of Turin in Italy as a place of relaxation, you simply must bring a photo of this historic building home.  The main reason for this is that it was built before our era and protected the then Augusta Taurinorum from the attack of enemy troops.  The Middle Ages did not pass without a trace, the fortress underwent repair and expansion, after which it became a residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.museotorino.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turin italy attractions reviews" class="if uuid-2387646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387646.jpg"></div><p>  In the XVII century it was here that Maria Cristina of France lived - Queen Regent of Charles Emanuel II, at the same time the palace began to be called the Palazzo Madama.  Today in the residence is the Museum of Antiquity, where you can find the originals of works of art created in the Renaissance and the Middle Ages.  You can visit the cultural institution every day, except Monday, the cost of the entrance counter-fence will be 7.5 euros. </p><h2>  Holy Shroud Vault </h2><p>  It is pointless for religious and pious citizens of Russia to ask questions in the style of ‚ÄúWhat is Turin?  Where is it?  In Italy? ‚Äù, They will immediately answer you that this is the <span>Italian city</span> in which the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist is located.  The building itself was erected in the 15th century, and two centuries later a chapel appeared next to it, which houses the Shroud of Turin.  The Bible says that it was she who was covered with the body of Jesus Christ some time after the crucifixion. </p><p>  A large number of tourists and pilgrims visit the cathedral, so try to choose the most convenient and free time for going there, for example, Monday morning.  In 1997, a severe fire broke out in the chapel, damaging the building.  Fortunately, the shroud was saved, but the consequences caused by the fire are still eliminated by the restorers.  There is a museum at the church, the exhibits of which can tell a lot about the sacred arts, it can be visited for free. </p><h2>  Temple of the Science of Ancient Civilization </h2><p>  Turin is a city in Italy, possessing an unusual treasure of the human race - the Egyptian Museum.  It is here that you can learn absolutely everything about the civilization of the same name, because only this cultural institution in Europe specializes in the study of Egypt.  The founder of the collection was Carl Emmanuel III, who occupied the throne of the king of Sardinia at the beginning of the XVIII century, he adored the antiquities of that period and collected everything that belongs to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vocidicitta.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turin italy attractions photo and description" class="if uuid-2387647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387647.jpg"></div><p>  By 1830, the museum had collected more than 10 thousand exhibits, most of them were donated to Bernardino Drovetti, who represented Napoleon in Egypt.  At the end of the 19th century, the famous scientist Ernesto Schiaparelli, who often went on expeditions to territories that once belonged to the Egyptian state, became the head of the institution.  With its help, it was possible to significantly replenish the collection of objects, and on the current day their number is constantly increasing.  The museum is open every day, except Monday and Christmas - December 25, you can get there for only 7.5 euros (531 rubles). </p><h2>  Spirits of kings </h2><p>  The Basilica of Superga is a temple in Turin (Italy), the photo of which is not recommended.  Many local residents bypass him, and there is a reason - all the kings who have ever ruled in the city found their rest in him.  Even the construction of the temple is connected with mysticism - Vittorio Amedeo III in 1706 vowed the Virgin Mary to build a temple in her honor if she would help him in the fight against the French troops who had besieged Turin.  The enemy eventually retreated, so the king fulfilled his own promise. </p><p>  The temple was built in the Baroque style of the XVIII century, the famous Filippo Juvarra had a hand in its creation.  There are guided tours daily, the Superga Basilica is open from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., visitors can even go to a special crypt where noble persons of Piedmont and Turin are buried, including the organizer of the construction of the temple. </p><h2>  Secluded place for lovers </h2><p>  There is a point of view according to which it is France that is completely saturated with romance, namely Italy, and Turin is the capital of love and happiness.  Some couples in love even come to the local park and Valentino Castle, which were named after the church of St. Valentine, located a few blocks from them.  Until the beginning of the XVI century, the building played the role of a defensive fortress, and at the beginning of the XVII century it underwent a major overhaul, which was started by Christine of France, the lone widow of the Duke of Savoy.  There is a legend that the duchess constantly changed her lovers, throwing the unwanted into the well, and they wander here, preventing the living from building their fate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.torinofree.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turin city in Italy" class="if uuid-2387648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387648.jpg"></div><p>  However, lovers do not believe in this and willingly come here to rest from the most different parts of Italy.  Various presentations and other entertaining events are constantly held in the castle, so you can always see something interesting here.  The courtyard is paved with marble floors, and the building itself is built in the form of a horseshoe, which in the 16th century was an original design decision. </p><h2>  Looking for inspiration </h2><p>  Interested in Turin and Italy?  The reviews of those who have already been there can help determine which ones are worth a visit.  Refined Russians prefer to just wander around the streets of the city and enjoy the original architectural solutions, while glancing at the cafe with delicious local dishes.  Some go to Italy for shopping, but Turin in this sense is not very suitable for travel, since there are not so many branded stores, Milan or Rome are another matter. </p><p>  History buffs almost never leave Castello Square, however, the Palatine Gate, built in the 1st century BC, can move them from their place.  They are located near the Palazzo Reale and in ancient times played the role of an entrance to the fortress, but now they have lost their main function and serve as a meeting place for lovers and fans of antiquities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Turin Italy Photo" class="if uuid-2387649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15327/2387649.jpg"></div><p>  As for hotels and restaurants in Turin and Italy, the reviews of tourists about these institutions are purely positive.  In general, the quality of service here is at a high level, directors and administrators of institutions strictly monitor this.  Historically, up to a million people come to this city every year, and each of them should be satisfied - this is the main rule of local authorities. </p><p>  When buying a ticket, the tour operator will certainly offer you sightseeing tours of the city and its environs.  Do not rush to refuse, among them you can find really good options.  For example, a guided walk costs from 50 euros / 3,500 rubles per hour, and this amount is charged from the entire tourist group (up to 20 people).  Especially popular are excursions to the wineries with subsequent tasting of the product, as well as trips around the city on segways - small chariots.  There are a lot of attractions in Turin, so you can probably make up the most interesting route for yourself and bring photographs of historical places, souvenirs for loved ones and, of course, positive emotions from Italy. </p>
