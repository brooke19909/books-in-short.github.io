Indeed, the associations that this authority invokes are usually negative.  Meanwhile, the inspection can and should be contacted not only for the purpose of declaring their income, but also for receiving money.  <span>Social tax</span> deduction - that is appropriate for all who have incurred the cost of education, treatment, additional insurance and so on.  The following describes when it can be obtained, as well as what is required for this. </p><h4>  <span>Social</span> tax <span>deduction</span> for treatment </h4><p>  You can get it if you have received medical services for a fee: consultations with doctors, diagnostics, hospitalization, and so on.  The same applies to the purchase of medicines. </p>

This amount is standard for most deductions.

    <p>  An exception to this would be costly treatment.  You can get a deduction from it, the amount of which will be determined as 13% of the expenses incurred (in the event that the paid income tax overlaps or is equal to this amount).  The list of such services is determined by the government.  So, it includes some types of surgical interventions, therapeutic and combined treatment of various diseases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h4>  Social tax deduction for training </h4><p>  In this case, you can get compensation for training costs: </p><ul><li>  own; </li><li>  their children (brothers / sisters). </li></ul><p>  Tuition paid from own funds can be any (secondary, higher, courses). </p><p>  But if we are talking about children (brothers / sisters), then you can apply for a deduction only if education is obtained at the full-time department of a higher educational institution. </p>

The first category of such returns falls under general standards, in the second maximum is 50 thousand, that is, no more than 6.5 thousand rubles will be returned.  True, if education is not one, but several children, the deduction is due to everyone.

    <h4>  Other types of deductions </h4><p>  You can also receive part of the money spent if it was donated to charity.  The maximum amount of funds to be returned is calculated as 13% of a quarter of the income for the year. </p><p>  These expenses upon receipt of the deduction are not cumulative with those that were spent on training and treatment. </p><p>  <span>Pension</span> expenses also fall under items for which tax refunds are possible.  The maximum deduction amount in this case is also a standard value. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h4>  Tax deduction </h4><p>  The documents that must be submitted for a refund vary depending on the type of expenses incurred.

However, having spent 100,000 per year on treatment and the same amount on education, you can still return no more than this amount.  The exception is those cases when the tuition was paid not for their own, but for the child (brother, sister), spending on charity and expensive treatment.  Expenses under these items are considered separately.

    <p>  Obtaining a tax deduction takes up to four months from the date of filing. </p><p>  As for the queues and paperwork, it is worth noting that the ongoing modernization of the <span>tax service is</span> bearing fruit: many metropolitan inspections have organized an electronic queue and the number of employees receiving documents has been increased.  Moreover, citizens have the opportunity to make an appointment. </p><p>  Filling out a declaration for the first time is likely to raise a ton of questions.  You can greatly simplify your task if you download a special program that allows you to do this while sitting at home (you will have to enter much less data, but at the same time you will be able to avoid mistakes).  You can contact the inspector for help.  And of course, it would be nice to study a sample of the completed declaration, which can be found in each district tax service. </p><p>  In any case, it is better to overcome yourself and do it, because the tax social deduction can be received not once, but many times. </p>
