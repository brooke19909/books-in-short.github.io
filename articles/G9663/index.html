One of these places is Vatsi, <span>a recreation center</span> located in the heart of Russian nature, in the Novgorod region. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The recreation center "Vattsy" (Valdai - the city near which it is located) opened relatively recently, in 2004.  Located in a village from which it took its name.  Although the village is very small, about 30 yards, it is very cozy and remote from the bustle of the city.  The base is located 12 km from the city of Valdai (or rather, its center) of the Novgorod region, almost in the thick of the forest. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that there are two lakes in the place where the asphalt and the village road end.  These are lakes Middle and Patrushikha. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As such, there are no rooms at this <span>recreation center</span> "Vattsy" (Valdai is located near it).  But the choice of wooden houses is huge.  Moreover, you can pre-book it without prior payment. </p><p>  They are located in two different parts of the village (the parts are 900 km distant from each other): the far and near territories. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity there are two cottages and a house, a cafe and a sports ground.  In addition, guests have the opportunity to go to the pier and visit the stable.  At the far cottage there are three cozy houses, as well as a bathhouse (open for guests to visit). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cottages are located (one of them is allowed to check in with animals) almost on the lake, across the road.  However, traffic along it is deadlock and practically absent, but it is quite possible to drive to the house by your own transport without hindrance. </p>

    <p>  The houses are exclusively double, in some of them there is the possibility of arranging additional space.  The cottage accommodates up to 7 people.  In winter, the rooms are heated.  For use, guests are provided with a microwave, refrigerator and barbecue facilities (located on the street).  Also there are showers, a toilet and, of course, towels and a hairdryer. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there is practically no distance between some houses, they all have good sound insulation, the windows look in different directions, and the verandas of each of them overlook one of the lakes. </p>

    <p>  For relaxation, guests are provided with a bathhouse, a beach (where you can fish), a barbecue and a gazebo, as well as a home zoo (here you can "chat" with chickens, rabbits, goats, piglets).  In addition, hunting lovers will like it here. </p><p>  Athletes will also have something to do: volleyball, table tennis, billiards and even paintball.  In addition, Vatsi is a recreation center where you can rent skis, a bicycle, a boat, a catamaran and even ride horses. </p><p>  Not far from the recreation center "Vatsy" there are various attractions that you can visit if you wish: </p><ul><li>  Iversky Svyatoozersky Monastery, which is located in Valdai itself; </li><li>  Museum of Bells. </li></ul><p>  The only drawback that the Vatsi recreation center has (reviews say this, although in some cases this is a definite advantage) is the almost complete absence of any connection, including wi-fi. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  Cancel <strong> </strong>  Leisure center management provides the opportunity to book rooms at no extra charge.  Cancellation conditions are indicated upon confirmation of the reservation. </p><p>  Accommodation for children.  Children under the age of 3 years stay free of charge without a separate bed. </p><p>  Special conditions.  Guests of the base are given the opportunity to stay with dogs in some of the houses.  The service is paid.  The price depends on the breed and size of the animal. </p><h2>  How to get from Moscow and St. Petersburg? </h2><p>  Vattsy is <span>a recreation center</span> that can be reached both by train and by car.  In the first case, you need to catch the train from Moscow-Pskov (this train leaves from the Leningradsky railway station) and get to Valday station. </p><p>  Buses run from St. Petersburg to this city, directly to Valdai. </p><p>  If you get to this place by car, you need to move along <span>the Moscow-St. Petersburg (E105) highway</span> and turn near the traffic police post on Dolgie Brody (from Moscow through 396 km, from St. Petersburg - 304 km). </p>
