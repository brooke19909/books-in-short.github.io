What beaches are worth visiting here?  What are their features?  Consider the rating of the best beaches in Alupka (with photo) below. </p><h2>  General features of the beaches </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka beaches" class="if uuid-2446204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446204.jpg"></div><p>  When planning your vacation in this resort town, you should have some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe local beaches.  First of all, you should pay attention to the fact that in the total number of sand and pebble areas for recreation there are both natural and artificial.  In reviews of the beaches of Alupka, one can often find recommendations that it is best to give preference to those that are considered artificial.  Such beaches (according to tourists) are the cleanest, as they are private, as a rule belong to sanatoriums and boarding houses.  You need to choose a place to stay, based solely on your needs.  The beaches of Alupka (Crimea) are clearly delineated among themselves among children‚Äôs, wild, nudist, urban, etc. Therefore, you won‚Äôt have to decide for a long time. </p><p>  If you plan to drive to the beach with your own car, it is best to foresee in which place you can leave it. There are a considerable number of sites in the city, to which both guarded and unguarded parking lots adjoin.  This mainly concerns private beaches, which are paid for. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rating of the best beaches of the city was compiled by popularity among local residents and tourists.  The first five leading positions in it are occupied by such vacation spots as the Vorontsov baths, the Frog, the Cote d'Azur, Three stones and that beach that belongs to the Green Cape boarding house. </p><h2>  Children </h2><p>  It is better to visit this place to everyone who arranges a family vacation on the coast of the resort town with young children.  This is due to the fact that there is a small depth of water, and its temperature is kept at an optimal level for a very long time, which is associated with the shallow water inherent in this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krym.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's beach in Alupka" class="if uuid-2448248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2448248.jpg"></div><p>  The Children's Beach in Alupka is located in a very quiet and peaceful place, which is a small lagoon where cold winds do not reach.  Its territory is visually divided into two equal parts, this is done due to a small concrete path. </p><p>  The entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis beach is covered with small pebbles, so for a stay here it is best to get special slippers in advance. </p><p>  Tourists in their reviews note that the infrastructure on the beach is simply well developed.  For a comfortable stay, there is a rental of sun loungers and umbrellas.  In addition, guests can always use the free toilets, showers, and locker rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Visiting this place is completely free.  There is a beach on the Alupkinskoye highway. </p><h2>  Vorontsov baths </h2><p>  In any ranking of the best beaches in Alupka, a special place is occupied by the Vorontsov baths.  This place is located almost 1.5 kilometers from the city center, not far from the <span>Vorontsov Palace,</span> hence the name.  You can get to this recreation site both through Primorsky lane and along the Vorontsov highway (along the descent). </p><div class="photo" data-original="alypka.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Alupka Crimea" class="if uuid-2446208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446208.jpg"></div><p>  As for the features and accommodation on the beach, tourists note that it is completely covered with pebbles of small size - it is quite smooth and pleasant, but still if you are visiting the beach with a child it is best to grab slippers for him.  None of the tourists and local residents recommend diving here, since there are a considerable number of large stones at the bottom of the sea that can damage something. </p><p>  The beach infrastructure is quite well developed, although all the amenities here are represented only by changing rooms, toilets and showers for vacationers.  In addition, here you can find a considerable number of cafes, bars and souvenir shops. </p><h2>  Cote d'Azur </h2><p>  In the ranking of the most popular beaches in Alupka, the <span>Cote d'Azur</span> is far from the last place.  This beach is famous for its beauty, as well as cleanliness and well-developed infrastructure in the form of a large number of amenities and entertainment places for vacationers.

Within walking distance from here is a city water park, to which guests come not only from all over the city, but also from nearby settlements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="travels-ua.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cote d'Azur Beach in Alupka" class="if uuid-2446217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446217.jpg"></div><p>  Relaxing on this Alupka beach, you can rent a small deck chair and umbrella.  Such a service is provided for a fee at a special rental point. </p><p>  As for security conditions, the coast along that beach is quite gentle and clean, which allows you to be here with children without fear. </p><h2>  Frog </h2><p>  Special attention of local residents and tourists is attracted by the Frog Beach.  In Alupka, it is considered one of the best, due to the presence of a large number of favorable conditions for recreation for the whole family.  This recreation area got such an interesting name as a result of the fact that there is a huge stone on its shore that resembles a frog in shape.  Its height is about ten meters. </p><p>  Tourists talk about the fact that it is advisable to rent a deck chair.  Such recommendations are related to the fact that the coast of the beach is completely covered with pebbles, which in some places is quite large.  Lying on it is not very convenient.  The rental service of sun loungers, umbrellas and mattresses is provided at a special point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alypka.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka beaches reviews" class="if uuid-2446199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446199.jpg"></div><p>  On the coast of this Alupka beach there is a wide selection of water activities, among which there are extreme ones. </p><h2>  From the sanatorium "South Coast" </h2><p>  Widespread among tourists who prefer to spend their summer holidays in Alupka, enjoys the beach, which belongs to the resort "South Coast".  It is located almost in the central part of the city.  The resort is located in a rather lively area.  This is partly due to the popularity of this place. </p><p>  Visitors to the beach can take advantage of some of the amenities of this resort: take a walk along its green alleys, sit in a cafe or simply enjoy the beautiful nature and fresh air. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.408645859878604" data-lng="34.036754240661594" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/2/1/2921.png"></div><p>  The beach area is covered with small pebbles.  There is a well-developed infrastructure.  This beach is located on Lenin Street, the entrance to it is free for all vacationers, and not just for guests of the sanatorium mentioned above. </p><h2>  Wild </h2><p>  The famous Wild Beach is also one of the most popular holiday destinations throughout Alupka.  It is located in the city, but one and a half kilometers from the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alupka beaches photo" class="if uuid-2446205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446205.jpg"></div><p>  As practice shows, this place especially attracts younger representatives of the population.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that this particular group of tourists prefers to learn something new and unusual, to learn interesting things.  All this is on the wild beach. </p><p>  Travelers who have been here talk about the beautiful wildlife, traditional for these places, as well as steep, but clean beaches.  The coast of this beach is completely covered with pebbles, the infrastructure here is poorly developed.  Perhaps this is why attendance in this area is not very high, but there are a huge number of fans of this beach. </p><h2>  Three stones </h2><p>  This is another wild beach in Alupka, which is very famous both among the local population and among visiting tourists.  In their reviews, they talk about the fact that here you can truly relax, feel complete unity with nature.  Some tourists prefer to call this place not even a beach, but simply a rocky site, which is harmoniously located between the Vorontsov baths and the Aivazovsky rock. </p><p>  This place is recognized as a wild beach, but the infrastructure is not so poorly developed.  Guests can please themselves with refreshments, which are offered in the cafe, delicious snacks.  Fans of dangerous sports can also enjoy water skiing or jet skiing. </p><p>  For the convenience of vacationers, cabins with toilets and showers, locker rooms are arranged here.  These are all amenities, but they are quite enough. </p><h2>  Black mound </h2><p>  Some tourists find this place quite unique.  According to vacationers, this Alupka beach in its appearance resembles a vacation spot, which is somehow ennobled by human hands to create a minimum level of comfort for tourists. </p><p>  Black hillock is <span>a beach</span> that is small in size.  It occupies only the space that is surrounded by high hills.  On one side it is covered by a high rock. </p><p>  Many tourists say that the nature in this place is very beautiful, but getting here is quite difficult.  Not a single public transport can be accessed to the Black hillock, that is, in any case, you need to walk a long distance.  That is why most vacationers do not recommend this beach for those families who relax with a child.  Getting to this point with him will be very problematic.  Such a long way is not worth the fatigue, for a vacation with a baby it is better to choose beaches that are located within the city limits, which are easily accessible on foot or by public transport. </p><h2>  Green cape </h2><p>  This beach area belongs to one of the most famous <span>resorts of the resort</span> town - "Cape Verde".  Therefore, the beach has such a name.  As indicated in the reviews of tourists who have been here, Cape Verde (Alupka) is a place created by human hands.  It was made at the very foot of the rocks (having previously erased part of them), strewn with fine and soft sand, and in some places with pebbles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travels-ua.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach Cape Verde Alupka" class="if uuid-2446220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2446220.jpg"></div><p>  As for infrastructure, this place in this plan is provided just fine.  There is a point for the delivery of sunbeds, umbrellas and towels.  You can take them for a small fee, which is set differently each year.  Tourists say that on this recreation site is constantly maintained perfect cleanliness, which cannot but please visitors and locals. </p><p>  From the beach you can very easily get to the pension of the same name.  To do this, just go along the narrow paths that lead through the cliffs. </p>
