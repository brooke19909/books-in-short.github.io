  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sum insured. Definition, types</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When we are offered to insure ourselves, our life or our property from all sorts of troubles and troubles, we somehow don‚Äôt think about it, answering: ‚ÄúWhat can happen to me?‚Äù  However, as practice shows, much can happen: an accident, an earthquake, an <span>industrial injury,</span> you can list endlessly.  Today, mass insurance contracts are concluded only for cars, and that is because such insurance is mandatory. </p><p>  By concluding an agreement with an insurance company, an individual, in the event of an insurance situation, has the right to receive monetary compensation.  Otherwise, it is called - the insured amount.  However, no matter how obvious the occurrence of the insured event, most companies try in every possible way to avoid <span>compensation payments to the</span> victim.  For example, referring to the fact that there are no necessary documents, or they are incorrectly drawn up and filled out.  Therefore, in order to prove your right to insurance, you always need to have a list of documents necessary for this, and in which case, record the smallest details of the incident.  If this is an accident, then it is imperative to draw up a protocol strictly according to the rules and ensure that the inspector of the traffic police fills in all documents to the letter.  If an accident happened, it is best to confirm this fact not only with documents, but also with photo and video, the benefit is that now cameras are even built into the most ‚Äúancient‚Äù mobile phones, and everyone has this device.  It is also important to comply with all deadlines for submitting an application, paying receipts, etc.  The necessary documents must be photocopied in several copies, one of which must be given to the insurance company against receipt.  And, most importantly, do not rush to repair until the entire sum insured has been paid. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the reason for recovering compensation from the company is <span>an accident</span> due to bodily harm or death, then a medical certificate and examination is necessary.  Without these documents, the sum insured is unlikely to be paid.  If the company refused to pay compensation, it is imperative to demand that the refusal be made in writing.  In the future, this can make your life much easier.  After all, it may turn out that the case reaches the court, and there each paper has its own weight. </p><p>  It is important to know that there is an insurance sum of two main types: aggregate and non-aggregate.  In general, there are many varieties of insurance coverage.  So, for example, it can vary by <span>insurance object</span> or event, it can be decreasing or increasing, floating or standard, etc.  What is their difference?  To navigate in these concepts, it is enough to remember that the aggregate insurance amount is reduced.  A non-aggregate - irreducible. </p><p>  When <span>concluding a contract,</span> it is important to pay attention to how much is indicated in it.  If the contract is concluded with the condition that the insurance payment is called non-aggregate, then this means that even if several insured events occur to you during the year, the company will be required to make payments several times, while their amount will not decrease.  In the case of the aggregate insurance amount, its amount will be reduced during the year in each subsequent insurance event by the amount of the previous one.  In this regard, it is necessary to count on the possible number of insured events, since the conclusion of a contract that states a non-aggregate insurance amount will cost an average of 5-10% more, but such an agreement gives a guarantee that at one fine moment for the consequences of an accident will have to pay money from your pocket.  In any case, the client of the insurance company always has a choice which contract to conclude, and the <span>insurance agent</span> does not have the right to impose his terms. </p>
