They are a symbol of this country, and there is no such person who would not hear about these lovely creatures.  And in Suomi itself they are so loved that they even created a park of the same name.  Now it is one of the main attractions.  Moomin Park is a country in which every visitor can plunge into the world of childhood. </p><h2>  The world created by Tove Jansson </h2><p>  These cute creatures, similar to hippos, were invented by the Finnish writer Tove Jansson.  Their story began in 1945, when she painted a funny hippo for her younger brother.  Then he will become the most famous character in Finnish literature. </p><p>  And the Pellinki island inspired the writer to create the Moomin World, where the Jansson family rested for several months a year.  This place is very cozy, a house surrounded by forest, the sea - all this inspired Tove Jansson.  Then the fairy tale grew into a series of books about good, cozy creatures that filmed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.awn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fairytale character Moomin" class="if uuid-3212749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3212749.jpg"></div><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The Moomin Park in Naantali is located, but not in the town itself, but nearby.  This is one of the best entertainment for children around the world.  In 2005, it was included in the list of 10 best theme parks.  For the Moomin Park in Finland, even a separate island was allocated, on which the fairy world was placed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Its visitors can not only see the real good hippos, but also visit familiar places from the book.  There is a blue Moomin house, where you can climb to the Moomin attic and go down to the Moomin basement, which stores the most delicious jam.  Hemul‚Äôs house and the Moomin‚Äôs dad‚Äôs boot are nearby. </p><p>  Be sure to go to the performance of Emma's summer theater.  But if visitors manage to see the Moomin who plays hide and seek with Sniff and Little Mu, they need to play with them.  In this fabulous place, everyone can find entertainment. </p><p>  In the park, every corner tells about the life of the good little hippos.  In the valley, visitors everywhere meet the Moomin trolls, who happily show and tell everything.  Especially interesting inside the famous Moomin house.  There you can explore every corner.  Of course, it will be especially interesting in the cozy kitchen of Mumi-mom. </p><p>  It is especially pleasant to walk around the park in the warm season, because it is then that Snusmumrik returns.  At the lake, he sets up a tent and fish.  Not only children, but also adults do not want to leave the park.  After all, there it is so fabulous, cozy that I want to stay longer at the Moomin trolls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picsbud.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="domi moomin" class="if uuid-3212747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/3212747.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In the Moomin Park in Finland, visitors can find a map guide to the fairy world.

Emma's Theater is located right at the entrance to the park. </li><li>  Police station - there is the Moomin police chief who is guarding the bully Haysuli (Stinki).  It is periodically brought about by the inhabitants of the island there. </li><li>  Hemulen's House - there visitors can see a collection of Finnish plants and butterflies.  Located near the pier.
