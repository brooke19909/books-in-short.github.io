    <h2>  The best park in the world </h2><p>  Tanzania, whose sights are famous all over the world, is famous for its national park - Serengeti.  It is located in the northern part of the country and is considered one of the best nature reserves on Earth.  The name of the park comes from a certain Masai word, which in translation sounds like “an extended platform”.  In 1951, an area of ​​14763 km <sup>2</sup> was allocated for the foundation of the Serengeti. </p><p>  Many Englishmen actively participated in the extermination of African fauna, because hunting for a large wild animal was a fairly popular pastime.  The first people to pay attention to the ecology of Africa were the British colonial authorities of the United Republic of Tanzania.  Trying to solve this issue, they created a national park and its attractions.  Tanzania today is known primarily as the territory in which there is a magnificent park.  Several million heads of large animals graze on its expanses, not taking into account the countless number of birds and small animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanzania attractions" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1263874.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is not only the <span>highest mountain of the</span> continent, but also one of the largest volcanoes in the world.  The mountain range covers an area of ​​approximately 388,500 hectares.  Whenever they talk about this attraction, it is mainly about its two main peaks - Mawenzi and Kibo.  But actually Kilimanjaro is a three-headed mountain.  The third peak is known as a ridge called the Shira, and it is the smallest peak of the mountain.  It is a mountain range destroyed during an eruption. </p><p>  Between the western slopes of Kilimanjaro and the ridge of the Shire, the Shira plateau extends.  It represents the most intriguing feature of an entire attraction.  The plateau reaches 6,200 hectares.  Scientists suggest that the plateau is a collapsed crater of the first volcano filled with lava from eruptions of a later period. </p><p>  Also on Mount Kilimanjaro there is Lake Chala, the existence of which is known to few tourists.  Kilimanjaro is the attraction that is worth visiting Tanzania for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanzania what to see" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1263873.jpg" width="600"></div>

Attractions near <span>Lake Victoria</span> and the pond itself is another place worth visiting.  Victoria is the second largest <span>freshwater lake</span> on Earth <span>.</span>  Its northern coast crosses the Equator.  The attraction was opened in 1858 by the traveler John Henning Speke. </p><p>  Many different islands are scattered around the lake, which have become a haven for birds.  And around the lake there are many famous reserves and national parks of the continent.  The most interesting among them is the national park on the island of Rubondo.  Almost four hundred different species of birds live here. </p><p>  Visiting Lake Victoria is best from June to September. </p><h2>  Park with wild animals </h2><p>  Tanzania (sights, photos of which can be considered in our article are numerous) is famous for another beautiful park - Arusha.  This is real Eden for the animals and birds that settled in it.  The reserve is conditionally divided into three zones that are not alike.  <span>This is the</span> Ngurdoto <span>crater</span> , covered with lush vegetation;  Momela lakes, giving off different shades;  <span>Meru mountains,</span> representing icy and cold cliffs. </p><p>  Only in Arusha park can one observe zebras flying through pastures and leopards hiding near waterfalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tanzania Attractions Photos" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1263872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The birthplace of chimpanzees </h2><p>  Many beautiful places rich in Tanzania.  What to see here is worth it in the first place, you won’t immediately say.  But what you should not miss is a visit to the Gombe Stream Park.  This is the smallest national park in the country, which is the birthplace of chimpanzees.  It is located in the mountains near <span>Lake Tanganyika.</span>  During the day, monkeys slowly drink water from it, and at night the pond is ignited by hundreds of lights. </p><p>  Here you can meet world-famous chimpanzee communities that were discovered by pioneer researchers from Britain. </p><p>  Observations of these animals confirmed the fact that they are much like people: their characters, behavior in different settings, distribution of responsibilities within the community - all this reminds of human life and way of life. </p><p>  In Gombe Stream, you can meet the most famous varieties of chimpanzees, ranging from red-tailed to blue. </p>
