Reviews</span> about such a popular device are sometimes very skeptical.  Next, we state all the information based on objective reviews from customers and critics. </p><p>  The owners of the "apple" technology have long been accustomed to the fact that the company produces every year an improved modification of the next model.  In this case, we are talking about the iPhone 6 / 6S / 6S +. </p><p>  The differences between the original model and the advanced S are small.  Therefore, we will not talk about them as separate phones with fundamental differences.  About the plus version a bit later. </p><p>  The presentation of the new <span>iPhone model,</span> like any other special news from the American manufacturer, was loud.  At the end of the show, the Model S was presented with a full overview of its characteristics, a discussion of the benefits and technologies introduced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pros and cons of iphone 6" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947742.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The release of the smartphone markedly surprised buyers.  The design remains the same.  It is practically no different from the predecessor of iPhone 6. The inserts were made of ceramic-metal material, and the camera stands out slightly from the case. </p><p>  Particularly attentive owners would be able to notice that the screen received a +1 millimeter.  The manufacturer associates this nuance with the introduction of 3d Touch technology.  Like many modern devices, a smartphone is convenient and pleasant to hold in your hand, use it.  It is as thin and light as possible.  It looks modern and solid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case is made of aluminum, which is better known in the 7000 series. Thanks to this, the device has a positive side: a high level of strength.  If you put it under a heavy object, sit on it or try to bend it, then everything will be fine with a smartphone.  Vulnerabilities exist, but they are low. </p><p>  But still I want to emphasize specifically for the owners of any expensive smartphone - you should not check the device for strength, and you should also avoid wearing the device in the back pocket of pants or trousers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6 Owner Reviews Pros and Cons" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947743.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen and new technologies </h2><p>  If we talk about changes and one more pluses of the device, it should be noted the introduction of 3d Touch technology in the iPhone 6S.  It has become quite significant, so many have become interested in the modification.  Any owner of the "apple" 5S will be able to notice a clearly distinguished difference when replacing the phone with the above. </p><p>  Thanks to this technology, users will be able to notice a huge list of functions that are now available for use.  They are especially noticeable when working with various files and utilities.  The screen is able to distinguish the force of pressing and with sufficient pressure opens a special (additional) menu.  An analogue of such a function should be called management under the Windows operating system.  In order to open the context menu, you need to click on the right mouse button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After a while, a large number of tests will appear in which you can experience 3D Touch technology.  It should be noted that even though the manufacturer has conducted several experiments, no one can do this better than buyers.  Also, all application developers who work on a smartphone will have to slightly adjust their applications for the described technology. </p><p>  The screen of the iPhone 6S has a low screen resolution (a serious minus), when compared with its competitors.  But, nevertheless, it is considered beautiful and clear.  Amazing owners and excellent color scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 pros and cons reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947744.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Many buyers have repeatedly said that the manufacturer should think about increasing the megapixels of the cameras used in iPhones. </p><p>  In the 6S, this has finally been introduced.  The developer used a 12 megapixel matrix, so the quality of the resulting images has become many times more.  Of course, when compared with the flagships from Samsung or Sony, which work with 16 megapixel and 23 megapixel sensors, this figure is quite low, but buyers are happy with at least such a response from the manufacturer.  Using the camera of the iPhone 6S, you can notice that the pictures are taken at high speed and with the best possible image clarity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One minus the company has not fixed.  Many buyers complained that they had to slide their finger up and down to change the exposure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6s Pros and Cons" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947745.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Live photo </h2><p>  Of course, this feature should be noted as a bold "plus" of this phone.  Thanks to her, you can make cinematic pictures / videos.  This function does not work in automatic mode.  If desired, it can be easily disabled or re-activated. </p><p>  But you need to remember that when using Live Photo, the memory on the device is consumed unrealistically quickly.  The front camera works with a 5 megapixel sensor, the quality of photos is the same as in the previous version.  She also got a flash. </p><h2>  Chipset and memory </h2><p>  Creating new versions of devices, Apple is taking tangible steps in creating and using various processors.  How successful the chipset is can be understood when working with the launch of programs and resource-intensive games. </p><p>  If you compare this modification with other devices, you need to notice a fairly strong breakthrough in power and performance.  The architecture is 64-bit, so you can even use heavy games with maximum convenience.  However, this plus has its own fly in the ointment.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not install the recommended 4 GB of RAM to reveal the full functionality and proper operation of the system. </p><p>  But 2 GB is enough for smooth operation, switching between windows and simultaneously opening several applications and games at once. </p><p>  It should be noted that during the presentation, the manufacturer did not say anything about the battery of the device.  Power consumption has clearly been increased and if the smartphone works with the same battery, then it will be discharged many times faster. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cons restored iPhone 6 plus" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947746.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Considering the pros and cons of the device, unfortunately, the price can not be clearly entered into one or the second list.  For everyone, value will play a different role.  Therefore, in what list should this nuance be attributed to the reader.  Cons and pros of iPhone 6 in the reviews of the owners are always supported by pricing. </p><p>  In Europe, this phone will cost 200 (iPhone 6S model) and 300 (iPhone 6S Plus model) dollars.  This cost will be relevant if a person, along with the purchase, concludes a 2-year contract with a mobile network operator. </p><p>  In the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the device is sold for at least $ 700. </p><h2>  The pros and cons of the iPhone 6 </h2><p>  It is necessary to summarize all the data obtained in order to provide a specific list of minuses and pluses.  What are they like? </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  large screen; </li><li>  the display is distinct and high quality; </li><li>  the speed of LTE and Wi-Fi networks is much better than in previous models; </li><li>  increased internal storage.  Three modifications are available: 16, 64 and 124 GB. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the battery remains at the level of iPhone 5; </li><li>  optical stabilization at a low level, many buyers lack it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="comparative analysis of iPhone 6s" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947747.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Pros and Cons of iPhone 6 S </h2><p>  It is impossible to say that the 6S model is very different from the usual (authentic) smartphone model.  But still it has its advantages.  In addition to the above, it is necessary to additionally note others. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Performance at the highest level. </li><li>  Compared with the iPhone 6, the case has become noticeably better. </li><li>  The camera now works with 12 megapixels. </li><li>  The screen will receive an innovative 3D Touch option. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The manufacturer did not say a word about the battery power. </li><li>  The camera, although it has become better, but it is much worse than that of competitors. </li></ul><h2>  Positive aspects of the 6 Plus modification </h2><p>  The autonomy of the device is much improved.  Users claim that it increased by 50-75% compared with the sixth iPhone.  Charging will be enough even with heavy use until the end of the day.  This is clearly the new <span>iPhone 6 Plus.</span>  <span>Plus</span> (specifically this one) is liked by everyone without exception. </p><p>  The camera got a lot of better specs.  Reduced noise due to the stabilization of the optics.  Although it does not help much when shooting outdoors, it does well in rooms. </p><p>  The device can be used in portrait orientation, so the text is typed as quickly as possible, conveniently and with few errors. </p><p>  The screen and its size inspired every customer.  It perfectly shows itself when reading books and viewing photos, pages in a browser. </p><p>  Above, we described the pros.  The cons of the iPhone 6 S Plus are described below. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the 6 Plus modification </h2><p>  If we take into account in the past the long-term use of most of the owners of the phone of the original version, this phone has no particular minuses.  The only drawback, rather, is the physical size.  The phone hardly fits in your pockets, it takes up a lot of space.  Putting it on and out of your pants is uncomfortable.  Many buyers note that initially this problem does not seem serious.  However, after several months, they notice a habit that they never had before: when they sit down, they immediately lay the device on the table.  In general, the discontent lies in the fact that even just walking with such a phone in your pants pocket is inconvenient. </p><p>  The downsides of the <span>restored iPhone 6</span> plus should be obvious.  Sometimes wireless modules do not work, the system slows down. </p><h2>  Differences between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ </h2><p>  The differences between these phones are small but serious.  The original model has a 4.7-inch display.  The screen resolution is 1344 by 750 pixels.  In the modification "Plus" this figure is increased.  Display - 5.5 inches, 1920 √ó 1080 pixels.  Moreover, optical stabilization is built-in, which the owners of the usual "six" so dreamed about.  You can use a large number of tabs in a horizontal application, just like on an iPad.  As the owners report in their reviews, the minuses and advantages of the iPhone 6 and 6+ are in many cases identical. </p><p>  The logic of the manufacturer for a long time revolved around the assertion that a small screen facilitates the use of the device.  However, the owners were confused by the size of 5S, since due to the small display it is difficult to use many functions.  Now this problem has almost disappeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new iphone 6 plus pluses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1947741.jpg"></div>
