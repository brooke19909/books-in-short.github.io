    <p>  On average, it takes six to eight meters of fabric to make a turban, but some species require twenty or more meters of fabric. </p><h2>  Turban in ancient times </h2><p>  In the East, there were more than 1000 methods of tying this headgear, and by its appearance it was possible to determine the status and type of activity of its owner. </p><p>  Initially, the turban was the headdress of men in India and some Muslim peoples.  She wore a skullcap on top.  Men were forbidden to take off their hats with strangers. </p><p>  In some sections of the population, turban was of practical importance.  In ancient times, the turban of eastern warriors could reach up to 20 kg: they could carry small weapons and necessary things in campaigns in it. </p><h2>  Turban as a female headdress </h2><p>  Over time, this attribute also entered the women's wardrobe.  Oriental women adorned their dresses with precious stones, and the turban itself was made of expensive fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hat turban knitting with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1682168.jpg" width="369"></div>

    <p>  If you already have knitting experience, a similar headdress can be knitted in one evening.  But even if this is a debut, creating a fashionable turban will not take you much time and effort.  Yes, and knitting will be a way of manifesting your creativity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What do you need to tie a turban on your own? </h2><p>  So, let's look at <span>how to knit a turban hat with</span> knitting needles for a woman.  You will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  yarn, in the composition of which there is wool and acrylic (or only acrylic - optional); </li><li>  knitting needles, the format of which is indicated on the packaging for the threads; </li><li>  hook; </li><li>  needle with a big eye; </li><li>  threads matching yarn; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  centimeter for taking measurements. </li></ul><h2>  Knit a turban together </h2><p>  If you have prepared everything you need, feel free to get down to business.  So, how to knit a turban hat with knitting needles?  We‚Äôll review the description of the most convenient and quick way right now! </p><ol><li>  First you need to determine the size of the product.  Use a soft centimeter to measure head coverage.  The measurement is made from one earlobe to another through the highest point of the head.  Divide the received data into two, remember them or write down.  Tie a sample of yarn - a 4 x 4 elastic band. The elastic band is knitted as follows: four front loops alternate with four purl loops to the end of the row.  Then turn the product over with the other side (toward you), and continue knitting. </li><li>  Steam the resulting sample.  Count how many loops are located on one centimeter.  Multiply the figure by the data that determines half of the head circumference.  Add two side loops to the hem. </li><li>  Dial the desired number of loops and start knitting.  The algorithm is the same as when knitting a sample.  Knit a flat cloth as if making a scarf.  Try on the product periodically.  On average, its length should be about 80-100 cm. </li><li>  When you tie the desired length, connect the two ends with a hook or needle with thread. </li><li>  Turn the product so that the connecting seam is further from you (it will run from the crown to the forehead).  Connect the inner edges about 20 cm. You should get a hat with a rounded tail on the back. </li><li>  Women's turban is almost ready.  Try it on yourself.  Twist the loose loop from the back and pull it over the rim.  You can wear a hat in different variations.  You can rotate the turban forward, you can decorate with a brooch or other accessories of your choice. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a turbaned hat with knitting needles with a description" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1682171.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Here is such a hat-turban with knitting needles.  To link such a description is not difficult. </p><p>  If you plan to wear a hat in the winter, use thicker yarn.  Acrylic or cotton yarn is excellent for the autumn-spring period. </p><p>  Many modern hats are similar to each other, but a turban hat is always a unique thing, especially in its own performance. </p>
