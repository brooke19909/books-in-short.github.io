They are designed to fix everything that happens on the road.  You will learn about the functionality of this model from the article. </p><h2>  Gadget culture </h2><p>  In connection with the development of technological progress, large cities are daily overloaded with automobile flows.  Unfortunately, roads, highways and interchanges are not being built as fast as the number of car owners is growing. </p><p>  This leads to a transport collapse in large cities, and complex multi-hour traffic jams are not the worst result of such an industrial process.  The likelihood of an accident increases significantly.  And it becomes harder for the driver to prove his case and punish the culprit.  Especially if the latter fled the scene. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gps-navigator-info.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr mystery mdr 650" class="if uuid-2692767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2692767.jpg"></div><p>  It was in such conditions that the culture of mass video surveillance was born.  It is difficult to imagine in modern Russia a motorist, a resident of a large city, without an auto-recorder like the Mystery MDR-650 or some other.  Using such devices became as natural as washing and brushing your teeth. </p><h2>  About Mystery MDR-650 </h2><p>  The DVR manual describes all the multifunctionality of the system: there is a cyclic recording on a single camera with a viewing angle of 120 ¬∞, which can be rotated 180 ¬∞.  Video recording is carried out in a resolution of 1280 √ó 960. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The videos are recorded for 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes.  Between them there is a gap of about 3 seconds.  Files are saved in avi format.  Shooting is carried out in both day and night mode. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gps-navigator-info.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdr 650 registrar reviews" class="if uuid-2692769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2692769.jpg"></div><p>  This model is equipped with a built-in rechargeable battery of 500 mAh, but it is also provided with power from the vehicle‚Äôs on-board network. </p><p>  The Mystery MDR-650 has its own two-inch screen for viewing footage.  In addition, the device can be connected to a computer via a USB cable to take a look at the video on a wider screen. </p><p>  The standard mount is on a suction cup.  The product is small in size - only 50 √ó 97 √ó 22 mm. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The Mystery MDR-650 DVR has earned the attention of motorists due to its ease of use and low cost.  In user reviews, it is noted that the product is worth the money, recording is good, without freezes and crashes, car numbers are visible both in the daytime and in the dark. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": doc6i, "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdr 650 full set" class="if uuid-2692780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2692780.jpg"></div><p>  Many are happy with the minimum of actions to turn the gadget on and off: the driver just gets into the car, plugs the product into the cigarette lighter, recording starts.  Pulls out of it - disconnects.  There are no complicated and hard-to-reach keys that need to be somehow found on the case. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Drivers are also pleased with the opportunity to turn the camera to shoot both the passenger compartment and the traffic police inspector when he approaches the driver‚Äôs door. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  No matter how good the model may be, it also has its drawbacks.  Unfortunately, there are more negative reviews about the Mystery MDR-650 than positive reviews.  For example, many note that the device stops functioning after several hours of operation, freezes and turns off. </p><p>  Many complain about the poor quality of the video, which runs counter to positive reviews about it.  It is noted that when turned on, it loads the radio broadcast with interference.  The suction cup is not reliable, because you have to put up with the fact that the gadget periodically falls off the windshield. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdr 650 instruction manual" class="if uuid-2692778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2692778.jpg"></div><p>  Regarding whether vehicle numbers are visible, it is noted that they can be seen in daylight only at close range in pause mode.  At night, only glare will be visible.  It is noted that the interval between entries is not at all 3 seconds, as stated in the product description, but all 10. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Low cost: from 2000 to 3000 rubles.  In principle, the Mystery MDR-650 costs its money - an inexpensive, unpretentious device with a limited set of functions and capabilities. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  In summary, it should be said that the gadget is not so good.  It‚Äôs better to add some money and buy a model that has proven itself in the video gadget market.  In addition, such an interval between video recording is fraught with the fact that the details of the accident may not be captured. </p><p>  To avoid such incidents, it is recommended to purchase a model with a built-in shock sensor.  Another name is G-sensor.  The module automatically starts recording when there is a sharp increase in pressure on the car.  The file is moved to a directory that is protected from being overwritten.  The function fixes the time before the accident and after (configured in the options).  Thus, the attacker will not go unpunished, because information about him will be recorded on the camera. </p><p>  In addition, useful features are: radar detector, GPS-navigator and sleep warning function.  The latter is not particularly relevant in a city; it is more often used by truckers at long distances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": doc6i, "><img itemprop="image" alt="mystery mdr 650 dashcam on a windshield" class="if uuid-2692781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2692781.jpg"></div><p>  When choosing a product, it is recommended to pay attention to the presence of WDR technology.  Thanks to this, the quality of shooting in the dark increases.  With a lack of light, dark corners are illuminated, and bright ones are slightly obscured.  As a result, when moving during the day, the image does not become ‚Äúilluminated‚Äù if the ray of the sun hits the lens and does not turn out too dark at night.  Car numbers are getting picky. </p><p>  However, such models are much more expensive, but such costs will be entirely and fully justified.  Although a lot of money will have to be spent on a reliable gadget, it will be of more benefit than a cheap model, which will last a very short time and calmly remain somewhere in the trash can or will be sold half as cheap to an unlucky motorist.  So think a few times before buying a DVR in your car. </p>
