    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For older Muscovites, Fili Park, a map of which is presented in more detail on its official website, suggests visiting a club called the Silver Age.  Musical evenings, master classes in historical dances, computer basics, yoga and gymnastics classes, as well as meetings with people interesting to this generation are held here daily. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For children and youth, as well as for those who love adrenaline, the Panda hanging rope attraction is especially popular.  Fili Park is one of the few places in Russia where extreme lovers soar above the surface of the earth on ropes at a height of twenty meters.  The Panda Adventure Rope Complex is great for competitions.  It consists of five routes with a total length of almost six hundred meters.  On this highest route in Russia - the climbing wall - the average travel time is two and a half hours. </p>

    <h2>  For animal lovers </h2><p>  Fili Park has a real stable.  Everyone who loves horseback riding can not only gobble up on them, but also take care of what they like and take care of him. </p><p>  In addition, there is a mini zoo, with pets which you can even talk closely.  Fili Park was one of the first to organize a movement under the slogan ‚ÄúFeed the squirrel!‚Äù.  Since these animals cannot be fed with salted nuts or roasted seeds, special food is sold in numerous cafes and stalls on the territory. </p>

    <h2>  "Cursed place" </h2><p>  One of the attractions of the park is the Kuntsevo settlement, one of the oldest fortified settlements found in <span>Moscow.</span>  Its earthen rampart and moat are perfectly preserved.  During the excavations, not only traces of the stockade and the remains of various buildings, including residential ones, were discovered, but also earlier finds dating back to the Dyakovo culture. </p><p>  On the territory of the ancient settlement called the ‚Äúcursed place‚Äù, archaeologists found metal jewelry, casting tools, and also bone products.  In the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, this territory was inhabited by the Slavs-Vyatichi, as evidenced by the mounds preserved to this day.  Later, from the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries, the Church of the Protection of the Virgin Mary operated here.  However, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the settlement was devastated by the Polish invasion. </p><h2>  Naryshkin Manor </h2><p>  The current Park "Fili" in the middle of the seventeenth century was a guarded hunting ground of Sovereign Alexei Mikhailovich.  In the late eighties, Peter the Great transfers these lands to his uncle.  For a hundred and seventy-five years, the Naryshkin family owned them. </p><p>  Here is the famous manor of this famous family, the last owner of which was K. Soldatenkov, a wealthy book publisher.  Over the years, she was visited by Alexei Mikhailovich and Empress Catherine II, even the Prussian king Frederick William III came here. </p><h2>  Fili Park: how to get there </h2><p>  This place, where many Muscovites gladly come to rest, is located in the Western Administrative District.  You can get to it by metro.  From the station ‚ÄúFili‚Äù to it is only ten minutes walk along Novozavodskaya street, from ‚ÄúBagrationovskaya‚Äù - only a quarter of an hour. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Fili Park is considered the largest massif of broad-leaved forest that exists in the western part of the capital.  The rich flora and fauna are perfectly preserved here.  Centenary lindens, one and a half centuries old oaks, as well as maple plantations and birch trees grow in the park.  Old-timers, whose age has exceeded one hundred and thirty years, have still survived from pine forests stretching in these places.  There is such <br>  same old summer elm.  Not bad preserved apple orchard.  In addition, in the park are represented in large numbers and "foreign" plants, more than one hundred and twenty species of mosses and ninety species of birds and animals. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope route" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/460051.jpg" width="360"></div></h2><h2>  Park today </h2><p>  Fili Park, whose photo can be seen on the official website, was a nature reserve until 1964.  And after that, work began on the creation of a national cultural, historical and natural landscape complex.  Until the seventies of the last century, moose still met on its territory, and many Muscovites specially came here to pick mushrooms, of which there were a lot.  But already in 1978, the park was declared a monument of garden and park art. </p><p>  In the year of the celebration of the eight hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Moscow, a historical and ethnographic center called the ‚ÄúCity of Masters‚Äù was opened on the site of the old settlement. </p><p>  Today, Fili Park is completely transformed.  Saplings of the rarest trees and shrubs delight the eye.  Here, new flowerbeds or lawns are broken every year, playgrounds for games are opened and sports simulators are added.  Both forest paths and places for recreation are constantly being improved. </p>
