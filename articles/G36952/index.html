Among them, a special place is occupied by Cologne.  It is here that on the top of the hill called Soborny, almost at the railway station, stands the magnificent Cathedral built in the Gothic style in honor of the Virgin Mary and St. Peter the Apostle. </p><p>  The monumental Cologne Cathedral is not inferior in magnitude to the famous masterpieces of medieval architecture, such as the Seville and <span>Milan Cathedrals</span> in Italy, as well as St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.  For some time, the grand temple in Cologne was the highest in the world, but over time it moved to an honorable third place.  But this is not the only virtue and the reason why thousands of tourists from all over the world come to see the Cologne Cathedral with their own eyes.  Here are collected many priceless relics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of Cologne Cathedral" class="if uuid-2346878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346878.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists are interested in everything: the history of Cologne Cathedral, architectural features, interior design. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The place for the construction of this temple was not chosen by chance.  Historians know an interesting fact about Cologne Cathedral: already at the beginning of the 1st century there was a temple here that was dedicated to the Roman gods.  Since the IV century, the construction of Christian temples began in this territory, which eventually deteriorated and collapsed or were destroyed in fires.  In the middle of the XIII century, when the holy relics of the three Wise Men were transferred from Milan to the Archbishop of Cologne, Rainald von Dassel, it was decided to build a temple that surpasses in size and luxury all that were built earlier. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In August 1248, the first stone was laid in the foundation of Cologne Cathedral.  Initially, the work progressed very quickly, but soon they practically stopped, and only by 1560 the foundation of the structure was built.  The active construction of the Cologne Cathedral began in 1824.  According to plans and drawings found in the archives, during this period it was possible to complete the famous towers, the facades were decorated. </p><p>  To do this, many sculptural compositions on biblical themes were made, the gates for portals made of bronze were cast, hundreds of square meters of stunning stained-glass windows of Cologne Cathedral were collected.  Construction work, lasting 632 years, was completed in 1880.  The harmonious combination of medieval architecture and neo-Gothic elements in the temple‚Äôs appearance, which was characteristic of the 19th century, turned Cologne Cathedral into one of the country's greatest historical and architectural monuments. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the cathedral was practically unharmed, with the exception of several stained glass windows knocked out from the south.  The restoration was completed in 1956, but only in 2007 the stained-glass windows of the temple were restored.  For this, more than 11,500 glass multi-colored fragments were needed.  In 1996, the cathedral was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itscarmen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cathedral architecture" class="if uuid-2346881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346881.jpg"></div><h2>  Cologne Cathedral Architecture </h2><p>  This building is famous throughout the world for its grandeur and scale.  The towers of the cathedral are directed upward by 157 meters, and the height of the building exceeds 60 meters.  These towers are well visible from anywhere in the city, and in the evening the facade is illuminated by greenish lamps, and the cathedral looks simply amazing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the temple is not famous for one height: the construction is so magnificent and monumental that it simply amazes the imagination.  The length of the architectural structure is 144 meters, and the total area is 8.5 thousand square meters.  A composition of many through lattices, violets, supporting pilasters is perfectly combined with other decorations - carvings, sculptural plastic and a characteristic height difference.  A shade of gray Rhine stone supports the Gothic style of the cathedral. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  Visitors are simply fascinated by the interior design of the cathedral in Cologne.  Its main hall is surrounded by galleries, carved columns, figures of saints, small chapels, the walls and floor are lined with unique mosaic with gilding.  The main value of the temple is the golden tomb, in which the remains of the Magi rest.  There is also the Milan Madonna and the two-meter oak cross of Hero. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetravelturtle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interior decoration" class="if uuid-2346887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346887.jpg"></div><h2>  Altar </h2><p>  Skilful craftsmen made the main altar of the cathedral from a monolith of marble, and the side walls are made in the form of an arcade.  In its niches are statues of the twelve apostles. </p><h2>  Tomb of the Magi </h2><p>  A particularly valuable relic of Cologne Cathedral is the tomb with the relics of the Magi, who brought the world the news of the birth of Christ.  It is located next to the altar.  The tomb is three sarcophagi made of wood and sheathed with gold plates.  The sarcophagus is inlaid and decorated with exquisite embossing and carving.  More than a thousand ancient gems and precious stones were used to decorate this relic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stevehickey.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tomb of the magi" class="if uuid-2346891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346891.jpg"></div><h2>  Milan Madonna </h2><p>  This is another priceless relic of the temple.  In 1290, this statue was made to replace the miraculous image that burned into the fire.  It was performed by the same masters who created the sculptures of the apostles that adorn the inner pilasters of the temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dominikanische-laien.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Milan Madonna" class="if uuid-2346898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346898.jpg"></div><h2>  Oak cross </h2><p>  And this relic arouses sacred awe among the parishioners and guests of the city.  It was donated to the old cathedral by Archbishop Gero.  This amazing two-meter creature amazingly accurately depicts the crucified Christ.  The uniqueness of this cross lies in the fact that it has survived to our time in its original form. </p><h2>  Stained glass </h2><p>  World-famous stained glass windows of Cologne Cathedral can be attributed simultaneously to the architectural features and values ‚Äã‚Äãof the church.  They depict saints, biblical scenes, kings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zephyrinus-zephyrinus.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stained glass windows of Cologne Cathedral" class="if uuid-2346917" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346917.jpg"></div><h2>  Cellars of the cathedral </h2><p>  Many values ‚Äã‚Äãof the temple are stored in display windows equipped with lighting in the basement.  Among them are the attributes of power of the city‚Äôs archbishops - a rod and a sword, ceremonial crosses and donors. </p><p>  Those who wish can see numerous examples of ancient writing, embossed on stone slabs, a collection of amazing church clothes made of precious brocade.  Here are several sculptures that used to adorn one of the portals, and artifacts from the burial of the Merovingian dynasty, which date back to 540 AD.  e. </p><h2>  Viewpoint </h2><p>  No description of Cologne Cathedral will cause such emotions as a visit to the observation deck of the temple.  It is located almost at a hundred-meter height and allows you to appreciate the grandeur of the structure.  Not all visitors can make this climb, because more than 500 wide and steep steps lead to the site. </p><p>  After visiting the cathedral, many tourists walk along the square located near the temple.  This is a lively and popular place in the city.  Here you can see the performances of mimes, listen to the game of street musicians and just have a cup of coffee in one of the tiny cozy cafes. </p><h2>  Cathedral today </h2><p>  Today it is an active temple in which services are held.  In addition, the building is also a museum where visitors can get acquainted with a huge collection of paintings, sculptures, jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theviewingdeck.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the cathedral today" class="if uuid-2346946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346946.jpg"></div><h2>  The legend of Cologne Cathedral </h2><p>  This legend has several interpretations.  Someone firmly believes in the veracity of this story, someone is skeptical about it. </p><p>  In developing the design of the cathedral, the architect Rile could not decide which drawings and sketches to give preference to.  The famous master was so burdened by this choice that he decided to ask Satan for help.  The devil immediately responded to the request and offered the architect a deal: he will receive blueprints that will make the cathedral one of the greatest creations in the world, and in return the master will give his soul to the devil.  The decision was to be made with the cry of the first cocks.  Gerhard promised to think, anticipation of world-wide fame incline him to a positive decision. </p><p>  Voluntarily or involuntarily, the master‚Äôs wife heard the conversation with the devil.  And she decided to try to save the soul of her husband.  She hid in a secluded place and after the devil handed over the blueprints, she cried out with a rooster.  Only then did Satan realize that the deal did not take place.  The artistic version of this story was outlined in the poem ‚ÄúCologne Cathedral‚Äù by P. A. Kuskov. </p><p>  The legend has a sequel.  According to the townspeople, Satan was so angry with the cunning of the architect‚Äôs wife that he cursed the temple and said that the last stone laid in the cathedral building would be the beginning of a worldwide apocalypse.  True, according to some versions, the curse concerned only Cologne.  Maybe that's why the famous <span>German temple is</span> constantly being expanded and completed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.blog.daum.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sculptures of the cathedral" class="if uuid-2346884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/2346884.jpg"></div><h2>  Cologne Cathedral: opening hours </h2><p>  The mode of operation of the temple depends on the season.  From November to April it can be visited every day from 6:00 to 19:30.  From May to October - from 6:00 to 21:00.  The treasury of the cathedral awaits guests every day from 10:00 to 18:00.  The towers of Cologne Cathedral are open in winter from 9:00 to 16:00.  In spring and summer - from 9:00 to 17:00.  Entrance to the temple is free, a visit to the tower will cost you three euros, and treasures - five euros. </p>
