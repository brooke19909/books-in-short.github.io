And the first, and second, and third!  Zanzibar is an archipelago belonging to the African state of Tanzania and lying just 35 kilometers from its mainland coast.  Washed by the warm Indian Ocean, these <span>paradise islands</span> have a tropical climate and are ready to receive tourists all year round.  But travelers from Russia have only recently discovered this country. </p><p>  The archipelago consists of a whole placer of islands, but only two of them are large enough: Unguja and Pemba.  The first is often called Zanzibar.  On this island is the capital of the archipelago.  This is the "Stone City", Stone Town, which is often called Zanzibar.  The tourism industry has long flourished on the island of Unguja.  Five-star hotels lined up on the coast. </p><p>  According to its characteristics, the slightly smaller island of Pemba is in no way inferior to Unguja (Zanzibar).  But the tourism industry there is still underdeveloped.  Pemba attracts romantically inclined travelers who long for unity with nature.  This does not mean that there are no good hotels.  But still, most tourists prefer Zanzibar hotels.  In this article we will talk about one of them - PalumboKendwa. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Zanzibar Island:</span> holiday features </h2><p>  Reviews complain that in Zanzbar, that is, Unguja, you will no longer see "real Africa."  Of course, the white beaches are clean, the hotels are gorgeous, the underwater world is amazing with a variety of species, but this surroundings are indistinguishable from the resorts of Costa Azahar, Maldives, Dominican Republic and similar places.  But on the northern island of the archipelago, Pemba, preserved African exoticism.  Impenetrable jungle, real, not theatrical villages of the natives, pristine nature and rich underwater world.  But the tourism industry is in its infancy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And the city of Kendwa in the north of Zanzibar Island combines all the advantages of Unguji and Pemba.  It is in this city that the PalumboKendwa hotel we are describing is located.  The most beautiful resort Kenva can boast of is the beach of the same name.  He is considered the best in the entire archipelago.  Naturally, people go to Kendwa beyond the beach and the sea.  By the way, the ebbs and flows here are minimal and almost imperceptible. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  PalumboKendwa is a three-minute drive from the center of Kendwa.  This circumstance gives the hotel the opportunity to have a larger territory than the standard city hotel.  But Kendwa‚Äôs main attractions can be reached on foot in just ten minutes.  This is a second-line hotel, that is, you need to walk a little to the beach.  Abeid Amani Corum International Airport is 52 kilometers away.  As for the location of the hotel to the tourist infrastructure of the island, its tourists rated it as good.  Easy access to the capital with its attractions.  The best beach on Nangwi Island is five kilometers from the hotel.  The town of Kendwa itself is small.  There are no special entertainments there.  All evening life is concentrated on the territory of hotels.  But you can visit the local market, where you can see colorful and exotic representatives of <span>the Masai tribe.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Palumbo Hotel Kendwa - the hotel is very interesting and original.  The stone building is built in African style.  From a distance, the casing looks like a pile of boulders.  Each hotel room has its own loggia.  In front of the building is an extensive swimming pool with shallow water for relaxation.  Everywhere is very green.  The territory is planted with palm trees, bougainvillea, and other flowering bushes.  Reviews mention that the site comes with ledges.  But you don‚Äôt have to go down-climb the long stairs.  Beautiful paths are laid everywhere that make you want to walk for hours.  Despite the fact that the hotel does not have direct access to the sea, it has its own beach.  At the hotel, vacationers will find a small shop with all sorts of things, a restaurant and a bar.  The entrance to the hotel is carefully guarded.  Tourists rated the hotel grounds as excellent. </p>

    <h2>  Where holidaymakers settle </h2><p>  The three-story building of the PalumboKendwa Hotel, although large in appearance, contains only 67 rooms.  They, in addition to spaciousness (two, three or four people), have subdivisions into categories.  This is a standard (balcony overlooks the garden), sea view (sea view), junior suite and suite.  Each room has a covered balcony with a coffee table and two armchairs.  Double rooms have wide beds.  The bedrooms for more guests are complemented by sofas.  All these lodges are equipped with beautiful canopies or canopies from mosquitoes.  In general, the rooms, if we consider the photographs taken by vacationers, are very original, stylishly decorated with elements of African aesthetics.  The bathrooms are also beautiful.  Hot water, unlike other Zanzibar hotels, is available around the clock in Palumbo Kendva.  Reviews claim the rooms are spacious.  Tourists recommend that when checking in, ask for rooms on the upper floors, since on the first they are dark. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  Old reviews of the PalumboKendwa hotel (Zanzibar) indicate that fans are struggling with African heat.  But after renovation, all hotel rooms have acquired a new generation of air conditioners.  They are very effective and silent.  A TV with satellite channels is provided for entertainment.  In order not to go down to the reception desk to solve various issues, there is a telephone.  There is also a minibar in the room.  He, prompt reviews, can serve as a refrigerator.  But the filling of the minibar is paid, with the exception of bottled drinking water.  An electric kettle is attached that reviews are highly praised.  The room has a safe, spacious enough to accommodate a laptop.  In bathrooms, vacationers will find a hairdryer.  Cosmetic and toiletries are replenished during cleaning, once a day.  The maids do their job just fine.  Many reviews praise the hotel for the cleanliness of the rooms and grounds. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel PalumboKendwa (Zanzibar) includes breakfast.  It is quite simple, albeit plentiful.  Meals are held in the hotel restaurant, in the "buffet" mode.  On the tables there are cereals, sausages, pancakes, salads, eggs in different forms and a lot of fruits.  Tourists praise extremely delicious and fragrant Tanzanian coffee.  Reviews advise: do not buy half or <span>full board</span> from a tour operator.  It‚Äôs better to pay twelve dollars a day for a person in the hotel, and you will be fed lunch and dinner.  For a daily meal, you do not need to leave the beach at all.  After all, dinner is served on the coast in a stylized Masai hut restaurant.  And dinner is already served at the hotel.  If you didn‚Äôt book the guesthouse, but you‚Äôve got hungry, you can safely come to the restaurant.  Your number will be recorded there, and you will be paid upon departure.  But such a meal will cost you more - ten dollars. </p><p>  About nutrition, all reviews are very, very supportive.  Tourists say that they constantly give meat dishes, there are grilled baked dishes, but many are also stewed and boiled.  From the first often offer soup puree.  Lunches and dinners are also praised thanks to delicious fish and vegetable dishes.  The hotel has a bar, which is decorated as a kind of treasure cave.  You can try some good Tanzanian wine there, but there is also imported alcohol. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  To be honest, the PalumboKendwa hotel is located far from the sea - five hundred meters.  You will have to walk to the hotel‚Äôs own beach on foot through the village of Kendva for about fifteen minutes.  Therefore, the hotel provides a free shuttle service.  You will not need to wait for the bus and adjust your schedule to his schedule.  According to any of your requirements, during the daylight hours, the hotel car will take you to the beach and will pick you up at the agreed time.  But many tourists liked walking.  This is a complete immersion in everyday African life!  The beach itself is carefully guarded from strangers.  You can leave things and go wandering along the coast.  Snow-white sand, azure expanse of the sea - everything is just like in the advertising picture about the paradise islands!  Umbrellas and sunbeds with mattresses can be used for free.  The beach also has bungalows.  The use of them is paid. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  Always a warm sea with a smooth entry into the water, hot white sand so attract tourists that there are almost no reviews about the freshwater reservoir in the hotel.  The photographs show that the pool at the PalumboKendwa Hotel (Tanzania) is made in the form of a lagoon among green lawns.  Its depth increases smoothly, without steps.  This is done so that you can lie in shallow water, in a state of complete relaxation.  But the depth away is enough to swim freely.  This adult pool has a children's section.  Reviews say that there are always few people.  Therefore, there is no need to take sunbeds.  There is always relaxing music by the pool. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure PalumboKendwa, Zanzibar </h2><p>  This hotel carries four stars on its sign.  Of course, in Tanzania this is a very conventional designation.  But reviews say that the hotel administration clearly did not pull off the ceiling and did not suck out a finger.  Hotel services are fully consistent with its category.  The reception desk is open around the clock, and its staff speak English and Italian.  One of the hotel managers can talk with Slavic tourists in Ukrainian.  The hotel has a shared lounge with a library.  There is also: a gift shop, currency exchange, car rental office, tour desk.  Transfer to the beach is free, anywhere in the island - for money.  What shocked tourists most about the hotel was wifi.  It pulls everywhere, in the rooms inclusive, and it is free.  If one of the guests has a birthday, the staff bakes a cake and gives it to the birthday boy with congratulations. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There is nothing special to do in the small town of Kendwa.  All entertainments are somehow connected with the sea.  Diving, snorkeling, sea fishing, walking on the famous Nangwi beach (five kilometers) - this is all that you can do in the daylight.  Excursions to Stone Town, a spice plantation, an island of giant turtles, and the unique Hosani jungle are also offered.  But their reviews are recommended to be ordered from local, and not from your tour operator.  So it will be cheaper at times.  As for entertainment after sunset, they are all - only on the territory of the PalumboKendwa hotel (Zanzibar).  Animators (both for adults and for children) work during the day.  But since at this time everything is on the beach, and almost no one is by the pool, their activity is hardly visible.  But in the evening the guys give all their might.  In addition, the administration often invites professional artists.  Tourists mention Masai dances, gymnasts, fire shows, etc. </p><h2>  PalumboKendwa (Zanzibar): reviews </h2><p>  The owner of the hotel is originally from Italy.  Therefore, the level of service in it is European.  Cleanliness and order reign everywhere.  Plumbing does not flow; there is no interruption with hot water.  Many of the responses mentioned are friendly and welcoming staff.  They want to help you with all their might and try to make your stay even more enjoyable.  No cases of theft at the hotel have been heard.  Maids are cleaned up to their conscience, regardless of tip.  It can be seen that the staff value their workplace.  Tourists also note the calm, relaxing and friendly atmosphere at the PalumboKendwa.  Reviews mention that mainly Italians and Ukrainians rest there.  There are very few Russians, and no discrimination has been noticed towards them.  In general, tourists recommend this hotel for a relaxing and measured vacation. </p>
