Not only exotic oriental culture attracts vacationers, but also low cost of living.  For example, in Nha Trang along the coast a lot of cheap hotels have been opened.  But not all complexes offer really high quality service at low prices.  An extremely budget option in Nha Trang is considered Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * (Vietnam), the reviews about which tourists leave controversial.  Should I choose it for relaxation?  We will tell you about this resort in this article. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  Since this hotel is considered a place for cheap accommodation, it cannot offer tourists a favorable location.  Nevertheless, the Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * hotel (Vietnam) was built in the central part of the city on a busy street.  In the immediate vicinity there are many attractions, including the 2nd of April.  Tourists can walk to it in 5 minutes.  Near the hotel is the Longshon Pagoda and the Tyama Towers.  If you want to buy souvenirs or gifts for loved ones, be sure to visit the Vietnamese Dan market.  Tourists with children are advised to go to an amusement park.  It will take you about 10 minutes by car to get there.  The distance to the central part of Nha Trang is about 450 meters. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2381123" data-lng="109.19071200000008" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/9/8/11598.png"></div><p>  The main disadvantage of the location of the hotel is its distance from the beach.  The hotel does not have its own stretch of coast, because it was built on the third line of the sea.  The distance to the beach is about 750 meters.  You can walk to it in 10 minutes.  To get to the sea faster, many tourists also rent scooters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The international airport is located near Nha Trang, so guests can get to the hotel in about 1 hour.  It is 35 km away from the hotel.  For convenience, when buying a tour, you can purchase a transfer from the airport.  You can also take a taxi or public transport. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The budget city hotel Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * was opened in Nha Trang in 2010.  But do not think that his number of rooms is very outdated.  The last full repair in the complex was carried out recently - in 2016.  The hotel has no extensive territory, as it is located in the city center.  It only houses a seven-story residential building.  The housing stock has only 21 rooms, so this hotel is suitable for tourists who do not like crowded places to stay.  After all, even with full occupancy, no more than 50 tourists live on its territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tourghepdanang.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel lobby" class="if uuid-2958662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958662.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the hotel staff does not speak Russian.  The administrator speaks Vietnamese and English.  You can come here with children of any age.  It is also possible to check in with pets, however, this service is provided for a fee.  It is necessary to warn the hotel management in advance of their intention to bring the animal and give them all the information about it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Check-in at the hotel starts at noon local time and lasts until midnight.

Upon registration, guests must give the administrator an international passport as a deposit. </p><h2>  Number of rooms Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) </h2><p>  It has already been said above that this is a very small hotel, with a housing stock of only 21 rooms.  Of course, they cannot boast of large sizes or an elegant interior, since the hotel is considered an extremely budget option for accommodation.  But each room has everything that you might need for a comfortable night: comfortable beds, a bathroom with a shower, lockers for clothes. </p><p>  When making a voucher, tourists can choose one of three categories of apartments: </p><ul><li>  Standard doubl.  Small room of 14 m <sup>2</sup> .  It accommodates no more than 2 adult guests.  The bedroom has a small window overlooking a busy street. </li><li>  Standard twin.

Some of the rooms are additionally equipped with a window, but in some it is not at all. </li><li>  Superior  Superior rooms equipped with a balcony and a window that overlook the city.  Their area is 20 m <sup>2</sup> .

As a rule, guests prefer to eat not in the hotel, but in small cafes and restaurants on Nha Trang Street.  Therefore, they can purchase a ticket without food or pay only breakfast. </p><p>  Morning meals are served at the on-site restaurant, which seats 30 visitors.  A standard international breakfast is served.  Its menu consists of omelet or scrambled eggs, sandwiches, sausage and cheese slices, fruits and vegetables. </p><h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * complex is located in the city center, so it can‚Äôt boast a large territory.

Lockers for storing valuables are also rented here.  For a fee, the administrator can arrange a shuttle service to the airport or hand over clothes and laundry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kenhotel.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel infrastructure" class="if uuid-2958696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958696.jpg"></div><h2>  Leisure options </h2><p>  Tourists choose this hotel for an overnight stay, and prefer to spend most of the time in the city.  Therefore, no entertainment for guests at the hotel is not provided.  If desired, they can book an excursion to the sights of Nha Trang at the reception or rent a bicycle and a scooter.  Using the latter, it is very convenient to get to the municipal beach, which is 750 meters from the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.waytovietnam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nha Trang Beach" class="if uuid-2958692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958692.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * complex (Vietnam, Nha Trang) accepts tourists with children of any age, but does not provide additional amenities for them.

Entertainment for young guests at the hotel is also not. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Ken Hotel Nha Trang 2 * </h2><p>  Like many budget hotels, this hotel is often criticized by guests.  Of course, offering accommodation at a low cost, the administration cannot provide guests with a first-class level of service.  However, many tourists leave positive reviews about the hotel.

In their reviews, they ask management to pay attention to the following serious disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Some rooms have no windows, and the lighting is rather dim, so the living rooms are very dark in the evening. </li><li>  There are a lot of ants in the hotel that staff cannot handle.  Therefore, tourists do not recommend leaving food on the table, as it attracts insects.  Better put them in the refrigerator. </li><li>  The windows overlook the busy traffic street, so sometimes it is quite noisy at night.  Tourists have to sleep with the windows closed. </li><li>  A slow elevator that has to wait a few minutes to go up to your floor. </li><li>  Some rooms require general cleaning.  There is a lot of dust under the carpets and furniture, stains are visible on the windows.  Sometimes maids bring towels and bedding with small holes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="tourghepdanang.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bathroom" class="if uuid-2958665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958665.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, this hotel will not be an ideal place to relax in Vietnam.  But for budget accommodation, it is perfect.  Guests recommend coming here to young companies and those travelers who need a hotel room only for an overnight stay.  After all, Nha Trang is a lively resort where absolutely any tourist can enjoy entertainment. </p>
