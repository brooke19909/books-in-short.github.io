Over the long years of existence, this tool has proven its reliability in ensuring the safety of money; moreover, it can be opened at any bank in a matter of minutes. </p><p>  But despite the obvious advantages, the deposit has a drawback - a low interest rate.  In most cases, it is impossible to cover inflation with the accumulated interest, the contribution only allows you to save your own funds, but not to increase them.  This minus does not please depositors at all and forces them to look for more profitable banking instruments.  One of them is considered an investment contribution. </p>

    <h2>  The concept </h2><p>  An investment deposit is a deposit, the amount of which is divided into two parts: </p><ul><li>  Basic is a familiar contribution. </li><li>  An additional one - the funds of this part will be invested in mutual <span>investment funds (mutual funds).</span> </li></ul><p>  The money invested in <span>investment funds is</span> used by banks to play on the stock market, where shares of various enterprises are purchased. </p><p>  The differences between an <span>individual investment account</span> (IIA) and an investment contribution should be understood.  IMS is an investment that a client can manage independently (for example, Sberbank, a well-known banking organization. An investment deposit drawn up there involves independent trading on the sites after completing the training course). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A client who has invested in an investment deposit does not take part in the process of making further transactions, he simply hands the funds to the bank and forgets about them for the time prescribed in the terms of the contract. </p>

    <h2>  Features of investment deposits </h2><p>  He can choose the tools for investment on his own, but there are certain restrictions.  The banking institution provides a list of mutual funds from which the client can choose what he wants.  He will not have the opportunity to purchase shares in other companies, this item is prescribed in the contract. </p><p>  In addition, the bank single-handedly decides on the distribution of the percentage of the deposit and contribution to mutual funds, taking into account the fact that the deposit can be issued for an amount not exceeding the value of the purchased shares. </p><p>  The basis of investment deposits is that the bank creates a fund from the money contributed by a large number of capital owners, and then distributes funds on the stock market.  The profit earned as a result of trading is divided among all depositors, taking into account the deduction of the interest of the management company as a fee. </p><p>  The minimum deposit amount is set by the bank and, most often, it is equal to the value of 100 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  The next feature is investment insurance.  If a regular deposit can be insured on simple terms, then investments in mutual funds are not subject to insurance, because investments in this case work differently. </p><p>  As mentioned above, a mutual fund consists of funds from depositors, and they are managed by a third-party organization for a fee.  The positive point of mutual contributions is that the funds of the enterprise can be redirected to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe economy in order to maximize profits. </p><p>  For this reason, the income received from mutual funds is not subject to insurance.  Often there is a game in the stock market, the results of which cannot be predicted.  The profit from mutual funds is at least subject to all kinds of leaps and risks, nevertheless, it can potentially bring the greatest benefit. </p><h2>  Requirement for registration of investment deposit </h2><p>  To conclude an investment agreement with a mutual fund, several conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  Confirmation by the client of the fact of coming of age.  An investment deposit can be issued only upon reaching adulthood.  This restriction is associated with independent capital management and taxation. </li></ul><p>  Playing on the stock exchange, one way or another, is associated with risks.  Invested funds can be multiplied, but their complete loss is also possible.  In accordance with the law, to dispose of the state, to be responsible for their actions and deeds, fully understanding the consequences, is allowed to those who have reached the age of majority. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The next point is taxation.  Contribution to mutual resources is considered as entrepreneurship, respectively, is taxed.  Despite the fact that persons under the age of majority may be tax payers, the legal side of this issue is so inaccurate, all discussions arising on this issue can only be resolved by the judiciary.  Actually, for this reason, it is only possible to draw up investment deposits when they have reached the age of majority and have received full legal capacity. </p><ul><li>  Proof of employment.  When making large amounts, banking institutions ask the client for a certificate of earnings of an individual.  This is due to the legal side of the agreement, where mutual funds pop up. </li></ul><p>  In case of loss or decrease of assets of mutual funds, all issues are resolved in a judicial proceeding, and in accordance with the current legal system there is a requirement to confirm ownership of deposits. </p><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation does not allow large investments without confirming the status of a citizen, but at the same time it does not require an explanation of what sources the savings were taken from.  For registration of the contribution, you only need a document from the place of work, even if the client is employed by the janitor. </p><ul><li>  An investment deposit can only be made by residents of the Russian Federation.  This condition does not require any discussion, since investing in mutual funds is, in essence, entrepreneurship.  This is how the state systems of all countries are arranged.  An investment deposit is entitled to be opened only by a person paying taxes. </li><li>  The deposit amount cannot be higher than the size of the mutual fund.  The essence of the interest rate.  The deposit part increases profits by receiving a profitable increased rate due to a contribution to investment funds.  That is why deposits mainly operate for short periods of time.  Thus, banks are protected from inflation.  Quite common programs for which you can purchase additional units, giving the opportunity to increase revenue and replenish the deposit. </li></ul>

You need to know in advance about the provision of such an opportunity. </p>

    <h2>  Contributions to investment projects </h2><p>  In addition to bank investment deposits, there are so-called highly profitable projects called hiip. </p><p>  HYIP or HYIP (High Yield Investment Project) is translated from English as an investment project with high profitability.  However, such an investment contribution, according to customers, is fraud. </p><h2>  Project Features </h2><p>  The principle of operation of such projects is similar to the Ponzi pyramid.  A high percentage of payments is ensured by incoming new deposits made by newly registered users.  Thus, the project is fueled by new money, but as soon as the funds cease to flow and they are no longer enough to cover obligations to investors, payments end and the hype closes. </p>

    <p>  Fraud consists in the fact that the whole system masquerades as an invented legend, that is, an invented story, due to which investors receive interest.  Experienced investors are well aware of all this and are aware of the possible risks associated with financing such projects. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Such banking products as a transition form from a liability to an asset have every chance of existence.
