The main question of the past year in the world of technology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It's no secret to anyone that Apple is very popular among fans of new products in the technology world, and therefore the question: ‚ÄúWhen did the new iPhone come out?‚Äù  can be heard more and more often.  And there‚Äôs nothing strange about it: a convenient interface, simple operation, many high-quality applications and stylish design do their job.  In this article, we will try to deal with more recently the main question in the technology market - when does the new iPhone 5S come out?  In addition, we slightly open the veil before the next new Apple product - iPhone 6. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="When the new iPhone came out" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/323888.jpg" width="525"></div></h2><h2>  iPhone 5s </h2><p>  Developing this smartphone, the company wanted to realize its main goals: to create a gadget that will have stronger technical characteristics than the previous generation;  make the iPhone 5S incredibly reliable in terms of maintaining the confidentiality of owner data  And Apple completely succeeded, and therefore the question: ‚ÄúWhen did the new iPhone come out?‚Äù  gaining popularity daily.  The long-awaited device itself was presented on September 10, 2013 in Cupertino.  The novelty differs from the iPhone 5 primarily in its new feature - Touch ID.  The innovation allows you to unlock the phone with the fingerprint of the owner.  You can also be sure that no one - besides you - will make a purchase in the iTunes Store - the fingerprint reader also works here.  If we talk about the appearance and dimensions of the device, then the iPhone 5S continues the tradition of the previous generation: all the same 112 grams, 4-inch screen.  The back panel is not strictly white or black, as it was in all generations up to 4S.  The technical characteristics of the gadget are simply amazing: the new dual-core A7 processor and the M7 coprocessor make the iPhone 5S the phone of the future, because there is no such application in the nature that would work poorly here!  Do not forget that the new iPhone has become better aperture - f 2.2.  This means that it becomes possible to take even better pictures, although, to be honest, almost no one expected Apple to improve an already excellent camera that would be the reason for pride in almost any modern phone.  In addition, the developers promise that the smartphone will keep charging for up to 10 hours of talk time in third-generation networks.  Summing up, we can say that the iPhone 5S is equipped with all the most necessary functions for today's user, and therefore it is not surprising to hear from all sides: ‚ÄúWhen did the new iPhone come out?‚Äù </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  iPhone 6 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="When will the new iPhone 6 come out" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/323869.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In the modern world, no one and nothing stands still: technology is developing, going beyond the once impossible.  So the iPhone 6 in the literal sense of the word goes beyond: there was information that there simply will not be restrictions!  In addition, the developers plan to equip the smartphone with two screen sizes, releasing two modifications: one with a 4.7-inch display, the other - 5.7.  Also, information about improving the camera on the iPhone and the development of the new iOS 8 system leaked to the World Wide Web. If all this is really implemented, then the release of the iPhone 6 can be considered a new milestone in the development of Apple.  To the question: ‚ÄúWhen will the new iPhone 6 come out?‚Äù  There is no definite answer, because some experts suggest that the presentation will take place this summer, while others - in early autumn. </p><h2>  Summary <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="When the new iPhone 5S comes out" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17427/323882.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The iPhone 5S is a true flagship, the best phone to date, which embodied all the ideas of Apple engineers to bring it to perfection.  Although, given the latest news from the world of technology, there are doubts about whether all the plans were really presented in the iPhone 5S.  iPhone 6 should confirm or destroy these doubts.  In any case, the wait is not long.  We hope that after reading the article you can easily answer the question: ‚ÄúWhen did the new iPhone come out?‚Äù </p>
