    <p>  The manufacturing process of the stand includes several successive stages: </p><ul><li>  selection of topics; </li><li>  selection of necessary sections, determination of their total number; </li><li>  creating a sample of the future stand on paper; </li><li>  selection of materials for the manufacture of the stand; </li><li>  production of a corner; </li><li>  installation or installation of the stand; </li><li>  filling the classroom with information. </li></ul><p>  First you need to start creating a model of the future stand on paper.  It is necessary to draw with the help of colored pencils, felt-tip pens or paints what a cool corner will look like.  DIY decoration <strong> </strong>  makes it possible to connect children to this process.  Joint creativity will only bring students closer, help to reveal their creative inclinations and will contribute to the development of aesthetic taste and imagination. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The choice of subjects </h2><p>  The choice of topics should be taken with full responsibility.

    <p>  Subject area for <span>elementary grades</span> can be associated with fairy-tale characters, cartoon characters, and more.  The main condition is the brightness of colors and ease of execution. </p><p>  So, for example, you can arrange a corner in the form of a sun with rays, a train with trailers, a tree, a flower meadow, a rainbow and the like.  It all depends on the imagination of the teacher and his creative abilities. </p><p>  The topics for the stand of middle and senior students are more strict.  DIY corners can be designed in the form of a book, mathematical, linguistic, literary, sports or artistic symbols. </p><p>  Students can also suggest topics for the stand, based on their preferences and interests.  Here the main thing for the teacher is to listen to the opinion of everyone and choose the topic that will be acceptable to the majority. </p><h2>  Selection of required materials </h2><p>  Having decided on the topic, it is necessary to calculate the total number of windows in which the information will be placed, and also title each section in accordance with generally accepted requirements about what should be a cool corner in the school.  Making this stand with your own hands gives room for imagination and creativity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY photo corner" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/980189.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The choice of raw materials for the manufacture of the stand depends on the state of the financial aspect and the potential of the teacher. </p><p>  With a meager budget and great creative potential, teachers can make the perfect stand from simple materials at hand.  Perfectly processed cardboard, plywood, fabric, heavy paper. </p><p>  Below is one example of how you can design cool corners with your own hands for elementary school. </p><h2>  Subject class corner: "Ant family" </h2><p>  The classroom consists of three stands and is a forest clearing where ants work hard.  Grass, flowers and other necessary decorations can be made of fabric.  A tree and an anthill with its inhabitants are made of thick paper or cardboard. </p><p>  On the central stand of the corner is a large anthill.  Above it you can fix a leaflet with the inscription "Our friendly team" or "Our class". </p><p>  The number of ants should correspond to the total number of students in the class.  You can place photographs of each student on a corner stand, and mark girls and ant boys with pink and blue ribbons, respectively. </p><p>  Also, photos of students can be arranged in the form of a tree, the crown of which is formed by photos with the addition of foliage.  Leaves can also be made from paper or fabric.  The composition is completed by a powerful barrel cut out of cardboard or made of paper using the technique of applique or origami.  Under the tree, you can put the schedule of lessons and calls. </p><p>  On the second side stand, you can make a ‚Äúflower of success‚Äù with little tips for students and berries with mushrooms, on which you can put the names of classroom attendants, children who do not have passes for illness, and so on. </p><p>  In addition, place should be left on the stand for placement of educational information, happy birthday, student achievements and recommendations for parents.  An excellent incentive for the <span>development of creative abilities</span> will be the presence of the block ‚ÄúOur Creativity‚Äù or ‚ÄúCreative Success of Students‚Äù. </p><p>  In this case, you don‚Äôt have to waste your time and do absolutely everything with your own hands, it will be enough just to choose the right artist, explain to him all the nuances of the order, then submit an application and after a specified period of time pick up a completely finished product. </p><h2>  Installation or installation of the stand </h2><p>  If there is a sufficient amount of money, the stand can be ordered at a specialized company that manufactures stands, both template and custom-made. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cool corner do it yourself" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/980190.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Installation of the finished classroom can be carried out independently, with the involvement of the parents of students, by the forces of school workers or other organizations. </p><p>  The main requirement for the installation of stands is the unconditional observance of safety measures and the compliance of the corner with all the rules for safe operation.  Stands should be firmly fixed to the wall, not have sharp corners and contain materials that could cause injury to children or harm their health. </p><h2>  Cool corner at school, do-it-yourself decor </h2><p>  When filling the classroom with information, it is necessary to take into account all the requirements for data of this kind, as well as age characteristics and interests of children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cool corner at school do-it-yourself decoration" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/980191.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  It should also be remembered that the messages on the stands are subject to mandatory systematic updating.  To implement this requirement, students can be connected by distributing responsibilities and assigning them their own stand area. </p><p>  Responsibilities for updating curriculum information, lesson schedules, as well as data for parents are entirely the responsibility of teachers. </p><p>  The stand can contain not only drawings and texts, but also thematic photographs, which will make the finished classroom corner in the school quite original with its own hands.  Students can also offer photos for the stand, which will significantly increase their participation rate in the overall work. </p><p>  Timely and high-quality updating, competent presentation of the text helps maintain the interest of students and parents in the life of the class, and also greatly simplifies the work of the teacher, making it more effective and fruitful. </p><p>  Compliance with all the above requirements is a guarantee of successful and high-quality work.  DIY cool nooks will bring joy and satisfaction.  There is no need to be afraid to create and fantasize, because it is precisely on the ability and talent of the teacher that the success of the work begun depends. </p>
