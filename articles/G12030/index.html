Usually companies of young people and families with children come here on vacation.  Alanya's beaches are marked with blue flags, which indicates their purity and beauty.  If you want to have a good and inexpensive vacation at the resort, then pay attention to the Xperia Grand Bali Hotel 4 * complex. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  A good location of the hotel is the key to a successful stay.  Therefore, it is often a fundamental factor influencing the choice of hotel.  Xperia Grand Bali Hotel - Adults Only - compares favorably with its competitors because it is located in the center of the resort and at the same time is not very far from the coast.  Cleopatra - the famous city beach of Antalya is located just 150 meters from the complex.  Tourists can independently reach it in 5-10 minutes. </p><p>  Xperia Grand Bali Hotel is located on a busy city street in the heart of Alanya's resort.  Near the complex, tourists can find many restaurants, bars and shops.  Nearby are nightclubs, the noise from which can interfere with the rest of tourists with small children. </p><p>  The only minus of the hotel is its distance from the airport.  To get to the hotel, tourists will have to cover a distance of 120 km, so the road can take several hours.  The nearest international airport is in Antalya.  A comfortable bus takes the guests from there, the cost of which is usually included in the price of the ticket.  If desired, tourists can refuse this service and get to the complex by taxi or car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  This cozy city hotel was opened for tourists in 1996.  On its small territory is a seven-story building, built in the classical style, as well as an outdoor pool and an extensive garden.  At the same time, the Xperia Grand Bali Hotel 4 * complex does not look old or dilapidated at all - the last major overhaul of all the premises was carried out here in 2010.  The hotel cannot be called large because it offers only 96 rooms.  In total, about 250 tourists can relax here at the same time. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews about Xperia Grand Bali Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  But not without criticism.  Some of the guests say that the hotel does not correspond to the declared category, when compared with European hotels. </p><p>  Guests note the following disadvantages of relaxation in this place: </p><ul><li>  Lack of sound insulation.  In the room you can hear not only noise from the street, but also from neighboring rooms. </li><li>  Rare cleaning.  Hotel staff may forget to change towels, and sometimes do not tidy up for several days.  However, after a reminder, they eliminate their mistake in the shortest possible time. </li><li>  Low speed internet.  Due to the heavy workload in the evening, it is impossible to update even social networks. </li><li>  Poor transfer organization.  After arriving at the airport, tourists could not find a bus, so they had to call the hotel.  Only after that, a car came for them for an hour. </li><li>  The small pool is in poor condition and needs repair, so almost no one swims in it. </li></ul><p>  Despite the shortcomings found, tourists still recommend a vacation in this place, indicating the low cost of living. </p>
