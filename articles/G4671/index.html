Someone fell asleep at the sight of hundreds of dates and thousands of names.  Nevertheless, I had to learn all this in order to write quizzes and pass exams. </p><p>  And yet history itself is a very interesting discipline.  We learn about the past of our ancestors, about the formation of large cities and the development of countries.  In this matter, the main thing is to present facts and historical events in an interesting way.  And then the ancient cities of Kazakhstan will attract the attention of not only the inhabitants of this country, but also people from all over the world. </p><h2>  Thematic focus </h2><p>  The topic of the article is quite extensive.  It is almost impossible to talk about each settlement.  You can write a book on this topic.  Then a couple of volumes is enough to not forget about every ancient city of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  What needs to be considered in order to make an overall picture?  By the ancient cities of this country are meant its own settlements that existed during the period of ancient and medieval times.  But before we move on to a brief history, consider the current state of the state. </p><h2>  Kazakhstan </h2><p>  This power is located in the center of Eurasia.  Most of it belongs to Asia.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKazakhstan is almost 3 million square kilometers.  Its dimensions are comparable to those of Argentina.  Thanks to such an area, the country takes 9th place in terms of territorial determinations around the world. </p>

    <p>  The population of more than 18 million people.  Astana became the capital, although there is a larger city - Alma-Ata.  Residents of the state speak Kazakh.  Although you can also hear the Russian language, which is official here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  To find out what ancient cities existed on the territory of Kazakhstan, it is worth considering the geography of a modern country. </p><p>  It is surrounded by interesting geographical features: the Caspian Sea, the Lower Volga, the Urals, Siberia, China and Central Asia.  The neighbor of the state was Russia.  The length of their common border is 7.5 thousand kilometers.  The eastern side is occupied by China with a border of 1.7 thousand kilometers, the southern - by Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of this state is divided into some periods.  Ancient Kazakhstan describes the development of the territory from the time of the Paleolithic until the advent of writing in the 8th century. </p><p>  Early Paleolithic finds were found in the eastern part of the state.  They were discovered on the banks of the Kolgutta River.  There is also evidence of Paleolithic locations. </p><p>  In the XII-V millennia BC, parking lots spread across the territory of modern Kazakhstan.  At this time, large animals are already disappearing.  They invent bow, arrows, boats, traps and much more. </p><p>  In the Neolithic period, the active development of stone tools begins and ceramics appear.  Primitive people are engaged in agriculture and cattle breeding. </p><p>  In the Copper Age, hundreds of settlements appeared, and the <span>Botai culture was</span> founded <span>.</span>  The type of people is protoeuropoid.  The ancient period affects the nomadic lifestyle and the emergence of Scythians (Saks). </p><h2>  First information </h2><p>  Ancient cities on the territory of Kazakhstan became known long before the birth of the country itself.  In place of the modern state, the first settlements appeared in the II-I centuries BC.  e.  The authors of those times spoke about the existence of cities, on the site of which is now located Issyk-Kul Lake, Ili Valley and the Syr Darya River. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Since the territory of the state is impressive, at different times certain historical and cultural regions appeared on it.  Their feature was a sedentary life form.  From here it became possible to trace their development and formation.  Cities began to form here. </p><p>  The first known such regions were South Kazakhstan and Zhetysu.  Archaeologists have been researching this group, highlighting palace dwellings in certain outdated villages.  From here the material used for construction - <span>raw brick</span> became known <span>.</span> </p><p>  It is believed that a large number of ancient cities in Kazakhstan were located in the Arys river valley, in the Otyrar oasis.  Here, finds were discovered that testify to land cultivation, water supply, livestock raising, small-scale manual production and trade. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  Active development of ancient settlements began in the XII century.  At that time, Turkic states began to be built rapidly on the modern territory of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  The list of ancient cities of Kazakhstan can be very long.  It is fair to divide it into several groups.  For example, the remains of 25 settlements dating back to the 6th-9th centuries were found on the territory of Southern Kazakhstan.  From them it became clear that the city had a citadel, an internal settlement and a place that served as a suburb.  These include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Isfijab. </li><li>  Sharab. </li><li>  Budukhet. </li><li>  Otyrar. </li><li>  Shavgar. </li></ul><p>  But other cities were built on trade directions.  Here was collected information about the existence of the residence of the rulers.  These places belonged to important international objects, the neighboring powers knew about them.  These cities include: </p><ul><li>  Taraz. </li><li>  Otyrar. </li><li>  Isfijab. </li><li>  Shavgar. </li><li>  Balasagun. </li><li>  Almalyk. </li><li>  Suyab. </li></ul><p>  This list of ancient cities of Kazakhstan can be continued with a dozen more settlements.  The central part of modern territory was settled in the 9th-13th centuries.  Cities were located in river valleys and foothills. </p><p>  <span>Eastern Kazakhstan</span> was also settled along the Irtysh River.  There is evidence that the cities in this territory are referred to the Turkic nomadic people - Kimaks.  The largest of these was the last Imakia.  It is conditionally called the capital. </p><p>  The western part of Kazakhstan was also populated.  The Oghuz Turks who occupied the Ural valley were in charge here. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Before we get to the information about the ancient cities of Kazakhstan, it is important to give a general description of them.  Like any medieval city in the East, these were multilingual.  The territory had a diverse ethnic group.  It was inhabited by Usuns, Turges, Karluks, Kypchaks, etc. </p><p>  In the ancient cities of Kazakhstan, craft, glassmaking, metal processing, and jewelry were actively developing.  The most important thing for every settlement was trade.  It extended to both local buyers and international cooperation.  As a result, part of the cities acquired large markets, part - minted pennies. </p><p>  Almost every city had the same structure.  Close clusters of buildings were placed, which were combined into separate parts.  Between them there were narrow streets with stalls. </p><p>  Already in the 8th century, the spread of religion began.  Citizens began to study Buddhism and Christianity.  Some residents became shamans.  But a century later, Islam appeared on this territory, which soon took the main place among other religions. </p><p>  In the same period, temples and cemeteries began to be erected.  Since the 10th century, the mosque became the main building of the city.  In addition, baths became notable in the settlements.  They were distributed throughout the ancient cities of the state.  Information about their existence was found in the 10th century. </p><h2>  The most ancient city of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  Of course, determining such a settlement is not easy.  In 2013, the director of the Institute of Archeology Baurzhan Baytanaev called Shymkent the most ancient city.  Moreover, if earlier it was believed that it exists for about 700 years, then according to the historian, his age is more than 2,200 years. </p>

    <p>  He made such a statement on the basis of excavations that lasted several seasons.  Archaeologists have found a ceramic complex, which is attributed to one of the oldest cities in the world Afrasiab.  The appearance of the latter dates back to the 8th century BC. </p><p>  The scientist suggested that information about the city of Nujiket is directly related to Shymkent. </p><p>  But so far, it‚Äôs difficult to consider this information true, as well as the fact that Shymkent and Shymkent are one and the same city.  Therefore, reliable information about the settlement appears only in the 14th century.  So far, it is officially believed that the birth of the city dates from 1365-1366. </p><p>  This settlement for a long time passed from hand to hand.  In the 13th century, the army of Genghis Khan came here.  In the 16th century, the city passed into the possession of the Kazakh Khanate.  The next two centuries, the Dzungar invaders "entered" here.  Until the first half of the 19th century, two large khanates fought for supremacy in this territory. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, a large number of industrial enterprises of the USSR were transferred here.  In the postwar period, the territory was overtaken by rapid economic growth. </p><p>  By October 2017, 950 thousand people live in Shymkent.  Since its independence, the city has developed.  In 2011, there was a population growth of 44% compared to 2000.  The territory of the city also expanded slightly. </p><h2>  Not on the map </h2><p>  It is believed that this is Sairam, which was previously called Ispidzhab (Isfijab).  Unfortunately, it is not known for sure whether this ancient city was located on the territory of modern Sairam.  The opinion of historians was divided. </p><p>  Ispidzhab itself was a popular trading city.  Its main feature was its important trade value.  It was located on the Great Silk Road.  It was first mentioned in 629.  According to other sources, it was founded in the 9-10th century as a military fortification.  Thanks to its beauty, it was called the White City. </p>

    <p>  There is information that after the founding of the Samanids, the ancient city of Kazakhstan, Ispidzhab, became part of it.  A century later, he moved to the Karakhanid dynasty and was with them for two centuries. </p><p>  It is believed that the city became Sairam in the 13th century.  This is if we take the theory of the relationship between the two settlements.  Already as Sairam, he was annexed to the <span>empire of Genghis Khan,</span> and a couple of years later to the Chagai ulus. </p><p>  For some time it was part of the Uzbek possessions.  Now Sairam is a Kazakh village in the south of the country, in which 48 thousand people live. </p><h2>  Large settlement </h2><p>  Otyrar is an ancient city of Kazakhstan in Kazakh.  In Russian, it is called Otrar.  Also, this settlement had different names: Tarband, Turarband, Turar or Farab. </p><p>  Until the Mongol invasion overtook this territory, it was the largest in Central Asia.  Now Otrar is a settlement in the Otrar district in the south of the state. </p>

    <p>  Previously, the Otrar oasis existed.  Now it is a historical and cultural reserve.  Here, almost 50 years of research and excavation.  It was thanks to work in this territory that Otrar became known. </p><p>  The Otrar oasis developed in the 1st-13th centuries of our era.  In the ancient city of Kazakhstan, Otrar, there was a mint of Karakhanids.  In the 13th century, the territory became part of Khorezm. </p><p>  There is evidence that Otrar was part of Farab.  They were obtained from a study of copper dirhams. </p><p>  There is evidence that a large number of scientists, sages, skilled musicians, foretellers and jewelers lived in this settlement.  Excavations helped identify key places in the city.  So, it is known about the madrasah, the market, the blacksmith's workshop, gurt-khan, bathhouses, mosques, shops and shops. </p><p>  After the reign of Genghis Khan, tragic events took place with the participation of Mongolian troops.  The sons of the great commander conducted a siege for six months.  In Otyrar, famine began, as well as confrontation between residents and government officials.  Ordinary villains wanted to negotiate with the attackers.  As a result, one of the residents opened the gates to the Mongols.  This led to the burning of the city and its complete destruction.  The inhabitants were enslaved and killed. </p><p>  In the 15th century, the settlement was rebuilt anew.  Until the mid-18th century, the city belonged to the Kazakh Khanate.  After it, the jungars destroyed again.  In the 19th century it was finally abandoned. </p><h2>  The ancient city of Kazakhstan, founded by Saks and Usuns </h2><p>  Taraz is a famous settlement of the state.  It is the administrative center of Zhambyl region.  The city is located in the south of Kazakhstan, near Kyrgyzstan.  Its population is 364 thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient city of kazakhstan founded by saki" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2212252.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Taraz is an ancient city of Kazakhstan, in the Kazakh language, this word is consonant with "scales."  Some believe that this is what gives the right to consider the city a participant in the Great Silk Road (scales were used in trade).  In fact, the origin of the name is still unknown.  In the period of the USSR, it was called Dzhambul. </p><p>  The history of the city begins with the Talas River, which has settled the tribes of Saks and Usuns.  It is believed that they founded the settlement in the 5th century BC.  Until the founding time of Shymkent has been proven, it can be said that Taraz is the most ancient city of Kazakhstan. </p><p>  In the first century BC, the state of the Huns split.  One of the brothers of this dynasty decided to leave China to Central Asia.  He falls into the Talas Valley to his vassals Uysunyam. </p><p>  After this, written evidence of the existence of the ancient city of Kazakhstan, Taraz, begins to appear.  In 400 there are mentions of Talos.  This settlement was part of the Great Silk Road.  350 years later, a battle was recorded on Talas, in which the Arabs participated.  It was with their submission that the city began to be called Taraz. </p><p>  In 900, the settlement voluntarily converted to Islam.  Christian temples are being rebuilt in mosques.  Taraz becomes a part of the Samanid state.  Until the 10th century, it was part of the Karluk khanate. </p><p>  Despite the fact that this is an ancient city of Kazakhstan, founded by the Saks, by 1000, nothing of this tribe remained on this territory.  The land was conquered by the Karakhanids.  Thanks to this dynasty, the territory became the center of development, since it was the capital. </p><p>  Interestingly, this is one of the few cities that did not retain written references to the Mongol invasion.  Perhaps Taraz was able to withstand the warriors.  Although the information that he was burned in 1220 suggests otherwise.  At this moment, the Mongols decide to rename the city to Yany. </p>

    <p>  Until the 15th century, the settlement belonged to the Chagatai ulus.  Until 1718 - to the Kazakh Khanate.  Also came under the destruction of the jungars.  After this tribe, Taraz became part of the Kokand Khanate.  And in 1856 it was renamed Aulie-Ata.  Before the start of World War II, Taraz - the ancient city of Kazakhstan - in Kazakh began to be called Mirzoyan.  Two years later - Dzhambul. </p><p>  Each time the city was renamed in honor of prominent people.  Aulie-Ata (Kaz. "Holy Grandfather") was named in honor of the founder of the Karakhanids.  Levon Mirzoyan was the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks).  Dzhambul Dzhabaev is a <span>Kazakh poet</span> and akyn. </p><p>  Already in 1993, the city was again renamed due to transcription in Zhambyl.  But it is obvious that the locals were not satisfied with such changes and the city was returned to its old name - Taraz. </p><h2>  Other cities </h2><p>  Unfortunately, describing every ancient city is not easy.  This is largely due to the fact that some settlements have not yet been well studied. </p><p>  For example, the previously mentioned Imakia - the ancient city of Kazakhstan, in the Kazakh language - Kimakia.  It used to be a medieval Asian settlement of Kimaks.  It was located on the territory of modern Kazakhstan and is now considered to have disappeared. </p><p>  In the 9-13th centuries it was the residence of the ruler of the same name kaganate.  There was a city on the Irtysh River in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Pavlodar. </p><p>  The settlement of Kulan was known.  Now it is difficult to understand what territory was meant, since in Kazakhstan there are two villages of the same name.  The first is in the South Kazakhstan region, the second is in Zhambyl.  And in the latter case, we have an aul, in which by 2009 about 15 thousand people lived. </p><p>  Another ancient city of Kazakhstan was Aspara.  Located in the Zhambyl region.  Now it is the remains of a medieval settlement.  It was investigated before the Great Patriotic War.  Found that the length of the destroyed walls is only 100-300 meters. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that the bulk of the settlement existed until the 12th century.  Some sources mention Aspara as a point on the Great Silk Road.  There is also the possibility that at one time there was a parking lot of the troops of Emir Timur. </p><p>  And the last ancient city that exists to this day is Turkestan.  It is located in the south of the country.  Not far from it flows <span>the Syr Darya River.</span>  It is considered a city of regional subordination. </p><p>  The first settlements in this territory were recorded in 500 AD.  Perhaps Turkestan in the 10th century received the name Shavgar, and in the 12th - Yasy.  In medieval times, the settlement became a fortified city. </p><p>  Often this territory is compared with the life and death of the poet and philosopher Ahmed Yasawi.  Tamerlan later built a mausoleum in honor of the poet, who is now considered a cultural center. </p><p>  About the city with the name Turkestan they started talking in the 15th century.  This place became part of the Kazakh Khanate, and after it was destroyed by the Dzungars. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of ancient cities of Kazakhstan.  It is interesting that some become a kind of synthesis, since it is not easy to finally determine the territorial and temporal boundaries of a settlement, given the number of centuries passed. </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So disputes about the existence of a city are born. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now it is unambiguously known about the large ancient cities of Kazakhstan, among which we can distinguish: Shymkent, Isfidzhab, Otyrar and Taraz. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are the territories that have preserved a lot of material evidence and written information.</font></font></p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Many settlements have become part of the neighboring states of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and China. </font></font></p>
