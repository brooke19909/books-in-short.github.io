    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Although Kemer is a relatively "young" resort, it is already considered an established center for beach holidays.  Here is a beautiful nature, against which many chic hotels, night clubs, restaurants and colorful oriental cafes function. </p><p>  However, tourists in this resort, charming with its beauty, first of all appreciate its natural resources: an almost transparent sea of ‚Äã‚Äãturquoise color, secluded bays hidden from human eyes, which are surrounded by lush vegetation, an incredible pine aroma reigns in the air. </p><p>  A light breeze, catching the smell of fir trees, deliciously smelling orange groves - all this forms a unique microclimate of this region.  In addition, Kemer is famous for its magnificent beaches, many of which are marked with the Blue Flag for environmental friendliness.  Such an amazing microclimate is created by the sea and the mountains surrounding Kemer.  This makes it possible for a person to practically not feel the high air temperature inherent in this resort in high season.  There is comfortable sunny weather here year-round. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Ten kilometers from Kemer is the village of Camyuva.  At the end of the last century, as a result of a real tourist boom, the once modest fishing village turned into a real international recreation center.  Its name is translated from Turkish as "pine nest." </p><p>  Today Camyuva is a beautiful resort surrounded by mountains, surrounded by thickets of oleanders, orange and olive trees, palm trees.  Hotels here mainly have a high category and fully meet European standards.  One of them is the four-star Larissa Inn Hotel. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This hotel was formerly called the Rizzi Hotel, and before that - the Larissa Inn <span>Camyuva Hotel.</span>  The tourist complex is located five kilometers from Kemer, in the former fishing village of Camyuva.  The nearest airport (Antalya) is fifty kilometers from the hotel.  Many tourists from Russia opt for Larissa Inn Hotel 4 *.  Tours here have recently become very popular, and one of the reasons is the short time transfer from the airport.  Indeed, for families traveling on vacation with their young children, the issue of remoteness from the airport is especially relevant. </p><p>  The hotel was built in 2005.  It has a relatively small territory - only four and a half thousand square meters.  Larissa Inn Hotel (ex. Rizzi Hotel) is a five-story building surrounded by trees.  The small balconies available in all rooms give residents the opportunity to admire not only the sea panorama, but also the majestic mountain ranges, from the slopes of which a pleasant aroma of pine needles descends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The territory of Larissa Inn Hotel is fully landscaped.  Palm trees grow everywhere, exotic shrubs, lawns are broken.  There are ballot boxes, signs indicating all the main infrastructure of the hotel - everything so that residents would feel comfortable on site. </p><p>  Parking spaces are not required to be reserved in advance.  The last major renovation in this hotel was carried out in 2016. </p>

    <p>  The Russians who visited the Larissa Inn Hotel (Kemer) mainly liked the Turkish hotel.  Regarding the situation in the rooms, no one expressed a fundamental discontent.  Some visitors, however, found them too small.  Many vacationers from our country note the fact that almost all hotel staff understand the Russian language.  This makes the Russian stay here more comfortable.  However, the majority of maids evaluated the work quite negatively: the rooms are cleaned poorly and irregularly. </p><p>  As for the location, the reviews are only positive.  As for nutrition, opinions differ somewhat here.  Some people think that in this hotel the food is varied and delicious, others express dissatisfaction with the scarcity of the assortment in the menu and the lack of meat dishes, but all these reviews are purely individual. </p><p>  Our tourists call the hotel beach a real island of peace.  Compared to neighboring hotels, where music is booming in the bathing areas from early morning and there are a lot of people, it is calm and crowded.  The Russians left a lot of positive feedback about the fully landscaped area.  Particularly impressed by some palm trees entwined with vines.  Judging by the reviews, there are many wonderful places on the territory where you can conduct a photo shoot.  Some were impressed by the fire show, which was organized by a team of animators. </p><p>  Most of our compatriots find the Larissa Inn Hotel a great vacation destination, especially for the money that was paid, so they recommend choosing this particular hotel. </p>
