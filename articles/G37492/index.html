  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a loan at Megafon?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Urgently need to call or just send SMS, and the account balance is zero ... According <span>to the law of meanness,</span> at such a moment, as a rule, there is no payment terminal nearby.  But do not be nervous.  Megafon, along with other major mobile operators, provided options for solving such problems.  We can borrow at Megaphone.  And this is not at all difficult to do. </p><p>  <strong>Trust loan</strong> </p><p>  Talking name.  This service can be used even with a negative balance of the phone.  How to get a loan at Megafon?  Now we will talk about this in detail. </p><p>  The amount of the credit limit varies depending on: </p><ol><li>  The time of your service as a Megafon customer (at least 2 months). </li><li>  The average value of your expenses for communication services of this company over the past 2 months. </li></ol><p>  The minimum credit limit of 200 rubles is available for communication costs an average of 400-599 rubles.  and a service period of at least 2 months.  If your communication costs remain within the same limits, but you remain a Megafon customer for more than 13 months, then you can get a loan of up to 600 rubles. </p><p>  Given the growth of communication costs for the same period up to 2000 rubles per month - a loan of up to 2000 rubles is available. </p><p>  A tempting prospect and, most importantly, a full guarantee that your phone will not be blocked at the most inopportune moment.  How to get a <span>trust payment</span> at Megafon? </p><p>  To activate the service, dial * 138 * 1 #, then press the call button or simply send SMS to 5138 with the text 1. </p><p>  Connection to this Megafon service is free.  It is also important to know that the size of the credit limit may vary slightly depending on the region.  But in general, the essence remains unchanged. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, you can not only decide for yourself the question - how to take <strong> </strong>  credit at Megafon, but also earn bonuses.  Depending on the size of the loan received, their accrual will occur for 4-12 months until the amount of the spent loan is fully returned. </p><p>  For example, if you received a loan of 300 rubles, then after 3 months over the next 4 months, 75 points will be awarded.  As a result, the spent amount will be fully refunded. </p><p>  If a situation arises that the loan is no longer needed, the service can be disabled.  To do this, the subscriber must be online at the moment and have a positive account balance.  There are several ways: </p><ul><li>  send a request with the number 1 to 5138; </li><li>  using the USSD command * 105 * 83 # </li><li>  using the voice menu by dialing 050083. </li></ul><p>  If you couldn‚Äôt disconnect the service yourself, dial 0500 and get a detailed consultation.  Or contact your mobile phone staff for help. </p><p>  <strong>Promised payment</strong> </p><p>  Now consider another option on how to get a loan at Megaphone.  To do this, just activate the "Promised payment" service.  The amount of the loan in this case directly depends on how much money you spent on paying for mobile communications in the previous month.  Its size ranges from 10 to 250 rubles. </p><p>  This service is activated only with a positive account balance of your phone.  It is valid for 5 days.  After this period, it will be necessary to replenish the account for an amount that will fully repay all debts. </p><p>  An important condition for connecting the service, which must be remembered, is that you cannot get a new loan until you pay off the old one.  Moreover, for each subsequent activation of the service a fee of 5 rubles is charged. </p><p>  There are three ways to activate the Promised Payment service: </p><ul><li>  dial * 106 # XXX #, where XXX is the amount of the promised payment.  This is the only way you can get a loan if your phone is already locked; </li><li>  send an SMS message to number 0006 with the text - XXX, i.e.  indicate the amount of the desired loan; </li><li>  using the Service Guide through the USSD menu, while dialing * 105 * 1 * 5 * 2 #. </li></ul><p>  I hope that the question of how to get a loan at Megafon will no longer take anyone by surprise.  At least you now know exactly how to do it.  A forewarned, then armed. </p>
