    <h2>  Formation of a settlement </h2><p>  The settlement on both sides of the road to Dmitrov began to form in the <span>XIV century.</span>  The bulk of the population were artisans and traders.  The settlement began to be called Dmitrovskaya, since most of its inhabitants came from the city of the same name. </p><h2>  XVI-XVII centuries </h2><p>  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, people from the Dmitrov settlement were relocated away from the Kremlin.  The goal was the liberation of profitable territories for the local nobility.  As the city developed, the settlement had to move even further along the road.  The newly populated territories were called Malaya Dmitrovskaya Sloboda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big dmitrovka" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/464511.jpg" width="600"></div>

On the street-road it was possible to go to the earthen rampart, which went along the line of modern boulevards.  Dmitrovsky Gate was made in it, so that the street passes further.  When the construction of the <span>brick walls of the</span> White City began on the site of this rampart, they did not foresee the aforementioned gates.  This was supposed to be due to security concerns.  The gate, as you know, is the most vulnerable place of the fortress.  Thus, Bolshaya Dmitrovka began to be blocked by a wall.  The natural direction of the road was disturbed. </p>

    <h2>  History of house number 1 </h2><p>  In the seventeenth century, on the spot where the building of the Noble Assembly was located, the Volynsky estate was adorned.  The estate remained with the heirs of this boyar until the end of the 18th century.  Then, house No. 1 was transferred to the governor-general of the capital, Dolgoruky-Krymsky - the prince who married the daughter of the boyar Volynsky.  In 1782, three and a half hundred square fathoms of courtyards adjoining the burned St. George Monastery were added to the existing buildings.  In the same year, the famous Column Hall of the House of Trade Unions was erected for the new owner.  The author of the project was the <span>architect Kazakov.</span>  At the end of the era of noble courts, the structure of the Noble Assembly began to serve as a venue for concerts.  Almost all world celebrities have visited the stage of this hall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  St.  Bolshaya Dmitrovka is the location of many historical monuments of the capital.  Among them is the House of Trade Unions.  <span>This building,</span> which is an example of classical architecture, was erected in the eighteenth century.  The old manor still bears the status of the historical pearl of Moscow, and all thanks to the efforts of the builders, the talent of the architect and the reverent concern for this wonderful building.  This building is under state protection as an <span>architectural monument.</span> </p>

    <h2>  House number 2 </h2><p>  Bolshaya Dmitrovka Street was the residence of the Princes of Cherkassky.  Representatives of this large and noble family lived in house number 2 until the beginning of the seventeenth century.  In 1821, the building was reconstructed.  In 1869, meetings of the Artistic Circle began to be held within its walls.  Members of the latter were not only famous artists.  He was visited by Ostrovsky, Tchaikovsky, Pisemsky. </p><h2>  The fate of other buildings </h2><p>  On the street  Bolshaya Dmitrovka there were many large yards belonging to the princes Vyazemsky and Kozlovsky, the boyars Streshnev, Saltykov, Buturlin, Sheremetyev and others.  In the eighteenth century, they occupied almost the entire street, gradually crowding out the houses of representatives of other classes.  The only exception was the church priest.  The most extensive estate, stretching its possessions up to the street.  Tverskaya belonged to the Saltykovs.  The main building at number 17 is now occupied by the Nemirovich-Danchenko and Stanislavsky Theater.  Earlier, a beautiful garden was planted behind the house, which occupied almost a whole block. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolshaya Dmitrovka street" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/464521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Building number six </h2><p>  The first owners of the house were the princes Shcherbatov, then he went to the Solodovnikovs (merchants).  With the direct participation of the latter at the dawn of the twentieth century, the building was substantially altered at ul.  Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 6. The Operetta Theater, organized within the walls of the renovated building, still delights connoisseurs of the beautiful.  We managed to harmoniously place the most modern sound and lighting equipment in a classic, cozy, beautiful room. </p><h2>  Art Library on Bolshaya Dmitrovka </h2><p>  The Russian State Art Library is called the invaluable treasure house of Russian art and culture, as well as the country's leading scientific and information institution.  The formation of the architectural appearance of this structure took place in the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries.  The building is an example of mature classicism.  Its facade has survived to this day with minimal changes.  At different times, the estate was owned by N. E. Myasoedov and F. A. Tolstoy.  The latter had a rich collection of Slavic-Russian old printed books and manuscripts, which in 1820 he sold to the public library of St. Petersburg.  Soon after, the house itself went under the hammer.  From the beginning of the 1830s, he was listed with the Directorate of the Imperial Theaters.  Later, the capital's theater school moved to this building.  In order to expand, two more buildings were erected in the courtyard of the house and a dance hall was equipped.  At school, both students and teachers lived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolshaya Dmitrovka 6 operetta theater" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/464522.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Currently, the interior decoration of the first half of the nineteenth century, which is partially preserved in the building to this day, is especially protected. </p><h2>  Bolshaya Dmitrovka, 26 </h2><p>  The Federation Council has been at this address since 1994.  The complex of buildings appeared in 1983.  The architects Sverdlovsky and Pokrovsky worked on a responsible project.  The left building stretching along the street was subsequently rebuilt.  The right one was rebuilt from a preexisting building.  Initially, O. P. Leve lived in this building.  The construction of the house was carried out in 1884-1885.  according to the project of Zykov.  In the years 1934-1937.  it was turned in accordance with the then trend of constructivism. </p><h2>  Twentieth Century </h2><p>  In the early 1920s, Bolshaya Dmitrovka briefly became the street of Eugene Potier - the author of the International and an active participant in the <span>Paris Commune.</span>  In 1937 she was renamed Pushkinskaya.  This was connected with the centenary of the death of the great poet.  Only in 1994 did the street finally return its historical name. </p>

    <p>  Work on the arrangement of the pedestrian zone on Bolshaya Dmitrovka was completed in September 2013.  Its length is slightly less than one kilometer (900 m).  In the process of improving the streets, the facades of thirty-seven buildings were put in order, and signs and signs that were inadequate in size were dismantled <span>.</span>  The old streetlights were removed, in their place there were new, not connected to each other by hauling wires.  In addition, more than a hundred outdoor sofas and granite benches were installed, as well as 180 flower girls and 71 ballot boxes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Bolshaya Dmitrovka is the famous metropolitan street.  Currently, it is almost completely pedestrian.  Muscovites and city visitors love to walk along buildings that have absorbed the spirit of more than one era. </p>
