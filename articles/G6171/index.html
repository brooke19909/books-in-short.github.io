  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coin 15 kopecks 1982. Cost, features, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A coin of 15 kopecks in 1982 does not differ in high cost, since it was minted in a multi-million dollar amount.  The stamps that were used to produce such coins were often used, so money is practically of no value to collectors.  Only a small number of coins are made using new stamps.  They belong to the category of improved coinage and are of interest to numismatists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arc.violity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kopeks 1982 Price" class="if uuid-3162663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162663.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  A coin of 15 kopecks 1982, minted by the Leningrad Mint, is also called an ordinary.  The exact circulation is not known, but there is information that the number of coins is in the millions.  Money was made from a popular alloy of copper and nickel at that time, to which zinc was added in a small amount.  It has no magnetic characteristics.  The color is light gray.  Weight - no more than 2.5 grams. </p><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  At the top of the coin 15 kopecks (1982) is an indication of the face value.  The figure is located in the upper half of the circle.  The entire lower half of the coin is occupied by the inscription "cents" and the year the money was produced.  If the numbers showing the face value are sharp and have faces, then the year of production looks outwardly smoother and more rounded.  On two sides are wheat ears that come from two oak leaves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Of great interest is the obverse of the coin of 15 kopecks (1982).  The price is precisely due to differences in the obverse.  But more about that later, for now, let's figure out what is depicted on this side of the coin. </p><p>  So, the main and most part is, of course, the emblem of the Soviet Union.  This is a classic design for coins issued during this period.  In the center is an image of a planet on which a sickle and hammer are clearly visible.  From below, the Earth is heated by the rays of the sun.  Moreover, a coin of 15 kopecks (1982) shows only a small part of the Sun.  The rays are long and come close to the Earth. </p><p>  Round the coat of arms collected in ears of wheat stalks.  They are tied with a ribbon that connects at the bottom with a beautiful half band.  The number of ribbons is 7. If you count the number of bandages, then it will be equal to fifteen.  This symbolizes the number of union republics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coins.lave.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="15 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3162661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162661.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  From the right side of the globe, the ears of spikes have no spine.  This indicates the use of 15 kopecks (1982) stamp number 1 for minting a coin. It is much less common than others.  It is of great value, since coins are rare. </p><p>  The second type of postmark (number 2) was used to produce all other monetary units.  Such coins are very cheap; they are not valuable for collecting and numismatists.  Here the rays of the ears are longer and thinner, there are spines.  The coat of arms is slightly omitted in relation to all other images. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krsk.au.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cost 15 kopecks 1982" class="if uuid-3162664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3162664.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost 15 kopecks 1982 </h2><p>  Coins with a slightly depicted image of the coat of arms, as well as those with spikes without spikes, cost from three to thirty rubles.  Coins with stamp number 1 are considered to be more expensive. They already have noticeable spines on the stalks of ears, they have wider rays on the star.  The price of such coins will vary from eight hundred rubles and reach up to eleven thousand. </p><p>  Coins of "improved quality" cost from five hundred to five thousand.  For coins of 15 kopecks in 1982, a high price for defective monetary units is not peculiar.  As a rule, marriages are valued, but here the cost will be from one to seventy rubles.  Of course, the prices shown are not accurate.  Everything will depend on the safety and integrity of the mint products. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that such coins will not be expensive to sell.  Only a few succeed.  The large number of copies (more than a million) and the absence of any features (change of stamps during the year of production, pronounced marriages and the like) are to blame. </p>
