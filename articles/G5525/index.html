  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Historical background: ancient Slavs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancestors of the present Slavs, the so-called ancient Slavs, stood out from the vast Indo-European group that inhabited the entire territory of Eurasia.  Over time, tribes close in household management, social structure and language, united in a Slavic group.  The first mention of them we find in Byzantine documents of the 6th century. </p><p>  In the 4th-6th centuries BC  the ancient Slavs participated in the great migration of peoples - a large <span>migration process,</span> as a result of which they settled in the vast territories of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.  Gradually they divided into three branches: Eastern, Western and Southern Slavs. </p><p>  Thanks to the chronicler Nestor, we are aware of the main <span>East Slavic tribes</span> and the places of their settlements: in the upper Volga, Dnieper, <span>Western Dvina</span> and higher, Krivichi lived to the north;  from Volkhov to Ilmen there were Slovenes;  the Dregovichi populated the lands of Polesye, from Pripyat to Berezina;  Radimichi lived between Iput and Sozh;  near the Desna one could meet northerners;  from the upper reaches of the Oka River and downstream stretched the lands of the Vyatichi;  in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Middle Dnieper and Kiev there were glades;  Drevlyans lived along the Teterev and Uzh rivers;  Dulebs (or Volhynians, Buzhanians) settled in Volyn;  Croats occupied the slopes of the Carpathians;  the tribes of streets and tiverts ranged from the lower reaches of the Dnieper, Pozhuzhie to the mouth of the Danube. </p><p>  The life of the ancient Slavs, their customs and beliefs became clear during numerous archaeological excavations.  So, it became known that for a long time they did not depart from the patriarchal way of life: each tribe was divided into several clans, and the clan consisted of several families who lived together and owned common property.  Elders controlled the clans and tribes.  To resolve important issues, an assembly was convened - a meeting of elders. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Gradually, the economic activities of the families became isolated, and the clan system was replaced by <span>neighboring communities</span> (ruts). </p><p>  The ancient Slavs were sedentary farmers who grew useful plants, raised livestock, hunted and fished, knew some crafts.  When trade began to develop, cities began to emerge.  Glades were built by Kiev, northerners - Chernihiv, radimichi - Lyubech, Krivichi - Smolensk, Ilmen Slavs - Novgorod.  Slavic warriors created squads to protect their cities, and at the head of the squads became princes - mostly Varangians.  Gradually, the princes seize power and in fact become masters of the land. </p><p>  The same <span>chronicler Nestor</span> tells that such principalities were founded by the Varangians <span>Askold and Dir</span> in Kiev, Rurik in Novgorod, Rogvold in Polotsk. </p><p>  The ancient Slavs settled mainly in hillforts - villages near rivers and lakes.  The river not only helped get to the neighboring settlements, but also fed the locals.  However, the main occupation of the Slavs was agriculture.  They plowed plow oxen or horses. </p><p>  Cattle breeding was also significant on the farm, but due to climatic conditions it was not too developed.  The ancient Slavs were much more active in hunting and flight hunting - the extraction of wild honey and wax. </p><p>  According to their belief, these tribes were pagan - they deified nature and dead ancestors.  They called the sky god Svarog, and all heavenly phenomena were considered the children of this god - welders.  For example, Svarozhich Perun was especially revered by the Slavs, because he sent thunder and lightning, and also gave his protection to the tribes during the war. </p><p>  Fire and the Sun showed their destructive or beneficial power, and depending on this they were personified by the good Dazhdbog, giving life-giving light and warmth, or the evil Horse, burning nature with heat and fires.  Stribog was considered the god of the storm and wind. </p><p>  The ancient Slavs attributed to the will of their gods any natural phenomena and changes in nature.  They tried in every possible way to propitiate them with various festivities and sacrifices.  Interestingly, any person who wanted to do this could make a sacrifice.  But on the other hand, each tribe had its own sorcerer-sorcerer or wizard, who knew how to learn the changing will of the gods. </p><p>  The ancient Slavs did not build temples and for a long time did not create images of gods.  Only later did they start making idols - roughly made wooden figures.  With the adoption of Christianity, paganism and idolatry was gradually eradicated.  Nevertheless, the religion of our ancestors has survived to this day in the form of folk signs and agricultural natural holidays. </p>
