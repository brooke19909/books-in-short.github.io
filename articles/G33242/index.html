    <h2>  Brief definition </h2><p>  Talking about what functions the kidneys perform, the first thing is to give a full definition of this term.  It will be right.  The kidneys are a paired bean-shaped organ that regulates the chemical homeostasis of the human body.  And this happens due to the function of urination.  For the same reason, this organ is part of the <span>urinary system.</span>  It is located in the <span>retroperitoneal space</span> (to be more precise, in the lumbar region, on both sides of the spine).  And finally, the kidneys are the organ that plays the most important, main role in the process of urine production.  And this, as you know, is a liquid that contains substances that are essentially waste. </p>

    <h2>  Urinary fluid formation </h2><p>  Discussing what functions the kidneys perform, it is necessary to tell about this first thing.  Since the formation of urine is the main "duty" of this body.  Initially, water and other liquid are filtered through three layers of a glomerular filter (renal body, a kind of "sieve").  Mostly proteins and plasma pass through it.  Then primary urine is collected in the tubules.  Of these, the necessary body fluid is absorbed, as well as various nutrients.  The last step is called ‚Äútubular secretion‚Äù.  During this process, all substances unnecessary to the body pass from the blood to the secondary urine, which then accumulates in the bladder.  Simply put, everything that may be useful to us remains in the blood and is distributed throughout the vessels.  And harmful substances that can harm the body or provoke a disease, malaise, virus - come out in the form of urine.  Thus, it becomes clear why the kidneys are often called our filter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is interesting to know </h2><p>  What functions do the kidneys perform in addition to eliminating the final metabolic products from the body?  In fact, many.  There are five of them - excretory, homeostatic, metabolic, endocrine and protective.  The one described above is the first.  And I would like to draw attention to it. </p><p>  Interestingly, in 24 hours, about 1,500 (!) Liters of blood pass through our kidneys!  And few people know that about 180 liters of urine come out of them.  The figure seems incredible.  But really - 180 liters of urine from 1500 liters of blood.  However, this is only the initial stage.  Then the body absorbs water.  Total at the final stage, a maximum of two liters of urinary fluid is formed, which the person emits.  By the way, the composition of this liquid is as follows: 95% water and 5% solid solids.  But this, of course, is a normal person.  So, for example, in people with alcoholism, urine contains protein (and alcohol processing products).  This is due to impaired normal kidney function.  In alcoholics, these organs look terrible, and it was possible to find out during anatomy.  The kidneys are wrinkled, blackened, with yellowish spots and large swellings (overgrown connective tissue).  Such organs are not able to function normally.  As a result, all <span>poisonous substances</span> simply continue to remain in the blood.  And accordingly, the most serious diseases arise and develop, the worst result of which is a fatal outcome. </p>

    <h2>  Homeostatic and metabolic functions </h2><p>  These are also very important processes.  When discussing what function the <span>human kidneys</span> perform <span>,</span> one cannot forget about homeostatic and metabolic.  This body regulates blood metabolism, namely it removes excess ions and protons of bicarbonate from the blood.  In addition, it affects the balance of fluid in the human body, controlling the content of ions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And also the exchange of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, the breakdown of peptides, amino acids - this is what the kidneys do!  It is in this body that the beneficial vitamin D is converted to the D3 form, which is so necessary for a person to maintain a healthy immunity.  And the kidneys are actively involved in the process of protein synthesis.  So not only the formation of urine is the ‚Äúduty‚Äù of this body. </p>

    <h2>  Synthesis and Protection </h2><p>  This is the last thing to mention when talking about what function the kidneys perform in the body.  In addition to the above, this body is also involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, renin, calcitriol and erythropoietin.  In simple and understandable language, it helps to form various hormones and enzymes that are vital for us.  These substances regulate the pressure in the arteries, stimulate blood, maintain a balance in circulation and control the amount of calcium in the body. </p><p>  And finally, protection.  Here's another function that the kidneys have in a person.  With their help, there is a neutralization of various foreign substances (or simply harmful) that are in the body.  These are alcohol, nicotine, drugs and powerful drugs.  It is advisable to minimize the amount of these consumed substances.  Completely, of course, it will not work: if a person does not smoke or drink, he sometimes takes medications, and this also creates a burden on the kidneys.  So it's worth saving them.  To do this, you need to drink clean water (mineral water can be), green tea, piles of cranberries and cranberries, a drink of honey and lemon, parsley broth.  In general, fluids need at least 2 liters per day.  If you follow this simple advice, you will be able to maintain the kidneys in excellent condition and also prevent the formation of stones.  And it is also advisable to give up coffee, alcohol and soda.  It only destroys the kidney cells. </p>
