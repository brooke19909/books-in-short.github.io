    <p>  In this resort town is the Central estate of the Teberda Nature Reserve, on the basis of which there is a museum and a zoo.  Museum guides will not only acquaint their visitors with the nature of the reserve, but will also help them to truly love it with their interesting stories and stories.  The zoo is very different from the usual format for everyone - only a brown bear sits in a cage, and the rest of its inhabitants live in fenced meadows and hills of the reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No less interesting is a trip to a trout farm located in the village of Verkhnyaya Teberda.  Two species of trout and several other types of fish are bred here.  Those who wish can enjoy a variety of fish dishes prepared by experienced Caucasian culinary experts right in front of visitors. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The city of Teberda is the starting point for many hiking tourist routes that pass through the most famous and beautiful places that Karachay-Cherkessia is rich in. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  <span>The Teberda resort,</span> whose attractions are described above, is located in the eponymous biosphere reserve.  Filled with clean air, shrouded in sunlight, permeated by the murmur of rivers and streams, it invariably attracts travelers to their possessions year after year.  Over 1200 species of vascular plants, about 500 species of mushrooms, about 750 species of mosses and lichens, and about 100 species of terrestrial algae grow on the territory of this alpine reserve.  45 species of mammals run through the meadows and hills of the reserve, more than 220 species of birds fly into the sky, and numerous fish, reptiles and amphibians swim in rivers and lakes. </p><p>  One of the main highlights of the Teberda Nature Reserve is its many lakes, most of which are located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters above sea level.  Baduk Lakes are the most famous and beautiful natural reservoirs of this region.  Like most lakes of Karachay-Cherkessia, they are from 200 to 1000 years old and appeared as a result of melting glaciers.  Numerous rivers flow down from the snowy peaks along steep mountain slopes, forming huge rapids and mighty waterfalls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Sentin Temple </h2><p>  Fans of historical and architectural sights will love the excursion to the Sentin historical and architectural complex, which includes the temple itself and the buildings of the convent.  The Sentin temple, built by the Alans in the 10th century, is one of the oldest in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  This architectural complex is located in the mountains above the village of Nizhnyaya Teberda, the sights are perfectly preserved to our time, despite its more than venerable age.  The temple was built in the style of cross-domed architecture of limestone on the site of an ancient pagan sanctuary, its height is about 10 meters, the remains of frescoes dating from the 11th century are well preserved on the walls.  A female Orthodox monastery was built near the temple in the 19th century, which, unfortunately, was destroyed in the Soviet years.  Later, the nuns reconstructed part of the cloisters and the temple, slightly distorting, however, its original form. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof teberda" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35618/842998.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Shoan temple </h2><p>  The Shoan temple is another Christian shrine that Karachaevo-Cherkessia lurks in its mountains.  Built in the 10th century in the Byzantine tradition, it has preserved on its walls numerous inscriptions of various eras in Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Arabic, Greek, the remains of beautiful decorative painting, patrimonial sign-tamgas of the peoples of the North Caucasus.  Unfortunately, most of these artifacts that have come to us through the centuries can soon disappear forever, falling off the walls. </p><h2>  Jamagat Narzan </h2><p>  Holidays in Teberda involve walks in natural attractions in the vicinity of the resort.  One of the most popular tourist routes is a trip to the Jamagat Narzan - mineral springs located in the valley of the Goral-Kol River.  There are two ways to the source, however, most tourist groups use the one that runs along the former irrigation canal to the Jamagat river valley. </p>

    <p>  The tour route is simple, it is accessible to absolutely everyone.  A leisurely walk through the fields and forests will be completely tireless, filled with birdsong and the murmur of a river, warm sun and ringing air.  All kinds of shades of greenery of valleys and trees, bright colors of flowers and berries, grazing horses and cows, a crown of mountain peaks on the horizon and a high clear sky create a feeling of an unreal and fabulous picture, where travelers came by chance, passing through an invisible curtain between the worlds. </p><p>  Sources are located at an altitude of 1813 meters above sea level.  The water in them is slightly mineralized, pure, slightly carbonated and unusually tasty.  Legends make up its healing and youthful properties. </p><h2>  Shumka river and waterfall </h2><p>  For another interesting route, the starting point is Teberda.  Sights and legends will be revealed to travelers on a trip to the Shumka waterfall. </p>

    <p>  The excursion route passes first along the highway to Dombay, then along the bridge over the Shumku river - a small tributary of Teberda falling with noise down the stones, behind the bridge the path runs along the river between centuries-old firs and beeches of mixed forest.  Near the rocky coast, you need to go to the right bank of Shumka, from here a steeper climb begins.  Further the road requires attention and caution, because  Big boulders stand in the way.  To the right of the boulders is the steep Rock of Love, about which there is a sad and beautiful legend, telling about the tragic fate of two loving people.  From here, the waterfall is not yet visible, but its noise is already audible, amplifying with every meter.  And before the admiring gaze of travelers opens Shumka waterfall.  Powerful streams of water break down from a stone ledge and with a great noise heard throughout the district, fall from a 12-meter height.  There is no further way - it is cut off by almost sheer cliffs covered with lichen and moss.  Here you can just sit by the waterfall, breathing in the water dust raised by a cloud above a <span>stormy stream,</span> and enjoy the virgin nature of the gorge, gathering forces to move on the return trip. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karachay-Cherkessia" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35618/842992.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Dombai </h2><p>  Fans of skiing can go to Dombay, which is 20 kilometers from the city called Teberda.  How to get there  The fastest and easiest way is not a taxi, but you can also get there by bus.  Despite some shortcomings (queues on the ski lifts and a small number of slopes), Dombay is considered to be the pearl of the Caucasus.  Magnificent landscapes, hospitable residents and an atmosphere of tranquility and comfort invariably attract numerous guests to the resort. </p><p>  Mountain and beautiful Teberda!  The sights of this wonderful land, created by nature itself over many centuries and millennia, amaze with power and magnificence.  Clean air, healing springs, snowy peaks and flowering valleys are invariable components of a wonderful holiday in this famous Caucasian resort. </p>
