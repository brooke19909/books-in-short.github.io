    <p>  Numerous visitors to the resort village especially note its budget.  Compared to other places of rest in the Crimea, it has cheap accommodation and low food prices.  Anyone who can‚Äôt afford the South Coast or other elite places in Crimea, such a vacation is perfect.  Vitino (the resort's private sector also offers very low prices) is just a godsend for the tourist.  Although the infrastructure in the village is not very developed, this is quite enough for a comfortable stay.  This is a great place for children's health.  The coast is clean, the sea is shallow and warm.  There are no noisy youth here - and this is a big plus for those who prefer a relaxing holiday. </p><h2>  Pensions, recreation centers or the private sector </h2><p>  Popular places to stay in Vitino are the mini-hotel "By the Sea" (rooms from 1,200 rubles per day) and a small recreation center "Lazurnaya" (600 - 800 rubles per person).  The latter is designed to accommodate large companies, such as sports teams.  Isolated houses are located in an ecologically clean region. </p><p>  Quite contradictory reviews about the recreation center "Vitino" (Yevpatoriya).  But in general - this is not the worst option, especially if you like to relax in close proximity to the sea.  Service, food and accommodation with relative comfort are provided to the tourist. </p><p>  Available in Vitino and pensions.  From the noise of the city you can hide in a comfortable pension "Summer".  In 2017, the price is from 1 800 rubles.  per night for a double room. </p><p>  In a few minutes walk from the sea there is another wonderful private boarding house ‚ÄúAt Eugene‚Äù with pretty nice prices (from 1,000 rubles). </p><p>  It is very convenient and affordable to accommodate in the private sector.  Here there is housing from 300 rubles per person.  Of course, this will not be the first line.  But for 500 rubles you can find housing even near the sea.  Rent a cottage will cost 3 000 - 5 000 rubles.  But, as a rule, in such houses a large number of sleeping places are offered, so the cost per person will not be high. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Marina Grove" </h2>
