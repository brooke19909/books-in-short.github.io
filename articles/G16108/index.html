Also unhappy were the service people who ordered a wedding at the park hotel.  Guests arriving at the ceremony had to wait almost an hour until the waiters delivered all the dishes. </p><p>  After collecting information about the hotel, we can conclude that much still depends on the people.  Despite the wonderful living conditions and beautiful surrounding nature, the comfort of vacationers is largely due to the quality of service of the staff, and on this score, the opinions of visitors vary.  Make a conclusion and still come to rest in this wonderful place! </p>
