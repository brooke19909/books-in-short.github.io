    <p>  What did James Cook discover and who is he?  This question is of interest not only to schoolchildren, but also to adults who admire the strength of mind and courage of people of the past.  The future traveler was born in a simple Scottish family on October 27, 1728.  He was the fifth child, studied at school for five years, and then worked with a local farmer.  1746 was a turning point in the life of James: he got a young ship on a coal ship. </p><p>  Before telling what James Cook discovered, it should be noted that the young man in the service met the greatest people.  William Bly (better known as the legendary captain of the Bounty ship), George Forster, Joseph Banks inspired him to explore the <span>southern waters of the</span> Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans.  Before he organizes three expeditions and goes down in history as the discoverer of Australia, James is diligently studying the maritime industry, geography, mathematics and navigation.  The diligent sailor was noticed by the brothers-shipowners Walkers, who invited him to lead one of their ship.  However, Cook refuses and continues to serve in the British Navy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  James Cook is a navigator, a participant in the <span>Seven Years War,</span> who shows remarkable abilities.  He is noticed in the Admiralty, and this predetermines the further development of his career.  In 1768 he was assigned the Endeavor ship, on which he embarked on his first expedition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="James cook opening" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/304534.jpg" width="201"></div>

    <p>  What did James Cook discover in the south of the globe, a mysterious and unexplored corner?  It is worth noting that the pundits of that time believed that another mainland should be located there.  The famous captain set off in search of him.  Besides Australia, which he discovered on April 29, 1770, he mapped many more islands, the Great <span>Coral Reef.</span>  Cook carefully examined the coastline of the southern continent, gave the names of bays and bays, noted in the report places suitable for life.  With his light hand, the largest Australian port city of Sydney was later founded. </p><p>  We can safely say that James Cook discovered not just a new land, but a new era of colonization.  Not only geographers got a job, biologists discovered dozens of plant and animal species not previously known to science.  Great Britain replenished with new land, where she hastened to resettle dangerous criminals.  Romantics surged on the open continent, hoping to discover countless treasures, as in America, and find a new home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="James Cook the Mariner" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/304536.jpg" width="420"></div>

    <p>  James Cook, whose discovery is hard to overestimate, died during his third expedition at the hands of the natives.  During clashes with local residents, the captain got a heavy stone in his head.  The team was forced to retreat to the ship, leaving the body of the <span>great navigator</span> on the shore.  A few days later, the natives sent her the remains of the commander, who with great honor were put to sea. </p>
