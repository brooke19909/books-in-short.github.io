    <p>  In many video tests, Apple's smartphones look really better than many of the competing devices, but you can notice a lot of iPhone with cracked screens or at least with large pieces of glass missing around the edges after unsuccessful drops. </p><h2>  How much does it cost to replace glass on an iPhone 5, 5S and 5C? </h2><p>  Apple services offer replacing the screen of the iPhone 5C or 5 within three to five business days, and it will cost $ 269.  However, third-party repair services are available that are faster and more affordable.  In such services, you can replace the glass on iPhone 5 at a price of about $ 100. </p><p>  Fortunately, replacing the screen glass of your iPhone is actually very simple.  It will not cost so much if you do it yourself.  Most likely, you will save a huge amount compared to repairs through Apple or a specialized workshop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You have two options for replacing glass on a 5 iPhone.  A full screen section (entire display) will cost more (about $ 60), but it includes all connected components, such as the Home button, which greatly facilitates the entire repair process.  In fact, as soon as you disassemble the smartphone, you just need to disconnect the three cables, attach a new screen and fix it. </p>

    <p>  In addition, you can only buy one screen element - the glass itself, which can save you $ 30, but you will need to transfer the button and other components yourself.  It is advisable to purchase a whole display, this can be done in any online store. </p><p>  However, <span>replacing the glass on the iPhone 5S</span> at the price of one component will not work, as well as on the 5S - in these models you will have to change the entire screen. </p><h2>  Why is there such a problem? </h2><p>  <span>The iPhone</span> 5C and 5S <span>models</span> have a glass cover, a digitizer (the part of the display that responds to touch) and a basic LCD display built into one part.  This allows the device to be thinner, but it also means that its repair cannot be performed separately for each component (since often the working part must be removed along with the broken one).  This leads to the fact that restoration work is more expensive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For those who have significant technical knowledge and suitable tools, it is possible to conduct such work independently.  However, to replace the display (containing the built-in glass), you need to accurately identify your iPhone model (5, 5C or 5S).  Each of them has its own kind of screen, and you cannot replace the glass on a 5 iPhone with a part for the 5C model, and vice versa. </p><h2>  How to distinguish different models of iPhones? </h2><p>  Currently, the iPhone 5C and 5 are pretty easy to identify visually.  The iPhone 5C is the only one that has both a polycarbonate (plastic) surface and a 4-inch display in the center, and iPhone 5 is the only model with a Touch ID home button on the right. </p><p>  However, appearance is not a good identification method, especially when the devices cannot be compared with each other.  Therefore, it is best to check your iPhone for its unique model number, located on the back of the device, at the bottom. </p><p>  Smartphones iPhone 5C and 5S can also be differentiated by serial and serial numbers using the UltimateiLookup service and EveryMac application (available for iOS 5 and later distributions). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The serial number is not indicated on the outside, but it becomes available when connected to the computer on the Summary tab in iTunes, and is also visible in the Nano SIM card tray.  If the display works well enough to see the contents of the screen, the credentials can also be viewed in the General section&gt; About the program in the Settings application. </p><h2>  Various display details </h2><p>  Although from the consumer's point of view, the display in the iPhone 5C and 5S is the same - both have a 4-inch IPS touch screen with LED backlight with a resolution of 1136 x 640 and a density of 326 dpi, the LCD connectors in them are different. </p><p>  Therefore, if you decide to replace the glass on an iPhone (5, 5S or 5C) yourself, be sure to purchase spare parts designed specifically for your iPhone, preferably from an official manufacturer.  There are screens without guarantees, which are not as high quality as the original ones, and they can not only work poorly, but also easily fail. </p>

    <h2>  Display Replacement Warnings </h2><p>  It is worth noting that older models of iPhones usually have spare parts that are combined as one part for easier replacement.  At the same time, parts of the screen of the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S usually require a separate transfer of the main button, front camera, speaker and much more.  On the iPhone 5S, also when opening the device, it is very easy to break the ribbon cable that connects the Touch ID button to the board. </p><p>  The delicate opening of an iPhone and the transfer of small parts are complex and time consuming.  It is also necessary to pay close attention to detail and have sharp eyesight and dexterous fingers.  If the glass from the old screen is badly damaged, removing small fragments from it also significantly increases the risk of injury. </p><p>  The iPhone 5C and 5S display kits are only available with the home button, front camera, and other items pre-installed as a unit. </p>

    <h2>  Parsing a smartphone </h2><p>  How to replace broken glass on iPhone 5?  To disassemble the iPhone 5, you need to use a small star-shaped screwdriver to unscrew the small screws on either side of the Lightning port.  Remember to keep them in a safe place, as they are easy to lose. </p><p>  Use a sponge to remove the screen from the phone.  This may take effort, but if you use one hand to hold the case and the other to pull out the display, it usually comes out easily.  You can also use a plastic card or adapter to push the yielding screen. </p><p>  Be careful - you should not raise the display more than 90 degrees vertically, as you can stretch the cables.  Pay attention to the connection on the left side, there are three connecting wires.  They are hidden under the top metal plate inside our phone. </p><p>  This plate is held in place by three metal screws.  Unscrew them with a standard Phillips screwdriver and put them in a safe place.  Since they are very small in size, they can easily get lost. </p><p>  The plate contains special latches on the left side that push it to the left and then lift it.  You will need to make very little effort.  Do not push it - it should easily move away by itself. </p><p>  After that, you can see the three cables that you need to attach.  They overlap, so start the connection process from the top. </p>

    <h2>  Pin connection </h2><p>  To disconnect the connectors, use a plastic tray or flat-blade screwdriver and carefully pull them out. </p><p>  Your old screen goes blank as soon as you release the third connector.  Now you can replace the glass on the 5 iPhone with a new one.  Set the removed display aside and take a new one.  Align it to the top of the case, lift it vertically 90 degrees and insert the connector cables in the reverse order.  Lining them can be complicated, but it requires very little effort and should not take more than a couple of minutes. </p><p>  Now you can build your iPhone 5 on.  Fasten the metal plate, including the three small silver screws. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  Before closing the case and securing it, you should make sure that the iPhone 5 works without problems.  However, keep in mind that if the device remains partially disassembled, the Home button will not function yet.  However, the screen must be fully controllable.  If so, you managed to replace the glass on the 5 iPhone correctly. </p><p>  The last step is to close the case from above, check if the main button is working, and then reinsert the base screws. </p><p>  After that, everything is ready.  As you can see, the process is very easy.  Similarly, you can perform repairs and iPhone 5S.  Do-it-yourself replacement of glass in this model is similar, but you need to consider the fragility of its contacts and act very carefully. </p>
