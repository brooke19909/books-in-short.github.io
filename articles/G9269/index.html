Reliably establish his age is not possible.  It is generally accepted that in its modern form it has existed since the mid-seventeenth century, but ancient settlements and ancient settlements have existed in this place since time immemorial.  Anyone who wants to better understand Ukraine should go to Kharkov.  The sights of the city are not as famous as Kiev, but the city is very characteristic and expressive.  History has left an indelible imprint on its appearance, especially that part of it that has gone through the city over the past century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kharkov sights" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/266243.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Kharkiv city, attractions</strong> </p><p>  This is one of the most significant industrial, scientific and cultural <span>centers of Ukraine.</span>  Over the past century, he was constantly in the center of historical events, at the forefront of the blows of wars, revolutions, <span>industrializations and collectivizations.</span>  It was this turbulent historical turbulence that had a decisive influence on the external appearance that the city of Kharkov today has.  His sights to a large extent only illustrate the era that shaped it.  The worst war in the history of mankind has passed through Kharkov three times, in 1941 and 1943.  In many ways, it had to be rebuilt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kharkiv city attractions" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/266240.jpg" width="496"></div>  And its architectural appearance was formed largely in this post-war era.  But what has been preserved from the pre-war buildings deserves special attention.  These are Orthodox churches - the Annunciation, Assumption and Pokrovsky cathedrals.  Each of them is expressive and unique in its own way.  But there are a number of secular buildings and structures that Kharkov is rightly proud of.  Sights of this kind are especially relevant and interesting against the backdrop of fashionable architectural trends of the beginning of the twenty-first century.  This, of course, the famous Gosprom - a unique construction of the era of constructivism erected in the city in 1925.  It has been carefully restored, restored and continues to amaze the audience with its grandeur and unusual configuration of supporting structures and ceilings.  The railway station was also very expressive, built after the war in the characteristic style of the so-called <span>"Stalinist Empire"</span> .  Kharkov begins with it, the sights of which you can begin to explore directly from the forecourt. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kharkov sights station" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/266242.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  <strong>City Tours</strong> </p><p>  All the significant <span>sights of Kharkov</span> in one day to see is quite real.  Especially if you ask for help to make it one of the indigenous citizens who are not indifferent to their city.  Otherwise, you can skip something interesting and expressive.  For example, old buildings that are not striking at first sight, such as the House with Chimeras.  This is a unique Art Nouveau building with Gothic elements.  Another attraction is the Governor's Palace.  These buildings are among the few monuments that survived the war.  And the best way to start a city tour is from the central Freedom Square.  It is impressive in its scope and is included in the rating of the largest in the world. </p>
