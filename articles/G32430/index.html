However, tourists are surprised at the silence prevailing in the city and note its provincialism.  This is the main feature of Beethoven’s homeland: life here is measured, and no one is in a hurry. </p><h2>  Beethoven-haus </h2><p>  Ancient Bonn, whose attractions reflect its rich past, is located in the Rhine Valley, near Cologne.  Of course, the most famous resident of the former capital is a brilliant German musician who lived here before moving to Vienna.  In honor of Beethoven, a monument was erected on Munsterplatz Square.  It is curious that the initiator of its construction was another classic - Franz Liszt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bonn attractions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1700498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Beethoven Museum is also located in the city - this is the house where the composer was born, and now his personal items are stored here, including the clock that stopped after his death, notes and drafts.  Not a single lover of classical music passes by such an important cultural institution, which Bonn (Germany) is rightly proud of. </p><p>  On the ground floor of the building, everyone will be able to listen to the famous masterpieces, wearing headphones, and the museum souvenir shop offers to buy books that tell about Beethoven’s life, as well as CDs with his eternal works.  Every autumn, a music festival is held in the city dedicated to genius and gathering performers from all over the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bonner münster basilika </h2><p>  Calm Bonn, whose attractions are the subject of admiration for all tourists, is famous for the main Catholic cathedral depicted on the city coat of arms.  The Basilica of St. Martin, where the coronations of the rulers of Germany took place, appeared in the 13th century on the site of an ancient Roman temple, and it is simply impossible not to notice it.  From across the city you can see the 96-meter tower, soaring into the sky.  The unique structure enthralls all who are partial to beautiful architectural monuments.  The appearance of the basilica, where Gothic, Romanesque and Baroque styles are interwoven, is not inferior to the amazing interior decoration of the temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bonn germany" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1700521.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists get acquainted with relics of the early Christian period, which make a huge impression.  To the left of the city’s business card is a bronze fountain dedicated to the saint. </p><h2>  Marktplatz and Altes Rathaus </h2><p>  In the very center of the pearl of Germany is Market Square, the history of which dates back to the days when picturesque Bonn was a very small settlement.  The attractions of Marktplatz attract thousands of travelers who want to touch the past.  Now the oldest square is a busy intersection of city streets.  On it rises the famous town hall, built in the Rococo style.  A remarkable building, which remembers the most famous politicians who walked along its steps, is cast in gold and silver.  Each tourist considers it his duty to take a photograph against the backdrop of the recently restored colorful Altes Rathaus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cherry tunnel </h2><p>  Perhaps few people know, but Bonn (Germany) is a city where a unique cherry blossom festival is held each spring.  The streets of Breite Straße and Heerstrasse, on which sakura trees are intertwined, resemble paintings by painters, turning into a kind of pink tunnel over the road.  Flowering lasts only 10 days, and at this time the city is filled with thousands of admiring tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bonn city" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1700537.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nobody will give the exact date of sakura blossom, but most often this happens in mid-April.  Bonn, burning in pink, whose sights are created by nature itself, looks picturesque during the day and fantastic at night - in the light of flickering lanterns.  And when the petals fall to the ground, they cover the streets with a silk carpet. </p><h2>  Museum Mile </h2><p>  Tourists who come to the city of Bonn for cultural experiences will receive a lot of positive emotions from visiting the area called the Museum Mile.  The constellation of the famous exhibition halls is known far beyond Germany. </p><p>  The Museum of Modern Art, the Academic Art Museum, the Schumann Museum, zoological, local history and Egyptian museums are just a small list of what the city will offer tourists.  The cultural institutions of Beethoven's homeland can compete with institutions of this kind in Dresden or Berlin in their wealth. </p><p>  Created in 1981 by the feminist artist, the Women's Museum of Bonn is considered one of the most unusual.  The talented Marianna Pitzen, who learned from her experience how difficult it is for ladies to break into the world of art, decided to help the fair sex to make themselves public.  This is not only a spacious area with various expositions, but also a children's art studio and a decorative goods store. </p><h2>  Godesburg </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the city is the ancient castle of Godesburg, which is incredibly popular.  The defensive fortress, transferring to the Middle Ages, attracts both history connoisseurs and lovers who bind their hearts together by marriage in the walls of a fortification.  After the reconstruction, a popular restaurant with great views of the Rhine Valley opened in Godesburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bonn museum" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1700548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flughafen köln / bonn </h2><p>  In the suburban area of ​​Cologne is located one of the busiest <span>airports in Germany</span> - Flughafen Köln / Bonn.  Air gates operating around the clock have three runways that are used both for domestic flights and for international airliners. </p><p>  We can say that this is a whole complex consisting of 53 shops, restaurants, a post office, a business center, a doctor’s office and an ATM.  Arriving tourists can easily get to Cologne or Bonn by special aeroexpress trains that leave every five minutes.  In addition, the largest airport in the north-west of the country has a spacious car park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bonn airport" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1700549.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Bonn is a city I want to talk about for a very long time.  You can’t get acquainted with all its sights even for a week, so when planning your vacation, make sure to spend as much time as possible in the magnificent pearl of Germany. </p>
