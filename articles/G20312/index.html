The latter is also called the Centrepoint Tower.  This tower is the tallest in the city and the second tallest in Australia.  She takes second place in the southern hemisphere in terms of the height of the observation deck.  Its height is 309 meters. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-33.870451" data-lng="151.20875999999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/8/9/14389.png"></div><p>  Sydney Tower in Australia is included in the World Federation of Towers as one of the tallest in the world.  Today this place is a cult place for all tourists coming to Sydney. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikidata.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tower structure" class="if uuid-3079367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079367.jpg"></div><h2>  Sydney Overview </h2><p>  This city is the best example of how the most different styles of architecture can be combined.  Modern skyscrapers, rising above the city to a height of up to three hundred meters, are especially striking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The largest Australian city</span> is known for its beautiful attractions.  His famous opera house has become a symbol of all of Australia.  Due to its huge popularity, Sydney is often called the capital, although the true capital of Australia <strong>is</strong> Canberra. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jadensadventures.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sydney City" class="if uuid-3079322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079322.jpg"></div><p>  Sydney's main attractions: </p><ol><li>  Harbor Bridge <strong>is</strong> the largest bridge in the city and one of the largest among the arch bridges in the world. </li><li>  Sydney Tower <strong>-</strong> one of the highest towers of the Southern Hemisphere (in more detail later in the article). </li><li>  The Chinese Friendship Garden <strong>is a</strong> stylized park with artificial ponds and lotuses growing in them, waterfalls, as well as cozy gazebos and other facilities for visitors to relax. </li><li>  Sydney Observatory, which is both a scientific object and a museum. </li><li>  Sydney Aquarium <strong>-</strong> one of the largest aquariums in the state, opened in 1988 in honor of the anniversary of Australia (200 years). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiwand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chinese Friendship Garden" class="if uuid-3079338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079338.jpg"></div><h2>  A brief history of the tower </h2><p>  In 1970, a design project was created for the future Sydney tower, and construction work, according to the plan, began in 1975.  Access to the tower was closed to the public until 1981.  The total cost of construction work amounted to 36 million Australian dollars.  The author of the project <strong>is</strong> architect Donald Kron. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At first, the tower was owned by the AMR company (the type of activity is the supply of agricultural equipment from the best world manufacturers), which at that time owned the Centrepoint center.  The tower functioned as a telecommunications tower.  Then it, along with the shopping center, was bought by Westfield (in December 2001).  Since then, it began to be called the Sydney Tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.littleeats.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tower Restaurant" class="if uuid-3079351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079351.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Sydney Tower consists of three parts.  One of them, which is a closed observation deck, has a height of 251 m. From its height, an excellent view of the whole city.  About 20 meters higher is the second part <strong>- a</strong> platform with a glass floor.  This tower has a cozy restaurant, popular among tourists. </p><p>  Any part of the tower is available for inspection.  You can climb the stairs or on one of the three high-speed elevators.  On holidays, the Sydney Tower is decorated with various lights and fireworks. </p><p>  The total height of the Sydney tower, built in the form of a hyperboloid, is 309 meters.  Its top is visible anywhere in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the panoramas" class="if uuid-3079356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079356.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of viewing platforms </h2><p>  The main value of the Sydney tower (its photo is presented in the article) is the viewing platforms.  The lower platform with a glazed floor rotates smoothly, thereby allowing visitors to view the amazing panorama of the city from all sides.  From this place, a city with modern skyscrapers, an ocean with wonderful ships and yachts, the slopes of the Blue Mountains, visible in the distance, are well inspected.  There is a special display on the site that displays information about wind speed, pressure and temperature. </p><p>  Another area is suitable for visitors with stronger nerves.  By its design, it is retractable with a glass and completely transparent floor, creating the effect of soaring in space.  1954 steps lead to the second platform, but you can also take the elevator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maniamag.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The second observation deck" class="if uuid-3079353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3079353.jpg"></div><p>  This place is a fun ride called Skywalks.  Those who want to experience the thrill put on special overalls with insurance and for a whole hour walk at an altitude of 268 meters on the open roof area.  The most shocking in this walk is the very transparent floor through which you can see with trepidation the city below. </p><h2>  Other tower sights </h2><p>  Among other things, the Sydney Tower has several restaurants, among which the very popular institution of the same name - Sydney Tower.  A place with excellent cuisine and wonderful views of the urban landscape.  The restaurant is designed for 220 guests. </p><p>  The rotation speed of the tower is almost not felt, but the views from here are very beautiful.  It should be noted that the total number of windows on the eight-story part of the tower is 420. There are also cinema halls, souvenir shops and other establishments. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The main function of the Sydney Tower <strong>is the</strong> broadcasting of television and radio signals, but its functions are not limited to this.  To climb a bird's-eye view and enjoy stunning views of the city and its surroundings, high-speed elevators work here, as noted above.  It should be noted that climbing to the highest platform at maximum speed can take only 40 seconds. </p><p>  The famous Sydney Tower with a height of more than 300 meters is located near the central city business district, next to the equally popular Sydney hotels.  Admission is by tickets.  Their cost is 15-25 dollars. </p><p>  Daily work schedule: from 9:00 to 21:00.  On holidays, entry is from 7:00 to 20:00 (on Christmas from 10:00 to 18:00, on New Year <strong>'s</strong> from 9:00 to 19:00). </p><p>  Sometimes the tower is used to launch fireworks, and on New Year and Christmas holidays it is highlighted with colorful lights, creating a festive mood for the townspeople. </p>
