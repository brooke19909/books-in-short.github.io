    <p>  The Russian empire seriously lagged behind other European countries in the development of industrial industry.  The devastating Civil War further aggravated the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the early twenties, Chubar Vlas Yakovlevich headed the organizational bureau for restoring the industrial potential of the Ukrainian SSR.  The process is extremely difficult and problematic.  Mostly agrarian Ukraine suffered greatly from the Civil War and the intervention of the Western powers.  All industry was concentrated in the east of the republic, while in the west it was practically absent. </p>

    <p>  To acquire modern equipment, it was necessary to contact foreign companies.  Chubar is a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU (B.).  The new position actually brings him to the very top of the government. </p><h2>  Secretary General dissatisfaction </h2><p>  Stalin personally draws attention to Vlas.  The Secretary General was extremely dissatisfied with the work of Chubar.  This is evidenced by the secret letter of Stalin to Molotov and Kaganovich.  In it, he points to Vlas's frivolous attitude to work and his opportunism.  The message also mentions Stalin‚Äôs intention to remove the chairman from his post.  Meanwhile, the wife and children of Chubar Vlas Yakovlevich are moving to the capital.  And Vlas himself is becoming an increasingly significant figure in the Central Committee of the party. </p><h2>  Takeoff policy </h2><p>  After the final establishment of the Stalinist regime in the USSR, great changes began in the party. </p>

    <p>  Passes the famous seventeenth party congress.  It discusses the further development of the Soviet state for the next five years.  After this, large-scale purges in the ranks of the party begin.  By a resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU (b), Chubar was appointed Minister of Finance. </p><p>  However, the personality of Vlas is not liked by many prominent members of the Central Committee.  In particular, Kosior and Eikhe regularly report on Chubar's offenses.  Rumors are also spreading by Rudzutak and Antipov.  As a result, the people's commissar of finance does not have the best reputation.  This leads to an open meeting of the Central Committee, at which a decision is made to remove Chubar from his post. </p><h2>  Death policy </h2><p>  After the expulsion of Vlas Yakovlevich from the Central Committee, contrary to expectations, he was not immediately arrested.  Due to the lack of evidence, he is sent to Solikamsk to a lower position.  There he was to build a pulp mill.  However, such expulsion did not save him.  In July of the thirty-eighth, he was arrested. </p>
