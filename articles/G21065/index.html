    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Where to stay?  This is the first question that comes to mind for a person going <span>to Gelendzhik.</span>  <span>Holidays</span> with children in Gelendzhik should be comfortable.  Let's see what hotels the resort can offer for families with children. </p><p>  Various <span>hotels Gelendzhik</span> can offer <span>.</span>  Holidays with children are easily organized in more than 50 complexes of various classes.  At the same time, everything will be as it should: a shower and toilet in the room, breakfast if desired, in the territory of your own pool, gym, the possibility of hiring an animator or nanny for the child. </p><p>  The hotels located on the coastline offer their own comfortable beaches with sunbeds for their guests.  Actually, this option is the most comfortable and convenient.  But, as usual, and the most expensive in the resort of Gelendzhik.  Rest with children in Gelendzhik in hotels involves considerable expenses.  A room for a mother with a child in a middle-class hotel will cost at least 3 thousand per day.  Book rooms better in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Boarding houses </h2><p>  Gelendzhik resort is ready to offer not only expensive housing.  Pensions can make recreation with children quite comfortable, although the class is slightly lower than in hotels.  But the prices here will also be more affordable.  At the same time, meals in boarding houses are offered three meals a day, with home cooking.  It is worth noting that the cooking in most establishments is really delicious and the prices are quite reasonable. </p>

    <p>  The rooms have a shower, toilet, TV, small fridge.  Sometimes in the courtyard a small pool is built and a place for relaxation and children's games is equipped.  Such a room will cost about 1.5-2 thousand per person per night, depending on the chosen period and the capacity of the rooms.  You need to book your accommodation for several months.  For example, currently in the Gelendzhik boarding house there are practically no available rooms for the whole summer. </p><h2>  Guest houses </h2><p>  This is the most common <span>type of holiday</span> in the resort of Gelendzhik.  Holidays with children in Gelendzhik in the guest house will be quite comfortable, but it is better to carefully study the conditions offered by these houses.  Rooms can be single, double, triple or even more.  In addition, the shower can be located in the room, and maybe on the floor.  Not all guest houses can offer a dining room or cafe.  Many provide only a place for self-cooking and common utensils. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bed in the rooms will be changed every 10 days (or upon request).  All shower accessories, towels, bathrobes must be brought with you.  In the courtyards there is often a swimming pool, a small animal lives for the amusement of vacationers (parrot, peacock, ferret, monkey), there is a corner for children, barbecue.  But the cost of living will not be high, you can find good numbers, even at 1.5 thousand per room for three.  Bookings must be made in advance during the season.  From September to May you can come without prior arrangement. </p>

    <h2>  Private sector </h2><p>  Finding such rooms is very simple.  Many hosts approach arriving buses, place advertisements on the Internet and newspapers.  Most home owners have long equipped rooms and houses for holidaymakers on their sites.  The level of such rooms is completely different - from the "house-keeper" with a toilet in the yard, to the "comfort" with all the amenities.  But the kitchen is shared, the courtyard is landscaped to a minimum.  In most cases, this is just a place to spend the night in the resort of Gelendzhik.  Rest the private sector offers not too comfortable, but also inexpensive.  A place in a room without amenities ("economy") can cost from 400 rubles per day per season (June-August). </p><h2>  Savages </h2><p>  The least expensive vacation on any coast - rest savages.  Actually, this is practically the only type of vacation that Gelendzhik himself is not ready to offer.  Holidays with children in Gelendzhik with tents are not provided, since almost every meter of the beach is occupied with all kinds of ‚Äúentertainments‚Äù.  But this does not mean that it makes no sense to go there with tents.  You just have to drive a little out of town.  Just a few kilometers there is a great beach near Divnomorskom.  It is here that many put up tents on the shore to spend time alone with nature. </p><p>  Children like this vacation very much, because they are not too worried about amenities, but there can be more interesting meetings with the local flora and fauna than in the city.  And the sea around the clock around the clock is an obvious plus.  If you need to see the beauty of Gelendzhik - the city is nearby, in just a few minutes by car or taxi you can be in the city center.  In the season for billeting at the campground you will have to pay about 150 rubles per car and plus 100 rubles per person. </p>
