The unrest began with anti-government demonstrations that were brutally crushed by the Shah‚Äôs military forces.

    <p>  Defense of Achievements and Guardians of the Islamic Revolution </p><p>  As in many states that survived a government coup or revolution, pro-Islamic forces still remained in Iran, and there was a real threat of counter-revolution.  To protect the new leader of the country and his government, the so-called Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was created.  It was formed from paramilitary groups that arose during the revolution. </p><p>  Prop mode </p><p>  The corps of guardians of the Islamic revolution over time did not leave the stage of history, but only strengthened its influence and became a kind of alternative army, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="border guard corps" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/265616.jpg" width="590"></div>  intended to protect the state.  In 1982, the <span>organization‚Äôs charter</span> was approved <span>,</span> which once again confirmed that its main goal was to protect the achievements of the revolution (that is, the current regime in the country), as well as maximize the spread of Islamic domination, strengthen the defense potential of Iran and the military readiness of the people's militia.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has a very ramified structure.  The organization of the entire army divides it into 31 territorial corps - one in each region of the Iranian republic.  The composition of its <span>ground forces</span> includes about 100 thousand people.  The remaining units are the IRGC naval forces, the air force and the border guard corps.  The <span>militia,</span> called here "Basiji", is also subordinate to the formation.  The IRGC is armed with artillery systems, armored vehicles, chemical weapons, and <span>combat aircraft.</span>  Moreover, government funding for this corps is even higher than that of the official army.  All corps fighters pass </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guards of the islamic revolution" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/265615.jpg" width="512"></div>  rigorous psychological selection, and, once in the detachment, are subjected to massive ideological processing.  To die for the cause of the Islamic revolution is not an empty phrase for them.  It is morale that is an important advantage of this formation over the armies of many secular states, where motivation is limited mainly to material wealth.  The soldiers of the IRGC are fanatics in the very literal meaning of the word.

    <p>  Participation in hostilities </p><p>  During its existence, the Corps of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution managed to participate very actively in the Iran and Iraq war, in the 1980s, in the civil <span>war in Lebanon,</span> in Syria, in the conflict in northern Iran with the Kurds and in Balochistan.  In addition, the corps is directly related to the formation and further support of the Hezbollah group. </p>
