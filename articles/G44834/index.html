And still they do not cease to be amazed at its mysterious deserts and mountains, the beauty and scope of temples, the luxury of civilization, the theological depths.  And what is the sea here - is it possible somewhere else to meet such colorful fish, similar to tropical flowers, flickering among corals?  In order for tourists to enjoy all this in full, there are chic resorts on the Red Sea, where hotels are built for holidays in Egypt.  What tourists say about them, you will find out if you read the information below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="icomts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hotel Reviews" class="if uuid-2263628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2263628.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels of the Red Sea </h2><p>  The popularity of Egypt as a resort is due to many factors.  Not the last place is occupied by the fact that it is in this country, like in no other, that you can combine rest on the beach and acquaintance with amazing historical monuments.  Reviews of hotels in Egypt are very diverse and often ambivalent, but one can draw such a conclusion.  Here, a rich man and a man with a very modest budget can easily find a place to have a great time.  And how many various excursions do tourists offer in Egyptian hotels?  And a desert safari in jeeps or ATVs, and a sunset meeting in the mountains with dinner and dancing by the Bedouins, and a boat trip on the Nile, and a trip to Luxor, Cairo or Alexandria.  But experienced people are advised not to succumb to the entreaties of the hotel guide.  All organized trips are best bought at travel agencies on the street.  You will be provided with the same services, but much cheaper.  In addition, from the hotels of Hurghada it is easiest to get to the famous pyramids and temples of ancient Egypt.  And Sharm El Sheikh will provide you with a great opportunity to visit Israel and Jordan inexpensively. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kempinski.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hotels 5" class="if uuid-2263630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2263630.jpg"></div><h2>  Country Hotels Features </h2><p>  Egyptian resorts are somewhat different.  If the hotels of Hurghada are mainly stretched along the sea - that is, they are on the ‚Äúfirst line‚Äù and their beaches are usually their own, then in Sharm El Sheikh even some of the ‚Äúfives‚Äù are located far from the coast.  Therefore, the cost of rest in these hotels includes a transfer.  The vast majority of resort hotels have free use of sun loungers, towels and umbrellas.  4 and 5 star hotels on the beaches often have a bar.  Hotels consist of one or two main buildings, but often there are "bungalows" or "villas" on the territory.  The resort cities of the country, as a rule, are stretched along the sea and divided into several areas.  Sometimes desert areas lie between them. </p><p>  In their reviews, tourists are advised not to pay attention to the location of the hotel relative to the geographical center.  The fact is that the most interesting places were often formed near large hotels, and there will definitely be something worth visiting near you.  And in other places you can quite get on Egyptian minibuses or inexpensive taxis.  However, experience shows that tourists still spend most of their time on site.  Therefore, in reviews of hotels in Egypt so much attention is paid to amenities.  Indeed, it often depends on them how successful your vacation will be. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunshine.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurghada Hotels" class="if uuid-2263634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2263634.jpg"></div><h2>  Zvezdnost Hotels and Services </h2><p>  Some tourists, having come to rest in this country, then begin to write disappointed reviews about hotels in Egypt.  The fact is that people often have high expectations.  The class of hotels here is not assigned according to international standards, but according to the special rules of the Ministry of Tourism.  Therefore, "stardom" is somewhat subjective.  If the hotel management is not foreign, but local, then often you will have to run to the reception and ask for cleaning or replacing towels.  Even if it is a "five".  It‚Äôs best not to scandal, but be patient and talk politely.  It is appreciated here. </p><p>  Tourists also warn that if you want to be provided with some kind of unforeseen service, then you should not give a bribe to staff.  Better to thank them later.  This is already legal and is called "bakshish". </p><p>  The most common category of hotels in this country is ‚Äú4‚Äù.  Most of the reviews about hotels in Egypt, which tourists leave, confirm that the system of "all inclusive" is adopted there.  But often hotel owners change managers, and they begin to work in a new way.  Therefore, sometimes hotels with a good reputation can suddenly change the quality of services for the worse, and vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="elgouna.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Holidays Hotels" class="if uuid-2263644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2263644.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory and food </h2><p>  If you like comfort, then only 5-star hotels in Egypt will provide you with the necessary luxury.  A huge territory, often decorated in the form of a tropical garden, Aladdin‚Äôs palace or a fabulous eastern city, playgrounds and clubs, water parks, fun and varied animation, gourmet food - all this awaits you in the best hotels of the country.  But, reading reviews of hotels in Egypt, including the most expensive, you will understand another feature.  Since all resort hotels are surrounded by desert, there is nowhere to grow fruit.  Therefore, their choice even with an all-inclusive power system will be limited.  The food in the hotels is not bad - it is a kind of ‚Äúmixture‚Äù of Arabic and European cuisine.  You will not see such a variety of tastes as in Turkey.  The side dish is mainly served with legumes, eggplant, rice, potatoes.  Of the meat, most often you will see chicken, chopped meatballs from a mixture of lamb and beef - ‚Äúkyufte‚Äù.  In good hotels on the street they will make a grill, where they cook both fish and seafood.  But alcohol can often be diluted. </p><h2>  Most popular tourist hotels </h2><p>  So, we already realized that when choosing a resort you need to get familiar with the reviews about hotels in Egypt.  Those who like diving, it is better to choose hotels where there are special clubs or instructors, and the price includes at least the first dive.  People who come to see the fish should ask if there is a good reef near the hotel's beach.  And for those who come with children, you must definitely get to where there is a water park or at least a few slides.  And tourists themselves differently understand what rest is.  Reading reviews of hotels in Egypt, you understand that for some, good food is important, for others - the beach, and for someone - a transfer to a cheap market or excursions.  Nevertheless, there is a list of hotels most popular with Russian tourists.  In Hurghada, the first three places are occupied by Dessert Rose, Mercure and Dana Beach, and in Sharm El Sheikh - Reef Oasis, Rehan Royal and Rixos. </p>
