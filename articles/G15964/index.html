The guest rooms are generally called relatively comfortable, equipped with a TV, air conditioning, a comfortable bed. </p><p>  The bathroom has a hairdryer, usually all appliances are in working order, although some complain of damage.

The territory is covered with fine sand, but when entering the sea you can stumble on stones. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews recommend not to be too lazy and walk to the Cleopatra beach (it will take 40-45 minutes to walk on foot).  This beach all tourists do not get tired of praising.  It is very beautiful, clean, the water is clear, a pleasant entry into the sea.  You can use sunbeds with umbrellas for a fee (inexpensive), but you can sunbathe and lying on a towel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guests who have left reviews about Alanya Pera Inn Hotel 3 * hotel (Alanya) characterize the restaurant rather ambiguously.  According to them, throughout the entire time spent at the resort, they try every day to diversify their leisure time: they either sunbathe on the beach or attend various excursions, but they only return to the hotel to eat and sleep.  Alanya, vacationers share, is a truly chic resort.  But the Pera Inn Hotel is considered by many to be an institution for very unassuming tourists.  Guests consider the hotel's advantages to be a convenient location, the presence of friendly staff, large rooms and balconies.  As a minus indicate the lack of a hotel own beach, territory and animation, poor quality food and bad alcohol.  Those who appreciate comfort and decent service are recommended to choose another hotel. </p>
