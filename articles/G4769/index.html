Today, plastic has moved to a new level, and modern prepaid bank cards have appeared.  What is this new product about?  What advantages and disadvantages does it have?  Let's consider in more detail in the article. </p>

    <h2>  What is a prepaid card? </h2><p>  When using this product, the client does not conclude a transaction with a financial institution, according to which he receives a loan in the form of cash.  In this case, the user can manage his own money, which was previously paid by him to the balance of a prepaid bank card.  Thus, it is quite simple to understand the principle of operation of modern plastic.  In order to issue it, the client just needs to visit the bank branch, open an account in it and deposit a certain amount of money into it.  After that, the deposit can be replenished at any time for any amount.  By and large, a prepaid bank card is an ordinary product, thanks to which it is much more convenient to pay in stores or make purchases online. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Distinctive features </h2><p>  This card is used by individuals and, by and large, is an imitation of how the bank makes payments using previously received financial resources.  In this case, money can be contributed by both the holder of this instrument and a third party.  If we talk about the main distinguishing features of this means of payment, it is worth paying attention that in this case no personal data is indicated on a plastic medium.  Accordingly, the surname, name and patronymic of its holder will not be accessible to strangers.  Thus, there is no factual link to an individual. </p><p>  Thanks to this, a prepaid bank card can be transferred to other individuals.  This is very convenient if, for example, you need to donate money. </p><h2>  Varieties of prepaid cards </h2><p>  These products are classified based on various criteria.  For example, today you can order a prepaid card with the possibility of replenishment or without such a service.  In addition, a virtual or real card is available to bank customers.  Consider some of these points in more detail. </p>

    <h2>  With and without replenishment </h2><p>  Based on the wishes of the client, he can deposit additional funds to the card.  However, some prefer to restrict access and prohibit replenishment.  If the choice falls into this category, then in this case there is no need to confirm the identity of the user.  In addition, when opening a card without replenishment, you do not need to open a bank account.  Thus, you can apply for a prepaid gift bank card, which will then be used by another individual who does not have an open account with a financial institution.  It is very comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the client prefers a rechargeable card, then in this case opening an account is mandatory.  In addition, the card product number must be linked to the holder‚Äôs account.  However, in this case, no personal information about the owner of the plastic is indicated.  Balance replenishment can be implemented in any convenient way. </p><h2>  Virtual or real </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about cards that are issued at the time of application.  Some of them are used exclusively in a virtual network.  It is very convenient for paying for goods and services online.  Also, a real card can be issued for payment, which outwardly almost does not differ from a standard credit card (with the exception of indicating the surname and name of the holder). </p>

    <p>  However, they can also be replenished or non-replenished. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Speaking about what a prepaid bank card means, one cannot but mention the negative points. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that prepaid cards are most often issued only in a low class, that is, Maestro or Electron.  In addition, there is a certain law according to which money deposited on such carriers is not insured.  In addition, in case of loss or theft of the card, the client has no right to block it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that such electronic media are often blocked in a situation where a client tries to pay in a store that is located abroad.  In addition, when traveling there may be certain problems when booking hotels or renting a car. </p><p>  Among other things, this type of card does not imply a loan in case the client does not have enough balance to pay for services.  A prepaid document cannot be reissued. </p><p>  Another important minus is that the maximum limit on the card is 100 thousand rubles.  In this case, no more than 40 thousand rubles can be deposited on an electronic medium every month.  In addition, it is not possible to make anonymous transfers between individuals. </p><p>  It is worth noting that to date, prepaid cards are mainly used only as gift options.  This means that not every financial institution issues such products.  For example, VTB 24 prepaid bank cards are not currently issued.  The same goes for many other financial institutions. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  If we talk about the advantages of obtaining such a carrier, then it is worth paying attention to the fact that when issuing prepaid bank cards, no additional information and certificates from the place of work, confirmation of wages and much more are required. </p>

    <p>  In addition, as already mentioned, previously to obtain such a product, it is not necessary to open a bank account.  This means that no conclusion of the contract is required, as well as payment for card activation or one-year maintenance.  This means that the client can be sure that he will not have any debts over time. </p><p>  In addition, in this case there are no any interest that will be charged for services that the client absolutely does not use.  Among the advantages, many note the convenience of use, since such cards are accepted in most stores, as well as online.  To date, there are banks that produce such products.  Consider the most popular offers. </p><h2>  "Russian standard" </h2><p>  This bank has long established itself as one of the most popular financial organizations providing loans. </p><p>  Among the numerous services of the bank there is also the possibility of issuing a virtual prepaid bank card.  In this case, you can deposit rubles, dollars or euros into the account.  When buying tickets or paying for a hotel, no additional conversion is planned in the Russian Federation or abroad. </p><p>  At the same time, a card can be issued online without an additional issue fee.  And if we talk about limits, then the maximum possible amount by which cards are replenished is 30 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  If the client goes through identification procedures, then the available limit rises to 100 thousand rubles.  At the same time, many users note that during registration you can choose an individual card design or create an original gift wrap for it.  No additional documents are required for product design.  The cost of the card is equal to the limit amount.  At the same time, a choice of cards for 1, 3, 5, 10 or 15 thousand rubles is available.  At the same time, getting a prepaid bank card in Irkutsk or any other city in the country will not be difficult. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that at the same time Visa or Mastercard systems are supported.  If the client wants to increase the maximum limit to 100 thousand rubles, then in this case he must provide a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  "AK Bars" </h2><p>  This bank uses the transport application, thanks to which it is possible to pay for trips made by public transport in most cities.  In this case, the client can draw up an non-renewable card, the face value of which is from 500 to 15 thousand rubles.  And there is also a replenished version of the card, however, in this case, the provision of identification documents is mandatory.  In this case, the maximum card limit is increased to 100 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Svyaznoy Bank </h2><p>  The offer of this financial institution is called the ‚ÄúBest Buy Card‚Äù.  At the same time, the maximum balance can reach 15 thousand rubles.  To do this, the client does not need to open an account or provide additional information about himself.  You can replenish the card in any way possible. </p>

    <p>  The only drawback is that it is impossible to withdraw cash.  A nice bonus is that in the process of paying for goods and services, a certain bonus is credited to the card in the amount of 1 to 20% of the amount spent. </p><h2>  "Alfa Bank" </h2><p>  The prepaid cards of this bank are in great demand at the offices of commercial enterprises and when using private individuals.  To apply for plastic media, it is necessary to pay for the selected face value, after which a special envelope with a PIN code and an additional security password will be provided to the client.  After this, Alfa-Bank prepaid bank card can pay for services on the Internet or transfer it to third parties. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><p>  The largest bank in Russia also produces prepaid cards.  It should be noted that plastic works with the VISA payment system, its maximum face value is 15 thousand rubles.  As in other cases, no identification documents are required to complete the product. </p>

    <p>  Sberbank prepaid bank cards are widely used to pay for purchases in retail chains or online stores.  At the same time, you don‚Äôt have to pay anything for plastic maintenance.  The card is valid for 1 year. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  This product is really very convenient and has a lot of advantages.  The only thing you need to pay attention to is not to draw up such cards in dubious organizations.  It is worth giving preference to large financial organizations.  But not everyone is releasing this product.  For example, it is impossible to get a prepaid bank card at VTB today. </p>
