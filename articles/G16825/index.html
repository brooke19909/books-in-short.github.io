For this reason, in the current article we will present to the reader a detailed description of the most popular models.  Making them at home is much easier than it seems at first glance.  You just need not be afraid to try. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Before you start knitting any product, you need to prepare yarn and knitting needles.  The material must be selected, focusing on the purpose of the thing, as well as the selected pattern.  You should not knit a light cardigan from thick woolen threads; in openwork, it is not recommended to use variegated yarn.  The tool is preferable to a metal one and a half times wider than the thread.  In addition, experienced knitters advise beginners to make a pattern before starting work.  Yarn and knitting needles should be used the same as in the conceived product.  Otherwise, knitting a cardigan, which will definitely fit the figure, will fail.  After this, the sample should be measured in length and width, and then count the number of rows and loops.  Divide the number of rows by length - A, and the number of loops by width - B. As a result, we will be able to find out how many loops and rows are per 1 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit cardigan" class="if uuid-2884116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884116.jpg"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To knit a cardigan with knitting need to determine the parameters of the model or customer.  It is very easy to do.  You need to arm yourself with a centimeter, a simple pencil and a paper sheet.  Then measure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  cardigan length - B; </li><li>  armhole height - G; </li><li>  chest girth - D; </li><li>  shoulder width - E; </li><li>  neck width - W; </li><li>  sleeve length from the lower edge to the tip of the shoulder - Z; </li><li>  sleeve length from the bottom edge to the armhole - And; </li><li>  girth of the widest part of the hand - K. </li></ul><h2>  Convert centimeters to loops </h2><p>  Knitting a product, constantly comparing it with the previously defined parameters, is extremely inconvenient.  Therefore, it is very important to pre-calculate the number of loops and rows.  This technology is not familiar to beginners, so we will also pay attention to it in the current article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan knitting" class="if uuid-2884123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884123.jpg"></div><p>  Earlier, we already calculated the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor one centimeter.  Now you need to find out the number of loops for: </p><ul><li>  a set of backs, multiply parameter B by 1/2 of parameter D; </li><li>  set before, multiply parameter B by 1/4 of parameter D; </li><li>  set of sleeves, multiply parameter B by parameter K; </li><li>  to knit out the armholes on the back, subtract from the loops to set the back of the set of numbers - parameter B and parameter E; </li><li>  knot the armholes at the front, subtract from the loops to set the front also the set of numbers, divided into two; </li><li>  the design of the gate on the back, the parameters B multiplied by the parameter G; </li><li>  clearance of the front gate, a set divided into two. </li></ul><h2>  Convert centimeters to rows </h2><p>  Having determined the above values, many knitters begin to study instructions on how to knit a cardigan with knitting needles.  However, first you need to calculate the number of rows.  To: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Make the desired length of the product, multiply parameter A by parameter B. </li><li>  In time, start rounding the armhole, multiply parameter A by parameter G. </li><li>  Distribute the "extra" loops for the armhole, multiply parameter A by the difference in parameters B and D. </li><li>  Make a sleeve of the desired length, multiply parameter A by parameter Z. </li><li>  In time, start the upper edge of the sleeve, multiply parameter A by parameter I. </li><li>  Distribute the "extra" loops to form the upper edge of the sleeve, multiply parameter A by the difference in parameters Z and I. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting cardigan step by step" class="if uuid-2884135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884135.jpg"></div><h2>  Armhole dressing </h2><p>  Most beginner knitters note that the most difficult step in knitting an item for the upper torso is to perform an armhole.  After all, only professionals can cope with the task, almost without thinking.  Beginners also need instructions, without which it will not be possible to knit a cardigan with knitting needles, like a crochet.  Therefore, in this paragraph, we consider the technology of dressing armholes: </p><ol><li>  It always starts the same way - in the right row from the edge, six loops are closed. </li><li>  In the next two rows, five more are reduced. </li><li>  Next, two rows of four. </li><li>  The remaining loops decrease in descending order, trying to evenly distribute in the last rows. </li></ol><p>  It is important to note that the execution of the backrest involves the reduction of loops on each side.  While the front, consisting of two mirror shelves, left and right, is framed by two armholes on each individual part. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Knotting the upper part of the sleeve </h2><p>  The traditionally studied product has long sleeves.  To make them beautiful, you should start the canvas with elastic.  Better one on one.  It is also necessary to mention that a beautiful cardigan for women, knitted with needles, suggests harmoniously inscribed sleeves.  This is much easier to achieve than it might seem.  You just need to tie the sleeve in the same way as before the armhole.  The only difference is that after all the decreases, six loops should remain on the spoke.  Which subsequently the knitter will close.  Therefore, when distributing excess loops, it is important to consider this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.facebook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardigan description" class="if uuid-2884139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884139.jpg"></div><h2>  The design of the gate on the back </h2><p>  And one more difficult stage for many, we will describe in detail in the current paragraph.  To the reader knitting brought only pleasure.  So, to arrange the gate on the back, you must: </p><ol><li>  Seven rows before the end of the product, separate the number of loops allocated to the desired part. </li><li>  After that, select twelve loops in the middle and close them in the usual way. </li><li>  Each strap we will knit separately.  Therefore, one of them is transferred to an additional spoke or fixed with pins. </li><li>  Next, we distribute the remaining number of loops into six rows, so that you can "get rid of excess" as it decreases. </li></ol><p>  The described actions will help to knit a cardigan with knitting needles for a woman with a round collar.  But this is only about the back.  In front you can make a different shape.  For example, a traditional V-shaped. </p><h2>  Gate design on the front shelves </h2><p>  There are many models of cardigans.  However, the most popular ones have button fasteners.  Therefore, when performing the transfer, it is important not to forget to make holes along the edge.  In addition, start tearing the gate in time.  The level can be determined independently.  But in the classic version of the product, the lower edge of the collar is located under the chest.  Having dealt with the desired parameter, determine its height using a centimeter.  After using the technology described earlier, we calculate the number of rows that separate the lower edge from the corner of the goal.  After that, we knit the product with an even cloth to the desired level.  And then evenly distribute the loops on the remaining rows. </p><p>  A more modern round collar is found in new cardigan models.  Knitting such a product is not difficult.  It is necessary to be guided by the instruction described in the previous paragraph.  However, start the rounding fifteen rows to the end. </p><h2>  Fitted cardigan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful cardigan knitting" class="if uuid-2884893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884893.jpg"></div><p>  To associate the following model of the studied product at home, it is necessary to measure the waist of the person on whom the cardigan is knitted before starting work.  After that, calculate the number of extra loops by multiplying parameter B by the waist circumference.  It is important to consider that half of the obtained value is required for the back, and the fourth part for the front shelves. </p><p>  Then we determine the number of rows between the bottom edge and the waist.  Evenly distribute the extra loops and gradually knit out the desired part of the product.  Next, we need to add the loops again.  To do this, add the reduced loops in the same way.  And we tie to the armhole with an even cloth.  A similar knitted cardigan for beginners can be difficult to perform.  And experienced knitters recommend first practicing on a simplified version.  We will study it further. </p><h2>  Simple seamless cardigan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a cardigan" class="if uuid-2884894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884894.jpg"></div><p>  This product is noteworthy in that it is knitted with a single fabric and does not require knitting of the armhole.  Therefore, ideal for beginners.  Its technology is pretty simple: </p><ol><li>  Initially, we gain the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  We knit with an even cloth, moving back and forth. </li><li>  Having reached the armholes, we divide the back and two front shelves. </li><li>  And we tie most of it to the shoulders.  Do not knit the gate! </li><li>  Then we carry out the shelves.  Do not forget to make holes for buttons, if provided. </li><li>  Approximately from the chest, we begin to reduce the hinges for the gate, smoothly mowing the line. </li><li>  Having finished before, we sew the details along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  After that we take a hook and we gather around a circle armholes of a loop.  And the quantity on both sides should be the same. </li><li>  Transfer the loops to the hosiery knitting needles and knit in a circle the desired length of the sleeve. </li><li>  Then, if desired, we knit a small elastic band. </li><li>  Add buttons sawn fasteners. </li></ol><p>  That's the whole description of a knitted cardigan, which differs from the others in the minimum number of seams and the absence of a round armhole. </p><h2>  Peplum Cardigan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself cardigan" class="if uuid-2884897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2884897.jpg"></div><p>  Sweatshirts, blouses, etc., look very impressive with a "skirt" along the bottom edge.  Such products are especially suitable for girls with curvaceous forms.  They are performed by a single canvas.  Knitting such a cardigan is much easier than it might seem.  Especially thanks to the instructions below: </p><ol><li>  The first thing you should do is loop.  Depending on the puffiness of the Basques, their number varies.  For the classic version, professional knitters are advised to gain one and a half to two chest girths.  Therefore, we calculate the required number of loops in the manner described earlier and proceed to creativity. </li><li>  The canvas should taper to the waist.  Therefore, about ten rows to its level, we begin to sharply decrease the loops. </li><li>  To leave the waist area necessary for the design, we calculate the number of loops for this parameter as well. </li><li>  Having narrowed the canvas to the desired width, we knit 3-5 rows of the current number of loops. </li><li>  Over the next fifteen rows, you need to add as many loops as you need to cover your chest. </li><li>  We arrange the upper part of the product at our discretion. </li></ol><p>  There are many models of knitted cardigans.  Making each one yourself is a snap.  But when choosing a style and pattern, it is important to consider your own parameters.  Professional makeup artists advise you to go shopping first and try on a few finished products. </p>
