    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In order not to make a mistake in choosing a hotel, be sure to read the reviews about the Riu Palace Hammamet Marhaba 5 * hotel.  Tunisia, Hammamet is a rather specific tourist destination, and therefore you can be prepared for some shortcomings.  Based on the comments of travelers, the following negative points can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  the buffet menu has a limited number of fish dishes (nevertheless, the variety of meat types compensates for this drawback); </li><li>  there are practically no green spaces on the territory, which further aggravates the feeling of heat; </li><li>  in the midst of the holiday season, the hotel is undergoing renovations (it was necessary to close the establishment for a while or to postpone the restoration); </li><li>  the beach is cleaned only in the morning, and during the day candy wrappers, cigarette butts and other garbage accumulate on the sand; </li><li>  there is no infrastructure and places for walking near the hotel (you will have to walk at least 15 minutes to the nearest store); </li><li>  Wireless Internet is only in the lobby (in the evening it is almost impossible to use it due to the large influx of people); </li><li>  Before checking in new guests, it would be nice to ventilate the rooms, as they have very stale air; </li><li>  smoking is allowed in the hotel lobby, which is why there is always a "smoke screen" (apparently, the ventilation can not cope). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  If you consider yourself a lover of a relaxing holiday, then you can safely go to this hotel.  The lack of noisy entertainment will allow you to relax from the bustle of the city and restore your strength.  It is also facilitated by a modern spa center, where for a small price guests are provided with quality services.  Well, of course, the location on the first coastline makes us happy, which provides direct access to the warm and gentle sea.  The staff will meet you with a smile and will try to please you in every possible way (without requiring a monetary reward). </p>
