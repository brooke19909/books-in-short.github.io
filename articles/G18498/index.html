    <p>  Among the most noteworthy innovations present in Android KitKat: </p><p>  - A constantly functioning voice assistant Google; </p><p>  - operational switching between various tasks; </p><p>  - An improved mechanism for allocating RAM resources; </p><p>  - optimized distribution of telephone contacts; </p><p>  - Caller ID with search function unknown subscriber on Google Maps; </p><p>  - integration with cloud printers; </p><p>  - The function of launching applications using Google Chrome; </p><p>  - option to display subtitles for movies; </p><p>  - optimization of the mechanism for determining the location of the phone; </p><p>  - fine-tuning the corresponding function; </p><p>  - the ability to use creative Japanese emoticons; </p><p>  - Support for NFC payments through the Google Wallet system and other EPS; </p><p>  - saving payment statistics in a cloud service or in the device‚Äôs memory; </p><p>  - optimization of screen content. </p><p>  The considered line of smartphones is budget.  We study the features of the pricing policy of the brand in relation to the corresponding devices. </p><h2>  How much do PIXI 3 phones cost? </h2><p>  Can Alcatel One Touch PIXI 3 phones be considered expensive?  The price of each device is determined primarily by the pricing policy of a particular retailer.  A device with a 3.5-inch display costs about 2,690 rubles.  If we talk about the 4-inch modification of Alcatel One Touch PIXI 3, the price of the device will be approximately 700-800 rubles more.  It can be noted that many Russian retailers sell this smartphone at a discount. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can we draw by exploring the PIXI 3 product line?  First of all, it is necessary to note the uniformity of devices.  In fact, their main difference is the size of the display, as well as its basic technological parameters, such as, for example, resolution.  Differences in the number of processor cores, support for 3G and 4G standards do not correlate with a specific type of phone of the Alcatel One Touch PIXI 3 series. The characteristics of a device with a 3-inch screen can in this sense be superior to those that have a 4-inch version of the smartphone.  In fact, not only the basic modifications of the device are presented on the market, but also those that differ in the aspect of the noted characteristics.  This predetermines the possibility for users to find a phone suitable for themselves in terms of actual tasks. </p>
