Feedback from each of her clients is extremely positive.  The broker is a worthy competitor to such world market leaders as Alpari, ForexClub and Broko.  As the experience of many clients has shown, the broker not only takes his obligations seriously, he cares about his reputation.  Among the many advantages of the company are the quick execution of orders, the absence of price movements in the terminal and the ability to trade with a deposit of $ 1 or more. </p><h2>  Let's get to know Instaforex closer </h2>

    <p>  Instaforex company, whose feedback everyone can leave, belongs to the category of ECN brokers.  This ensures that each transaction is placed on the electronic foreign exchange market.  The essence of the approach is that when deciding to purchase a certain number of lots for one of the currency pairs in the market, the buyer is selected by a trader from the same currency market, who at the moment decided to sell a similar volume of the currency instrument.  Thus, the broker is interested in the success of his client and does not put obstacles to his success.  The www.instaforex project does not belong to the category of intermediary companies that intentionally play a game against their customers simply without bringing their transactions to the electronic market.  The partnership policy has provided an ever-expanding <span>customer base,</span> which today already numbers about 1 million people, both individuals and <span>corporate clients.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  InstaForex Project History </h2>

    <p>  The unique InstaForex project was launched in 2007.  The initiator of the organization was the world-class company InstaForex Companies Group.  From the first moments of the project‚Äôs existence, its management concluded an agreement for long-term cooperation with the leader in the development of software for trading in the foreign exchange market - with MetaQuotes Software.  Instaforex offers its customers access to the <span>international currency market</span> not only for trading currency pairs, but also for working with derivatives.  Under the auspices of the company, contracts for difference on shares on NYSE can be concluded.  Gold and silver are available.  According to the magazine World Finance Media, in 2009 the broker was awarded the title "Broker No. 1 in Asia."  The company received a similar status in 2009 according to the reputable World Finance Award.  In just over ten years, the broker managed to gain worldwide recognition and open about 200 representative offices in different parts of the world. </p><h2>  Bonus line from a reliable broker </h2><p>  Located at www instaforex com, the broker not only takes seriously the needs of his clients, he systematically pleases them with a variety of gifts and bonuses.  The company's specialists have developed a whole bonus line.  According to the established rules, each client of the company can count on a promotion in the amount of from 30 to 5000 dollars (or their equivalent in any currency of the world).  Material incentives are credited to the client‚Äôs trading account after making a deposit of a certain size.  To receive $ 30 into the account, the deposit must be replenished by <span>$ 100.</span>  And to get 5 thousand dollars into the account, you need to deposit at least 50 thousand dollars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Exciting contests and stunning prizes </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the struggle for material rewards, traders are invited to take part in various competitions.  Even beginners who do not have a deposit can try their hand.  A sufficiently large percentage of competitions are held on demo accounts.  The total annual prize fund of the company is about 50 thousand dollars.  I would like to say that the prizes of the Instaforex Group are more than just worthy.  In history, even cars were presented as rewards: the Hammer, the Porsche Cayman and the Evora Lotus.  The duration of the contests is very diverse.  In some battles, winners are determined once a year, and in others every week.  The amount of remuneration varies from 500 dollars for the first place, up to 50 thousand dollars.  To take part in the company's contests, it is enough to fulfill simple conditions, including registering on the company‚Äôs website and providing a package of documents.  Every novice trader has a chance for a secure future even without a powerful material pillow (capital). </p><h2>  Terms of trade with the company </h2><p>  The broker offers customers very interesting terms of trade.  For making transactions, its own InstaTrader <span>trading platform</span> with elegant built-in functionality is available.  A deposit can be opened in one of three currencies: dollar, euro, ruble.  You can deposit and withdraw funds from the deposit using the most common electronic payment systems.  These are Webmoney and Liberty Reserve transfer, Moneybookers transfer and Perfect money transfer, Alertpay and Global Digital Pay, RBKMoney and Yandex.Money, QIWI and PayPal.  For currency transactions, an InstaForex bank debit card and MasterCard and VISA, Mastercard and JCB Card, Diners Club International and American Express, STB and Union Card can be used.  As an alternative, you can take the help of dealers.  The minimum deposit allowed for trading is only 1 dollar.  The maximum deposit amount is not limited. </p>

One-click trading available.  Customer support is available around the clock.  These are just the basic tools offered by Instaforex.  The trader‚Äôs personal account provides access to much broader trading prospects. </p><h2>  Offer for investors </h2><p>  The company offers not only support to traders, it opens up great prospects for investing.  As an alternative to trust management for clients, they developed the ForexCopy service, which was based on PAMM accounts and copying transactions.  Within the framework of the project, one can follow step by step experienced traders, systematically increasing their deposit, diversifying their assets within the program.  Copying of transactions is carried out step by step, while the size of the deposit can both correspond to the size of the capital of the trader, and can be significantly less.  In the latter case, simple scaling is performed.  Everyone can set both the minimum and maximum threshold amount, limiting the list of pairs to which transactions will be transferred.  The project capabilities are extended not only to currency pairs, but also to binary options.  PAMM-investment service is available on the site, which many moneymakers have been familiar with for a long time. </p><h2>  Universal affiliate programs </h2>

    <p>  Considering the Instaforex.com project, one cannot fail to mention an interesting affiliate program, which is a risk-free way to improve your financial situation.  Each client receives an affiliate link through which new project participants must register.  As a reward, the partner will receive from 1.5 to 5.3 points from each transaction that traders attracted by him will make in the terminal.  If the program is attended not by private individuals, but by entire representations, additional remuneration is accrued to them.  For each attracted client, open statistics are published that allow you to track interest accrual.  On certain conditions, program participants can be provided with a private website to promote the services of a broker.  Numerous advertising and marketing tools, training materials are available to choose from.  In total, about 10 affiliate programs are presented on the site, and each client can choose the most convenient partnership format. </p><h2>  InstaForex helps everyone realize themselves </h2>

    <p>  The broker, which can be found on www.instaforex.com, offers services not only for traders and investors, it opens up new, interesting directions for earning.  You can try yourself in the following areas: </p><ul><li><p>  partner trader advertising company services; </p></li><li><p>  blogger </p></li><li><p>  webmaster who oversees a thematic site; </p></li><li><p>  exchanger providing assistance in making financial transactions on the site; </p></li><li><p>  VPS hosting; </p></li><li><p>  training traders and attracting them to cooperate with the instaforex.ru project; </p></li><li><p>  selling trading signals; </p></li><li><p>  opening of a regional office. </p></li></ul><h2>  Comprehensive training </h2><p>  Training is one of Instaforex's strengths.  Feedback on the quality of training materials can be found on almost every thematic forum.  Young experienced traders are supervised by their experienced and successful colleagues.  Training is carried out simultaneously in several directions: </p><ul><li><p>  video; </p></li><li><p>  theoretical support; </p></li><li><p>  webinars; </p></li><li><p>  analysis of free analytical materials. </p></li></ul><p>  Access to training materials will be available only after the client registers and replenishes the account.  Instaforex does not charge fees for access to materials, but the size of the client‚Äôs deposit must be at least $ 100.  These funds can be further used for trading in the foreign exchange market. </p><p>  One of the most important innovations of the company is open access to analytics from leading experts in various industries.  For example, customers who are interested in candlestick analysis can subscribe to this particular category of news, others can concentrate on technology, others can focus on <span>fundamental analysis,</span> and so on. </p><h2>  Segregated Accounts </h2><p>  Segregated accounts are another advantage of Instaforex.  The trader‚Äôs personal account allows 29 ways to replenish the account, while not all money can be deposited into it immediately.  To protect yourself from bankruptcy, only a part of the deposit is introduced, and the rest of it is stored in the bank.  For example, if you have 10 thousand dollars, you can enter only 3 thousand into your account, and trade with all the capital.  The main thing here is to provide the company with a certificate from a financial institution about the availability of an account.  In this way, traders save their savings, and the presence of this service only indicates the reliability of the Instaforex project.  The recall of each client who has experienced the benefits of a segregated account has a pronounced positive connotation. </p><h2>  Technical Support - Direct Presence </h2><p>  The number of communication methods offered by the broker surprises even experienced currency market players.  Instaforex.com offers free calls to 12 countries, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are allocated in separate directions.  Online chat is always attended by company employees who answer all questions of interest within a few minutes.  Slight delays may occur during the holidays and weekends.  A wide variety of messengers are actively used to support customers.  Mail and skype are also widely practiced at Instaforex.  Your personal account opens up opportunities for communication with company representatives in any of the convenient ways.  For the convenience of customers and to quickly resolve each emerging issue, support is differentiated into departments: financial, customer, technical and others. </p><h2>  Instaforex is the most advanced broker </h2>

    <p>  Binary options, which are very popular today, are another and rare innovation from Instaforex.  The cabinet, which the company‚Äôs client registers on the eve of trading, provides access to the use of about 72 trading instruments.  Intraday and urgent binary options - this is the main direction.  The tool is very easy to use and does not require deep economic knowledge.  Already quite a lot of company customers have improved their financial situation thanks to this service.  Such brokers who offer to work in this direction on the Forex market are an exception. </p><h2>  Maximum benefits - minimum disadvantages </h2><p>  Each broker has its own strengths and weaknesses, because it is impossible to provide high-quality access to the market at first, because Forex is very multifaceted.  Instaforex is an established project that has long resolved all of its ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù problems.  If previously there were interruptions in the connection and withdrawal of funds, today no one remembers them.  A huge abundance of trading tools, good help to novice traders, optimal trading conditions - these are just a few of what Instaforex offers.  Bonus is a completely separate conversation.  The scope of the corporation is so large that even the leadership of Western brokers is astonishing.  If we compare the company with foreign analogues, then Instaforex always leaves only positive impressions.  Small inconvenience is caused by the overload of information of the Instaforex website itself.  The trader‚Äôs office completely eliminates this inconvenience due to the optimal design of the project and a hospitable interface. </p>
