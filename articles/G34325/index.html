    <p>  Robert raised the very banner of national liberation and gave his own people will and freedom.  The history of Scotland is closely connected with the famous ruler, whose life to this day does not reveal all the real facts. </p><p>  His merits cannot be described in a nutshell, but only one thing is certain: the people of Scotland really respect their king and give him a lot of gratitude for all his labors.  In addition to freedom and independence from England, Bruce gave Scotland many improvements for life.  Despite the fact that during the entire reign he tried to protect his own lands from the enemy British, Robert also managed to do other things that help the Scots to fight. </p><h2>  Dynasty founder and famous surname </h2><p>  Robert 1 was born in 1274, July 11, at Turnsberry Castle.  He became the founder of the dynasty and rightfully took possession of the crown of the ruler.  Bruce spent his youthful years at the court of Edward 1, King of England. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The origin of the surname is due to the fact that the genus Bryusov descended from the Normans, who took possession of the lands of Normandy. </p><p>  The great Bruce dynasty can really be proud of such a ruler and military leader who did everything exclusively for the sake of the people, and not for his own benefit. </p><p>  Baron Robert de Bruce participated, more precisely, was the leader of the uprising in the struggle against England.  For this he was solemnly rewarded with considerable land in Yorkshire.  Thanks to all his merits, the Bryus family became closely connected with Scottish history. </p><p>  All the eldest sons in the family had the same name - Robert.  Of course, all this was in honor of the founder of the dynasty.  The first wife was Isabella (middle daughter of David Huntingdon).  It was thanks to the marriage with her that Robert was given the right to claim the Scottish throne by law, and then to present valid claims to the throne.  But soon their marriage was dissolved for unknown reasons.  There are several sources that tell a variety of reasons, but modern people will not find out the truth. </p><p>  The king‚Äôs life is really full of interesting facts, events and small stories.  Modern youth can safely take an example from such a ruler.  His character deserves respect first of all, and then all the skills. </p><h2>  On the way to the crown </h2><p>  After the death of the ruler of Scotland, there were a lot of candidates for the crown, but Robert Bruce's father refused to resolve this dispute, and therefore entrusted his own son. </p><p>  The year 1292 became significant for Robert, because he was given the title of Count Carrick.  Then, after the death of his father, Robert Bruce became the seventh Lord Annandale.  The clan advanced a confrontation to John Balliol, who subsequently entered into an alliance with France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  During all this confusion and the loss of a large amount of land, the clan simply had to reunite with the rebels, as many lords of Scotland did. </p><h2>  The Return of Edward 1 from the Campaign </h2><p>  At this point in time, the history of Scotland is losing some facts, but there is only one official version. </p><p>  Edward 1 invades Scotland, and fights begin.  In these battles, English archers and cavalry defeat enemy units, and many rulers are overthrown from the throne.  The Bruce clan has to endure heavy battles, and as a result, they clash with the Komin clan for a long time. </p>

    <p>  Robert Bruce brutally killed John Comin, and only then the dispute between the clans was resolved.  With this murder, Bruce successfully cleared his way to the crown.  Then the meeting of the Lords of Scotland proclaimed him the new king, and the coronation itself took place in Skawn on March 10, 1306.  In that place was stored the "Stone of Destiny", which was the sacred coronation stone of the Scots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Coronation </h2><p>  On a significant coronation day, many locals were sincerely happy.  The signing of the coronation document meant only one thing - Scotland did not want to see Edward 1 as his own ruler.  Therefore, on the same day the War of Independence began. </p>

    <p>  Robert suffered a couple of defeats, and then his family was captured by the British.  Bruce himself sought refuge in many places.  The Pope personally excommunicated him from the church, but even this fact did not stop the Scots, and their rebellion only increased in scope.  Robert Bruce returned to his homeland in February and led all the rebel forces there. </p><h2>  Way north </h2><p>  In connection with the increase in the number of rebels, Edward 1 had to apply more stringent measures, and he decided to lead the army to the north, and there he already carried out his own plans. </p><p>  Unfortunately, all his dreams were destroyed, because he suddenly died.  This happened already near the border with Scotland, and all his plans decided to continue his son. </p><p>  Edward 1 died suddenly, so his son had to take drastic measures and somehow take matters into his own hands, until his troops were seriously defeated. </p><p>  At the same time, the Scots had more strength and power, so the <span>troops of England were</span> gradually squeezed out of Scotland. </p><h2>  King recognition </h2><p>  The king of Scotland convened the first parliament in 1309.  And after that, despite the fact that he was excommunicated, he was duly recognized as the Scottish clergy king. </p>

    <p>  Troops of Robert Bruce took control of most of the land, and the British had few territories left. </p><p>  The town of Bannockburn itself suffered a large-scale defeat, since it was there that the Scots defeated the army of England, the number of troops in which was much larger than that of Bruce. </p><p>  In addition to Scotland, the Irish also fought with the British, since an alliance was concluded between Scotland and Ireland.  According to this document, Ireland did not have the right to leave the Allies to tear the enemy to pieces, so the extra forces came in handy for the Scots. </p><p>  In 1315, Robert's younger brother was recognized as the Irish king.  The alliance of Ireland and Scotland brought a lot of success, but the British were not so simple.  Their counteroffensive served as a failure for the allied countries.  A huge defeat was inflicted on the troops of Scotland and Ireland, and the ruler of the Irish was killed. </p><h2>  The fight with the British </h2><p>  Despite all these failures and the loss of the king‚Äôs sibling, the War of Independence continued.  Robert and his army were not about to give up.  To the control of the Scots, some more of the lands passed.  The British tried to launch a second large-scale counteroffensive, hoping for the same success, but their plans were again destroyed.  The Scottish units invaded earlier than the opponents, so they managed to block all the moves and defeat them. </p><p>  Robert Bruce with little difficulty concluded a military agreement with France.  A year later, his first son was born, who, accordingly, subsequently passed the crown. </p>

    <p>  The most final attempt of the British was made in 1327, but, fortunately, their campaign ended in failure.  Scottish troops completely ravaged Northumberland and again landed on the lands of Ireland. </p><p>  A year later, England was simply forced to sign a treaty that declared Scotland's independence.  Now Scotland has rightfully become a sovereign state, and Robert Bruce is recognized as its king. </p><p>  All the conditions of the world were ultimately secured by the only marriage of David Bruce (the four-year-old son of Robert Bruce) and Joan Plantagenet (the seven-year-old sister of Edward III). </p><h2>  After death </h2><p>  The famous king of Scotland has achieved many foreign policy as well as military successes.  But, despite all his merits and victories, he still could not realize his cherished goal.  Robert wanted to create a solid foundation for Scottish power, which he did not succeed in building. </p><p>  In recent years, he fell ill with a terrible disease - leprosy (leprosy).  Unfortunately, at that time there was no equipment available for isolating and treating a person, so he had to transfer all this to himself live and endure to the last.  At that time he lived in Cardross, on the very shore, and died there. </p><p>  The body, at the request of the Scots, was buried in Dunfermline, and the heart was transferred to Melrose.  Some time after the terrible event, many legends spread throughout Scotland, people composed and wrote poems, poems, tales, etc. In all these manuscripts, the king was credited with the powers of a wizard or some extraterrestrial ruler who gave his people freedom by sacrificing on their own. </p><p>  After the death of his son, the line of the dynasty was cut short.  The crown went to the grandson of the female line - Robert Stuart. </p><h2>  Second wife </h2><p>  Elizabeth de Burg is best known as the second wife of the king of Scotland.  There were many legends about her among local residents and Scottish troops, where she became famous. </p>

    <p>  She was born in Dunfermline, where, as you know, Robert spent the last years of his life.  She was the daughter of the omnipotent Richard de Burgh, so the noble family gave her enough status. </p><p>  Elizabeth de Burgh met Robert Bruce at the English court, and in 1302 they married. </p>
