  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Already as a gadget, watches find new uses for themselves.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Initially, the watch was designed to determine the time.  Gradually, from the huge mechanisms that were located in the tall towers, they moved into houses, and even turned into stylish jewelry through the efforts of watchmakers.  A little time passed and as a necessary accessory or gadget for a business person, the clock migrated to the wrists of modern people.  Even in the mechanical version, the watch was already able not only to determine the time, but also worked as a calendar, stopwatch, etc.  When the mechanical insides of the gadget watch were replaced with electronic stuffing, their capabilities expanded to infinity. </p><p>  Integrated circuits allowed a variety of devices to be mounted in a small watch case.  Alarms and flashlights, heart rate monitors and small radios in various combinations complemented the main functionality of wrist gadgets.  With the advent of mobile phones, watches began to lose their functional properties and again began to turn into a stylish and expensive jewelry for both women and men.  Through the efforts of designers and watch developers, they have retained their presence in the market and continue to exist both as a stylish classic expensive jewelry on the one hand and as an inexpensive <span>multi</span> - <span>functional device</span> on the other. </p><p>  As an ornament located on the user's wrist, the watch is a product of world-famous companies; the quality of assembly and the brand mark also affect the price.  If the brand name does not shine with historical fame, then the watch-accessory not only turns into a masterpiece of jewelry craftsmanship, but also takes the cost of the material used. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a gadget, watches attract consumers by the presence of attractive functions, according to the ideas and developments of modern watchmakers, we will carry out our short review. </p><p>  Availability and versatility.  This is the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe creator of devices that combine in their design a stylish bauble bracelet, player and watch.  Echo gadgets from the designer from Iran, Milad Talegani, are designed for the youth category of users aged 16-25, and moreover, exclusively for its female half.  Low price and a rich set of additional functions were the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe concept. </p><p>  The stylish USB Retro Telephone Light with Alarm Clock looks spectacular.  This gadget combines clock and PC backlight in its design.  You can‚Äôt call him wrist, but he got into the review due to his original appearance.  The device, stylized as an old-fashioned telephone, has a flashlight mounted on a microphone on twelve LEDs, and instead of a dial, a classic version of the watch dial is installed. </p><p>  The next in the review are ‚Äúspy watches‚Äù, the gadget will attract attention as a fun toy, although its functionality is quite serious.  In the design of Spy Net Video Watch there is a camera and a video camera, there is a ‚Äúvoice recorder‚Äù function.  The developers of this wrist combine suggest even the installation of a night vision device.  A very attractive thing for lovers of detective stories and other espionage passions. </p><p>  A wrist gadget with a built-in remote control looks much more practical than a spy watch.  The owner of The Television Remote Control Wristwatch no longer has to spend time looking for a TV remote.  Six buttons on the device‚Äôs body will provide convenient navigation through the interface of a modern television receiver. </p><p>  The engineering idea to squeeze a mobile phone into the watch, still found its implementation.  Owners of sWaP Rebel will want to become a limited category of users, but, nevertheless, the manufacturer has prepared several color solutions for his product and a pretty nice appearance. </p><p>  Among modern wristwatch-combines there are flash drives, and descendants of the Predator wristwatch with an intricate dial, devices that support continuous Internet connection and are equipped with a bluetooth headset.  By the way wristwatches are used in modern life, it can be judged that they are not going to rest, and for a long time will show off on the wrists of users. </p>
