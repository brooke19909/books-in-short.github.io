  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some poisonous spiders</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most poisonous spiders are considered the most beautiful.  Dangerous for humans are karakurt, <span>tarantulas (the poison of</span> which is not fatal to humans, but causes severe swelling), erezus.  So, the poison of the mastofora gastrocantoides - a spider from the araneid family - has a strong necrotic effect (causes tissue necrosis). </p><p>  Karakurt females arrange their lair under the stones, covering it with a web for catching insects.  Males of this species are vegetarians. </p><p>  These spiders live in Moldova, Dagestan, Central Asia, Crimea.  The female karakurt has a spherical dense abdomen of black color with reddish and whitish spots.  In addition, she has a pair of poisonous tubular glands, which are located in the main segment of the chelicera (upper jaw).  At the end of the gland there is a moving sharp claw with a duct opening.  Under the pressure of the enveloping muscle membrane, poison is released. </p><p>  The most dangerous are considered to be mature females of karakurt of South American species.  Their poison is fifteen times stronger than the poison of a rattlesnake. </p><p>  Of interest are the relationships between the sexes of this species of spiders.  The male who discovered the den begins active courtship of the female.  ‚ÄúExcitation‚Äù is manifested (almost always) by characteristic twitching of the web.  The latter, noticing these "signals", often rushes at the male and puts him on the run.  However, after some time he returns and continues to "courtship".  The male begins to weave the nets and lure the female into them with characteristic rhythmic movements.  Spiders mate in the mink of a female.  After the male tries to quickly hide, but he rarely succeeds.  The female sprays poison in his wake, as a result of which the male's legs stick together.  Then she eats it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Russia, few poisonous spiders are able to bite through human skin.  The danger may be a <span>South Russian tarantula.</span>  Its furry body of a yellowish-brown color with a black pattern has a length of about three and a half centimeters. </p><p>  It lives in a vertical deep (up to sixty centimeters) mink.  <span>The spider's bite</span> feels like a <span>wasp stings.</span>  There is also a tumor on a bitten place. </p><p>  Poisonous spiders of the araneide family are found in Peru.  A dangerous representative is the type of mastophore gastrocantoides.  These poisonous spiders tend to infect people who care for vineyards.  After a bite, sharp pain occurs, then severe swelling.  Subsequently, tissue destruction (necrosis) occurs in the affected area, in some cases to the bone itself. </p><p>  Such poisonous spiders as ctenus, lycosa raptoria are also dangerous to humans, but the species dendrifantes noxiosus is of particular danger to people.  These poisonous horse spiders are small - about four to five millimeters.  Their bite causes first acute pain, then blood appears in the urine.  Death occurs a few hours later. </p><p>  Most tarantulas are not dangerous to humans.  In any case, fatalities from his bites have not been recorded, but a fairly large wound can remain in his place. </p><p>  Tarantula spiders have two-centimeter chelicera <span>(upper jaws).</span>  They are often kept at home. </p><p>  Breeders allergic to wasp or bee stings should be careful with such a spider, despite the fact that not a single case of anaphylactic shock has been described. </p><p>  Speaking of <span>domestic tarantulas,</span> it should be said about some rules of behavior when bitten. </p><p>  First of all, no need to panic.  It is necessary to carefully remove the spider from your hand and put it in a terrarium, and the wound should be treated with hydrogen peroxide, iodine, any other antiseptic.  It is recommended to take some antihistamine (for example, the drug "Diazolin", "Suprastin" or "Tavegil"), call a doctor. </p>
