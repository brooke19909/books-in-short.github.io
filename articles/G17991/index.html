    <h2>  Ramada Resort Akbuk 4 *: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since many tourists choose hotels based on the comments of people who have already visited them, we decided to summarize the reviews of our compatriots about the Ramada Resort Akbuk 4 * hotel. </p><p>  So, with regard to the appearance of the hotel complex, the interior and furnishings of the rooms, no one complained here.  After all, the hotel began its work only this year, and everything here is new and modern.  Air conditioning and plumbing also work properly.  Many travelers really liked that the rooms are equipped with literally everything you need: from slippers and daily replenished tea and coffee sets to a clothes dryer located on a spacious balcony.  There were no particular complaints about cleaning and replacing bed linen. </p><p>  As for the hotel, it did not cause much enthusiasm, since for the most part it is a concrete site with a minimum of vegetation. </p><p>  Some travelers were not very happy with the beach.  Moreover, complaints were caused not at all by the fact of the need to travel there by bus (they went regularly), but by the state of the coast itself.  So, the sand here is mixed in places with clay, as a result of which the water off the coast is very muddy, which caused discomfort to some vacationers. </p><p>  Almost no complaints were noted by our compatriots about nutrition.  So, the dishes here were very diverse and tasty.  Everyone could find food to their taste.  Also, many were pleased that during the whole day it was possible to have a snack in snack bars, to taste ice cream. </p><p>  As for the staff, mainly the guests were satisfied with it.  The only minus tourists say is that most of the hotel staff speaks only Turkish or English.  Finding a person who understands the Russian language is almost impossible here.  And this despite the fact that the vast majority of guests were tourists from Russia and other CIS countries.  However, this fact could not adversely affect the rest.  It is also quite possible that after the first season of work at the hotel some changes will occur.  And next year the situation will change for the better. </p><p>  In general, almost all tourists were satisfied with their stay at the Ramada Resort Akbuk hotel.  They admit the possibility that they will come here again and are ready to recommend the hotel to their friends and relatives. </p>
