    <h2>  Standard Apartment </h2><p>  Talking about the Seamelia Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * located in Turkey, it is worth paying attention to the rooms that this hotel has.  There are 300 of them, and most of them are ‚Äústandards‚Äù. </p><p>  These are bright and spacious rooms measuring 30 square meters.  m. with windows starting from the floor itself.  Inside each of them there is air conditioning, satellite TV, a minibar, a safe, a telephone, and a bathroom with a shower, toilet and free hygiene items. </p><p>  What about the price?  For two people a week of living in the "standard" will cost about 45,000 rubles.  This price includes all-inclusive services and 8 percent VAT.  If in the ‚Äústandard‚Äù only one guest intends to settle, then for him the cost will be 35,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  We must not forget about their description.  Many come to Seamelia Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * as families, and this category of apartments is their ideal choice. </p><p>  These rooms have a larger area, which is equal to 35 square meters.  m.

    <h2>  The nuances of booking and accommodation </h2><p>  Well, enough has been said about the Seamelia Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 * service, now we can note some important points. </p><p>  Check-in here starts at 14:00.  Departure is in the morning, but lasts until noon.  You need to remember this information and select the most convenient flights for yourself.  If guests arrive earlier than 14:00, they will be settled, but only if there are free apartments.  And this is a rarity (especially in high season), as the hotel is popular. </p><p>  Also, when making a remote reservation, you need to prepare your credit card in advance.  Either Visa or Master Card.  Data will be needed to indicate them in the application - this is a kind of booking confirmation.  By the way, when checking in, you will need to present a card with your passport, so you only need to use your own, and not borrowed from someone. </p><h2>  Seamelia Beach - the best choice </h2><p>  So many people who rested here assure.  Tourists claim that this is a great hotel for people who are desperate to look for a good 5-star hotel in Turkey with unreasonable accommodation prices.  For those who care about the condition of the hotel complex, good food and remoteness from the sea. </p><p>  Seamelia Beach is really worth a look.  There are several hotels nearby, but some have no reviews, while others have too high prices.  And in Seamelia Beach, by the way, you can often "get" at a discount!  If you book an apartment in advance, or out of season. </p><p>  And there‚Äôs a good contingent here.  Rest mainly Germans and Russians.  The situation is very calm, one might even say friendly.  And it captivates. </p>

    <h2>  What do the guests say? </h2><p>  It will not be superfluous to pay attention to reviews of Seamelia Beach Resort Hotel &amp; Spa 5 *.  For the most part, they are positive.  And here is what the guests say: </p><ul><li>  Territory.  Small in comparison with the nearby hotels, but well maintained and clean, planted with greenery, palm trees and flowers. </li><li>  Apartments.  Actually correspond to photos.  The furniture is comfortable, plumbing glistens with novelty. </li><li>  Staff.  The service here is top notch.  Administrators speak Turkish and English, they are always ready to constructively and capaciously answer any questions.  Quality cleaning, daily.  Anyway, all the employees of the complex are very helpful, helpful and smiling. </li><li>  Silence.  It is really very calm here.  The rooms have excellent sound insulation, but this in this case is only a nice bonus, because by the time midnight on the street everything subsides. </li><li>  Beach.

You can understand, because it is clean, spacious, sandy, with convenient approaches to the sea - and even within walking distance! </li><li>  The location.  Also a considerable advantage!  Yes, let it take about an hour to get to the airport, but in 5-7 minutes you can get to interesting sights.  To Side Harbor, for example, to the amphitheater, or to the temples of Apollo and Athena.  And if you drive 10-20 kilometers, you can see the <span>waterfall Manavgat,</span> Titreengel and <span>Green Canyon.</span> </li></ul><p>  To summarize, we can say - this is a great place for people who want to plunge into the atmosphere of the "five stars", enjoy the local culture, as well as how to dine and sunbathe. </p>

    <h2>  The best time to relax </h2><p>  About this - in the end.  Most tourists go to Turkey in the summer - in the high season.  And you can understand why, because at this time, the vast majority of holidays begin.  And yet - when is it better to go here? </p><p>  To begin with, a few words about the least favorable period for rest.  About the last month of summer, to be more precise. </p><p>  Not everyone can withstand the weather in Side in August - sultry, suffocatingly humid, arid.  The sun burns without stopping, and +35 ¬∞ C on a thermometer are considered the norm.  Even evenings do not bring tangible invigorating coolness.  Needless to say, even the water warms up to +30 ¬∞ C, becoming really hot, and without bringing any pleasure.  The weather in Side in August is terrible, and if you go here in the last month of summer, you will not be able to relax.  Because in such a hell it is impossible to do anything.  One wonders: ‚ÄúBut when will the heat subside?‚Äù  and there is ice. </p><p>  But May is another matter.  The water temperature does not fall below +20 ¬∞ C, during the day moderate heat prevails at +25 ¬∞ C.  And there are not so many people as in the high season. </p><p>  You can still go here in October or November.  Water does not cool below +21 ¬∞ C, and rains only begin in the last week of autumn.  In addition, these months host major cultural events, for the sake of which tens of thousands of tourists come here. </p>
