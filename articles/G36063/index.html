Television shows, travel blogs, travel agency stories present Bali as a dream for anyone.  But there are places in this paradise that inspire fear.  This is an abandoned hotel. </p><h2>  Bali - Island of Dreams </h2><p>  Bali is a small Indonesian island located between two oceans.  From the south, its beaches are washed by the warm Indian Ocean, from the Pacific North.  It is a famous resort in the whole world. </p><p>  The length of the island is about 145 kilometers.  But Bali is not only an island with pristine beaches and magnificent sunsets.  The mountain range, which stretches along the entire island, is a seismically active zone.  Volcanic eruptions here can happen at any moment.  In 1963, a major eruption of the Agung volcano claimed the lives of almost half the population of the island, destroying residential and commercial buildings to the ground. </p><p>  Tourists love the island for its stable warm temperature throughout the year, its magnificent nature and warm ocean.  Despite the relatively small area of ‚Äã‚Äã5,780 km, this paradise has many beauties: national parks, savannahs, the jungle, beaches with white sand, forests with pristine mountain lakes.  There are dormant volcanoes, magnificent waterfalls, thermal springs. </p><p>  There are about twenty thousand temples and palaces in Bali.  There is even its own religion - Balinese Hinduism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.balitourismboard.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches in bali" class="if uuid-3039898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039898.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel business </h2><p>  Thanks to its convenient geographical location, the tourism industry is by far the most prosperous activity.  Hotel owners are doing everything possible and impossible to please customers, to make their vacation truly unforgettable.  One of the best hotels in the world is in sunny Bali.  Hundreds of millions of dollars are invested in real estate annually.  All in order for tourists to come back here again and again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The range of services is quite wide.  For lovers of beach holidays and spas, there are magnificent beaches equipped with everything you need.  In addition to mandatory buildings such as locker rooms and showers, here you can find tents with soft drinks and a light snack. </p><p>  For children there are unique attractions and water activities. </p><p>  Extreme sports enthusiasts can always rent scooters, ATVs, water skis or surfboards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.balitourismboard.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bali island" class="if uuid-3039900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039900.jpg"></div><h2>  Abandoned hotel </h2><p>  The story of an abandoned hotel in Bali is known throughout the world.  Tourists have heard about this unusual place and often ask local residents to take them there.  However, the Balinese themselves do not really like to talk about this gloomy place and try to avoid not only visits, but also conversations about it.  There is an opinion that the ghosts of those people who, according to legend, disappeared in an unknown direction in one night, roam around the hotel at night. </p><p>  An abandoned building is located fifty kilometers from Denpasar.  This is the former Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel &amp; Resort, and is located at an altitude of one and a half thousand meters above sea level.  Every tourist would like to visit it on their vacation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Bali" class="if uuid-3039873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039873.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of an abandoned hotel </h2><p>  One of the most popular and widespread versions of why the hotel has turned into an old, forgotten building, is as follows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1993, the son of Indonesian President Tommy Suharto began construction of a magnificent hotel.  The building was to become the residence for the presidential family, as well as increase the flow of tourists to Budugul.  Since the president‚Äôs son was a successful businessman, it was planned to invest large sums in the construction to give the hotel a truly royal luxurious look.  The best foreign architects and designers were invited to realize all the ambitious ideas, and only natural marble, wood and silver were used as materials. </p><p>  Construction was abruptly stopped in 2002.  As tourists around the world suggest, the blame for the terrible terrorist attacks in Kut.  Many people died, and tourists for a long time forgot the way here.  An abandoned hotel in Bali has become a symbol of those terrible events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeboom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in bali" class="if uuid-3039871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039871.jpg"></div><h2>  The myth of construction </h2><p>  Around the abandoned hotel in Bali, several myths have developed.  In particular, such.  The son of the president of Indonesia led a wild life, not denying himself the various pleasures for which he spent money from the state treasury.  For his behavior, he was arrested.  His case fell into the hands of the supreme judge, who was known as an honest man.  Attempts to bribe a judge failed, and the president‚Äôs son hired a killer to remove the judge from the road and solve his case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The guilty son of the President of Indonesia was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  The presidential family in the light of terrible events could not continue the construction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeboom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hotel in bali" class="if uuid-3039872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039872.jpg"></div><h2>  The legend of the Chinese millionaire </h2><p>  The most fantastic legend about the appearance of a huge hotel is the legend of a Chinese businessman.  It is said that at the end of the twentieth century, a Chinese millionaire who once visited Bali fell in love with this island with all his heart.  But he was a man who was used to working, and instead of resting and doing yoga, he developed a business plan and began to build a hotel of enormous proportions at an altitude of 1,500 meters.  An amazing architectural structure was supposed to attract tourists to the underdeveloped area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island. </p><p>  The construction was a success.  A lot of money was invested.  But as a result of the terrorist attacks, in which hundreds of inhabitants of the island were killed, the flow of tourists to Bali stopped.  The Chinese, who supervised the construction, lost his mind, and construction stopped. </p><p>  Another, mystical version, reports that the hotel was still open and even received several thousand tourists.  But in one night all the people who were on its territory disappeared inexplicably somewhere. </p><p>  When the difficult period began, the hotel was put up for sale.  No buyer was found, and he turned into the only abandoned hotel in Bali, where people disappeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="romainveillon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="abandoned hotel" class="if uuid-3039870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039870.jpg"></div><h2>  The architecture of the hotel and its territory </h2><p>  Location of an abandoned hotel in Bali is very good.  He stands on a hill at the entrance to the city.  The hotel also offers magnificent views of the ocean and landscapes.  If the hotel worked, then most likely it would be very popular with tourists. </p><p>  The architecture of the institution is made in the classical Balinese style.  Many roofs resembling a pagoda.  Magnificent statues are located throughout the hotel.  The pools, fountains, windows of the rooms and restaurants are decorated with delightful elements of marble, stone and wood. </p><p>  There are several fountains on the territory, next to which are light gazebos, where in the heat you can hide from the heat and listen to the birds singing. </p><p>  Inside, the hotel is decorated in a grand and luxurious way.  Table and floor, in the growth of a man, vases with images of birds and animals, statues, bas-reliefs on the walls, marble floors.  Everything indicates that the hotel was planned for status visitors. </p><h2>  How to get to an abandoned hotel </h2><p>  To admire the gloomy beauty of an abandoned hotel in Bali, you need to travel by car or bus from Denpasar to Bedugul Taman.  Finding it will be very simple.  You don‚Äôt even need the address of an abandoned hotel in Bali.  Everyone knows him. </p><p>  Depending on the speed, the road will take up to two hours.  You need to go by Denpasar-Singaraja or by Jl.  Raya Denpasar.  Passing by is simply impossible.  But in any case, how to get to an abandoned hotel in Bali, any local resident will tell you. </p><p>  If you are still afraid to take an independent trip to an abandoned hotel, use the services of local residents.  Even a child knows how to get to an abandoned hotel in Bali.  Offer a guide a few dollars, and, in addition to the road, you will learn many myths and legends about the island and the hotel.  If you get on your own, only the navigator will determine the exact coordinates of the abandoned hotel in Bali. </p><h2>  What an abandoned hotel looks like now </h2><p>  The full name of an abandoned hotel in Bali is Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel &amp; Resort.  Despite the fact that more than fifteen years have passed since the construction was stopped, the hotel is striking in its scale. </p><p>  During construction, great attention was paid to the quality of materials.  And not in vain.  Both the interior and exterior of the hotel is in excellent condition so far.  If street decor elements begin to collapse under the influence of wind, prolonged rains and fogs, then only a layer of dust can contribute to destruction. </p><p>  There are no guards at the abandoned hotel.  Nobody watches the garden, so lush island plants almost filled all the paths with themselves, sprouting between stones and slabs of marble. </p><p>  Pool baths were never cleaned and began to collect rainwater.  Water does not go anywhere, so over time the water in them turned into a dense swamp slurry, which was chosen by persistent marsh plants. </p><p>  Balconies, railings and stairs are everywhere entwined with various kinds of ivy, the branches of which are so intertwined that they can withstand the weight of an adult.  The steps were covered with moss.  Long tentacles of perennial vines hang from the roofs, and wild birds have chosen places under the flooring. </p><p>  The main entrance to the hotel is closed by a makeshift fence with barbed wire.  Some tourists report that sometimes at the entrance you can meet a gatekeeper who will open the main gate for you to enter by car for just a few cents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelsoul.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abandoned Hotel in Bali" class="if uuid-3039919" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3039919.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Bali is one of the most popular tourist destinations and has only positive reviews.  The level of service corresponds to the declared prices.  Many tourists are advised to rent a car and travel around the island on their own, without reference to tourist groups and excursions from the hotel.  Especially many reviews can be heard about the savannah and national parks.  The only point that, judging by the reviews, you need to consider is the time of year.  In the rainy season, you won‚Äôt get much rest, since long rains erode the roads. </p><p>  Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel &amp; Resort is the largest not only in Bali, but throughout the world.  Where is the abandoned hotel in Bali, the whole world knows.  Despite the fact that he has been empty for more than fifteen years, attempts to restore activity have nevertheless been made.  Local authorities once made an attempt to attract investment to resume operations, but the plans were unsuccessful.  The Indonesian authorities do not have their own funds to clear the thickets and finish the little that remains. </p>
