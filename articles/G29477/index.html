Which colonies did Italy own?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the great geographical discoveries, European countries sought to subjugate countries and turn them into colonies.  Italy, which for a long time remained fragmented, after unification to maintain the image of a great power, tried to keep up.  The colonies of Italy, although they were incomparably smaller in area than the English, contributed to the development of the metropolis. </p><h2>  Italy after unification </h2><p>  The complete unification of Italy ended in 1870.  But the united state was first announced by the pan-Italian parliament 10 years earlier.  In 1860, Lombardy, Modena, Romagna, Tuscany and Parma united around the Sardinian kingdom.  In these states, plebiscites passed, and the population spoke in favor of an alliance with Sardinia.  After the arrival of Giuseppe Garibaldi in Sicily, the <span>Kingdom of both Sicilies</span> joined in the consolidation of the Italian states <span>.</span>  The king of the <span>kingdom of Italy</span> in March 1861 was Victor Emmanuel II. </p>

    <p>  The final completion of the unification of Italy is connected with the campaign of Garibaldi in Rome.  At that time, the papal region turned into a bulwark of reaction, the pope resisted the entry of Rome into a united kingdom and its transformation into the capital of the state.  Another fragment of Italian lands left out of the union is Venice.  In September 1870, the troops of the <span>Italian kingdom</span> entered Rome.  In July of the following year, <span>Victor Emmanuel II</span> proclaimed the Eternal <span>City as the capital of</span> fully reunited Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Colony fight </h2><p>  The young state almost immediately joined the struggle for a place in the sun.  It began to fight for the colonies.  Italy needed to strengthen its position in the international sphere. </p><p>  In the colonial activity of this country, it is conventionally decided to distinguish three stages. </p><p>  <span>The first stage</span> is from the beginning of the 80s of the XIX century to the 20s of the XX century.  The newly formed centralized state is beginning to expand.  The ruling circles of the kingdom in the seizure of colonies saw the root of the solution of many problems: the interests of the domestic economy, achieving prestige among European countries, reducing social tension in the country.  The slogan of "Mediterranean identity" was taken as the basis for the fulfillment by Italy of a civilizational mission in the colonies.  It was assumed that the Italian colonists would ennoble the Africans, and they would turn into carriers of a common identity. </p>

    <p>  <span>The second stage</span> - 1922-1943 (regime of power by <span>Benito Mussolini).</span>  During the years of his premiership, the colonial aggression of Italy intensified.  The seizure of territories becomes the basis of the ideology of the fascist regime, becoming a ubiquitous practical activity. </p><p>  <span>The third stage</span> is 1943-1960.  The government tried to recover the lost colonies of Italy.  In the 19th century, they were a guarantee of the recognition of the country as an equal partner of the European community.  Now turned into an integral attribute of status and international recognition.  But enslaved peoples strove for independence.  By 1960, the decolonization process was completed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The conquering success of Italy in the first stage </h2><p>  At the first stage, Italy sought to subjugate Tunisia.  The Italian community already lived there.  But Tunisia subjugated France in 1881.  Then the Italians went to the east of Africa.  Having seized two important ports - Assab and Massau, Rome united under its authority vast territories.  The first colony of Italy - Eritrea - was formed in 1890 (annexation was carried out in 1885).  The subject territory has become a stronghold of the advancement of Italians to Abyssinia.  In 1889, its ruler Menelik II recognized the power of Italy. </p>

    <p>  1889 brought another territorial increment - Benazir.  The entry of the colonialists into Somalia began.  In 1908, a colony of Somalia was formed from three provinces (Obbia, Mijurtini and Benadir).  In 1925, Jubaland was added to it. </p><p>  In 1911-1912, the Italo-Turkish war broke out.  The lands of Tripolitania and Kerenaika, as well as the Dodecanese Islands, went to Rome.  In 1934, the first two provinces formed Libya.  The Dodecanese, settled by the Greeks, until 1919 remained a disputed territory between Greece and Italy.  According to the Treaty of Sevres, they remained behind Rome (they became known as the Italian Islands).  The Rapallian world of 1922 secured South Tyrol and Istria to Italy. </p><h2>  Mussolini's activities in the second stage </h2><p>  Mussolini‚Äôs aggression intensified by the beginning of the 30s.  In 1934, he was preparing to capture Abyssinia.  Justifying its invasion by the struggle against slavery that remained in the country, Italy in 1935 turns Ethiopia into a colony.  To abolish slavery, the <span>Italian king</span> proclaims two laws (in October 1935 and April 1936).  Abyssinians got rid of centuries-old slavery. </p>

    <p>  In 1936, the Italian government formed a new colony state - it became Italian East Africa as part of Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia.  African colonies of Italy entered one state. </p><p>  In 1939, the eyes of Italians are sent to European Albania.  A small country cannot withstand the military stronghold of Italy and is subordinate to Rome. </p><h2>  The collapse of the Italian <span>colonial empire</span> in the third stage </h2><p>  The defeat in the Second World War of the fascist bloc, of which Italy was a party, led to the destruction of the colonial power of Rome.  In 1943, Mussolini was ousted from the post of real leader of the country.  The colonies of Italy embark on the path of struggle against the colonialists.  In 1947, the Dodecanese Islands were transferred to Greece.  Ethiopia achieved independence and annexed Eritrea.  Fearing the strengthening of the Communists in Italy, the Anglo-American forces agreed to leave Somalia under the rule of Rome.  In 1951, Libyan independence was granted.  In 1960, the term of ownership of the Italians of Somalia expired, and the country received the promised sovereignty.  The Italian colonial power disappeared from the political map of the world, Italy lost the status of the Mediterranean leader. </p>

    <h2>  List of Italy Colony Countries </h2><p>  In the colonial submission of Italy were the countries of Africa, territories in Europe and Asia.  European lands were conquered by the Mussolini government and recognized the power of a country such as Italy.  Former colonies in Europe are the Ionian and Dodecanese Islands, Dalmatia and Corfu, as well as Albania.  In Asia, Italy seized the province of Tianjin, now part of the PRC. </p><p>  It takes much longer to list which colonies Italy owned in Africa.  The conquered provinces, the Italian government united and created larger state associations.  Italian North Africa in 1934 became known as Libya.  It included Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica.  Italian East Africa consisted of Ethiopia (in 1936 it was called Abyssinia), Eritrea and Somalia. </p>
