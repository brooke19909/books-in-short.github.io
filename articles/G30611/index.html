    <p>  What preceded the foundation of Kievan Rus?  What factors contributed to the formation of the Old Russian nationality? </p><h2>  State foundation </h2><p>  In the ninth century, Slavic society reached the level where the creation of a legal field regulating conflicts was required.  Civil strife arose due to inequality.  The state is the legal field that can solve many conflict situations.  Without it, such a historical phenomenon as the Old Russian nationality could not exist.  In addition, the unification of the tribes was necessary, because the state is always stronger than the principalities not connected with each other. </p><p>  About when the state came together, uniting the <span>Eastern Slavs,</span> historians argue to this day.  At the beginning of the 9th century, the Ilmen Slovenes and Finno-Ugric tribes started such hostility that the local leaders decided on a desperate step: to invite experienced rulers, preferably from Scandinavia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Varangian rulers </h2><p>  According to the annals, the wise leaders sent a message to Rurik and his brothers, which said that their land was rich, fruitful, but there was no peace on it, only strife and strife.  The authors of the letter invited the Scandinavians to reign and restore order.  There was nothing shameful in this proposal for local rulers.  Noble strangers were often invited for this purpose. </p><p>  The foundation of Kievan Rus contributed to the unification of almost all of the East Slavic tribes, which were discussed in the annals.  Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians are the descendants of the inhabitants of the feudal principalities, united in a state that has become one of the most powerful in the Middle Ages. </p>

    <h2>  Legend </h2><p>  This city was the capital of the Slavic tribe of glades.  According to legend, Kiy once led them.  Helping him control Cheek and Horeb.  Kiev stood at the crossroads in a very convenient place.  Here they exchanged and bought grain, weapons, livestock, jewelry, fabrics.  Over time, Kiy, Horeb and Schek disappeared somewhere.  The Slavs paid tribute to the Khazars.  Passing by the Vikings occupied the "street" city.  The origin of Kiev is covered in secrets.  But the creation of the city is one of the prerequisites for the formation of the Old Russian nationality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the version that Chek is the founder of Kiev is under great doubt.  Rather, it is a myth, part of a folk epic. </p><h2>  Why exactly Kiev? </h2><p>  This city arose in the center of the territory inhabited by Eastern Slavs.  The location of Kiev, as already mentioned, is very convenient.  Wide steppes, fertile lands and dense forests.  In the city there were all conditions for cattle breeding, agriculture, hunting, and most importantly - for the defense of the enemy invasion. </p><p>  What historical sources speak of the birth of Kievan Rus?  About the emergence of the East Slavic state, and, consequently, of the Old Russian nationality, reports The Tale of Bygone Years.  After Rurik, who came to power at the invitation of local leaders, Oleg began to rule Novgorod.  Igor could not manage due to his young age. </p><p>  Oleg managed to concentrate power over Kiev and Novgorod. </p>

    <h2>  Historical concepts </h2><p>  The Old Russian nationality is an ethnic community in which the <span>Eastern Slavic tribes</span> united to form the early feudal state.  A few words should be said about what is hidden under this historical term. </p><p>  Nationality is a historical phenomenon characteristic of the early feudal period.  This is a community of people who are not members of a tribe.  But they are still not residents of a state with strong economic ties.  How does a nation differ from a nation?  Modern historians today have not come to a consensus.  Discussions are still ongoing regarding this issue.  But with confidence we can say that nationality is what unites people who have a common territory, culture, customs and traditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Periodization </h2><p>  The topic of the article is the Old Russian nationality.  Therefore, it is worth bringing a periodization of the development of Kievan Rus: </p><ol><li>  Occurrence. </li><li>  Heyday. </li><li>  Feudal fragmentation. </li></ol><p>  The first period dates back to the ninth to tenth centuries.  And it was then that the East Slavic tribes began to transform into a single community.  Of course, the differences between them disappeared gradually.  As a result of active communication and rapprochement, Old Russian language was formed from many dialects.  An original material and spiritual culture was created. </p><h2>  Rapprochement of tribes </h2><p>  East Slavic tribes lived in a territory that was subordinated to a single authority.  Apart from the constant feuds that occurred at the last stage of development of Kievan Rus.  But <span>mutually beneficial relations</span> led to the emergence of common traditions and customs. </p><p>  Old Russian nationality is a definition that implies not only the commonality of economic life, language, culture and territory.  This concept means a community consisting of basic, but irreconcilable classes - feudal lords and peasants. </p><p>  The formation of the Old Russian nationality was a long process.  Features in the culture and language of people living in different areas of the state have been preserved.  Differences are not erased, despite the rapprochement.  Later, this served as the basis for the formation of the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian nationalities. </p><p>  The concept of ‚ÄúOld Russian nationality‚Äù does not lose its relevance, because this community is the single root of fraternal peoples.  Residents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, through the centuries, carried an understanding of the proximity of culture and language.  The historical significance of the Old Russian nationality is great, regardless of the current political and economic situation.  In order to verify this, it is worth considering the components of this community, namely: language, customs, culture. </p>

    <h2>  History of the Old Russian Language </h2><p>  Representatives of the East Slavic tribes understood each other even before the foundation of Kievan Rus. </p><p>  The Old Russian language is the speech of the inhabitants who inhabited the territory of this feudal state from the sixth to the fourteenth century.  A huge role in the development of culture is played by the emergence of writing.  If, speaking of the time of the origin of the Old Russian language, historians call the seventh century, then the appearance of the first literary monuments can be attributed to the tenth century.  With the creation of the Cyril alphabet, the development of writing begins.  The so-called annals appear, which are also important historical documents. </p><p>  The ancient Russian ethnos began its development in the seventh century, but by the fourteenth, due to the strict feudal fragmentation, changes began to be observed in the speech of the inhabitants of the west, south, east of Kievan Rus.  It was then that dialects appeared that later formed into separate languages: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian. </p>

    <h2>  Culture </h2><p>  The reflection of the life experience of the people is oral creativity.  In the festive rites of the inhabitants of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, today there are many similarities.  How did oral poetic creation come about? </p><p>  Street musicians, wandering actors and singers roamed the streets of the Old Russian state.  They all had a common name - buffoons.  Motives of folk art formed the basis of many literary and musical works created much later. </p><p>  The epic epic was especially developed in the <span>early feudal state</span> .  Folk singers idealized the unity of Kievan Rus.  Characters of epics (for example, the hero Mikula Selyanovich) are depicted in epic works as rich, strong and independent.  Despite the fact that this hero was a peasant. </p><p>  Folk art influenced the legends and legends that have developed in the church and secular environment.  And this influence is noticeable in the culture of later periods.  Another source for the creation of literary works for the authors of Kievan Rus was military novels. </p>

    <h2>  Farm development </h2><p>  With the formation of the Old Russian nationality, representatives of East Slavic tribes began to perfect tools.  The household, however, remained in kind.  In the main industry - agriculture - widely used rails, spans, hoes, scythes, wheel plows. </p><p>  Significant successes with the formation of the Old Russian state were achieved by artisans.  The blacksmiths learned to harden, grind, and polish.  Representatives of this ancient craft made about one hundred and fifty kinds of iron products.  Especially famous were the swords of Old Russian blacksmiths.  Pottery, wood processing have also been actively developed.  Products of ancient Russian masters were known far beyond the borders of the state. </p><p>  The formation of the nation contributed to the development of crafts and agriculture, which subsequently led to an increase in the development of trade relations.  Kievan Rus developed economic relations with foreign countries.  A trade route "from the Varangians to the Greeks" passed through the Old Russian state. </p><h2>  Feudal relations </h2><p>  The formation of the Old Russian nationality occurred during the period of the establishment of feudalism.  What was this system of public relations?  The feudal lords, the cruelty of which Soviet historians spoke so much, really concentrated power and wealth in their hands.  They used the labor of urban artisans and dependent peasants.  Feudalism contributed to the formation of complex vassal relations, known from the history of the Middle Ages.  The great Kiev prince personified state power. </p><h2>  Class feuds </h2><p>  Smerd peasants cultivated the estates of the feudal lords.  Artisans paid tribute.  Serfs and servants lived the hardest.  As in other medieval states, in Kievan Rus, feudal exploitation intensified over time so that uprisings began.  The first took place in 994.  The story of the death of Igor, who, together with his team, decided once to collect a tribute for the second time, is known to everyone.  People‚Äôs anger is a terrible phenomenon in history, entailing incitement to strife, outrage, and sometimes even war. </p><h2>  Fighting Aliens </h2><p>  The Norman Scandinavian tribes continued their robbery attacks even when the East Slavic tribes were already an ethnic community.  In addition, Kievan Rus waged a continuous struggle against the hordes of the <span>Khazar Khaganate.</span>  Residents of the old Russian state bravely repelled enemy invasions.  And they themselves did not wait for another attack from the enemy, but, without thinking twice, set off.  Old Russian troops often equipped campaigns in enemy states.  Their glorious exploits are reflected in chronicles, epics. </p><h2>  Paganism </h2><p>  Territorial unity was significantly strengthened during the reign of Vladimir Svyatoslavovich.  Kievan Rus reached significant development, waged a fairly successful fight against the aggressive actions of the Lithuanian and Polish princes. </p><p>  Paganism negatively influenced the formation of ethnic unity.  The need was ripening for a new religion, which, of course, Christianity was to become.  Askold began to distribute it in the territory of Russia.  But then Kiev was captured by the prince of Novgorod and destroyed not so long ago the erected Christian churches. </p><h2>  The introduction of a new faith </h2><p>  The mission of introducing a new religion took on Vladimir.  However, there were many admirers of paganism in Russia.  The fight against them has been conducted for many years.  Even before the adoption of Christianity, attempts were made to update the pagan religion.  Vladimir Svyatoslavovich, for example, in 980 approved the existence of a group of gods led by Perun.  What was needed was an idea common to the whole state.  And his center was bound to be in Kiev. </p><p>  Paganism, however, has outlived itself.  And therefore, Vladimir, after long deliberation, chose Orthodoxy.  In the choice, he was guided, first of all, by practical interests. </p><h2>  Tough choices </h2><p>  According to one version, the prince listened to the opinions of several priests before making a choice.  Each, as you know, has its own truth.  The Muslim world attracted Vladimir, but he was scared of circumcision.  In addition, the Russian table cannot be without pork and wine.  The Jewish faith of the prince did not inspire confidence at all.  Greek was colorful, spectacular.  And political interests finally determined the choice of Vladimir. </p><p>  Religion, traditions, culture - all this unites the population of countries where tribes once lived, united in the Old Russian ethnic union.  And even after centuries, the connection between such peoples as Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian is inextricable. </p>
