    <h2>  History of the Principality of Monaco </h2><p>  This secluded harbor was originally inhabited by the Greeks in 6 BC.  e.  Legend has it that Hercules once passed through Monaco, and the Monoikos Temple was built in his honor.  Historically, this country was part of France, but in 1215 it became a colony of Genoa by decree of Emperor <span>Henry VI.</span>  Grimaldi settled here in 1297, and the ancestors of the family control the principality to this day. </p><p>  In 1419, the Grimaldi family acquired Monaco from France.  Since then, the principality has been protected by Spain, Italy and Sardinia.  In 1793, the French revolutionary troops captured Monaco and held it until 1814.  Today, a constitutional monarchy is established in the country, but the principality is under the protectorate of France. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly </h2>

    <p>  In 1949, Prince Rainier III ascended the throne of Monaco.  In 1956, he married the beautiful American actress Grace Kelly.  This event was a turning point not only in her professional career, but also in the life of the whole principality.  The famous actress at the peak of popularity left the cinema for marriage.  This news stirred not only Hollywood, but the rest of the world.  This event brought fame to the principality.  Previously, they talked about him only as the place where the Monaco Grand Prix is ‚Äã‚Äãheld in the Formula 1 championship.  Now the eyes of the rich and famous, riveted to Grace Kelly, turned to a small principality.  Having received the title of princess, the actress invested her energy in promoting the arts.  This brought charm to a small country and contributed to its economic and cultural development.  They had three children in common: Caroline, Albert and Stephanie. </p><p>  Grace Kelly's sudden death in a car accident in 1982 was a shock that was reflected worldwide.  Films and books were written about her life, and death is still shrouded in mystery around which conspiracy theories are built.  Prince Rainier III continued to rule Monaco after her death and was a respected monarch.  He no longer married and died in 2005, leaving the throne to his son, Prince Albert II. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Current status </h2><p>  The capital of the Principality of Monaco is the city of the same name.  The form of government is a constitutional monarchy.  The economy rests on tourism, gambling and banking.  Lack of income tax attract many wealthy residents.  The banking industry and money management generate 16% of revenues and play an important role in the economy.  In <span>addition, the country</span> is famous for its casinos, whose visitors come from all over the world to play in elite establishments.

    <p>  Monaco is located on the Mediterranean Sea and is surrounded by France on three sides.  Nice is the nearest major city, which is approximately 18 km away.  The terrain is quite rocky, located on steep hills that descend to the sea.  The climate is mild all year round, the temperature varies from 8 to 26 degrees Celsius. </p><p>  Monaco is divided into four quarters: </p><ul><li>  Monaco-Ville is an old city located on a rocky cape. </li><li>  La Condamine is a port area. </li><li>  Monte Carlo is the main resort, residential and tourist area. </li><li>  Fontvieille - a new plot built on alluvial land. </li></ul><h2>  Monaco population </h2><p>  More than a quarter of the country's population are French citizens.  A smaller but significant number are Italians, Swiss and Belgians.  One fifth is the Monegasques, representatives of the indigenous population, </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Monegasques are proud of the unique history and position of their country in the world.  It is believed that the name Monaco comes from the word "monoikos", associated with both the ancient Greeks and the Ligurians.  Ligurians settled on the Mediterranean coast even before the era of the Roman Empire.  The coastal road used by the Ligurians later became known as the "Hercules Road."  In Greek, Hercules was often called "Hercules Monoikos" or "Hercules."  Monegasques have managed to maintain their traditions and dialect for centuries, despite the influence of their much larger neighbors.  Their <span>cultural identity is</span> reflected in many local festivals and is part of Monaco's worldwide fame.  However, only a small portion of citizens can call themselves Monegasques.  The rest are people of different nationalities. </p><h2>  Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãMonaco </h2><p>  There are more and more tourists who want to visit this country every year.  They are probably interested in what language they speak in Monaco.  This is a multinational country, but France had the greatest impact on it.  Therefore, it is not surprising that French became the official language of Monaco.  It is the language of management, business, education and the media. </p><p>  The native <span>population of Monaco</span> speaks Monegasque, and it is he who is considered traditional.  It looks a lot like Italian.  Only about 21.6% of the population, who are mainly ethnic Monegasques, speak this language.  And although the authorities are struggling to preserve their native dialect, its use is decreasing every year.  By the 1970s, the language was on the verge of extinction, but several projects initiated by the government of Monaco helped raise its status.  Currently, schools teach this language, and street signs are made in two versions: in French and Monegasque.  Another traditional language of Monaco is Occitan.  Currently, only a small part of the country's population speaks it. </p><p>  In addition to the above languages, Italian and English are popular here.  This is not surprising, since Italians make up about 19% of the country's population.  For some time, Italian was even the official language of Monaco (between 1815 and 1861), when the principality was under the protectorate of Sardinia.  Some members of the princely family speak Italian.  English is mainly used by citizens of the UK, USA and Canada, permanently residing in the country.  The official language of Monaco is French, but English remains the most popular among tourists. </p><h2>  Culture </h2>

    <p>  Throughout history, the neighbors of Monaco (France, Italy and Spain) have had a huge influence on the principality.  Therefore, art traces the elements of their cultures.  The constitution allows religious freedom, but the majority of the population consider themselves to be supporters of the Roman Catholic Church (about 78% of citizens). </p><p>  The ruling Grimaldi family has played an important role in promoting culture and art in Monaco.  The city boasts exquisite architecture.  Visitors will find an amazing array of world-class galleries where they can attend musical performances throughout the year.  Many of them are supported by members of the princely family.  In addition, Grimaldi has created many charitable organizations, including the foundations of Princess Grace (who also supports the Dance Academy), Prince Pierre (funding for culture and art) and Prince Albert II (protecting the environment). </p><h2>  Monaco Cuisine </h2><p>  Access to fresh vegetables, fruits and seafood has determined the local cuisine.  In addition, the food reflects the Mediterranean heritage of the country, and the influence of French and Italian cuisine can be found in many recipes. </p><p>  Fine dining seafood is served in each of the many restaurants.  Among them, cod and anchovies dominate.  The warm climate allows you to complement the fish with local vegetables.  Separately, it is worth highlighting onions, garlic and olives (or olive oil), which are included in many dishes.  As a rule, breakfast is very small, but for lunch and dinner often several dishes are served - this tradition has taken root in Monaco.  Reviews about the restaurants are purely positive, because the owners, fearing to lose wealthy customers, maintain the service at the highest level. </p><h2>  What to visit in Monaco? </h2><p>  The main attraction of the principality is the Monte Carlo casino, which is a huge entertainment complex located in the same area.  It includes a casino and an opera house.  The famous French architect Carl Garnier built the casino in 1878.  The atrium, laid in marble, is surrounded by 28 ionic columns.  He leads to the audience of the opera Sal Garnier, decorated with a large number of bas-reliefs, frescoes and sculptures.  For over a century, outstanding international performances have been held here, as well as operas, ballets and concerts.  The ‚Äúgame rooms‚Äù include a number of numerous rooms with stained glass windows, exquisite decorations and sculptures, allegorical paintings and bronze lamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to visit in monaco" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2092298.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Princely Palace of Monaco today is home to the son and successor of Prince Rainier - Prince Albert II.  State rooms are open to the public in the summer.  Since 1960, the palace courtyard has become the venue for open-air concerts, presented by the Monte Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra.  It also opens for important events, such as celebrating weddings or birthdays in the Grimaldi family.  The assembled citizens of Monaco turn to the prince from the gallery of Hercules, overlooking the square.  The yard is also used for the annual <span>Christmas ball</span> for children.

    <p>  The many attractions of the Principality of Monaco will impress even the most demanding tourist. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In addition to the famous Grand Prix and the presence of the luxurious casino "Monte Carlo", there are no less interesting facts about this country that not everyone knows about: </p><ol><li>  Monaco is often called the tax haven of Europe.  For decades, the country has lived solely on revenue from its casinos.  Currently, thanks to the efforts of the government, tourism has become a major source of profit. </li><li>  If you want to go to the city of Monaco, then you can get to it by train, your helicopter or yacht, but not by private plane.  There are no airports, and the nearest one is in Nice.  Fortunately, Monaco and France are 30 minutes away from each other. </li><li>  Descendants of Francois Grimaldi, Genoese Guelph leader, have ruled Monaco for over 712 years.  This explains why most citizens are Catholics. </li><li>  Monaco is open to tourists at any time of the year - every month something happens here.  From exclusive open-air Monte Carlo Philharmonic concerts to sporting events, such as the famous Formula One Grand Prix. </li><li>  The elegant facade and interiors at Monte Carlo Casino were the location of the three James Bond films, namely Casino Royale, Golden Eye and Never Say Never. </li><li>  The crime rate in Monaco is very low.  This is mainly due to the fact that there are more police officers per person than in any other country.  In addition, the principality has a large number of video surveillance cameras to prevent criminal activity. </li><li>  There is almost zero unemployment.  There is also no poverty in the country. </li><li>  Do not be surprised if you find out that citizens of Monaco are forbidden to play and even visit casinos.  The rule is established by the government of a country that does not want its citizens to waste their money.  Casino is a source of income for the country and provides the work of its residents. </li><li>  The Formula 1 Grand Prix is ‚Äã‚Äãone of the main events that the country holds every year. </li><li>  In 2014, nearly 30% of the Monaco population were millionaires - just like in Zurich or Geneva. </li></ol>
