  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nohon batteries: reviews and specifications. Nohon Battery for Apple iPhone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you actively use your smartphone for more than 2-3 years, then you may encounter the problem of wear on the built-in battery.  Autonomy is catastrophically reduced, and one charge is no longer enough not just for a day, but just for the duration of the road to work and back.  Of course, you can temporarily solve the problem with an external battery, but this will only delay the inevitable.  The built-in battery requires replacement, and finding a good one for older models can be quite problematic.  Often, what is sold as the original has very mediocre characteristics.  There are cases that such batteries lose their capacity, swell after a couple of months of use.  However, as numerous reviews show, Nohon batteries, although not original, can compete with factory ones in quality and capacity.  To understand their pros and cons, it is worth familiarizing yourself with what they are, for which smartphones they are suitable, and how not to buy a fake. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The first distinguishing feature, speaking about the care of the manufacturer, can be called a delivery kit.  If the smartphone is without a removable cover, then replacing the battery requires its complete disassembly.  Not everyone at home has the necessary set of tools, so the supplier included the necessary screwdrivers, plastic picks and shovels in the package.  For iPhone 6S batteries, the kit is complemented by a special suction cup designed for the safe dismantling of the display module.  It will be easy to replace the battery yourself even in the absence of skills. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to all this, the iPhone 5S battery with a company logo is also located in a blister pack.  Its appearance does not cause the sensation of a cheap product.  The print on the sticker is even, there are no blurry or skewed letters.  The sticker itself is tailored exactly to the size of the battery.  In general, it does not seem that the battery is made somewhere in a dusty workshop.  It is clearly seen that the batteries are manufactured by the factory method, which further enhances confidence in quality.  In order to fix the battery inside the phone, a special double-sided tape is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.locflex.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nohon high capacity battery for iphone" class="if uuid-3224793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224793.jpg"></div><h2>  How not to buy a fake </h2><p>  Since this manufacturer is quite famous for high-quality copies of batteries, fakes began to appear on the market that copy the appearance of these spare parts.  However, often such a fake can already be determined by the scope of delivery - the counterfeit is rarely supplied with a complete set of tools, or even comes without packaging at all.  In order not to fall for fake spare parts, you can familiarize yourself with the appearance and protection elements on the official website of the manufacturer.  So, a genuine hologram that is hard to fake should be present on a genuine Nohon battery pack.  If necessary, you can contact the manufacturer at the email address indicated on the website and ask for the coordinates of authorized stores that sell these batteries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  IPhone Battery Replacement Features </h2><p>  As mentioned above, before replacing the battery in the iPhone 6S yourself, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the instructions for disassembling the device.  If the built-in battery starts to swell, it is recommended not to wait for the arrival of a new one, but to remove it in advance, because otherwise the display may be damaged due to pressure from inside the case.  When disassembling the device, you should clearly remember where each screw is removed from.  The fact is that in these smartphones they have different lengths.  One can‚Äôt notice this by sight, but if you screw a longer screw into the place of a short one, there is a completely non-fake chance to damage the device‚Äôs board, and recovery from such a malfunction is quite expensive, if at all possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techaudible.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nohon battery" class="if uuid-3224784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224784.jpg"></div><p>  When opening and assembling a smartphone, you should not make much effort.  For the most part, structural elements and latches, if they are not glued, are quite easily dismantled when force is applied at the right angle.  If this does not happen, make sure that all latches are removed.  For example, the battery cable on the iPhone 5S can be fixed with a metal screen with an invisible screw. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The battery is removed by removing the old double-sided tape.  There is a simple secret how to remove it quickly and without additional tools.  On one side of the battery are two black grips attached to the tape.  If you pull them without much effort, so as not to tear, you can easily pull out the entire strip of adhesive tape from under the battery.  Thus, during dismantling, the old battery will not be damaged and you will not have to use the tool to heat the smartphone. </p><p>  After installing the new Nohon battery, the iPhone is assembled in the reverse order.  To fix the display module, special adhesives are used that provide reliable fixation, but at the same time provide the possibility of re-disassembly.  Usually they have a silicone structure and soften when exposed to temperature.  If you need to re-disassemble the smartphone, then even with the help of a household hair dryer, you can ease it by warming the smartphone around the perimeter. </p><h2>  Standard batteries </h2><p>  The manufacturer produces two types of batteries.  The first is standard models.  They most accurately copy not only the size, but also the technical characteristics of the original.  According to the developers of spare parts, the maximum difference lies only in the corporate design of the Nohon battery for the iPhone 5S.  Reviews show that sometimes such batteries are better than the original ones, especially if we are not talking about models for the iPhone, but simpler ones like Xiaomi or Huawei. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5s battery" class="if uuid-3224782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224782.jpg"></div><p>  When creating them, reverse engineering methods are used, due to which the controllers are as close as possible to the factory ones.  So, on iPhones after installing Nohon Battery, all built-in systems for monitoring battery wear and battery consumption by individual applications continue to work, which cannot be said about many cheaper copies. </p><h2>  High capacity batteries </h2><p>  However, the manufacturer did not stop developing full copies.  Thanks to developing technologies, at the moment it is possible to create batteries for older models of smartphones, which will have exactly the same size, but higher capacity.  Thus, a team of professionals managed to launch Nohon high-capacity batteries for iPhone 5 and newer on the market, which are characterized by increased autonomy compared to the original.  Due to this, even such old smartphones can be quite relevant in our time, despite the fact that the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù in them is not the most energy efficient. </p><p>  Such batteries are also appreciated for the fact that they are capable of delivering a higher single current.  Some smartphones had problems with reboots during the launch of applications that require a significant amount of resources and use all the capabilities of the processor.  This was due to the fact that the old battery was simply not able to satisfy the need for instantaneous power output, which was required at this particular time.  Users who installed such copies were able to completely get rid of this annoying factor, which often manifested itself during active gaming. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nohon battery for iphone 5s reviews" class="if uuid-3224795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224795.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery Tests with Testers </h2><p>  Some customers with the appropriate equipment and skills checked the Nohon batteries that arrived at them using special chargers.  Their feature is the ability to accurately measure the battery capacity during several charge-discharge cycles. </p><p>  As these users note, in most cases, the indicators corresponded to the data declared by the manufacturer, and sometimes even exceeded them.  This indicates the honesty of the developer of spare parts and confirms the high quality of components. </p><p>  Similar testing was carried out for batteries manufactured for installation on a wide variety of smartphones.  A separate plus is the presence of batteries for very old models.  So, at the moment you can buy batteries for smartphones released more than 10 years ago.  Despite this time period, these devices still remain relevant for many users, but it would be rather difficult to find high-quality replacement batteries without Nohon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="nohon iphone" class="if uuid-3224787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224787.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive battery reviews </h2><p>  Many users who bought replacement batteries from this manufacturer tried to share with others information regarding their quality, as well as compare these batteries with offers from other companies.  As a result, there are quite a few reviews and reviews on Nohon batteries on the Web.  If you choose the main points from them, then you can make a list of the main advantages, among which the following stand out: </p><ul><li>  The presence of official, authorized stores.  Since the manufacturer appreciates its reputation and well-known brand, sales are mainly made only through a network of authorized stores with spare parts.  Buying a battery for iPhone 5S elsewhere, you may find that it turns out to be a significantly lower quality fake.  You can find such stores on the official website of the manufacturer. </li><li>  Anti-spoof packaging.  To prevent the battery from being replaced during delivery, a blister pack with decals is provided to help ensure that the components are original.  There is a holographic sticker on it, as well as information about the guarantee. </li><li>  Providing warranty service.  Despite the fact that the manufacturer is located in China, it provides the ability to replace illiquid goods.  Confidence in the quality of components is expressed in the fact that a guarantee is provided for a period of 6 months - this is exactly the same as that given on original batteries sold with smartphones in stores.  Thus, the manufacturer claims that its batteries are no worse than the original. </li><li>  The presence of a complete set of necessary tools.  If you want to replace the battery yourself, then the provided screwdrivers and spatulas will allow you to do this without unnecessary costs.  Such a specific tool alone is usually quite expensive.  Therefore, the offer from the manufacturer of the complete set, including special double-sided tape, is quite profitable, despite the fact that it slightly increases the total cost of the package. </li><li>  Compliance with the declared capacity of the real.  Numerous tests have shown that the manufacturer is not trying to dishonestly earn by overstating the Nohon battery capacity for Xiaomi Mi5.  Thanks to this, you can be sure that after installing a new battery, the smartphone will at least do without an outlet as long as immediately after purchase. </li><li>  The presence of reinforced batteries.  Batteries with increased capacity breathe new life into old models, for which modern programs are high-load and significantly reduce battery life.  Therefore, in the case of batteries on the "iPhone 5S" it is recommended to take precisely reinforced options. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the list of positive qualities is quite long, and it can be continued.  However, do not forget that any, even the highest quality components have their drawbacks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="finestphoneaccessories.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6s battery" class="if uuid-3224785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224785.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative points noted in the reviews </h2><p>  Some users point to a few shortcomings, which, although rare, are still significant enough to think about them before buying.  So, one of the key points in reviews of Nohon batteries is that sometimes the cable coming from the battery can be a fraction of a millimeter longer or shorter than the original.  Although this distance seems small, during installation, an error can complicate the work, as it will be more difficult to get into the latch.  Therefore, some customers when installing a battery recommend first fastening the cable, and only then stick the battery in its rightful place. </p><p>  The second drawback is the low prevalence in local markets and in component stores.  To be sure that the battery is original, you have to make an order from China, which translates into a long wait for an international parcel.  However, for those who order the battery in advance, this should not be a problem.  Moreover, in some cases, the manufacturer puts a small gift in the package - a transparent silicone case or stylus.  It seems to be trifles, but still nice. </p><p>  Another disadvantage is the cost, but this concept is relative.  For smartphones 10 years ago, this figure can be critical, since the battery will cost as much as 20-25 percent of the smartphone itself, or even more.  However, with regard to modern models, the situation here looks much better.  Therefore, self-replacement remains the most profitable option, which will allow the smartphone to last another couple of years without a constant connection to the outlet, especially since the characteristics of Nohon batteries exceed those of the original components. </p><h2>  Battery check without special equipment </h2><p>  To make sure that the battery is working and working properly, you can perform a test yourself.  To do this, you need to completely discharge the smartphone, and then put it to charge using the original power supply, after starting the stopwatch.  It is advisable to charge in the off state in order to minimize the error.  Here's how much on average iPhones of different generations should be charged: </p><ul><li>  iPhone 5SE, 6, 6S - 2 hours 10 minutes. </li><li>  iPhone 6 Plus, 6S Plus - 3 hours 40 minutes. </li><li>  iPhone 7 - 2 hours 20 minutes. </li><li>  iPhone 7 Plus - 3 hours 40 minutes. </li></ul><p>  Time should approximately correspond to these values ‚Äã‚Äãor be higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rapidrepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5s battery" class="if uuid-3224786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/3224786.jpg"></div><p>  To check the work on discharge, just run the video on YouTube in the highest quality, with maximum brightness and sound.  Its playback time will be approximately equal to the time that a smartphone can work under maximum load. </p><p>  In some reviews of Nohon batteries, users are advised to use the built-in utilities for tracking battery consumption, as well as additional programs that can be downloaded using branded app stores, for more detailed results and statistics. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Do not be afraid to independently replace the battery on your smartphone.  If you do all the operations according to the instructions and carefully, causing damage will be quite difficult.  Most smartphones do not require specific disassembly to replace the battery.  For example, common Xiaomi models are disassembled using a plastic tool without heating, since it is not necessary to peel off the display module.  Moreover, the lid is removed without effort, and the only thing that needs to be turned off is the cable of the fingerprint sensor or fingerprint scanner.  After that, full access to the battery appears.  As a result, the entire replacement process takes several minutes.  In the case of the iPhone, a little more operations are required, but still, according to reviews about Nohon batteries, everyone can do it.  Considering the cost of this operation in service centers, as well as the inability to check the quality of the installed components, self-replacement remains the most budget option that is suitable for those who do not like to waste money. </p>
