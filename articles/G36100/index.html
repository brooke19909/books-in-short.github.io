They are often used in landscape design when highlighting individual objects, but the most effective solution from the point of view of street decoration is a garland on a tree with LED diodes.  Such models differ from traditional garlands not only in their original glow, but also in the variety of structural solutions. </p>

    <h2>  LED String Overview </h2><p>  The basis of LED garlands is formed by LED elements of miniature sizes.  If for bulbs this format is still not optimal, then the diodes in a full-sized version have compact dimensions.  Therefore, it is possible to decorate trees with garlands in almost a dotted version, as in ceiling lighting.  LEDs are controlled through the controller unit.  This component is also used in normal lighting to control backlight modes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Obviously, garland maintenance involves much more functionality, which manufacturers also consider.  Even budget inexpensive kits are provided with several modes of operation of the fixtures, which can be controlled remotely. </p><h2>  The benefits of LED lights </h2>

    <p>  Among the main advantages of LED backlight elements, a high working resource is noted.  On average, a garland on a tree as a source of decoration serves about 50 thousand hours, which is several times higher than similar indicators of halogen and luminescent models. </p><p>  Here it is worth emphasizing another feature.  Traditional incandescent bulbs, for example, spend about 10% of their energy directly on scattering light, and the rest goes to heat.  LED elements consume all the energy completely for light output.  The lack of heating at the same time affects both the reduction of energy consumption and safety, since the garland can come into close contact with dry branches and leaves. </p><p>  <span>Decorative LED-lamps</span> and practicality are distinguished.  The technical design of the same diodes makes it possible to use a huge range of finishing materials for the housing and bundles of bulbs with each other.  This allows you to place garlands for trees on the street in any configuration options without restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Varieties by source of energy supply </h2>

    <p>  As in the case with other lamps, LEDs can operate either directly from the network or from the battery pack.  The first option is most common, since in this case the convenience and reliability of operation is ensured.  The disadvantage of this method is the complication of the scheme by which the garland is installed on the trees.  LED elements are demanding on control and management devices.  As already noted, the controller will be an essential component in the circuit, but it is also necessary to include a safety unit in the system to ensure safety.  If you consider that the power supply line should start from the home electrical network, then there may be difficulties with the technical organization of this solution. </p><p>  In terms of organization, it will be much easier to use the battery pack or batteries.  These are autonomous power supplies that eliminate the need to lay long lines from the network.  But this method of energy supply has its own drawback.  Depending on which garland is installed on the tree, a low-power battery for its power supply may simply not have enough energy potential.  Even with nominally sufficient characteristics, some batteries in the form of batteries at low temperatures in the winter can malfunction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Varieties of designs </h2>

    <p>  The most popular and versatile version of decorative LED-backlighting is duralight.  In essence, this is an LED strip, which, thanks to its flexibility and elasticity, allows you to form contours with multi-colored lights.  Based on such ribbons, one can organize a chain of serial garlands for trees on the street, which will be connected into one structure of the control controller.  That is, the modes of operation will be the same for the entire group of lights. </p><p>  Another equally interesting option is a clip light.  In this case, we are talking about a wire on which LED low-voltage bulbs are fixed.  A similar solution would be a play light, also called "light rain."  These are also street <span>LED garlands</span> for trees, but they are arranged according to the type of hanging toys.  In finished form, such a system forms cascades of luminous threads that hang from the branches of a tree. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  On the Russian market there are many options for LED garlands, which are mainly produced by Chinese manufacturers.  But in this choice you can find quality products.  For example, street garlands on Leon LED trees are distinguished by reliable performance of electrical filling.  In this case, both the controller and power circuits are based on a high-quality elemental base. </p>

    <p>  The Dutch company Koopman, whose production is located just in the Middle Kingdom, offers quite crude technically, but affordable sets.  They separately include lights and components for the organization of electrical engineering.  In general, such sets are also of good quality, but to work with them will require at least the experience of a radio amateur. </p><p>  And for those who want to get ready-made LED street garlands for trees, you should turn to TDM and Sturm products.  These are not just assembled and ready-to-use fixtures, but devices with rich optional capabilities, including a full set of controllers, fuses and mounting hardware. </p><h2>  What to consider when choosing? </h2>

    <p>  Initially, you should have an idea about the configuration of the placement of the garland, the power system and the approximate amount of lighting material.  At a minimum, this will help determine the type of optimally suitable lamp.  Next, specific parameters are determined, among which the length of the backlight line, the frequency of placement of the lights, their number, light characteristics, etc. It is also necessary to take into account that the garland on a tree in winter outdoor conditions will be subjected to intense external loads.  It is enough to note the temperature, precipitation and gusts of wind.  Only high-quality insulation in the design of the lamp will help to protect LED elements. </p><h2>  Recommendations for use </h2><p>  First of all, you should delicately unpack the garland, straighten and visually check the condition of its shell and LEDs.  To test the performance, most of these fixtures can be connected to a 220 V network. If the device is working, then you can start decorating.  At this stage, everyone can choose the arrangement of lights on the target object to their taste.  Also, some kits allow, on the contrary, to make a tree from a garland with your own hands with the use of fixing accessories.  But this design option is only possible with flexible contours that hold a given shape. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  It is advantageous to give preference to LED garlands not only because of operational advantages.  Modern LED-devices for illumination have introduced a fundamentally new technological possibilities of decoration in the segment.  For example, in the market you can find statodynamic street garlands of trees that faithfully mimic fireworks and salutes.  But compared to real pyrotechnics, such lights are completely safe.  Also, with the help of controllers, the rhythm of changing flicker modes can be tuned to chords for playing musical compositions, which will be especially true for the New Year. </p>
