It is located between two airports.  The first of these is Milas, and the second is Bodrum.  To the last distance of thirty-eight kilometers.  Before Milas - twenty-five.  To the city of Bodrum - twelve kilometers.  The hotel is very unusual, interesting and original.  Perhaps this is why tourists like it, who leave positive feedback about it.  The hotel is an economy class, but the services in it are primary, and the staff tries, as in the "five", and works from the heart.  The hotel belongs to the chain of hotels Cande, famous not only in Turkey, but throughout the world. </p>

    <h2>  Bodrum - photos and reviews </h2><p>  This place is called the most party resort in the country.  Bodrum on a map of Turkey is located in the very north of Gokova Bay, in the Aegean Sea.  This is the border with the Mediterranean.  And directly opposite Bodrum is the Greek island of Kos.  In addition, it is the center of a huge resort area with fourteen bays.  Surfers and active sports enthusiasts come here.  According to <span>tourists, this is a</span> very good place to visit almost any corner of Turkey.  From the local bus station, public transport leaves in Pamukkale, and in Izmir, and in Istanbul, and in Ankara.  The town itself is unusually picturesque, especially in the evenings, and is famous for its port, markets and the ancient fortress of St. Peter.  By the way, the castle has an exhibition of Islamic glass and the country's only museum of underwater archeology.  And from the harbor, many wooden boats - gulets - go for walks.  At this place once stood one of the seven wonders of the world.  This is the mausoleum of Halicarnassus, and if you are a lover of antiquities, you can look at what remains of it.  The village of Torba, where the Ora Hotel is located, is one of the resort places closest to the center of Bodrum.  It is considered to be fashionable, not so many hotels have been built here, and the water is of amazing purity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Bodrum Hotels </h2><p>  The city and surrounding areas are amphitheater in a natural pit.  On the terraces along its walls are hotels of different categories.  Almost all the beaches of the resort belong to them.  If such hotels have elevators that transport tourists from above directly to the sea, then these are usually 5 hotels.  Bodrum is famous for its luxurious first-class complexes, such as Marmara, Kariya Princess, Ersan Resort and Spa, Club Virgin and so on.  They are far from the center, but they have a huge territory and represent entire mini-towns for recreation.  However, as experienced travelers assure, the difference between them and class 4 hotels is not huge at all.  Quite often, the local ‚Äúfours‚Äù are better than the Anatolian ‚Äúfives‚Äù and are absolutely not inferior to local hotels of the highest category.  Torba hotels are known for being designed by famous architects, and they fit perfectly into the local forest landscapes. </p><h2>  How to arrive at the hotel </h2><p>  Russian vacationers traveling with travel agencies, as a rule, fly to <span>Dalaman airport.</span>  From there, they get to the place for two hours.  If you do not have a transfer, and you travel on your own, then you will need to go to the city either by the "Hashash" bus, which specially arrives "for flights", especially of "Turkish Airlines", or by taxi.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter which airport you fly to - Bodrum or Milas.  It takes forty-five minutes to get to Bodrum from any of them - a maximum of about an hour.  And then you can transfer to the Dolmush minibus, which stops right in front of the Ora Holiday Village 4 Hotel (Bodrum).  Drive to Torba - about fifteen minutes.  But keep in mind that minibuses run exclusively during the day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Ora Holiday Village 4 consists of one hundred and sixty bungalows located in terraces.  They are one-, two- and three-story.  To say that there is a garden on the territory, it means simply not to convey anything.  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the hotel is simply surrounded by greenery.  It seems that you live in the gardens of Babylon.  A lot of flowers, tropical trees, squirrels are jumping along the alleys ... Very good air.  During the heat, you can go to the sea in the shade.  At the time of flowering, everything is rampant with colors and aromas.  This park is shared with another hotel - Onura Holiday Village.  Hotels are different in style of construction.  "Onura" is made in the Greek style - two-story white houses.  Ora guests can eat in their fellow restaurants, while guests at another hotel go swimming at the local beach.  There are four shops with various goods at the hotel, a hairdresser.  The reception has free Wi-Fi. </p>

    <h2>  Service and entertainment </h2><p>  Ora Holiday Village 4 has a good parking, you can exchange currency, rent a car, and wash your clothes.  Tourists write that the hotel has good conditions for playing sports.  There is a gym and hammam, you can do aerobics, play futsal, volleyball, basketball, tennis (two courts work).  Good billiard room.  The beach has plenty of fun - canoeing, pedalos and even windsurfing.  All this is included in the tour price.  But water skiing and motorbikes, as well as riding a "banana" - already for a fee.  A playground is open for children, and there is also a mini-club where kids up to twelve years old can go.  Excellent animation, including in Russian, many shows.  Chinese circus, African acrobats and other guest stars come.  But to get to the disco, you need to go with animators to special clubs. </p><h2>  Sea bathing and spending time at the pool </h2><p>  Ora Holiday Village 4 is two hundred meters from the beach.  It is pebble and sand, and in addition, on its territory there is a wooden platform.  The beach is well-maintained, very clean, in a large number of sunbeds, deck chairs, <span>parasols.</span>  In Bodrum, two seas merge - the Mediterranean and the Aegean.  Therefore, it is difficult to say in which waters the guests have to swim.  For fun, the coast is called "Sredigeyskom".  But the water is exceptionally clean and clear, and there are a lot of fish that children like to feed.  But to enter the sea you need special shoes.  You can still swim from the pier - for a more comfortable entry into the water, a staircase descends.  And near the living quarters themselves there is a swimming pool with slides (it works on a schedule), as well as a children's ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù.  To take a <span>beach towel,</span> you need to leave a deposit.  There are two pools on the territory of Onura.  They are deep, of an original form, multi-level, with waterfalls - there is where to swim.  One of them has an artificial island with sun loungers. </p>
