  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dream Me, Beautiful Bird!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We all have dreams.  Colorful and bright, black and white, calm, pleasant.  In the process of sleep, we can even experience hunger, fear, a surge of strength.  We talk in a dream, or we are silent, we can sing in a dream, we can give out pas that are even unfamiliar to us in real life. </p><p>  If you translate this into the language of cinema, then everyone sees dreams in different ways.  Someone gets meaningless shorts, seconds of 3 or 4, which in the morning can neither be understood nor really remember what the messages of the unconscious were about.  Someone, probably lovers of various protracted series, get long dreams, for 20 minutes, with a twisted plot, with a sequel in a week. </p><p>  Human curiosity has no limits.  To know what was foreshadowed by this or that dream, to correctly interpret it, to see all the signs, is a task that is solved by more than one generation of people.  The number of dream books is growing every day.  Dream themes, their plots, repeatability and coincidences are objects to study. </p><p>  The theme of birds that we see in a dream occupies a large place.  Apparently because in real life, birds accompany us everywhere.  Can you recall at least one day without mentioning the birds?  Telecasts, radio programs, print media, the Internet - they will find a place everywhere. </p><p>  Literature on why birds sing is accidentally caught my eye.  Pictures with the most beautiful and ugliest representatives of this class of wildlife.  And stories about the intervention of birds in human activity and modern methods of protection against birds - about devices and <noindex>  <span>bird scarers</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  But how to explain the appearance of birds in our dreams?  Interpretations that give dream books can be divided into several groups.  If you dream of birds of prey, a falcon or a hawk - this is a real danger that may come from our opponents.  To kill a bird of prey in a dream, to shoot it means, according to the interpreters of dreams, overcoming obstacles, to victory over circumstances. </p><p>  A beautiful bird with amazingly beautiful plumage predicts a woman or girl a quick and happy marriage.  A dream where birds fly - to prosperity and good luck, to the expectation of better days.  White birds from your dream carry the good news. </p><p>  To hear birds singing in a dream, to hear how they echo in the forest more often - unfortunately, warns us of the impossibility or inability to solve some current task, problem.  Perhaps you need to change something in yourself and return to the task with renewed vigor. </p><p>  If you dreamed of a small, nondescript bird, you can not worry.  Contrary to its dim plumage, this dream suggests that peace and quiet will come to your family. </p><p>  Dreams, especially good ones, cheer you up and make you look at things differently.  However, it is not worthwhile to focus on stories from night travel and run to the dream book, firstly, there are a lot of dream books, and secondly, almost everyone has their own interpretation of what they saw, heard, felt.  Is it still better to trust your feelings and intuitions? </p></div></article>
