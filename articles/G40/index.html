    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  Administratively, Switzerland is divided into cantons.  Some of them are German-speaking, others speak Italian or French.  But tourists are most interested in which mountain region one or another Swiss resort belongs to.  So where is Zermatt located?  Administratively - in the French and German-speaking canton of Valais.  But more importantly, this resort lies on the slopes of the Matterhorn - the fifth highest peak of the Alpine mountains.  So, <span>skiing</span> on the blue shimmering glaciers is provided to you even in the summer.  And one more thing: Matterhorn peak has another name - Cervinha.  And this means that, having risen on the lift along the Swiss side, you can go skiing straight to Italy.  But even without this Zermatt is an unusual resort.  For many years now he has been holding the leadership among other Swiss ski areas in the number of mountain skiers.  And not because it is budgetary.  Rather, the opposite: Zermatt is one of the most expensive resorts.  The secret lies in the fact that the Matterhorn peak, a characteristic brilliant file crashing into the sky, can be seen from everywhere.  Its snowy peak is a peculiar visiting card of the country called Switzerland.  Zermatt, whose photos and posters are the most recognizable (at least by the “Tabletton” chocolate wrapper), gives its guests a year-round atmosphere of celebration, sparkling fun and European chic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort development </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, no one had heard of a village lost in the mountains.  And now it has become chic to go there for a winter vacation. And then Zermatt was not really a settlement - in the summer there were shepherds engaged in transhumance cattle breeding.  And when in the middle of the 19th century, doctors declared that the mountain air was a panacea for tuberculosis, the Swiss villages began to turn into medical resorts for the nobility.  At first they came here only in the summer.  The resort of Zermatt (Switzerland) became famous thanks to one of its natives - Zayder.  It was he who built the first three hotels, which, having decorated their signs with five stars, still accept tourists.  Hermann Seider, the son of a famous hotelier, went even further.  He opened the first ski school in Zermatt in order to popularize holidays in Switzerland in winter.  In parallel, the fashion for conquering the peaks grew.  The Matterhorn, on the slopes of which Zermatt is located, turned out to be a hard nut.  The first ascent of 1865 ended in tragedy: of the seven Englishmen who went to the top, only three returned.  But this only spurred interest in the peak.  In 1933, a railway was built that connected Zermatt with the main cities of Switzerland. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zermatt how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/557139.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  When is it better to come here </h2><p>  Off-season in the mountain climate of Switzerland does not last long.  Winter (from October to May) is quickly replaced by hot summers (mid-June - mid-September).  But, as already mentioned, the resort is ready to receive skiers all year round.  Zermatt never lacks a party.  Skiing in the summer months is accessible thanks to the non-melting glaciers Horner, Findelglecher, Ober-Teodyulglecher and the Matterhorn itself.  Almost all year round, trails to the level of Trokener-Steg (2939 m) are open.  On the slopes of Klein-Matterhorn (3883 m) you can also see a large number of snowboarders and skiers.  But even if the development of the slopes is not among your interests, the summer Zermatt (Switzerland) will surprise you.  Hundreds of horseback, trekking and walking routes scatter from the village.  The pride of all Switzerland is the old Gornergrat Bahn sightseeing railway, rising to a height of 3407 meters to Stockhorn peak.  In their reviews, Russian tourists praise the so-called "dawn trains", which depart every week of the summer to Gornergrat station.  Seeing the stunning sunrise over the Matterhorn from the observation deck is an indescribable feeling.  Alpine alpine villages with an ancient way of life are ready to accept eco-tourists.  Reviews from outdoor enthusiasts assure that hiking, cycling and horse riding trails are ideal and safe.  The cleanest lakes will please the rich catch of fishermen.  And those who like to soak in the warm waters will find what they are looking for in the spa resorts of Zermatt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Winter holidays </h2><p>  The peak season is observed in Switzerland during the Christmas and New Year period.  And so quite high prices soar to heaven.  Therefore, reviews advise those tourists who cannot afford Zermatt (Switzerland) to stay in hotels from the Italian side.  This is, first of all, the resort of Bry-Cervinha.  It is combined with Zermatt with one Glacier Paradise ski area.  And although a single ski pass is very expensive (about 340 euros for six days), you can save a little on housing and meals.  The skiing on the slopes of the Matterhorn is truly amazing and exceptional.  The most comfortable ski lifts totaling seventy-two bring skiers to the top of the slopes without the slightest queue.  But of the chair, overhead and drag roads, the most remarkable remains the railway, operating on the principle of a funicular.  It starts from the center of Zermatt, and reaches a height of more than three thousand meters (Gornergrat peak).  After a short daylight, holidaymakers who come to the resorts of Switzerland will enjoy a fascinating après ski.  Baths, saunas, spa treatments, tennis courts, horse and dog sledding, ice skating and shopping - you will not notice how the evening changes to night.  Many restaurants will help you satisfy your hunger, and discos and nightclubs will cheer you up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Zermatt: how to get there </h2><p>  In the southeastern part of the Valais canton, it is most convenient to come from Italy or France.  However, one should take into account the fact that most tunnels that significantly shorten the path are paid.  There is a train connection linking the main resorts of Switzerland, such as Davos and St. Moritz.  But the famous Glacier Express is rather a tourist attraction than a means of communication.  On this "express" it is good to make a sightseeing tour.  Excellent starting points reviews are called Geneva and Zurich.  Ski resorts are located from them in three and a half hours on a regular train.  In Visp you should transfer to the Matterhorn Gotthard Railway narrow-gauge shuttle train.  She will take you to the very center of the resort.  The ultra-modern and comfortable station is located at the end of the main street.  For environmental reasons, the inhabitants of Zermatt decided to abandon gas-powered vehicles.  At the station you will be met by electric taxis (fare - fifteen francs within the village) or a bus (if you have a ski pass, it’s free, and if you don’t have a ski pass, it costs three francs).  This <span>environmentally friendly transport</span> serves all key points in the village of Zermatt.  How to get to the resort by car?  Alas, reviews of tourists unanimously advise leaving the iron horse in a paid parking lot in the village of Tash, which is five kilometers below Zermatt and transfer to the same shuttle. </p>

    <h2>  Where to settle </h2><p>  Glory turned a small mountain village into a large resort town.  The number of hotels grew with Zermatt.  But the very first hotel that has served tourists without a break for more than one hundred and sixty years - Mont Cervin Palace - has been preserved here.  Two years ago, this five-star hotel underwent a complete renovation.  No less ancient history can boast two more “historical” hotels - Monte Rosa and Riffelalp.  Unfortunately, the hotel base of Zermatt is not like modern <span>ski resorts in Europe.</span>  In the village you can hardly find hotels practicing ski-in (skiing "from the door").  But the Kulmhotel Gornergrat is located at the top of the funicular railway station.  This is the highest mountain hotel in Switzerland.  It is located at 3100 meters above sea level - above only shelters for climbers.  According to the reviews, guests of the five-star Rifferalp Resort also have the opportunity to be the first to go on the slopes.  This historic hotel is located at the narrow gauge intermediate station on Gornergrat.  In addition to these hotels, Zermatt is crowded with many lower-level hotels and apartments.  They are convenient for families and large companies.  However, you can’t count on cheap accommodation in Zermatt. </p>

    <h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  ADAC Ski Guide - an authoritative guide that evaluates ski resorts around the world, has repeatedly awarded this resort the title of best.  One of the criteria for expert analysis is the restaurant base.  In this Zermatt is ahead of the rest.  Here you can find upscale restaurants marked by the stars Gau Millau and Michelin, as well as McDonald's.  Even the stalls on the main street sell gorgeous, incredibly tasty mustard sausages.  Of the best restaurants in the resort of Zermatt (Switzerland), it is worth noting Le Cervin, Le Gourmet (in the oldest hotel Alpenhof) and Corbeau d'Or.  Canton of Valais is famous for its cuisine, so you should not discount traditional restaurants.  Reviews recommend tasting fondue and lamb on the ridge in Stockhorn Grill Room.  The hall with an open hearth is always cozy, and the waiters are hospitable and quick.  An average dinner in this restaurant will cost 30 francs, which is not so much against the general background of Zermatt.  Another feature of the local cuisine is the “Valencian plate” - in fact, meze or cold cuts.  Different varieties of local ham and sausages will not leave anyone indifferent.  A table in the restaurant should be booked in advance.  From 16.30 bars hospitably open their doors.  Among the best reviews are Cafe DuPont (even locals come to taste fondue here), Fuchs coffee shop (the best <span>apple strudel</span> in Zermatt <span>),</span> Pink Elephant, Sparky's and Papperla Pub.  All establishments have a great cozy atmosphere, respectability and at the same time fun ease.  Wine prices start at 3.50 CHF per 100 milliliters. </p>

    <h2>  Ski Area Glacier Paradise </h2><p>  Holidays in Switzerland in winter are truly unforgettable.  The fabulous beauty of local nature, the harsh silence of four-thousandths, shining glaciers, the mountain sun, covering the skin with a bronze tan, give skiing a special charm.  A well-developed tourist infrastructure, instructors and rescuers do everything possible to make extreme vacations as safe as possible.  The ski area of ​​Zermatt is combined with the Italian Chervigny.  In winter, the total length of the tracks is about 360 kilometers.  At the same time, you can enjoy the elevation difference: from the summit of Klein-Matterhorn (3900 meters) to the bottom skiing point (approximately 1600 meters).  In summer, the length of the slopes narrows to 21 kilometers, which is also a lot - after all, not all resorts in Switzerland can offer skiing in July.  This is noteworthy Zermatt.  The circuit scheme gives preference to athletes who are confidently skiing and ace.  Tourists still claim that there are gentle slopes, but they occupy no more than 20% of the total number of roads.  But for advanced skiers, Zermatt offers over two hundred kilometers of red slopes, 62 km of black and 34 km of blue.  The requests of lovers of mogul, off-pist and heli-skiing were also taken into account.  The longest route of the zone is 22 kilometers, the most extreme black descent is Triftji Bumps (from the Hohtalli peak).  Zermatt has Europe's largest snow park.  There are also two toboggan runs.  115 km of marked tracks are at the disposal of <span>cross-country skiers</span> . </p><h2>  Apres ski in Zermatt </h2><p>  After closing the lifts you will not be bored.  Like all <span>ski resorts in Switzerland,</span> Zermatt boasts a developed entertainment network.  In addition to more than a hundred restaurants and bars where you can satisfy your hunger and refresh yourself with a glass of mulled wine, he offers his guests more sophisticated entertainment.  Knowing how the legs weakened during the day of skiing buzz, almost all hotels have saunas, Russian steam rooms and hammams with them.  Fatigue can be removed in one of the resort's fifteen indoor pools.  There is a cinema, two tennis courts, twelve solariums and a squash room.  If you have never skied, experienced instructors (including Russian speakers) will help you master this skill.  Reviews recommend ordering individual lessons.  There is a ski school for kids.  By the way, you can come to the resort with children.  While parents famously dissect on the tracks, the baby will be completely supervised by the local kindergarten.  And, of course, shopping.  The ladies who visited the resort claim that the main street of the town is simply dotted with representations of fashionable clothing, footwear and accessories companies. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p> The resort of Zermatt offers curious tourists a lot of opportunities.  The most fascinating tour, which takes seven and a half hours, is a trip on the Glacier Express.  This is the slowest train in the world - because the main thing here is not speed, but landscapes floating outside the window to the accompaniment of an audio guide.  Express will pass about 300 bridges, thrown at a dizzying height, and 100 tunnels.  It is a pleasure two hundred and seventy-five francs, if you go first class.  The price of the tour includes lunch with three meals.  At the upper Klein Matterhorn station, tourists will find a huge cave carved in a glacier.  An elevator descends to a depth of 15 meters.  Reviews recommend visiting the resort’s history museum.  It is located next to the Zermatt church.  Fans of romance can recommend a fascinating overnight stay in an igloo ice hut.
