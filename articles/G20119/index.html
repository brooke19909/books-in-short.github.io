Free calls to MTS in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each subscriber of any mobile operator would like to use the most favorable and suitable tariff.  Many people living in the Leningrad Region and St. Petersburg have such a peculiar dream come true.  This happened thanks to the Super MTS (St. Petersburg) tariff, the description of which includes interesting conditions. </p><h2>  Stipulated conditions </h2><p>  The Mobile TeleSystems company offers the Super MTS tariff to those subscribers who mainly make calls who do not use the Internet very actively.  In general conditions, it was noted that all calls to <span>MTS</span> numbers in <span>St. Petersburg</span> and the Leningrad Region are free.  Communication is not limited to any packages of minutes.  There is a full unlimited.  An additional bonus condition of the tariff is 100 Mb of traffic per day. </p><p>  However, Mobile TeleSystems is not so generous to provide its subscribers with absolutely free communication.  Unlimited calls to the numbers of the same operator are provided with one condition - if there is an additional option ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù.  This service is paid.  If it is available, an amount of 7 rubles is debited from the balance every day.  ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù is included in the initial tariff package.  This means that all subscribers who have just switched to the Super MTS tariff plan have it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bloknot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connection of the Super MTS tariff plan" class="if uuid-2631755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2631755.jpg"></div><h2>  Commands for the All Super option that you should be aware of </h2><p>  From the description of the tariff ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù (St. Petersburg) it is known that the option ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù is not mandatory.  The subscriber can disconnect it at any time.  To do this, dial * 111 * 249 * 2 # on the mobile device and press the call button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that subscribers use the disconnect command quite actively, but this does not mean that the option is not profitable.  It‚Äôs just that some people do not communicate every day or, for example, go on vacation, business trip.  The shutdown command allows you to save money on the balance sheet in those days when the phone is not needed or when it cannot be actively used. </p><p>  After disconnecting, the option ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù can be reconnected at any time.  The command for this action is * 111 * 249 * 1 # and the call button.  When connected, 7 rubles are deducted from the balance.  This amount is considered a fee for the first day of using the option.  It turns out that when disconnecting and reconnecting, the subscriber does not lose anything at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetrackdayclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Calls on the Super MTS tariff" class="if uuid-2631698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2631698.jpg"></div><h2>  The cost of communication services in the presence and absence of the option "All Super" </h2><p>  It has already been mentioned above that when the ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù option is activated, subscribers receive a 100% discount when making outgoing calls to MTS numbers in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region.  Also, thanks to this service, subscribers receive a small package of Internet traffic daily - 100 MB.  It is quite enough for communication in social networks, special applications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the absence of the ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù option, communication services are charged as follows: </p><ul><li>  every minute of an outgoing call to a subscriber connected to MTS - 1 ruble; </li><li>  every 20 MB of Internet traffic - 25 rubles. </li></ul><p>  Having studied the description of the tariff ‚ÄúSuper MTS‚Äù (St. Petersburg), we can conclude that the ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù option does not apply: </p><ol><li>  Calls to numbers of other operators in the home region.  One minute of conversation costs <span>1.50 rubles.</span> </li><li>  For calls to other regions both to MTS numbers (1 minute = 3 rubles), and to numbers of other mobile operators (1 minute = 12 rubles). </li><li>  To send text messages.  Incoming SMS are not charged.  The cost of outgoing messages depends on the region to which the sending is carried out (2 rubles - to the numbers of subscribers of the Leningrad region, 2.50 rubles - to the numbers of subscribers of other regions of our country, 8 rubles - to the numbers of international mobile operators). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="vsetarify.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of the tariff &quot;Super MTS&quot;" class="if uuid-2631694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2631694.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection of a tariff plan </h2><p>  Persons who are not yet subscribers of Mobile TeleSystems can purchase a tariff in any communication salon.  The starter kit, which includes a SIM card with a new number and the Super MTS tariff plan, costs 200 rubles. </p><p>  Those people who are already among the company's subscribers can simply change the tariff on their SIM card.  This is done in several ways: </p><ul><li>  using the command * 111 * 8888 # and the call button; </li><li>  in your account. </li></ul><p>  The cost of switching to a tariff is 150 rubles.  However, this fee may not be charged to the subscriber.  Switching to the tariff is free if a similar action was not performed on the number during the month.  If, for this period of time, the tariff changed, you will either have to pay for the transition, or wait until a month has passed since the last shift. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thetrackdayclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Setting tariff &quot;Super MTS&quot;" class="if uuid-2631702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2631702.jpg"></div><h2>  Setting up more profitable communication </h2><p>  For calls, the MTS tariff can be made even more profitable, because the mobile operator has a wide range of interesting services and options.  For example, in the Leningrad region, the option ‚ÄúFavorite number of Ukraine and Armenia‚Äù is available for connection.  It provides an opportunity for free and unlimited communication with subscribers of MTS of Armenia, MTS and Vodafone of Ukraine.  The option provides a monthly subscription fee. </p><p>  Fans of SMS communication can connect the option "Night SMS Drive".  It is available on the Super MTS tariff.  Free with this option you can send an unlimited number of SMS messages at night to subscribers of all mobile operators in the home region and MTS Russia.  Connection of "Night SMS-Drive" is paid.  Additionally, a small monthly fee is charged every day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digilabs.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connecting options to the Super MTS tariff of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region" class="if uuid-2631739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2631739.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariff features in other regions </h2><p>  The essence of the Super MTS tariff is the same in all regions of our country.  People get the opportunity to talk for free with subscribers of their own operator in their home region.  However, there are differences between this <span>tariff plan of the MTS of the</span> Leningrad Region, St. Petersburg and its versions in other regions of Russia. </p><p>  For example, in Moscow, an additional unlimited number is provided for calls to all city phones of the home region.  The differences between different versions of the tariff plan are also in the cost of services.  We give a small example.  In Moscow, the daily subscription fee when the ‚ÄúAll Super‚Äù option is turned on is 9 rubles.  In the Arkhangelsk region, the same fee is slightly lower - 6 rubles.  For this reason, it is recommended to read all the conditions established for a specific region before connecting the tariff. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that a very long time ago the Super MTS tariff appeared in St. Petersburg.  His description was a little different before.  Not all subscribers were satisfied with the conditions.  Now the tariff is more profitable and interesting.  It deserves the attention of Mobile TeleSystems subscribers and subscribers of other operators. </p>
