True, it actually costs much less than a rented apartment or a boarding house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in the Crimea savages" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/223454.jpg" width="600"></div>

For example, free walking tours of nearby attractions, they are conducted mainly by experienced residents of the town. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, rest in the Crimea by savages is a test.

But rest in the Crimea savages possible. </p><p>  So, in the <span>region of Sevastopol, the</span> coast is densely dotted with capes and bays.  Consequently, having captured the tent, you can go to <span>Cape Khersones</span> or Lyubimovka.  There is also Cape Fiolent, which has become a real mecca for divers. </p><p>  In the region of Balaklava, it is also possible to rest in the Crimea with savages, the prices of which please many, regardless of their financial situation.  But it must be borne in mind that these places are far from civilization, therefore drinking water and food must be stocked up in advance. </p><p>  Laspi Bay has also preserved its natural shape.  Although to it you need to walk about 5 km from the highway.
