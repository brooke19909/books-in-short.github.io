LCD "Slavyanka" was supposed to be one of them, and became a leader among the capital unfinished buildings.  It began to be built in 2002.  The developer promised interest holders not only spacious apartments, but also a rich infrastructure, including a kindergarten, school, and playgrounds.  Over the past 15 years, children managed to grow up, and their parents never received the treasured keys.  The notorious project is now called the LCD "Western Gate of the Capital."  His current developer has actively undertaken to catch up and plans to hand over the object by the beginning of next year.  The construction came to life again, and the interest holders revived hope.  This article offers detailed information about this housing complex, its advantages, disadvantages and the possibility of acquiring real estate here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  For the construction of the residential complex "Slavyanka" ("Western Gate of the Capital"), a place was chosen in the Odintsovo district, in the village of Novoivanovskoye, near the village of Marfino, 550 meters from the Moscow Ring Road.  Literally 1000 meters from the residential complex there is the Skolkovskoye highway, and 350 meters - the Mozhayskoye highway.  There is a bus stop where 17 city and suburban routes stop.  In addition, just 950 meters from the LCD there is a railway station called Nemchinovka, which is followed by trains from the Belorussky Train Station.  Thus, the transport accessibility of this complex is very good, convenient for motorists and those who plan to use public transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Marfino, where the ‚ÄúWestern Gate of the Capital‚Äù complex is being built, was recognized as a prosperous area according to the results of an environmental review.  There are no industrial enterprises and thermal power plants nearby, very low <span>radiation background,</span> good wind rose.  However, there are also no parks or other natural objects within a radius of 2000 meters from the complex.  But at 600 meters there is the Marfinsky cemetery and a sewage treatment plant.  According to equity holders, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe construction of the residential complex there is a gas pollution from a large stream of cars following the neighboring streets and Mozhayskoye Highway, but this figure is much better than in the central regions of Moscow.  Based on the foregoing, the ecological situation around the housing complex can be called conditionally favorable. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Initially, the general plan provided that the LCD "Slavyanka" will become a mini-town with a multifunctional infrastructure.  An area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 hectares was allocated for the construction, on which the developer was going to build 5 buildings on 10-25 floors, build a school, parking, landscaping, planting trees, planting flower beds, building playgrounds.  All buildings were planned as multisectional.  On their first floors, it was planned to open a children's club, retail outlets, pharmacies, a library, a computer club, dry cleaning, a bank, a post office, and a cafe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the rich infrastructure of the Western Gate of the Capital complex itself, there are many <span>social facilities</span> in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Marfino.  So, just 200 meters from the complex is located Auchan hypermarket, and next to it there is a bus stop.  100 meters from Auchan is the multifunctional movie theater Formula Kino.  Within a radius of 1,500 meters from the complex there are schools, a TVC, a sports club, a gymnasium, and about a dozen shops. </p><h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  RC "Western Gate of the Capital" is being erected in a monolithic way with the obligatory insulation of the external walls and glazing of loggias and balconies.  All cases are built in a single design, based on the severity of forms, the consistency of smooth lines and angles.  The buildings are located so as to form two spacious courtyards, closed from the noise of nearby streets.  The developer planned to protect the territory and establish a security post.  Entrance groups in the buildings should be bright and spacious, with two elevators, with a place for strollers and a concierge room. </p><p>  The facades in the complex are built ventilated, the entrances to the entrances are equipped with intercoms. </p>

    <h2>  Construction stages </h2><p>  For the past 15 years, the LCD ‚ÄúWestern Gate of the Capital‚Äù has been built.  The deceived real estate investors went to court, the city authorities convened commissions, passed resolutions, and journalists made special issues of television programs dedicated to this record long-term construction.  Initially, back in 2002, KSV (Soyuz Vozrozhdenie Corporation) began to build this residential complex, and Social Initiative and Co. acted as a co-investor, but in 2004 the latter terminated the contract and left the project. </p><p>  At this stage, the construction of the 1st building continued somehow, the rest were frozen.  In 2007, after the next meeting of the commission from the Ministry of Construction of Moscow, NBM was involved in the construction of the residential complex.  As a result, the first complex was completed, but the commission did not accept it, since the developer did not install elevators in it, did not connect utility networks (water, heating). </p><p>  NBM continued to fight for the LCD in 2014.  And, finally, it put into operation the long-suffering first complex, equity holders got the keys. </p><p>  The new builder could not do anything else, and in 2016 the Moscow City West Gate entrusted the PIK group of companies, famous for the fact that it never abandons the facilities that it started. </p>

    <h2>  Construction progress in 2017 </h2><p>  The new developer, in the first place, conducted a series of appraisal activities and issued a verdict that at the beginning of 2017, the second building was ready in 70% in the residential complex, 50% in the third and 35% in the fourth.  Of the infrastructure, a kindergarten is 50% ready and 70% one of the parking lots.  At the moment, construction work has been resumed.  In the second building, the exterior walls are lined, the communications are connected, and the interior works.  Shifts are also noticeable in the third building.  Here the building is being completed, and on the lower floors, wall lining is being conducted in parallel.  PIK company promises to hand over these two buildings in early 2018. </p><p>  The fate of the fourth corps has not yet been decided.  There is a proposal to demolish it in order to make way for the construction of the fifth building. </p><h2>  Prices and purchase options </h2><p>  At the beginning of the project implementation of the residential complex ‚ÄúWestern Gate of the Capital‚Äù the cost of 1 sq.  here was from 85 000 rubles.  Transactions were executed after the conclusion of the DDU.  To date, the sale of apartments from the PIK developer has not yet been resumed, but interest holders are invited to re-enter the DDU, for which you first need to terminate the contract with the previous developer or obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Internal Affairs certifying that the interest holder was granted victim status in case No. 88256. This scheme causes a number of fears in people that they will lose both money and housing. </p>

    <p>  Even more alarming is the trial that began in February with the lawsuit filed by Soyuz Vozrozhdenie against PIK, which allegedly violated the laws and arbitrarily seized land leased from SV, on which the ill-fated complex is being completed.  Therefore, the decision of his future fate again hung in the air. </p><h2>  LCD "Western Gate of the capital": reviews </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the complex has become a record long-term construction, the opinions of both equity holders and potential investors about it are far from enthusiastic.  This project has many advantages, among which: </p><ul><li>  wonderful location (MKAD nearby, there are many shops, schools, sports clubs); </li><li>  excellent transport accessibility; </li><li>  very successful layouts of apartments. </li><li>  rich infrastructure. </li></ul><p>  It is unfortunate that the insolvency and dishonesty of developers negates all these advantages. </p>
