    <p>  Each conflict has its own structure.  But it is somewhat different from the usual understanding of structure in general, because usually this means some kind of device, a list of elements of the object and the order of their location.  Speaking about the conflict, we must also take into account its dynamics, that is, the process.  Therefore, the structure of the conflict is a combination of its interacting components, ensuring uniqueness and integrity. </p><p>  Conflict as a special case includes the concept of ‚Äúconflict situation‚Äù, which is a fragment of it, a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù at some particular moment. </p><p>  <strong>Content of the conflict</strong> </p><p>  Its subjects are people.  As participants, they do not always act as <span>private individuals.</span>  These can be official persons (vertical conflict), legal persons (representatives of various organizations), and even entire states.  The degree of participation in a particular conflict also varies: from indirect influence on its course to direct confrontation. </p><p>  The structure of the conflict is, first and foremost, its main participants, the key link in any controversial <span>situation.</span>  <span>These are parties</span> that are direct opponents and perform some direct actions in relation to each other.  If one of the opponents disappears, the problem is settled, if the opponent is replaced by another, then this will be a different situation, because in an interpersonal conflict the goals and interests of the parties are individualized. </p><p>  When the <span>structure of social</span> conflict is considered at the intergroup or interstate level, the situation repeats itself, not only in relation to an individual, but to a group or state as a specific participant.  Allocate the concept of ‚Äúinitiator of the conflict‚Äù, by which they understand the party, the first initiating action, inciting a confrontation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Psychological aspect</strong> </p><p>  The structure of the conflict always has psychological components that affect the <span>organization of the behavior of the</span> parties.  They mean the aspirations (desires) of the opponents, the strategy and tactics of their behavior, the individual perception of each side of the problem situation.  They are also called conflict <span>information models</span> . </p><p>  Explaining the activity and orientation of the actions of the friction participants, they evaluate their motives, goals, interests, needs, regardless of whether we are talking about individuals or social groups.  They can differ significantly, but in any situation, opponents always defend their interests, which explains the reason for this or that behavior. </p><p>  <strong>Typology of Participant Behavior</strong> </p><p>  The structure of the conflict includes the following possible types of participation in a <span>conflict situation.</span> </p><ul><li>  Rivalry.  In this case, the parties try to impose on each other the preferred (competitive) solution to the conflict situation. </li><li>  Cooperation.  Such a strategy involves finding a solution that can satisfy both opposing parties. </li><li>  Compromise.  Tactics that allow concessions in important and fundamental moments that each side is ready to make in order to expedite the solution of the problem. </li><li>  Device.  In this case, one of the parties deliberately lowers its requirements and takes the position of the opponent. </li><li>  Avoidance of conflict.  The opponent simply refuses any active actions, without ceasing to remain a participant in the conflict. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Conflict dynamics</strong> </p><p>  Provides the following possible steps: </p><ul><li>  The emergence of pre-conflict state. </li><li>  The manifestation of a conflict situation. </li><li>  Awareness of the problem. </li><li>  Balanced counteraction. </li><li>  Attempts by the parties to resolve the problem situation in non-conflict ways. </li><li>  Completion. </li></ul><p>  The structure and dynamics of the conflict are always closely interconnected and cannot be considered separately. </p>
