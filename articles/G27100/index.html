    <h2>  Farm History </h2><p>  In 1910, the Kashirin Cossack family (consisting of 3 sons and father) came from the village of Starokorsunskaya and began to develop untouched lands along the banks of the Obrezka river flowing here (it was subsequently flooded by the reservoir).  The lands here were fertile, but the places were rather dangerous: there was a forest very close by, in which there were numerous gangs of bandits.  But despite this, good fishing places, fertile lands and other natural wealth began to attract active owners here. </p><p>  Soon, these places were populated by Cossack families from the Pashkovskaya and Starokorsunskaya villages, and a settlement was formed.  Since the first immigrants, and also quite wealthy, were the Kashirin family, it was decided to call this village the Kashirin farm (Kashirinsky).  In 1928, the Kashirin commune was created here, and several years later a collective farm with the same name was created.  In 1936, the Kashirin family was dispossessed and exiled.  And the farm and the collective farm were given the name of Lenin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

We can say that it consists of three parts: </p><ul><li>  "Old part"; </li><li>  "New part"; </li><li>  suburban village. </li></ul><p>  The ‚Äúold part‚Äù refers to the administrative center where the administration, school and hospital are located.  Here are houses that were built before 1990, the indigenous people live in them.  In 2000, by order of the Ministry of Defense in Krasnodar, Lenin Farm began to build new houses, from five-story buildings to luxury cottages.  So there was a "new part" of the farm.  The area is modern, well-maintained, fruit trees are planted on the streets.  Here is a fitness center, kindergartens, schools, pharmacies, shops, banks.  In the third part of the village, at the dachas, they live mainly in the garden period.  Although there are summer residents who live here all year round.  In the holiday village there are several shops, a metal depot, a car wash. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Krasnodar, on the Lenin farm, there are two cottage villages: Victoria and Rainbow.  In the village of Victoria there are modern two- and one-story houses, as well as duplexes for two families.  All communications are central, except sewerage (septic tank).  This is a closed guarded area.  A school bus takes the children to school.  Of the minuses, it is possible to note small plots of land adjacent to the house. </p>
