    <h2>  Popular Choice </h2><p>  First you need to talk about the most famous contributions for individuals.  Sberbank offers the “Save” tariff, with which you can open a savings account for a period of 1 month to 3 years.  This is available to everyone, because the minimum amount for an investment is 1,000 p.  But you need to know that this contribution does not imply replenishment and the possibility of partial withdrawal of funds.  The interest rate, depending on the term, varies from 4.6 to 6.23%. </p><p>  The second popular choice of customers is the “Replenish” tariff.  The rate in this case varies from 4.92 to 5.72%.  However, the deposit can be made for a period of 3 months to 3 years.  Partial withdrawal is also impossible, but regular <span>replenishment of the account is available.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Comfortable conditions at a low percentage </h2><p>  This is also possible.  Many people, studying <span>profitable deposits</span> for individuals at Sberbank, make a choice in favor of the “Manage” tariff.  The percentage is small, it varies from 4.62 to 5.41%, but the conditions are comfortable for the client.  Having issued this tariff, he can replenish the deposit and partially withdraw funds when necessary.  You can open such a deposit for a period of 3 months to 3 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The minimum amount, unlike the tariffs mentioned above, does not start with a thousand rubles, ac 30,000. By the way, if a person is interested in a foreign currency <span>deposit in Sberbank</span> for individuals, then he can also opt for the “Manage” offer.  Ho, the minimum amount for a deposit in dollars, like in euros, is one thousand. </p><p>  What is the profit from this deposit?  This will help to calculate the calculator.  Suppose a person has invested 100,000 rubles.  Every 30 days he pays an additional 15,000. And on average he takes about 5,000 rubles a month.  After a year, the total deposit amount will be 226 883 p.  A net profit will be equal to 6,883 p.  By the way, under such conditions, the rate is 4.32% per annum. </p>

    <h2>  Social offer </h2><p>  The “Give Life” tariff should also be noted with attention when talking about contributions for individuals.

The minimum amount starts at 10,000 p.  This is a unique offer, because every 3 months the organization transfers 0.3% of its profit from the contribution to a charity fund called “Give Life”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the minimum amount for the year, the profit will be only about 608 rubles.  Ho, if you invest more, for example, 1,000,000 rubles, then you will be able to help out 60,840 rubles. </p><h2>  Online clearance </h2><p>  Nowadays, people are most interested in offers on <span>opening deposits,</span> which can be used without visiting the branch.
