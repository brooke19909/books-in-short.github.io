    <h2>  Khao Lak </h2><p>  This is the name of the resort where the Palm Galleria Resort is located.  Khao Lak is one of the most secluded areas in the Thai province of Phang Nga.  People come here to relax and be alone with the picturesque nature.  The white sandy beaches of the Andaman Sea, the jungle, waterfalls, bizarre cliffs, turquoise water, mangroves and slowly wandering monitor lizards - all at your service.  As in any Thai resort, there are shops, restaurants, cafes, and markets.  Only instead of nightclubs and discos are centers of yoga and relaxation.  It is not crowded, there is no fuss, like in Phuket, and the prices are quite moderate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The only hub closest to the resort and, accordingly, to the hotel is located on the island of Phuket.  Aeroflot and Es seven flights fly from Moscow directly to Moscow.  You need to fly about 9 hours.  You can also take advantage of other connecting flights in Bangkok.  From the capital of Thailand to the Phuket hub, you need to fly about an hour and a half.  And from Kar Lak to him more than 80 kilometers.  To get from the airport to the Palm Galleria Resort hotel (in the reviews indicate that mostly tourists take a taxi), you need at least an hour, or even two.  Buses also come here - both from Bangkok, and from Phuket and from Krabi province. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm Galleria Resort 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2208625.jpg"></div>

Many of them are designed for one guest.  There are 4 rooms with several rooms.  Each guest room has air conditioning with individual split system, shower with bathroom and hairdryer.  Despite the fact that the hotel is positioned as a "three rubles", the level of comfort in the rooms - and this is confirmed by tourists - is much higher.  Any room has a small refrigerator, a free safe, an electric kettle, a coffee maker, and satellite TV.  There are no Russian-language channels.  They even give slippers, which is very unusual for a hotel of this class, as well as an umbrella for rainy weather and a beach bag.  An extra cot can be requested.  The rooms are spacious, often with panoramic views.  The beds are large, sometimes there is also a sofa.  Cabinets are built into the walls.

Wi-Fi is free, catches throughout the hotel, including in rooms, the speed is excellent. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Hotel Palm Galleria Resort 3 * in reviews is described as one of the few budget hotels where guests are given the opportunity to engage in such aristocratic sports as golf.  A specially equipped field is a stone's throw from the property.  There is also a spa with a sauna and Thai body, face and foot massage.  But you can order other procedures, such as body wraps or herbal scrub.  The hotel has a good tour desk, with which you scout all the surroundings, and they, as our guests assure us, are worth it.

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  The price includes breakfast.  When there are many tourists, they offer a buffet with different dishes.  If the season is low and there are few guests, they will prepare everything individually for you, taking into account your preferences.  As a rule, several types of soup are served for breakfast, pad thai noodles, rice with pork or shrimp, sausages and sausage, omelettes and fried eggs, vegetables, both stewed and fresh, greens, toasts.  A lot of different fruits.  For sweets - pancakes, pastries, sweet sauces, jams.  Of the drinks - tea, coffee (very tasty, according to the guests), juices. </p><p>  Palm Galleria Resort has a Galeria restaurant.  It offers guests a wide selection of not only dishes, but also types of cuisine from different nations of the world.  Here you will try Thai, Italian, and Chinese delicacies.  The winery has a wide selection of drinks, including champagne and cocktails.  And near the pool guests are treated to the Palm Bar, where you can also try different types of Thai tea.  For the guests' birthday, they will arrange a ‚Äúcompliment‚Äù from the administration - a cake with your name will be waiting for you in the room (although Thais can mix up and put the name out of the mastic).  And all the hotel staff, including the manager, will congratulate you. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, guests mostly go to the nearby village.  Restaurants there are all good and inexpensive.  Even with alcohol - which, in principle, is quite expensive in Thailand - you will not get sky-high bills.  You can take food with you to the hotel from the night market or buy it from the macaques.  Not far from the hotel there are several restaurants serving lobsters, freshly caught fish and <span>watermelon smoothie.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm Galleria Resort (Khao Lak)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2208604.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and pool vacations </h2><p>  Pakarang beach near the hotel is almost empty.  Walk to him for about five minutes from the hotel buildings.  But this area is intended more for beauty, and not for swimming.  Here, the shallow sea is very pronounced low tides.  You can walk a little to the left, swimming is better there.  Various exotic fruits are also sold there - they will be cut and served in slices right in front of you.  The sand is white everywhere, the beach is clean, no cigarette butts and other garbage.  Good massage parlors.  Swimming near the hotel is best after dinner - in the morning the sea leaves. </p><p>  The beautiful White Beach is a ten minute drive from the hotel.  You can get there inexpensively by mototaxi or tuk-tuk.  On this beach, usually located on the sun loungers of a nearby restaurant, this is a free service.  Well, maybe you‚Äôll be hinted that you would get some water or coffee.  An inexpensive Thai massage salon is also open there.  And the Palm Galleria Resort 3 * hotel has a huge swimming pool with several levels, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfour hundred square meters.  There is also a children's "paddling pool", and a jacuzzi.  Near the pool on the terraces there are sun loungers, umbrellas and sunbeds.  Beach towels are provided in the rooms along with the rest. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Khao Lak, tourists mostly visit natural attractions.  In the resort there are immediately three reserves.  The most popular of them is Khao Sok, as well as Phang Nga Bay, where the James Bond Island sung in cinema is located.  One of the most famous excursions, which, as a rule, is organized in Phuket, is a trip to the Similan Islands, known for their wild pristine nature.  Such trips last for several days, with overnight stays at various hotels, including the former Best Western Palm Galleria Resort.  But there are other offers in the field of ecotourism - kayaking, jeep safari, boat trips along the mangroves, elephant riding.  And Khao Lak is considered an ideal place for diving and snorkeling.  The underwater world is amazing - you will see real marine gardens of coral and colorful fish.  You can even watch leopard sharks here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm galleria resort reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2208617.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Despite the seclusion of the hotel, you will not find in Khao Lak, as in the surrounding area, problems with markets and shops.  The entire route along the beaches is literally lined with shops of the Seven-Eleven chain.  In towns and cities, night markets work.  Well, if you are not satisfied with the range, then you can go to the provincial capital - the city of Takua Pa.  There is a huge supermarket "Big Tse".  Everywhere, including near the beaches, there are shops selling fruit.  There you will find a lot of shops selling clothes and souvenirs for tourists.  But the cheapest things and food you need, of course, to buy in the night markets.  Moreover, in the evenings there are free performances and shows.  You can go shopping in Phuket, especially in Patong.  Moreover, buses run frequently along the highway and pass directly along the highway where the Palm Galleria Resort stands. </p><h2>  Palm Galleria Resort (Khao Lak): Holiday Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel is liked by many who lived in it.  It is not crowded, the atmosphere is relaxing, the rooms are nice, as if created for relaxation.  The beds are large with comfortable mattresses.  Huge balconies with beautiful views, stained glass windows.  The staff at the hotel is friendly, professional and very friendly.  This applies to all employees - from cleaners to managers.  Travelers of different categories - those who spent the night here on the way to the Similan Islands, and those who came to relax longer - are satisfied with the level of service of the Palm Galleria Resort.  Photos of its green gardens and beautiful sunsets on the beach often illustrate the reviews of tourists about how they relaxed in this hotel.  The coast is deserted, it‚Äôs good to sunbathe here, you can find bays for swimming near the hotel, and if you wish, go to White Beach.  Of course, those who like parties and entertainments like Patong will be bored, but romantics and thirsts for relaxation are the most suitable place.  Also, families with young children like the hotel.  It is convenient and safe here.  Sometimes there are problems with the pressure of water, lizards can climb into the room.  But this usually does not spoil the rest. </p>
