They are compact and mirrored.  Each class combines both positive and negative aspects.  Quite often, disadvantages arise precisely against the background of advantages.  For example, compact Casio (cameras) can be carried everywhere with you, just put in your pocket, but the small case does not allow you to make good internal components, which is why compact snapshots cannot be called decent, comparing them with those that are capable of making large and heavy gadgets.  Naturally, SLR cameras are better in image quality and their characteristics.  But at the same time, they can‚Äôt do a lot of shots quickly, while compacts do an excellent job of this. </p><h2>  Casio Cameras </h2><p>  Paying attention to this drawback, the company "Casio" released a SLR camera, the shooting speed of which can reach 60 frames per second.  EXILIM Pro EX-F1 just hit the market, but its cost is quite high, so not every photographer is able to purchase such a technique for themselves.  But the same company has a wonderful alternative - the Casio Exilim EX-FH20 camera. </p><h2>  Key Features FH20 </h2><p>  Considering the features of the camera model of a well-known company, it is worth noting first of all the resolution of the matrix, it is quite pleasant and amounts to 9.1 megapixels.  The lens has a twentyfold zoom, which allows you to shoot objects that are at a decent distance.  If you look for a compact camera with high speed burst shooting, then this model has up to 40 frames per second.  The camera is equipped with a three-inch LCD screen and is capable of video recording. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Review EX-FH20 </h2><p>  When testing the camera, it was revealed that the quality of the pictures at low sensitivity is quite good.  All details are visible well, <span>digital noise is</span> not visible <span>.</span>  Compared to other compact cameras, <span>this model</span> is capable of taking high-quality images even with ISO 400 set. If sensitivity is set higher, problems begin, noise appears, and the built-in system begins to reduce the sharpness of the photo, blurring low-quality fragments. </p>

    <p>  But even with ISO 800 you can still work, but if you increase it to 1600, it is better not to put the photo in print without additional modifications.  Since this is a compact camera, you should not expect clear pictures at high sensitivity.  Although compared with competitors, Casio cameras give fairly good results. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of the Pro EX-F1 </h2><p>  The main advantage of this model of a SLR camera is the presence of manual modes for setting shooting parameters.  Also, an optical stabilizer is built into the gadget, which positively affects the original quality of the pictures.  The camera zooms in 12 times.  Naturally, you should pay attention to the burst function. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It can do up to 60 frames per second if the image size is 6 megapixels.  You can also connect an external flash to it, which is very good when working in the studio.  Among the shortcomings, the most striking thing is the lack of shooting at a wide angle, the inability to turn the monitor and the poor quality of the electronic video finder.  If these disadvantages do not bother or frighten the price, then the camera is ideal for shooting high-quality images. </p><h2>  Review Pro EX-F1 </h2><p>  The ergonomics of the camera are very good, everything is done comfortably and wisely.  When setting high-speed modes, you can set the parameters quite flexibly.  The camera‚Äôs functionality is at a high level, and its unique ability to shoot fast is so amazing and unusual that you simply don‚Äôt pay attention to other functions. </p>

    <p>  As for the quality of the obtained images, the indicators are quite decent, the video, by the way, is also at a high level.  The price, of course, is not low, but taking into account the unique characteristics of this model, it is quite justified.  Of course, this model is inferior to many professional devices, but the combination of ultra-fast burst shooting and modern functions and settings still sets the Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 out of the total number of cameras. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that it was created for specific purposes, that is, for shooting dynamic scenes, where every moment counts.  But to purchase Casio, a camera whose instruction provides good instant shooting characteristics, is meaningless for portraits and landscapes, because then its main functions will be idle, and, accordingly, the investments will not be justified. </p><h2>  Comparison with competitors </h2><p>  Compare Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 with other models or competing manufacturers is simply impossible, because its functionality is completely unique.  There are currently no such cameras on the market that could be called a direct competitor to the model in question.  That is why, if you look for a camera with similar functions, it is the Casio (camera) EX-F1 that may be the ideal choice, as other models simply do not reach its level. </p><h2>  EX-ZR700 </h2><p>  No less popular in the market of photographic equipment and another model from the Japanese manufacturer - Casio EX-ZR700.  This camera got its popularity thanks to the new processor.  For a compact camera, three speed characteristics were completely unusual.  In addition, the versatility of the camera attracts attention, because it is designed for all kinds of shooting options.  These Casio digital cameras are equipped with a wide-angle shooting mode of 25 millimeters, a powerful zoom that can enlarge the picture up to 18 times.  At the same time, everyone has a decent aperture of up to 5.9. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the presence of two processors that allow the camera to work quite quickly, it turns on in 1.4 seconds, autofocus is induced in 0.18 seconds, and high-speed shooting allows you to take a picture every 0.26 seconds.  In addition to the technical characteristics that are good enough for such a camera, there are many more effects.  It is possible to take pictures with focus on the rear and front objects, and you can also stitch pictures to get one, better.  This feature is very helpful when you need to take a photo in a poorly lit room.  Therefore, many choose Casio cameras for personal use. </p><h2>  Design EX-ZR700 </h2><p>  This model can not be called special in terms of design, it is very similar to thousands of the same compact cameras.  During its creation, the manufacturer focused on technical indicators and software. </p>

    <p>  The model is rectangular, the upper part of the case consists of glossy plastic.  The protrusions are made in relief, matte for convenience.  The front side is metal, while the back of the case is plastic.  Although the model is small, the lenses are still good. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Cost Casio EX-ZR700 low, when compared with similar models from other manufacturers.  The camera is quite compact, while equipped with a good lens.  The versatility of the model is amazing.  Thanks to the optics and internal details, night shots come out quite clear and attractive.  The battery lasts long enough to charge.  In addition, you can install removable cards with a capacity of up to 2 terabytes.  The only disadvantage of this model is the size of the matrix, although it is quite acceptable for the cost of the camera.  In general, Casio cameras have many advantages, and each model is designed for different types of shooting, so when choosing a camera, you should definitely pay attention to the products of this company. </p>
