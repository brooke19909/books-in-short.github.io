    <p>  Not surprisingly, USB modems are extremely common here.  Despite the greed of mobile operators, only they are sometimes able to provide adequate Internet with a decent <span>data transfer rate.</span>  Their distribution is also facilitated by internal competition among operators.  In cities, YOTA has been starting to gain momentum for many years: its modems sometimes give a very decent speed, which other users of wired Internet in small towns cannot dream of. </p><p>  But today we‚Äôll talk about MTS modems.  More precisely, about those errors, which are often accompanied by the process of their operation.  Alas, almost every second user encounters them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  619 - an unpleasant number </h2>

    <p>  What does it mean and how to eliminate it?  Today we will discuss precisely these issues. </p><h2>  How can I decrypt this error? </h2><p>  There is no definite answer to this question.  The technical support and the websites of the operators themselves say that error code 619 implies a whole range of problems, which together lead to the inability to connect to the Internet.  In particular, if the modem is configured incorrectly, the connection is poor or there is no money in your account, you will see the message about this error. </p><h2>  Most common causes </h2><p>  As it usually happens, very often the reason is ugly banal.  Admit it, you were flashing your modem to use the SIM-cards of all operators, and not just MTS?  In this case, do not forget to change the Internet profile when replacing them!  Often, even experienced users ‚Äúcome across‚Äù this, not to mention newcomers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It often happens recently that error 619 pops up due to the banal congestion of the equipment of the operator himself.  There are a lot of users, so companies simply do not have time to set up new towers.  Specialists have long carried out a simple check.  It turned out that only MTS sold more modems than physically can withstand the equipment of two operators at once! </p>

In addition, it often helps to disconnect the modem from the device and then connect it.

    <p>  Do you have any money on the balance sheet?  Is the beginning of a new month today, when the <span>monthly fee is</span> usually <span>charged?</span>  There is one more remark.  Often, SIM-cards are immediately blocked after the subscriber's balance has gone negative.  When replenishing the account, voice data and SMS services are automatically resumed, while packet <span>data transmission is</span> blocked for a long time.  It is not surprising that error 619 pops up when trying to connect. </p><h2>  Another common mistake </h2><p>  Be sure to check if the MMS / GPRS service is connected.  You can do this in two ways: either through the "personal account" on your operator‚Äôs website, or by calling his technical support service.  If the service is available, but there is no real connection to the Internet, you will have to look for other reasons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Understand your profile settings! </h2><p>  Do not forget that from time to time the data for entering the network may change.  This is especially true for the username, password, and also the dialer number (which is less common).  Keep in mind that the data for connecting to the Internet on old cards can seriously differ from those that the OPSoS (mobile operator) currently uses. </p>

The first to break this tradition was in <span>TELE2: a modem</span> with their SIM card works without entering a password.  In addition, MTS and MegaFon are full of regional branches, in which the APN settings are completely different.  If you do not have access to the Internet from someone else's computer, call technical support and find out all this information from them.

    <h2>  Dialer! </h2><p>  We already said that error 619 sometimes appears due to a mismatch of dialer numbers.  The standard is considered the combination * 99 #, which works with almost all operators.  However, the opposite also happens.  Try using the number * 99 * 1 # or * 99 *** 1 #. </p><h2>  Check the quality of communication! </h2><p>  Very often the cause of all problems is the poor quality of communication.  Pay attention to the signal quality: if the antenna shows one or two ‚Äústicks‚Äù, then you should not count on at least an acceptable connection.  It often happens that voice communication works great, while the Internet does not work out decisively. </p>

First, try walking around your house or apartment looking for a place with the best connection.  If this does not help, set the connection properties in the modem settings to ‚ÄúPrefer 2G connection‚Äù.  When error 619 when connecting to the Internet does occur due to poor reception, it is also useful to use not a modem, but a telephone to connect to the network: put it in a place with the best signal level, and then connect to it via Wi-Fi. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <p></p>
    <p>  Finally, the antenna can fundamentally solve the problem.  So, in the country, the speed sometimes rises from 0.5 Kb / s to 5-6 Mb / s!  Agree that for the sake of such a result it is not a sin to spend a couple of thousand rubles to acquire it. </p><h2>  Another operator </h2><p>  It often happens that in an area where the signal of one mobile operator barely breaks through, the signal of another is perfectly caught.  Try to find out which OSPS specifically produces the best results in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour home.  As practice shows, a connection error 619 almost never occurs if there is a sane signal level. </p><h2>  Software issues </h2><p>  Now we will talk about some problems of a software property, conflicts with which can provoke inappropriate behavior of your USB modem.  You will surely grimace at the mere mention of this reason, but try checking your computer for malware.  Some samples of these utilities damage the main system files and libraries, because of which the MTS-Connect program and similar applications refuse to work normally. </p>

Do you know when the error 619 MTS often appears?  If you have ever installed (or still have) a program for connecting a computer and mobile phone, then all of the following will most likely be directly related to you.

    <p>  Incredibly, mobile phone manufacturers, who have no complaints about the hardware, often release completely inadequate software.  Try to install the same application for Nokia and Samsung at the same time, and then admire the result.  Almost always error 619 appears. MTS Connect gets along with these utilities especially badly. </p><p>  We recommend that you do not use regular Windows tools to remove all such programs, but use something like Revo Uninstaller Pro. </p><h2>  Drivers are an eternal headache ... </h2><p>  Do you happen to install drivers on your modem manually?  If so, where did you get them?  If from some third-party sites, then this does not bode well.  Their creators often do not completely monitor the normal operation of their programs on different versions of the OS, so anything can happen as a result. </p><p>  Sometimes even the absence of some important Windows update can have a negative effect, so do not disable the Windows Update service.  In any case, it is better to first try to remove the old driver versions, and then install their latest releases from the official site. </p><h2>  The negative impact of antivirus programs </h2><p>  This is not often talked about, but due to the operation of the antivirus, error 619 may also appear. Can't connect to the remote computer?  Try to completely disable your security program.  If after that everything worked, contact technical support or try other software. </p><h2>  Old versions of Windows </h2><p>  Despite the popularity of Windows XP SP3, manufacturers of hardware and software are gradually abandoning it.  This does not always happen officially: sometimes a signal of obsolescence is the persistent unwillingness of new devices (including modems) to work with your OS.  Try to install all available updates.  It does not hurt to check the modem under the virtual OS of the new family. </p>
