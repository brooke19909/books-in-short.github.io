  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does the term 'torsion fields' mean?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In recent years, the term "torsion fields" has become so popular that even some grandmothers sitting on benches at the entrances of houses use it.  Unfortunately, as is often the case with incomplete understanding, the meaning behind the words is distorted by the narrators, fouling with fiction.  As a result, torsion fields begin to be considered what they are not.  In part, this can be easily explained: the scientists themselves who proposed the torsion model do not fully understand what exactly they encountered.  However, this does not interfere with the creation and use of torsion generators.  The situation is similar to the usual <span>electric energy:</span> everyone uses electrical appliances, new ones appear every year, but the answer to the question ‚Äúwhat is, in fact, electric current‚Äù remains open.  In the best case, axioms are proposed like "so, because ... so it is." </p><p>  What are torsion fields?  One of the models of the structure of the Universe claims that each piece of space contains an accurate informational cast of the entire Universe.  Obviously, this mechanism must be implemented through something.  Also, many of the observed phenomena could not be explained in terms of the <span>electromagnetic field</span> alone <span>.</span>  The first conjecture about the existence of a special field around any rotating body was expressed back in 1913 by E. Cartan.  And only in 1993 in the book "The Theory of Physical Vacuum" such a possibility was theoretically substantiated.  Particles intermediaries of the three main types of <span>interactions (electromagnetic</span> , strong and weak) are currently detected.  The existence of the <span>Higgs boson,</span> the very elusive particle that causes gravity, is also almost proven.  But the rotation of any material particle determines the torsion fields.  The strength of the interaction of these fields is so small that at first they were ignored.  Compare: in these fields, the force is estimated as 10 in -66 degree, and in the interaction of electromagnetic fields as much as 10 in -2.  However, it soon became clear that during the wave interaction of a torsion nature, the constant (those same 10 in -66) can dynamically change.  Interestingly, when it grows exponentially, the manifestations of the interaction become visible. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that the <span>potential energy</span> and momentum of the torsion field are absent (equal to zero), spin interactions nevertheless carry information.  Therefore, the energy itself is not involved.  A striking example is the experiment of I.I.  Tarasyuk and V.P.  Mayborods by the effects of a torsion generator on a crystal.  In this case, magnetic changes were recorded, which, theoretically, could not be caused by the low energy of the torsion field, but they were present. </p><p>  Torsion transmitters (first gear in 1986) outperform classic electromagnetic ones.  At least the fact that the rotation fields can not be shielded, as well as its high speed, exceeding the light by 109 times.  Kirlian‚Äôs experiments, in particular, the famous ‚Äúphantom sheet‚Äù, provide some insights into the possibilities of rotation fields. </p><p>  In addition, there are <span>human</span> torsion <span>fields.</span>  As you know, matter consists of tiny particles that constantly rotate (remember, electrons have their spins).  Therefore, a person is a biological generator of torsion fields, and it is self-programmable.  It is believed that thoughts and even feelings are a manifestation of these fields.  And since torsion interactions are carriers of information, it is easy to guess that they could not remain without the attention of the military departments of various states.  When this topic is raised in conversations, many interlocutors assert (citing indirect evidence) that the chosen peoples and their places of residence have a ‚Äúzombie‚Äù effect of torsion generators of a potential enemy. </p>
