It turned out that life is unsafe, and this applies primarily to our property.  When buying a car, the owner should also think about a security system.  Established locks of foreign cars are good only against amateurs.  They will not only delay real professionals, but will also facilitate their work.  There is only one problem - you can crack any security system.  If the car is still stolen, then the Starline M15 lighthouse will help you find it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realxenon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Packing and lighthouse Starline M15" class="if uuid-2503951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2503951.jpg"></div><h2>  Global Location Systems </h2><p>  All modern navigation devices work closely with the orbiting satellite constellations of systems such as GPS and GLONASS. </p><p>  Between these systems, the difference is very small, and often people do not even notice it.  However, this does not mean that it is not.  GLONASS - Russian satellite orbital constellation.  She works great on the territory of Russia.  Its main drawback is that the quality of work deteriorates as it moves away from the Russian borders, and it also has fewer satellites. </p><p>  GPS is the second navigation system that Starline M15 can work with.  Let's be honest, he interacts with her much better.  Firstly, the orbiting satellite constellation is larger, and the devices themselves are more reliable and modern.  The system operates flawlessly throughout the planet, and the beacon signal will not disappear even in the most remote regions of Russia.  Secondly, this system works with less errors and is generally easier to configure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Special purpose </h2><p>  Search lighthouse "Starline M15" is installed in various vehicles.  These are optional cars.  It is used on agricultural machinery, on water and is even used in tactical games related to geographical marks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.point124.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lighthouse Starline M15" class="if uuid-2503947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2503947.jpg"></div><p>  The beacon allows the vehicle owner to track the exact location.  So with it you can accurately find out the trucker's route or see if the company car is used for personal or work purposes.  It is also an important element of the anti-theft security system.  However, unlike other protective devices, it should not prevent a crime, but rather facilitate operational-search measures. </p><p>  The device has a very compact size and can be hidden anywhere.  It is also autonomous and does not require external power.  One of the typical places to bookmark a beacon is the headrests of chairs.  Many people know about this, and therefore - do not place it there. </p><h2>  The principle of the lighthouse </h2><p>  The principle of operation of any such beacon is quite simple.  A special location terminal is hidden in the device‚Äôs body, which is connected with satellites.  They receive a request to the device, and the beacon answers them.  Thus, the fixation of the geolocation of the object.  Then all the information is uploaded to a special secure server, and there the user can access it.  The principle of operation sounds complicated, but in fact, this chain runs almost instantly and without delays, and Starline M15 pleases the operator with a quick response. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="vekabakan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Batteries in Starline M115" class="if uuid-2503950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2503950.jpg"></div><p>  There is only one problem, and it is also a common one.  Thunderstorm front, heavy cloud cover or normal weather - all of them lead to an error in the coordinates.  Also, the signal does not pass well through structures.  Reinforced concrete completely shields the lighthouse, interrupting its connection with the satellite.  If during a bad weather the vehicle was led into a reinforced concrete garage or underground parking, it will be difficult to find it, because the coordinates will be approximate. </p><h2>  Base model M15 </h2><p>  The Starline product line does not end with a single beacon.  It is represented by several good products.  They vary both in price and in functionality.  However, all of them, according to motorists, perform the same function. </p><p>  "Starline M15" is the youngest model in the line.  It is called basic for a reason.  Despite this, it is functional and is considered the best in terms of price and quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tyumen-starline.avto-guard.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scope of delivery of a beacon Starline M15" class="if uuid-2503954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2503954.jpg"></div><p>  The device is housed in a small case and has a built-in battery.  It does not need to be connected to anything else.  This provides good opportunities for discreet installation of the device.  An extremely important feature is the invisibility of the beacon.  The fact is that it works offline and practically does not emit any waves.  As a rule, attackers capture lighthouses and retrieve them from the vehicle.  It will be very difficult to do so with the M15.  In addition, this mode of operation protects the battery. </p><p>  A nice bonus is the presence of a built-in microphone and a small storage of information.  The device records all the voices in the car and, in which case, provides additional evidence for the investigation. </p><h2>  ECO </h2><p>  Another popular model is the Starline M15 ECO.  By and large - this is the further development of the previous model and bringing it ‚Äúto mind‚Äù.  The main differences lie in the details.  The device is equipped with a more powerful processor and can record not only coordinates with conversations, but also speed, and even the direction of movement.  In addition, it has a more powerful battery, which is noted by all device users in their reviews.  The operating time without replacing the batteries is impressive - about 3 years. </p><p>  This model has significantly increased the accuracy of determining coordinates.  The error is only about 5 meters!  The case is moisture and dustproof, which makes it possible to install the device not only inside the vehicle, but also outside, and even inside structures. </p><h2>  Subtleties settings </h2><p>  Any technically sophisticated device requires not only installation, but also configuration.  Beacons often also need calibration.  Configuring the Starline M15 lighthouse, as consumers say, is quite simple, understandable, and everyone will cope with it independently. </p><p>  First you need to turn on the device.  The button is located directly on its body.  Immediately after this, the device is operational.  If it does not receive any commands, it will go into offline mode within 30 minutes.  However, not all so simple.  It is necessary to bind the device to the owner.  The procedure is standard: we send SMS with a code to a phone number and we get a confirmation password.  Everything else is configured on the site, where you need to enter the number of the beacon itself, which is indicated on the device.  Alarm settings are the time the device is turned on and off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.autostudio.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The reverse side of the lighthouse Starline M15" class="if uuid-2503948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2503948.jpg"></div><p>  All coordinates are displayed on the site, also come in SMS messages to the phone.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that each SMS is paid.  Therefore, on the site you need to set the balance threshold at which the device will stop sending SMS messages.  On this, the ‚ÄúStarline M15‚Äù setting is completed and the device is fully ready for operation. </p><p>  Before placing the device in the car, it is advisable to check the accuracy of determining the coordinates by entering them in the Google Maps search window. </p>
