The tax payments of a particular business entity depend on many factors: the direction of work, the chosen mode, the availability of a settlement base, etc. For example, the accrual of property tax, transactions compiled in accounting in connection with this process should be carefully monitored.  In the event of an error in the calculations or correspondence, the sanctions of the fiscal authorities may be palpable to the business. </p><h2>  Taxes </h2><p>  All <span>obligatory payments</span> transferred by individuals and legal entities to the state treasury are clearly regulated by the relevant regulatory acts.  The RF Tax Code prescribes the mandatory elements of each type of contribution: rate, base, subject.  The macroeconomic indicators of the state are formed on the basis of total income received from business entities operating on its territory.  The largest budget revenues come from the collection of four main taxes: </p><p>  - for profit (legal entities); </p><p>  - income (residents); </p><p>  - VAT (consumers); </p><p>  - property (citizens of the Russian Federation and organizations operating on its territory). </p><p>  Obligations to make appropriate payments for legal entities occur from the moment they are registered as a business entity.  Value added tax is included in the price of goods or services to be sold in the Russian Federation.  Payments on income are transferred by all working citizens and organizations that receive it.  The tax on the property of organizations (accrual and payment) is borne by all enterprises and individuals who own these objects.  For organizations engaged in business activities, the basis for the payment of assessed contributions is accounting data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Property tax </h2><p>  The transactions reflecting the calculation and transfer of the obligatory payment are made up of all organizations that have objects of fixed assets for production and non-production purposes.  The main requirement for the obligation to arise is the registration and implementation of the financial and economic activities of the enterprise in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Moreover, it should have fixed assets on the balance sheet.  The Tax Code defines a number of enterprises exempt from payment of property obligations, they include: </p><p>  - religious associations; </p><p>  - organizations of persons with disabilities; </p><p>  - institutions of the correctional system; </p><p>  - federal roads, railways, pipelines, power lines; </p><p>  - pharmaceutical laboratories and production; </p><p>  - football associations; </p><p>  - Individual entrepreneurs applying simplified taxation regimes; </p><p>  - organizers of the Paralympic and Olympic Games. </p><p>  Organizations exempted at the regional level are not recognized as taxpayers.  As a rule, this benefit is granted to enterprises of the housing and communal sector, agricultural, municipal, and healthcare institutions.  Article No. 374 of the Tax Code contains a complete list of property tax payers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Base </h2><p>  Property brought into joint activity, movable, leased, transferred to temporary trust, immovable is the object of calculation of this type of obligatory payment, as property tax.  The base for accrual is reflected in the accounting of the enterprise on account No. 01. Foreign organizations operating in the territory of the Russian Federation keep their accounting records in accordance with Russian regulatory documents.  They are also <span>tax residents</span> and are required to accrue property tax.  Foreign companies make entries to accounting registers, form a taxable base, calculate the amount of tax in the manner prescribed by the articles of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, if there are no additional regulatory documents adopted by the regional fiscal authorities.  The object of payment calculation may not be: </p><p>  - Monuments of historical and cultural heritage (world, federal, regional level); </p><p>  - land (taxed by another type of tax); </p><p>  - property of the Ministry of Defense, the police, the system of correctional institutions; </p><p>  - natural, water resources; </p><p>  - space objects; </p><p>  - nuclear-type installations, areas allocated for the storage of radioactive waste; </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - ships and icebreakers. </p><h2>  Base definition </h2><p>  Each entity carrying out activities of any kind on the territory of the Russian Federation independently determines the value of the property on the balance sheet.  Accordingly, it forms the basis and procedure for calculating property tax.  The calculation made at the average residual value of fixed assets is recognized as correct. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, all analytical positions of account 01 are included in this value. The presence of <span>separate subdivisions</span> or branches in other regions is a factor in changing the rate or redistributing the amount between the budgets of various constituent entities of the Russian Federation.  The tax base can be formed by a general indicator in the parent company. </p><h2>  Base calculation </h2><p>  The average annual value of the <span>property of the enterprise</span> is calculated on the basis of balance sheet data.  It is equal to the difference between the amounts recorded on account 01 and 02. The calculation of property tax in 1C and other accounting bases significantly saves the accountant's time, since the formation of residual value occurs automatically when the reporting period is closed.  In this case, the accrued depreciation is subtracted from the initial price at which the fixed assets were received and put into operation.  <span>The residual value of</span> all property is added up.  The resulting value is divided by the number of months increased by one: 4 - with quarterly calculation, 13 - with annual. </p>

    <h2>  Rate </h2><p>  The tax on property is reflected in the financial result of the enterprise, but its size directly depends on the number of units of equipment and its value.  The upper limit of the rate of this type of obligatory payment is registered in the Tax Code, it is 2.2% of the calculated base.  Differentiation is allowed only in the established range and is determined by regulatory acts of a regional nature, category of payer and purpose of property.  The tax rate depends only on the place of registration of the business entity.  The transferred funds go to the treasury of the corresponding region.  In most cases, local authorities apply the maximum allowable value - 2.2%. </p>

    <h2>  Terms of payment </h2><p>  Property tax accounting is maintained throughout the reporting period (year).  The tax code governs the payment of <span>advance payments</span> once a quarter.  The calculation of the annual tax value is made taking into account transfers for the specified period.  The deadline for submitting the declaration and payment is March 30 of the year following the reporting year.  When transferring advance payments, it is necessary to keep within 30 days from the end of the next quarter.  At the same time, a declaration is transmitted via electronic communication channels, if the IFTS receives payment on paper, then it is sent 10 days before the deadline.  Article 383 of the Tax Code governs the submission of information and the date.  Taxpayers can use the information reflected in the main document, if there are no regulatory acts of regional significance prescribing other data. </p>

    <h2>  Accrual </h2><p>  The total value of the property tax of enterprises is calculated as the product of the rate (2.2%) and the taxable base (pre-calculated).  The total value is determined for the reporting year, taking into account the advance payments made.  The calculation period depends on the time the company is taxed.  If divisions and subsidiaries maintain their own accounting records, then based on their balance sheet data they pay tax at the place of registration.  In this case, the parent organization reports only for its own property.  To calculate advance payments, the product of the rate and tax base is divided into four each quarter.  According to the results of the reporting period, the average annual value of property is adjusted for the value of disposed (liquidated, realized) fixed assets.  Upon termination of activity, the company reports and makes the appropriate payments based on the results of the work period, i.e., the advances paid are offset at the time the organization is deregistered. </p>

    <h2>  Accounting </h2><p>  Settlements with the budget and extra-budgetary funds are made by each business entity.  For accounting purposes, account 68 has been created, which, in correspondence with cost and cash registers, reflects the processes of accrual and payment of obligations of the organization to the state.  It reflects all types of tax payments arising in accordance with the scope of activity and the accounting system at the enterprise. </p><p>  The accounting entries for the tax on property are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Dt 91/2 Kt 68 / subaccount - property tax accrued and included in other expenses; </li><li>  Dt 44, 26 Kt 68 / subaccount - the accrued tax is charged to the general expenses of the enterprise or to trading costs. </li></ol><p>  Both options do not contradict the legislation of the Russian Federation and are used most often.  When choosing and using the method of cost allocation, it is necessary to prescribe the appropriate method in the accounting policy.  Understatement of the tax base, incorrect allocation of amounts to accounting registers are violations that may result in sanctions of fiscal authorities from a fine to administrative liability.  Taxation by enterprises located in special taxation regimes depends on the chosen accounting system.  Organizations working on UTII do not pay property tax.  A simplified system (15% income - expense) implies the payment of an obligation with its further inclusion in expenses.  With the simplified tax system (6%), tax is paid if the organization has property, but it is charged to its own expenses. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  The tax on property, transactions and calculations made by an accountant are monitored by the tax inspectorate in order to obtain reliable information on payments credited to the budget.  Credit account 68 with appropriate analytical accounting is intended to summarize the data in the calculation.  To close the register, the result obtained during the calculation of turns should be paid by the company to the appropriate account.  In this case, the following correspondence is compiled: Dt 68 / sub-account Kt 51, 55, 52 - the accrued tax on the property of the enterprise is transferred from a settlement, special or foreign currency account.  When transferring, it is necessary to check the correctness of the beneficiary's details and payment code. </p>
