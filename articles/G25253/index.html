She, along with the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, the Civil Guard, is part of the <span>Armed Forces of the</span> Kingdom.  Their goal is to protect the territory of Denmark, its freedom and independence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Danish Armed Forces" class="if uuid-3054857" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054857.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>Armed forces of the</span> Kingdom of Denmark.  History </h2><p>  Throughout history, Denmark has fought for territory and independence.  The king fought with the nobles.  Nobles with the king.  A series of continuous military operations was a way of surviving the Vikings' heirs, preserving the independence and integrity of the state.  The Danish army fought a lot, until the war of 1864 with Prussia, participated in colonial wars. </p><p>  Denmark was an ally of the French emperor in the Napoleonic wars of 1799-1815 and after its defeat lost Norway, which moved to Sweden.  The territory of the country consisted of Danish lands, islands and the county of Lauenburg, for which Swedish Pomerania and the island of Rugen in the Baltic Sea were given to Prussia.  Holstein also left for Denmark.  Formally, Denmark became dependent on Germany, since its king, as the ruler of Lauenburg and Holstein, became part of the German Union. </p><p>  Germany and Prussia constantly intervened in the internal affairs of Denmark.  In the years 1864-1866 there was a war of Prussia against Denmark.  Its reason was the adoption of the Constitution in the land of Schleswig.  It ended with the victory of the army of Prussia over the army of Denmark.  Having lost Schleswig, the country for a long time turned into a secondary state of Europe, but this was a positive moment.  For a long time, it became a peaceful country that resolved exclusively internal issues and developed the army. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.military-history-denmark.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="army of Denmark" class="if uuid-3054855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054855.jpg"></div><h2>  The state of the army at the beginning of the war </h2><p>  Danish Armed Forces in 1939-1940  were reorganized and modernized, but did not participate in any military conflicts.  The army consisted of two divisions, divisions of seven infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments, and two artillery regiments.  They were housed in Zealand and Jutland.  In Copenhagen there was a regiment of the Royal Guard.  The total number of military personnel was 15 thousand people. </p><p>  The Air Force included two squadrons of fighters, bombers - 19 units, reconnaissance aircraft - 28 units.  The Navy included 58 ships, including 2 artillery battleships, 3 mine loaders, 9 minesweepers, 4 patrol vessels, 6 torpedo boats and 7 submarines. These were well-trained military forces that could repel anyone to the aggressor. </p><h2>  An occupation </h2><p>  Denmark was able to offer decent resistance to Germany, having a well-trained and armed army.  This can be judged by the fact that during the hour and a half of hostilities the Danes shot down 12 armored vehicles, 3 tanks, 2 aircraft were shot down - one of them is a bomber.  Nevertheless, the government signs an act of surrender, deciding not to resist, which causes discontent among the inhabitants of the country, some of whom, fearing persecution, left its borders. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cphpost.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Denmark in World War II" class="if uuid-3054858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054858.jpg"></div><h2>  The reduction of the army in 1940-1943. </h2><p>  Despite the loyal attitude of the Danish government towards the occupiers, Germany demanded a reduction in the army and navy, which represented a certain force.  That was just the beginning.  Formally, the police and army were subordinate to the Danish government.  The German command gradually began to withdraw heavy weapons, including 25 anti-aircraft guns, air defense systems and military vessels to guard the bridge across the Small Belt Bay. </p><p>  On August 23, 1943, the Germans simply dispersed the Danish government and brought their troops into the country.  The military units remaining after the cuts were disarmed, the military was interned, which means that all the equipment and weapons were in the hands of the German military - the Danish army ceased to exist in World War II.  Only the Navy showed resistance - out of 49 ships only 18 went into the hands of the Nazis. The rest were sunk or completely disabled.  The occupation continued until 1945, until May 5, 1945, the command of the German units in Denmark surrendered to the British troops. </p><h2>  The participation of Danish citizens in the war on the side of Germany and the anti-Hitler coalition </h2><p>  Historically, many Germans lived in Denmark, so the Danes served in parts of the Wehrmacht, SS, police and security units in the country, on the Eastern Front in the USSR and Croatia.  Danish immigrants took part on the side of the anti-Hitler coalition.  Since 1941, the Danish government was created in London, which achieved the draft of emigrant Danes into the ranks of the British troops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marucha.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kingdom denmark history" class="if uuid-3054861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054861.jpg"></div><h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  In the spring of 1949, Denmark joined the NATO bloc, in which it took an active part in all operations.  The military construction and modernization of the army went on intensively.  In 1951, an agreement was signed with the United States, according to which American military bases were built on the territory of Denmark - Greenland.  Not taking action in Korea, the country provided medical and sanitary services. </p><p>  In 1992, the Danish armed forces as part of NATO forces participated in military operations in the territory of the former Yugoslavia: Danish tanks participated in battles with Serbian troops in Bosnia, in 1994 they fired at Serbian positions during the Armada operation.  In 1999, a NATO member country took an active part in operations in Yugoslavia.  Since the autumn of the same year, Denmark, as a member of NATO, has been participating in stability operations in Kosovo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Danish Armed Forces 1939 1940" class="if uuid-3054863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054863.jpg"></div><h2>  Present </h2><p>  In Denmark, the only country in the West, the draft of the population in the army has been preserved.  It is fundamentally different from military draft in Russia.  They serve in the army for only 4 months, the draft in the armed forces of the Kingdom of Denmark is voluntary, conscripts must write a statement of their desire to serve and wait a year or two when the turn comes.  During the service, cadets take an initial military training course.  If there is a desire and a vacancy, then those who wish will sign a contract for 3-4 years.  The rest are enrolled in the Civil Guard, which is essentially a militia. </p><p>  The commander-in-chief of the troops is the queen, but this rank is formal, since all issues are decided by the Minister of Defense and the General Staff.  In parts there are persons in charge of political issues - the role is assigned to the deputies of the parliament, representing the ruling party.  The number of regular troops is 15 thousand people, 12 thousand are in reserve, 56 thousand militias are in the service of the civil guard. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.milpower.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="army of Denmark" class="if uuid-3054864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3054864.jpg"></div><p>  Three historical regiments remained in Denmark, which included three battalions - two main and one training.  They are part of the First and Second Brigades, which include two guards regiments, one artillery battalion, consisting of two batteries that are equipped with mortars and self-propelled guns. </p><p>  The special forces of the fleet was created in 1957, in 1961 an army special forces, numbering 200 people, was created. </p><p>  The Danish fleet, in view of its strategic position, incorporates large modern ships controlling the entrance to the Baltic Sea.  The Air Force has 119 aircraft and helicopters manufactured in NATO countries and the United States. </p>
