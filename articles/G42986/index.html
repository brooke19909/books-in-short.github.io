You will also have to understand what kind of organization is involved.  All this is extremely important.  After all, only after conclusions about the good faith of a particular company, a potential client can make the right decisions regarding the request for services.  What are the pros and cons of Safmar to pay attention to?  How satisfied are visitors with the service here?  All this will be described later! </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is the company under study?  Safmar is a <span>private pension fund.</span>  It offers pension insurance services, as well as the formation of the funded part of the pension.  Does not carry out any third-party activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safmar npf reviews" class="if" height="152" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537028.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  All this pleases customers.  They can tell you exactly under what circumstances to contact the company.  Safmar is not conducting any shadow politics.  The organization is supported <span>by Raiffeisen Bank.</span> </p><h2>  Spread </h2><p>  NPF Safmar JSC has branches in Russia in a small number.  The thing is that this company is not too widespread in the country.  Therefore, some believe that Safmar is a scam. </p><p>  This is actually not the case.  The company under study is nothing more than a real non-governmental pension fund.  Organization branches can be found in Saratov and Moscow.  These are separate branches of the NPF. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that Safmar (NPF) receives positive feedback from customers for the fact that the services of this fund can be used in the branches of Raiffeisen Bank.  From this perspective, the organization is distributed very seriously.  In almost every city in Russia, you can apply here to form pension savings. </p><h2>  Head Office Address </h2><p>  Some people wonder where the main branch of Safmar is located.  It’s not so hard to guess.  The city where the <span>private pension fund</span> is located is Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ao npf safmar reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537026.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The legal address of the company coincides with the actual one.  To be more precise, Safmar is located at the following address: 44/2 Plyushchikhina Street.  This is where the head office is located.  You can contact the indicated address if you have any global complaints or wishes. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  What is NPF Safmar rating?  This is an important nuance that many potential customers pay attention to.  I don’t really want to cooperate with an organization that is closer to the end of ratings of private pension funds in Russia. </p><p>  To date, “Safmar” has not the highest rates.  Among NPFs in terms of capital and reserves, the organization takes 28th place.  If we talk about the amount of pension reserves, you can see that the fund is in 17th place.  But that is not all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Safmar (NPF) receives not the best reviews because the company is in 15th place in the <span>rating of pension funds</span> in terms of pension savings.  It is such data that is relevant today.  In general, we can say that “Safmar” is far from leadership.  And this does not suit many customers.  They begin to doubt the integrity and reliability of the organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf safmar customer reviews 2015" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537025.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  And in vain.  NPF Safmar JSC receives positive reviews for the fact that this <span>non-state pension fund</span> has high reliability indicators.  Experts rate the work of the company as A ++. </p><p>  Today it is the highest level of reliability.  This means that the organization will not be suddenly closed.  She can be trusted with her retirement savings.  And this nuance pleases many potential customers.  Only taking into account Safmar’s position in the rating of Russian NPFs, some begin to doubt the advisability of applying for services. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  The next very important point is profitability.  Many potential customers pay attention to this feature.  What is NPF Safmar's profitability rating? </p><p>  You can not call him high.  But many emphasize that the organization can really increase pension savings.  And this is only due to the fact that the money is in the specified fund. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To date, NPF Safmar offers a yield of about 8.87% per annum.  This is the indicator experts called in the first half of 2016.  It cannot be said that the return on cooperation with the organization is too high, but it does occur.  Thanks to this, Safmar (NPF) receives positive feedback from many customers.  They indicate that retirement savings are indeed increasing in this company.  Not too fast, but reliable and stable.  Just what most future retirees need! </p><h2>  Customer Attitude </h2><p>  The organization receives mixed opinions for the attitude of employees to customers.  Some say that Safmar serves all its visitors quickly, without queues, everyone is given attention.  Paperwork is minimized.  Thanks to the professionalism of employees, paperwork is not long in coming. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="safmar npf employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537024.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  You can also notice that JSC NPF Safmar receives negative reviews for the work of employees.  Some visitors say that some subordinates do not treat customers well.  Professionalism is not felt, you can encounter rudeness and rudeness.  Fortunately, such complaints are rare. </p><h2>  Customer Alert </h2><p>  Safmar (NPF) receives not the best type of feedback for the fact that the organization cannot order extracts from the personal account directly through the Personal Account.  There is a special function on the fund’s official website, but it doesn’t work. </p><p>  Many emphasize that it is not always convenient to travel to Safmar branches to obtain information about the state of an open personal account.  However, this is not such a significant drawback.  Especially when you consider that in general the organization has a good rating of reliability and profitability. </p><p>  Also, some say that all statements of account status can be requested by mail.  Another good way to get information.  Only it takes a lot of time.  We can say that Safmar (NPF) receives reviews as not the most mobile organization. </p><h2>  Mysterious transitions </h2><p>  Not the best opinions the organization collects for one interesting phenomenon.  The thing is that some investors complain that their pension savings are transferred to Safmar without consent.  Some blame the organization for fraud.  But is it really so? </p><p>  Not at all.  Most often, such statements are met by clients of Raiffeisen Bank.  When concluding certain agreements, he informs about the transfer of pension savings to Safmar.  The main thing is to carefully read the conditions.  Employees themselves do not disclose such information.  Therefore, all allegations of fraud are unfounded.  Safmar and Raiffeisen operate exclusively under the law.  These organizations are conscientious. </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  NPF "Safmar" receives customer reviews (2015 or any other - it is not so important) receives a positive type for the opportunities that the fund offers all its investors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf safmar rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537023.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, they are no different from the proposals of similar companies.  The only thing that customers often pay attention to is the speed of service. </p><p>  Safmar offers: </p><ul><li>  opening of pension deposits; </li><li>  refill; </li><li>  closing deposits; </li><li>  transferring funds to another pension fund at any time. </li></ul><p>  It is recommended to read about all the features of the provision of services in the signed contract.  Pay attention to issues related to the transfer of money to another fund.  The thing is that Safmar imposes certain sanctions on customers when transferring funds to another organization.  This step leads to large monetary losses, which often upset investors. </p><h2>  About working with documents </h2><p>  Safmar (NPF) receives not the best reviews regarding the work of employees with clients.  Some note that the pension fund offers really quick service.  But such opinions are not so common. </p><p>  Often, “Safmar” is described as a pension fund that minimizes paperwork, but at the same time, the organization's work with documents leaves much to be desired.  It is noted that data on the residence of citizens-contributors are not checked.  And therefore, some alerts and other papers may not reach the client. </p><p>  All this leads to the idea that the pension fund is not too conscientious about its work.  In fact, Safmar checks all of its customers.  And sends documents and references to the specified contacts.  If you change your place of residence or registration, you must inform either Raiffeisen Bank or the non-state pension fund directly.  Otherwise, the data will indeed be sent to the wrong address.  But not through the fault of the pension fund, but because of dishonesty and irresponsibility of customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="NPF Safmar profitability" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537021.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About service in general </h2><p>  What do they generally say about the organization under study?  How reliable is this company?  Safmar receives a variety of reviews.  From the foregoing, we can conclude that the fund has many shortcomings.  Nevertheless, most citizens emphasize that the organization as a whole offers the highest level of service.  Leaders have high demands on subordinates.  Sometimes because of this, Safmar (NPF) does not earn the best reviews from employees.  Indeed, for subordinates, this is the same employer as everyone else.  This must be remembered. </p><p>  Sometimes you may notice that the population complains about the slow service and the constant lines in the departments.  No one is safe from them.  Nevertheless, workers try to pay due attention to all visitors.  Compared with other non-state pension funds, Safmar is not much different from them.  This should be remembered by every potential visitor.  You should not expect too good and quick service from the organization, the company still has its flaws. </p><h2>  As an employer </h2><p>  It is clear what the rating of Safmar JSC for clients has.  And what can employees say about this organization?  How much is a good faith employer? </p><p>  In general, he does not stand out anything special.  Someone praises him, someone does not.  Claims are standard: a lot of work, little to pay, not the most kind and honest bosses.  Among the advantages are official employment, as well as good working conditions.  Open and direct negativity to Safmar is not expressed from subordinates.  But this does not mean at all that the pension fund is an ideal employer.  Rather, it is suitable for those who just want to work and earn money without building a career. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ao npf safmar rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1537022.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn?  Safmar is a real non-state pension fund that successfully operates in Russia.  It has some disadvantages.  Not an ideal employer. </p><p>  But this organization is well suited for the formation of pension savings.  It offers good returns, which is good news.  You can pay attention to Safmar when there is no desire to invest in leading NPFs in Russia. </p>
