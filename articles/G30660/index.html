A dress with hand embroidery, crocheted knitted lace jacket with knitting needles, crocheted lace trim, artificial flowers made of fabric, brooches and a necklace made of beads - all this is more in demand today than ever and is therefore very expensive.  But if you put a little effort, perseverance and desire, then all these tricks are quite affordable to master yourself and not waste money.  Possessing basic knitting skills you can learn, for example, <span>knitting openwork</span> blouses - this is quite accessible to every person, at least a woman, even a man. </p><p>  By the way, just the man was the discoverer of the art of knitting.  It was only later that the ladies pulled out knitting needles from men's hands.  Therefore, they began to invent other, more expensive hobbies, such as cars and motorcycles, computer games and the Internet, coups and wars.  But if they continued to engage in quietly pulling stitches using long needles of various thicknesses, perhaps the world would have been arranged today quite differently ... But let us return to the topic of our article. </p><p>  So, here‚Äôs <span>how the</span> openwork jacket <span>fits with the</span> needles of the ‚ÄúOpenwork Waves‚Äù pattern. </p><p>  To make a 42-size blouse, you will need only 250 grams of cotton hollow braid 2 mm wide and knitting needles No. 5.5 or 4. The color of the yarn is best to choose blue or sea wave, because this summer the fashion prefers a marine theme. </p><p>  We accept the following conventions: </p><p>  front loop - A;  nakid - B;  2 loops together front - B;  back loop - G;  3 loops together wrong side - D;  <span>purl loop</span> from a stretched broach (last row) - E, </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Openwork jacket, knitting with needles</span> from a hollow braid, should not be folded along the bottom of the product.  Therefore, it is best to start knitting with a hollow elastic band 2 to 2 of arbitrary height.  Then the transition directly to the drawing begins. </p><p>  For the sample of the ‚Äúopenwork waves‚Äù pattern, we select the number of loops that are a multiple of 10 and increased by one loop (11, 21, 31, etc.) </p><p>  1 row: <span>* 1A, 1B, 1B, 5A, 1</span> simple broach, 1B *, followed by repetitions of the algorithm from * to *.  At the end of row 1A. </p><p>  2 and 4 rows are knitted with purl loops, yarn overlay. </p><p>  3 row: * 1A, 2B, 1B, 3A, 1 simple thread pull, 2B *, followed by repetitions from * to *, finish 1A. </p><p>  5th row: * 1A, 1B, 1A, 1B, 1A, 1 simple broach, 1A, 1B *, followed by a repeat from * to * and the last 1A. </p><p>  6th row: 1G, * 1G, 1E, 1G, 1B, 1D, 1B, 1G, 1E, 1G *, repeat from * to *. </p><p>  7 row: * 3A, 1A from the past yarn, 1A, 1A from the past yarn, 2A *, repeat from * to *, 1A. </p><p>  8 row: 1G, * 3G, 1G from yarn, 1B, 1G, 1B, 1G from yarn, 4G *, repeat from * to *. </p><p>  9 row: repeat 1 row, only the yarn is discarded. </p><p>  10 row: repeat from 2 rows to 9. </p><p>  Now that the knitter has mastered this pattern, an exclusive openwork sweater knitted with knitting needles, will surely be one of the most fashionable little things in the fashionista‚Äôs wardrobe. </p><p>  Begin knitting from the back. </p><p>  In order to complete the model 42 sizes, you need to dial 88 loops with needles No. 4.  If the size is larger than the specified, then the number of loops will naturally be larger. </p><p>  First, a hollow elastic band 2X2 of arbitrary height is performed.  Then the knitter proceeds to the drawing, changing the needles to number 5.  During the transition, 15 loops should be evenly reduced in the first row, since the hollow elastic is usually double, and if this is not done, the model will be extremely wide. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the canvas 32 cm high is connected, we begin to design the armhole in the form of a raglan.  First, for it, it will be necessary to close two loops from each edge, and then it will be necessary to reduce the loop in every fourth row.  Repeat this reduction algorithm at least seven times. </p><p>  In the course of performing raglanny armholes, you need to start the design of the neck.  You can start this process after the height of the product becomes 32 + 12 cm = 45 cm.  In this row, strictly in the middle, it is necessary to close 33 loops, insert an additional thread into the knitting and finish both parts in parallel.  To round the neck in every 2 rows near closed loops, you need to reduce the width of the call: 1 time by 5 loops and 2 times by 3. </p><p>  The front fits like a back. </p><p>  Only the neckline begins its design at a height of 32 + 1cm = 33cm.  The neck is also in front of the back.  First, 1 loop is closed and an additional thread is inserted so that each shoulder is knitted parallel to the other.  Then, in each 2 row near the cutout, loops are reduced: 3 loops are removed 4 times and 6 times - 2 loops. </p><p>  Sleeves are made in the same pattern as the finished parts.  Begin knitting sleeves with a set of 50 loops, from which the strap is tied.  You need to start making slices for raglan after the canvas of the sleeve reaches 39 cm in height.  Perform bevels according to the same algorithm as the bevels on the back and front. <br>  After assembling all the parts, the item should be washed well and carefully laid out on a soft, even surface.  A table covered with a terry towel is best suited for this.  A thing dried in this way will not be deformed. </p><p>  By the way, the raglan style is perfect for making knitted <span>sweaters with knitting.</span>  True, for sweaters, patterns should be denser, and yarn should be thicker and fluffy.  But the principle of knitting is almost the same. </p>
