  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first guns and rifles of Ancient Russia: trophies and production</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of when the first guns and rifles of Ancient Russia appeared is far from as simple as it seems.  The defense capability of any country directly depends on the quality and modernization of weapons suitable for the defense of the state and for the expansion of its borders.  The history of the proliferation of a new type of weapon is inextricably linked with the history of our state as a whole. </p><h2>  First guns and guns </h2><p>  Ancient Russia at the turn of the millennium was quite enough throwing machines, arrows and spears.  After the crushing of Ancient Russia, the production of weapons came to naught.  The revival of weapons was at the end of the <span>XIV century.</span>  According to the chronicles of the Tver Chronicle, the first guns and guns of Ancient Russia were used by Moscow citizens during the siege of the city by <span>Khan Tokhtamysh.</span>  However, these researchers do not take into account the fact that the Tatars took the city after all, which would have been impossible if the defenders used the firearm arsenal.  In addition, the first firearms were most likely trophy, which means that there were no people who could use the new arsenal. </p><h2>  Iron argument </h2><p>  A more reasoned answer to the question of when the first guns appeared contains the Tver version of the appearance of firearms.  In 1408, the emir Edygei besieged Moscow, but, knowing the presence of guns and guns in Tver, sent his representative there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the first guns and rifles of ancient Russia" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1223085.jpg" width="600"></div>  This short story suggests that at the beginning of the 15th century, production of firearms already existed in Tver.  From there, it quickly spread throughout Russian lands.  Masters decorated their guns with their own brand - so the name of the gunsmith and his hometown were glorified in other territories. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when the first guns appeared" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1223094.jpg" width="599"></div>  The first guns and guns of Ancient Russia were iron, forged from wide strips of metal with a thickness of about 10 mm.  The arsenal of gunshots consisted of beeper, guns and so-called mattresses, had no sighting equipment and guidance system.  But even such an imperfect arsenal has become the main help in the liberation of Russia from the Horde and in the creation of a new state.
