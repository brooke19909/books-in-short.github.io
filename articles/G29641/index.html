In addition to a passport, you will need to apply for a visa.  It can be long-term, short-term or transit.  For traveling around the country, it is better to draw up the second version of documents.

It is necessary to take an accounting certificate from work (details, salary and position are indicated).  A bank statement or letter from the sponsor is given.

You also need to draw up a "green card". </p><p>  If a person has real estate in Norway, you must provide a copy of the ownership document.  Relatives of citizens living in this country may present an invitation sent by their loved ones.

You can apply for a visa at a travel agency, consulate or visa center.  A standard fee will be required.  He is 35 euros.  However, you should be prepared for the fact that during the preparation of such documentation there will be additional costs.  The cost of obtaining the necessary documents can be about 100 euros. </p><p>  A visa is issued free of charge for students, relatives of Norwegian citizens, people with disabilities, scientists, diplomats. </p><p>  For residents of the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk regions, obtaining documents is carried out according to a simplified scheme.  In this case, it is not required to receive an invitation from citizens living in Norway.  For people registered in these areas, it is possible to get a multivisa at the first submission of documents.  This document is also called a "Pomeranian visa." </p><p>  When planning a trip to Norway, you need to know the reasons why a visa refusal may come.

Need to get an interview.  A visa may be refused if the person is nervous during the conversation.  Also, they can refuse to visit this country if there are refugee relatives. </p><p>  Please note that it is impossible to cross the Norwegian border without a visa.  This document is required. </p><h2>  When to plan a trip? </h2><p>  Many tourists are interested in the question of when it is better to plan a trip to this country.  You can come here at any time of the year.  The country is located in the northern latitudes.  Its part is in the Arctic.  However, its climate is milder than in other countries at the same latitude.  The fact is that the Gulf Stream is close to Norway.  A warm current makes the climate milder.  However, the harsh climate requires special planning of a trip from Norway to a tourist.  Video travels around the country, as well as photos will remind you of the unforgettable beauties of this mysterious area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grandescapades.net" data-author=": " data-source="http://grandescapades.net/a-travel-guide-to-independently-chasing-the-northern-lights-in-norway/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Traveling the Fjords of Norway" class="if uuid-2536028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/65070/2536028.jpg"></div><p>  Since many tourists go to this country to see the Northern Lights, they go to the polar regions.  This beautiful natural phenomenon can be observed all year round.  Only the weather (for obvious reasons) should be clear.  In most parts of the country, winters are cold, snowy and dark.  The south and west coast at this time of the year becomes rainy.  It is also cold and uncomfortable in winter. </p><p>  October and November are especially rainy.  Therefore, at this time of the year only true connoisseurs of wild, cold beauty of the Norwegian nature come here.  The most comfortable in this country in the summer.  At such a time, the air temperature can reach 20-25 ¬∞ C.  However, the weather even at this time of the year can be very changeable.  Be sure to take warm clothes with you.  This is mandatory even in the summer. </p><p>  It is best to go on a trip to Norway by car in the period from May to September.  The climate at this time is the most comfortable.  It will still be cold in the evening.  However, during the day you can enjoy the natural beauty without fear of getting wet or freezing in a piercing wind. </p><p>  It is worth considering that in July and August, Europeans are much more likely to go on vacation.  Therefore, there will be more people on the fjords.  If you want privacy, it is better to go here before the peak of the tourist season.  May and September are ideal for travel. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Deciding to go on a trip to Norway yourself, you should take into account the reviews of people who have been here.

You can rent a vehicle at a price of 40-45 euros per day.  You will need to leave a deposit of about 2 thousand euros.  Also, gasoline costs about 2-3 euros per liter.  It is worth considering that in Norway there are more than 50 toll roads.  This is an additional cost. </p><p>  The cost of living in a hostel is about 25-40 euros.  Remove the wooden cottage with private facilities on the street for the price of 150 euros.  If conditions are required more comfortably, the cost is from 250 euros.  You can live in a tent.
