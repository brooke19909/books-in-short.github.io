Its functionality, in comparison with its predecessor (model HX200V), remained the same.  Along with this, the novelty has acquired modern, more powerful components.  It can be safely called a universal device that allows pretty high quality display of almost any object both at close and long distances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dsc hx300" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/728799.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  In general, the design of the Sony DSC HX300 is typical of a hybrid type of camera with rather massive shapes.  In appearance, <span>black color</span> prevails <span>,</span> and all the inscriptions are white.  The device has an impressive size lens and a large grip.  The adjusting wheel has eleven user interface modes.  In addition, it provides the ability to directly access the most used functions by pressing a single button.  The tuning ring is located in the upper right corner.  Programming can be called well thought out, but many users complain that navigation is characterized by fluidity.  The device is equipped with a standard open flash.  The manufacturer has five scenarios for its operation.  The flash range is from 0.3 to 12.4 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ergonomics and build quality </h2><p>  In the design of the housing is mainly used plastic.  High ergonomics is considered one of the strengths of the Sony DSC HX300.  The feedback from the owners of the camera suggests that the developers have well thought out the location of the main controls for the device.  In addition, in the provided structural recesses there is a sufficient amount of space for the fingers.  All in all, this compact camera looks very durable and solid.  The only thing that causes certain doubts is the protection of the battery, which can be opened during operation quite easily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dsc hx300 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/728797.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Matrix </h2><p>  The camera is equipped with an Exmor R type CMOS sensor.  Its resolution is 20.4 megapixels.  As for the sensitivity range, its value ranges from 100 to 12800. The camera software allows for four-fold digital zoom of photographed objects.  At the same time, the nuance should be noted that due to the high resolution, <span>the noise level</span> also increases <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Taking snapshots </h2><p>  Pictures taken with the Sony DSC HX300 cannot be called impressive.  This is mainly due to the fact that the device does not cope very well with noise even with a minimum ISO value.  On the other hand, for inexperienced users and amateur photographers, the image quality seems quite acceptable.  It should be noted that blurring the background for pictures created with this camera is not typical.  As for the capabilities of the lens, they deserve only laudations: the images are not overexposed, and shady places are revealed in a sufficient amount of detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dsc hx300 photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/728793.jpg" width="600"></div>

As for burst shooting, its speed in maximum resolution is 11.5 frames.  This is a very impressive indicator.  However, if desired, the user has the opportunity to set the mode more slowly.  In addition, the device is equipped with an optical stabilization system, which is characterized by average performance. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Sony DSC HX300 has a liquid crystal display equipped with a rotation mechanism.  The diagonal size of the screen is three inches, the resolution is 921.6 thousand pixels, and the sides are correlated as 4: 3.  View modes are selected using a separate button.  It should be noted that the color scheme is reproduced quite clearly.  In addition, device owners can use the viewfinder. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  Like many other modern similar devices, the Sony DSC HX300 is equipped with a video recording function.  The clips are created in <span>1080 / 50p resolution</span> and are accompanied by stereo sound.  One of the interesting features of the device is the ability to scale directly during recording.  The quality of the created videos can be called quite acceptable.  There is no need to worry about strong noise or blurring of the contours of objects in motion.  It is impossible not to note the presence of several original art effects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony dsc hx300 review" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/728794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The Sony DSC HX 300 uses a lithium-ion <span>rechargeable battery with a</span> capacity of 1240 mAh.  Its full charge is enough to create about 310 photos.  As the experience of the owners of such cameras shows, this kind of power supply can be called quite a good solution for the model, since it is also enough for recording short clips and the active use of other compact functions. </p>
