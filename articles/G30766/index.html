Evidence of this is the amazing combination of architecture, cuisine and culture that guests can enjoy.  This is a good travel destination for a short weekend, a great choice for a honeymoon or a romantic getaway. </p><p>  The capital of Hungary is small, which allows you to explore it even on foot.  It is absolutely safe both for the local population and for visitors.  Visiting a number of attractions involves some fees for familiarization with them.  But a lot of interesting things can be seen here, just walking along the streets, parks, markets.  For a trip to Hungary, Russians will need a Hungarian visa, or rather a Schengen visa. </p><p>  Budapest will surprise you with its excellent restaurants, magnificent opera, indoor and outdoor saunas.  There is no problem with what to do here.  On the contrary, it will be difficult for you to make time on a short weekend in order to manage to do everything that is planned.  And do not forget to visit the local flea markets. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.497912" data-lng="19.04023499999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/4/1/7/17417.png"></div><h2>  Antique capital </h2><p>  There is an opinion that Budapest is considered a kind of Mecca for those who are a lover of antiques and antiques.  They say that the Hungarian capital is rich in various shops selling old things, for which you can pay with Hungarian money - forints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Flea markets can be safely called the sights of Budapest.  Three of them deserve the greatest attention: Echeri, Petofi, Erzhebet. </p><h2>  Echeri Market </h2><div class="photo" data-original="budapestflow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shopping line at Echeri market" class="if uuid-3216855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115121/3216855.jpg"></div><p>  Which flea markets in Budapest are worth a visit?  This is primarily the Ecseri Bolhapiac, also known as the Echeri flea market.  He is quite familiar to locals and tourists. </p><p>  Like many other flea markets in Europe, it is filled with old paintings, antique furniture, porcelain figurines, personal items, military-historical objects, old photographs, cameras, vinyl records, vintage toys, jewelry and many things from the last century.  There are also a lot of traditional Hungarian goods: from bed linen decorated in an old style (tablecloths, pillowcases, napkins) to porcelain products of famous brands (Herend, Zholnai and Hollochaza).  This market has something to offer.  He is just a dream for a lover of vintage things! </p><p>  Due to the chaotic location of trading floors and the lack of order in the organization of their work, it is better not to set specific goals for visiting the market.  The spirit of adventure and the search for something unusual will be the most justified ideas for a trip to Echeri. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="welovebudapest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trading at Echeri" class="if uuid-3216854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115121/3216854.jpg"></div><p>  Ecseri Bolhapiac is a fairly large market for antique items.  Counters are located both outside and inside it.  But on the other hand, even if you don‚Äôt get up very early, as many antique dealers do, there‚Äôs enough time to see everything.  On average, a leisurely walk around the market takes a couple of hours. </p><h2>  Market Schedule </h2><p>  Monday - Friday: from 8:00 to 16:00. </p><p>  Saturday: from 8:00 to 15:00. </p><p>  Sunday: from 8:00 to 13:00. </p><p>  On Sunday, there are usually fewer people than on Saturday.  Sellers on this day like to chat with customers about the origin and history of specific finds.  So if you have any questions, you should not be shy and feel free to ask them.  You may need to bring along a Russian-Hungarian phrasebook.  But if you know English, you should not have any difficulties buying.  Most sellers know English at a decent level, which allows you to easily conclude transactions. </p><h2>  Market placement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entrance to Echeri Market" class="if uuid-3216856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115121/3216856.jpg"></div><p>  The first question that a potential visitor to the Budapest Echeri flea market will ask himself is: ‚ÄúHow to get to this place?‚Äù  It is located on the outskirts of the city.  Often, such facts can alienate people who value personal time from visiting one place or another.  Do not allow this factor to be decisive in making a decision.  From the city center by public transport it can be reached in 30-40 minutes.  And the trip is worth it!  Whether you are a confident connoisseur of antiques or an ordinary connoisseur of history and culture, the morning spent here is a good time. </p><h2>  Petofi Market </h2><p>  In Echeri, the flea markets of Budapest do not end there.  Next in this row is the Petofi market.  It is located in the city park Varoshliget, not far from Heroes' Square (Mihai Zichy Street).  Like in other similar markets, here you can see anything: stuffed animals, watches, amateur paintings, clothes, stamps, books. </p><div class="photo" data-original="attractions.topbudapest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Petofi Market" class="if uuid-3216858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115121/3216858.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing that will surprise the market is that it is paid.  To enter, you need to purchase a ticket worth 120-150 forints.  It occupies a small area and is fenced.  It works on weekends from 8:00 to 14:00.  1-2 hours is enough to get around all the counters.  Children under 14 years old and older people over the age of 70 enter the market for free.  It is located near the metro station "Ferenc Puskash Stadium" (about 10 minutes walk). </p><h2>  Erzhebet Market </h2><p>  On Erzhebet Square is another of the flea markets of Budapest.  It is smaller than Echeri and is much closer to the city center.  Therefore, it is not difficult to get to it.  A market is organized every last Sunday of the month by the Aquarium Club, known as the favorite place for youth to relax. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lostandfoundinbudapest.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Products on the market of Erzhebet" class="if uuid-3216863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115121/3216863.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the small size of the flea market, here you can also find many decent things (both old and new).  In addition, there are food, sweets, vinyl records, old players, jewelry and porcelain. </p><p>  Considered flea markets have many similarities.  Some sellers can be seen at different times in different markets.  But at the same time, there are slight differences between them.  On each of them you can buy something interesting for yourself.  In any case, when visiting Budapest, you need to try to allocate time for a trip to flea markets. </p>
