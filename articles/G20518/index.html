    <p>  The hotel has an open-air lounge bar, where tourists can enjoy coffee, drinks and all kinds of sweets during the day.  Experienced bartenders prepare the most delicious cocktails for visitors. </p><p>  The pool bar allows you to relax on the sun loungers and enjoy music and cold drinks. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Anna Maria Village 3 * has a mini market, boutique, car rental, dry cleaning and laundry facilities on site.  The pool has a relaxation area with umbrellas and sun loungers.  For children, the hotel has a playground and a special pool.  For the youngest guests, a cot and high chairs are provided. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Anna Maria Village 3 * hotel is located in the village of Anissaras, near Heraklion.  This is a very beautiful area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Cretan coast, stretching from Kokkini Hani to Malia.  The village is located on a hilly area, near Hersonis.  Although both of these settlements are located next to each other, they differ both day and night.  Anissaris is considered a rich and noble suburb of Khersonis.  On the one hand, the village is ideal for a quiet and good rest, and on the other, it is located very close to the vibrant center of Khersonis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In a small village there are no bars, no restaurants, no clubs for an active nightlife.  Local hotels have a fairly high level of service and self-sufficiency. </p><p>  Most of Anissaras is unusually rocky, there are several beautiful beaches.  In Crete, as in all of Greece, there are no private sections of the coast.  Here all the beaches are municipal, and therefore open for free access.  Sandy oases created by human hands among the rocks simply amaze the imagination.  Such beaches are safe and comfortable, equipped with umbrellas and sun loungers, cafes and eateries. </p><h2>  Entertainment and Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in Anna Maria Village 3 * (Greece), you should definitely go to Heraklion.  It is worthy of close attention from tourists, as it is the historical capital of Crete and its pearl.  In addition, Heraklion is a tourist and shopping center of the island with its long history and traditions.  The city was renamed by the Turks, but later, in the nineteenth century, it returned the legendary name - Heracles, and later - Heraklion.  The city received its name in honor of Hercules, who accomplished a feat on the island.  It is the largest city of Crete. </p><p>  Heraklion has a lot of historical buildings and historical places, these are: Morozini Fountain, Knossos, Nikos Kazantzakis Museum, Titus Cathedral, Archaeological Museum, Kules Venetian Fortress. </p>

    <p>  Knossos Palace is located five kilometers from Heraklion.  Tourists are attracted by its complex architectural form, similar to a maze, and numerous frescoes.  An interesting decoration with a picture in the form of a bee was found on the territory of the palace, which became the real talisman of Crete. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  No less interesting to the guests of the island is the Morozini Fountain, located on Venizelu Square.  It was opened in 1628 by F. Morozini.  The fountain is made in the shape of a bowl with four lions that hold it on their backs.  Water from the fountain flows into eight bowls on the ground.  The exquisite form of construction combines the creative and technical achievements of the seventeenth century. </p><p>  The Nikos Kazantzakis Museum was founded in 1983.  It is located fifteen kilometers from Heraklion.  The museum is dedicated to the author of the very famous novel ‚ÄúThe Last Temptation‚Äù, and the translator of such works as ‚ÄúThe Divine Comedy‚Äù by Dante and ‚ÄúGoethe‚Äù Faust.  In the halls of the museum you can see the diaries of the writer, rare video and audio materials. </p><p>  <span>Heraklion Archaeological Museum is</span> dedicated to Minoan culture.  It is one of the largest and most interesting museums in all of Greece.  An interesting fact is that the museum to this day is replenished with new archaeological finds that are exhibited in its halls in chronological order.  Perhaps the main value of the institution is the Phaistos disc, which is the only example of the writing of the Minoan civilization.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to decrypt the letter until other examples of this writing are found. </p><p>  Heraklion also houses the Cathedral of Titus, which is an Orthodox church.  It received its name in honor of the patron saint of Crete, who was engaged in the preaching of Christianity in the first century.  The relics of Titus are stored in the cathedral itself.  The building was built at the behest of Emperor Nicephorus Phocas.  An interesting fact is that over the entire period of its existence, the temple has repeatedly changed religion during the conquests of the Turks and Venetians.  He was both a mosque and a Catholic cathedral, but still returned to his Orthodox origins.  And the minaret was converted into a bell tower. </p>

    <p>  The most interesting and most beautiful attraction of Heraklion is the Kules fortress, which has survived from the Venetian times.  It was built at one time in order to protect the coast from attack by enemies.  Then it was destroyed during the earthquake, but restored again.  The fortress is interesting in that its walls are built in the rock, which gives it a majestic appearance, making it a very reliable structure. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Many tourists buying tours ask themselves what to see and what souvenirs to purchase.  Heraklion in this sense is rich not only in sights, but also in markets and souvenir shops.  While in the city, you can visit: the central market, Laika market, jewelry stores. </p><p>  If you want to buy things, then you will certainly be interested in the Laika market, which is a European "stock".  Items from company stores that were not sold are brought here.  The location of the market is changing every day.  However, as a rule, on Thursdays and Saturdays it is located in the very center.  The souvenir industry is also developed in Crete.  It is here that you can buy local branded products and products: honey and cheese in painted jugs, cosmetics, spices, etc. </p>

    <p>  The most popular shopping destination in Heraklion is the central market.  Once it was the only one in the city, but then small markets appeared on the outskirts, pushing back the flows of the local population.  But for tourists, the central bazaar is still the main place of shopping. </p><h2>  Anna Maria Village (Crete): reviews </h2><p>  Leading a conversation about the hotel, it is worth paying attention to the reviews of vacationers who visited it.  Judging by the number of good words spoken by tourists, it can already be concluded that Anna Maria Village 3 * (Heraklion) is a worthy place for a good holiday.  But still, let's dwell on some points. </p><p>  The hotel area is small, but very well-groomed, with lots of flowers.  The "star" of the hotel is a young man named Manolis (the son of the owner).  He knows Russian very well and at the same time is sociable and hospitable, so you can always find out from him where to go and what to see.  Generally speaking, he is a very pleasant person in every respect. </p>

All of them have approximately the same equipment.  Apartments with kitchenettes are especially convenient.

    <p>  Maids clean well and efficiently.  Linen and towels are changed on time.  Vacationers note that the hotel managers are very friendly and nice people, always willing to help.  No less charming and the staff of the restaurant and hotel bar.  What distinguishes among other hotels Anna Maria Village 3 * (Crete)?  Reviews of tourists speak about the incredible comfort of the hotel and the pleasant atmosphere prevailing in it.  And it all starts with a warm welcome by the owner of the hotel, who is genuinely happy for each of his visitors.  It is noticeable that he puts his soul into his work, and does not put on stream, which, as a rule, occurs in large complexes.  Apparently, this is his success.  No wonder that a hotel room is not so easy to book. </p><p>  The hotel has its own pool with a relaxation area.  Tourists consider the availability of free Wi-Fi one of the main advantages of the hotel, which works great not only throughout the hotel, but also in the rooms. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  As for the beach, tourists can choose whatever they like in the city.  You can go down to the nearest one in no more than 7-10 minutes.  I would like to note that the local reliefs are such that it is necessary to go down to the sea, and returning back, you will have to climb the mountain.  If you are not a walker, you can rent a car.  Local beaches are stunningly beautiful with a clean beautiful sea. </p><p>  There is a bus stop next to one of the neighboring hotels, from where a direct bus to Heraklion runs.  Local guides offer numerous excursions, but most of them can be visited on their own, using a car or public transport. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel Anna Maria Village * (reviews are given in the article), I would like to note that the hotel is a good place for a relaxing and quiet family vacation.  If you want to find a small cozy complex with friendly staff and reasonable prices, then here you are. <strong></strong></p>
