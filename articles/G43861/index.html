It is located very close to the port city.  The Bugrib Mausoleum and Mosque are located in the same area.  The museum of Islamic culture with ancient exhibits is very popular, among which the manuscripts of that time are considered the most amazing.  The whole hall of this museum is reserved for clay dishes, and the most ancient exhibit is the astrolabe of 927.

    <p>  The most popular sports are aerobic exercise and horseback riding, and of the beauty treatments, sauna and jacuzzi are in great demand. </p><h2>  Reviews about the hotel Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * </h2><p>  Many tourists note that although the hotel has about 3 stars, it does not bother to relax in comfort.  The distance from the hotel to the airport and back is overcome in just 20 minutes, which has a very positive effect on the overall experience.  But not only this is attractive hotel Houda Golf Beach Club 3 *.  Guest reviews also indicate comfortable living conditions. <br><br>  Tourists note that rooms with views of the tennis court are in fact no worse than rooms that offer beautiful views of the sea or the flowering garden. <br><br>  As for the television in the room, only 1 Russian channel is supported, but it is enough to find out all the news.  The floor in all rooms is made of tiles, so that any sounds on the floor are audible, but when the noise stops, you can quite sleep. <br><br>  In addition to the Russian channel, a television antenna catches 2 English-language channels and 2 channels in French. <br><br>  Hotel Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * (photo of the apartment above) is very roomy, the rooms are cozy.  Within 5 minutes of leisurely walking are two large shopping centers where you can buy everything you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="houda golf beach club 3 hotel reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1442107.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The contingent is predominantly French and Germans, Russians are extremely rare, therefore it is better to go to a hotel with a dictionary.  But for those who speak the language, communication problems will not arise.

    <p>  Also, visitors were pleased with the beach with a sandy beach and a shallow bottom and sun loungers on the shore.  In addition, there are not very many people on the beach, so you can always comfortably stay and take sun baths.  More people gather here mainly in the evening.  This is not accidental.  Indeed, at this time, the city of Monastir is especially beautiful.  Hotel Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * and its beautiful beach allows vacationers to enjoy the beauties of evening Tunisia. </p><p>  For lovers of extreme relaxation and children there are slides and water transport.  One of the slides is designed for bathing babies, and the other three are for adults. </p><p>  For those who come with children to Tunisia, the Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * hotel is one of the best accommodation options.  There are no jellyfish in the sea, the beaches are clean and well-equipped.  But here there are invasions of flies, it is better to know about this in advance and purchase the necessary protective equipment. </p><p>  Excellent food is offered by the Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists confirm this.  You can always choose from the assortment of something to your taste.  Watermelons and melons were given every day; one could order fried eggs or omelet with cheese and vegetables.  The restaurant is better Tunisian than Italian.  You can go to each restaurant for free once, the rest at your own expense. <br><br>  The reception service works just fine and, which is of great importance, extremely quickly.  As for the comfort of living, although the airport is nearby, no extraneous noise is heard. <br><br>  All food at the hotel is cooked directly by the guests, which is very impressive.  For the sweet tooth, I must say that the choice of desserts is great and there is a sweet to any, even the most demanding, taste. <br><br>  Near the pool, the hotel hosts dancing and a fire show in the evenings, which is a pleasure to watch.  The staff employs about 20 professional animators. </p><p>  The <span>Houda Golf Beach Club 3 *</span> hotel has a fairly good location <span>.</span>  An overview of local entertainment venues located near the hotel is presented below. <br><br>  There are two shopping centers near the hotel.  Each has two floors and a huge selection and the prices there are very low. <br><br>  Near the hotel there is a bar club with a hookah and a disco, where you can have fun from the heart.  In this bar, if desired, animators also work, which entertain people near the pool.  Alcoholic drinks are quite cheap there. <br><br>  Shopping centers "Safari" and "Folia" surprise and delight with polite and super-efficient customer service.  They accept payments by cards of all banks, even the Russian Sberbank.  Safari is a two and a half minute walk from the hotel.  By the way, prices in this center are even slightly lower than in "Folia". </p><h2>  Beach area reviews </h2><p>  The seashore pleases with cleanliness, the sea itself is also almost perfectly clean.  There are practically no storms, so you can not be afraid for your life.  A beautiful and very comfortable sightseeing yacht with a highly educated guide carries the tourists around the sea.  True, all tours are voiced in German, English or French, so it will be a little difficult to understand what they are talking about.  Such language preferences are highly justified, because this area was previously considered one of the colonies of France. </p><p>  The sun is scorching, therefore it is better to go to the beach either early in the morning, or after lunch, or even completely in the late evening, when it is already dark.  You should definitely bring sunglasses and cream with you for a proper tan, clothes should not be dark, but light to reflect sunlight.  For better protection on the beach, it is better to be under an umbrella, which, incidentally, can be taken near the hotel.  The location of the hotel is very quiet and calm, but at the same time vibrant. </p><h2>  The surrounding area.  Guest comments </h2><p>  Tunisia is famous for its magnificent natural wealth.  Houda Golf Beach Club 3 * hotel is just surrounded by lush vegetation.  Amazingly beautiful tall palm trees, on which you can even see coconuts and majestic cypresses.  Children will certainly enjoy the water park, where you can swim in both the large and the small pool, in which a huge number of the same kids are always going.  Kids are having fun here, and parents are calm.  All water slides are safe.  Even the slightest injury is simply ruled out.  Of children's entertainment, water aerobics and water ball games are very popular, which are conducted under the guidance of experienced instructors.  In this area, one of the best is considered the hotel Houda Golf Beach Club 3 *.  Nearby hotels are not particularly pleasing guests with the level of comfort, and the prices in them are much higher.  And here, people with even a small budget can fully experience all the delights of a good rest with lots of entertainment. </p><p>  Having once visited this country, not a single tourist will remain indifferent and will definitely want to come to Tunisia more than once, because this place is simply fascinating, you just have to look at the sea.  The pier near the hotel is very long and wide.  By the way, sometimes you can see dolphins swimming peacefully among holidaymakers.  Little children will like this fact very much, because dolphins are very friendly and are not able to offend a person.  On the contrary, these mammals always saved from sharks, which is recorded even in history. </p><p>  In general, Tunisia is a wonderful country for families.  It has everything that can satisfy the needs of both adults and children.  In addition, rest here can be less costly than staying at domestic resorts. </p>
