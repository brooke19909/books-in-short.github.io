    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As for the housing stock of the hotel in question, here on the part of the guests a number of complaints can be noted.  However, overall reviews about the rooms are positive.  Judging by the comments of tourists, the hotel itself has long been no different novelty.  Apparently, they did not overhaul here for a long time, and the furniture and appliances in the rooms were also not updated.  Therefore, here you will not find modern interiors and flat TVs.  However, despite this, all rooms are very clean and comfortable, the furniture, although not new, is of high quality, and all the equipment is in working condition.  If something suddenly fails, then after contacting the reception the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.  Also, some former guests of Anmaria Beach advise those who are planning to come here to ask at check-in to be provided with rooms with sea or pool views.  The fact is that the rest of the rooms, according to tourists who stayed here, have windows overlooking a poorly-looking building, more like a hostel, and a garbage can. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anmaria beach hotel ayia napa" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1261130.jpg" width="600"></div>

Moreover, according to our compatriots, all the hotel employees are very nice and friendly people who do their job well and are always happy to help guests with any issue.  Also, a big plus was the fact that almost all the personnel of Anmaria Beach, if they don‚Äôt speak, at least understand Russian.  Therefore, no difficulties in communication with our compatriots will arise here. </p><p>  As for the service, especially the guests note the work of the waiters in the hotel restaurant.  According to them, they are very quick, helpful and attentive.  Room service was also well received.  According to travelers, their apartments were always clean.  Maids conduct dry and wet cleaning daily, replenish supplies of personal hygiene products.  Bed linen is updated twice a week, and towels - at the request of guests (if you want to get clean towels, then throw the used ones to the floor). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anmaria beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1261131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in accordance with the internal rules of Anmaria Beach Hotel 4 * (Ayia Napa), accommodation for new arrivals by their numbers should be carried out after two in the afternoon, in fact, in most cases, the keys to their apartments are just received by the new arrivals almost immediately.  And for this, the reception staff do not require any surcharges, which is very pleasing to hotel guests.  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  If your departure to the airport is planned at a later time, then you can extend your stay for an additional fee or hand over the keys to the apartment, leave your things in the luggage room and continue your vacation by going to the beach or sitting by the pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anmaria beach hotel 4 ayia napa reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1261132.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the comments left by former guests of Anmaria Beach Hotel, most of our compatriots paid half-board option when booking accommodation.  It involves free breakfast and dinner.  By the way, if you wish, you can change the dinner for lunch.  But it is necessary to notify the administrator at the reception in advance.  As for breakfast, then, according to tourists, they are the same every day.  However, the choice of dishes and products is wide enough, so no one will remain hungry here.  So, in the morning you can eat boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, bacon, nipples, sausage and cheese slices, beans, potatoes, vegetables, fresh pastries and sweets.  As for dinners, here the menu changes every day.  So, in the evening, guests of Anmaria <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> (Cyprus, Ayia Napa) will be offered to taste meat and fish dishes with a variety of side dishes, soups, cheeses, vegetables, salads, fresh fruits, desserts and ice cream.  As for dinners, some guests were not very satisfied with them, as the choice of dishes is not as diverse as for dinner.  Therefore, almost all the guests did not regret that they preferred half board.  Also, by the way, tourists are reminded that all drinks during lunch and dinner are paid.  You can order them from the waiter.  In addition to half board, hotel guests can choose an all-inclusive power system for an additional fee.  However, most vacationers abandoned this idea, so as not to be tied to the hotel all day, but to be able to visit a variety of local restaurants and bars. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  This item undoubtedly worries almost all travelers planning a vacation in Cyprus.  So, as for the hotel we are considering, then it, according to tourists, is located next to the sea.  However, the beach closest to Anmaria Beach is not suitable for swimming, since when you enter the water there are many stones that can easily be hurt.  Most vacationers recommend visiting neighboring beaches.  If you want to find a place with a sandy shallow entry into the water, then you have to walk about 15 minutes. Also, many tourists visited Nissi beach several times during their holidays.  The distance to it is 2.5 kilometers. </p>
