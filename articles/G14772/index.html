Knitting <span>pullovers for women</span> is very popular these days.  In the wardrobe of any girl, there are always several options for knitted <span>jumpers, sweaters.</span>  After all, it is very convenient.  They are worn with skirts, and with trousers (jeans), and even with dresses.  In general, this is an option for all occasions.  And not only in cold winter weather you will feel comfortable in a knitted pullover, but summer evenings can not do without light cotton patterns.  Let's look at several different options and patterns for their knitting. </p><h2>  Knit openwork pullover with knitting needles for women </h2><p>  This version of the pullover is suitable for any season.  Knitted from cotton yarn, it looks perfect with light jeans and dresses, and when using woolen threads (Angora) it will warm no worse than clothes made with tight knitting.  To decorate such a model, you can use various decorative accessories, for example, a lace collar, as in the photo. </p>

This is for standard size 46-48.  If your size is larger, then more yarn will be needed.  This model is knitted on straight knitting needles corresponding to the thickness of the yarn.  The pattern of lace can be any.  Choose the one you like the most.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting shelves </h2><p>  Knitting begins with a shelf.  Having collected the required number of loops on the <span>knitting needles, we knit an elastic band,</span> for example 1x1.  Having knitted 5-8 cm, you can proceed to the main pattern.  But do not forget that in the last row of gum you need to evenly perform increases (from 15 to 30 loops).  Next, we continue knitting to the armhole.  Here, depending on which style you have chosen, we either make reductions for the armhole, or we continue knitting directly (for a deflated sleeve).  Having reached the neckline, we find the middle of knitting and continue to perform each side separately, gradually decreasing to give a roundness to the neckline.  We complete each shoulder separately and close the loops. </p><p>  Knitting pullovers for women is a very exciting and useful activity, despite the fact that it takes a lot of time.  So, we pass to creation of a back part. </p><h2>  Knitting back </h2><p>  We knit the back similar to a shelf, only the neckline will not be as deep as on the front.  Having finished knitting the back, go to the sleeves.  Each of them also starts with an elastic band similar to the bottom of the back and the shelf.  Then, just as with knitting a shelf, in the last row we make an increase so that the element is more magnificent and free.  If you choose a model with a deflated sleeve, then, having knitted the required number of rows, just close the loops.  If, however, when knitting the back and the shelf, you made reductions for the armhole, then the top of the part will have a rounding corresponding to the notch.  After all the parts of the pullover are ready, we sew them with a hook or a needle with a thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now go to the finish neckline.  This can be a regular elastic band, the same as on the bottom of the product, or tying with a hook using ordinary single crochet posts.  Even for <span>processing the neck,</span> you can use such a crochet technique as ‚Äúhandy move‚Äù.  Choose to your liking.  All.  Your pullover is ready.  Wear it with pleasure! </p><h2>  Warm pullover with braids </h2><p>  Now we will knit the pullover with knitting needles for women in the "embossed" technique.  Such models look very beautiful and stylish.  The most beneficial combination of such a sweater with jeans.  Knitted embossed patterns (braids and others) add volume to these models.  Therefore, they look especially good on thin girls.  But if you use thin yarn, then the volume will be less.  In this case, work will be added, it will take significantly more time to create this model. </p>

    <p>  Another nuance.  You can knit such a pullover of a free style or, conversely, so that it fits the figure well.  Both options are suitable for young girls and middle-aged women. </p><h2>  Jacquard Pullovers </h2><p>  Another type of pullover that you can knit with your own hands is models with a jacquard pattern.  The latter can be classic, as in the first photo, or unusual and very original, as in the other.  Knitting pullovers for women with a jacquard pattern belongs to the category of work requiring special attention, accuracy and perseverance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting for women pullovers" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/354602.jpg?1395065110651" width="340"></div>

    <p>  The styles of such products are also diverse.  For example, the first model is connected in a classic style.  On the bottom of the product and on the sleeves a 1x1 elastic band is made.  Sleeve - Raglan.  On the chest there is a short bar with buttons.  Color can also be any.  This option is more suitable for teenagers and young girls.  If you change the color, then women of a more mature age will be happy to wear such a pullover. </p><p>  The second model looks very original.  Bright flowers are tied around the canvas.  Their size, shape and color scheme may be different, depending on your taste.  But the style of such a sweater is best done free. </p><p>  For knitting, you can use both light cotton yarn and woolen threads.  The main thing is that they are not very thick. </p><p>  The knitting technique and pattern are similar to the first option.  The neckline has the shape of a boat.  Knitting this one is much easier than previous options.  And even in this model there is no need to perform elastic at the edge of the neck, just gently tie it with crochet columns without a crochet.  You can wear such a pullover with jeans, a light flying dress or a classic straight skirt. </p>

    <h2>  A simple pullover for beginner needlewomen </h2><p>  The latter model is not distinguished by an exquisite pattern and decoration of reliefs.  However, it looks quite aesthetically pleasing and very comfortable to wear.  Even a novice craftswoman can create this.  Knitted pullovers for women, made with knitting needles, have special elasticity compared to crocheted models.  Therefore, for such a product that fits the figure, we chose knitting needles as a tool. </p>
