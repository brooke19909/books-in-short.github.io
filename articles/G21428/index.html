    <p>  A large selection of hotels in different parts of the island will allow each tourist to choose exactly what he likes the most for their vacation.  For example, the Iberostar Creta Panorama &amp; Mare 4 * hotel located near the city of Rethymnon will make a good impression on many potential guests of the island. </p><h2>  Holidays on the Greek island of Crete </h2><p>  Crete is one of the brightest pearls of the Mediterranean.  I want to visit this place from year to year, because beautiful landscapes, clean beaches and amazing sights make this small piece of land truly unique.  Once here, everyone can personally come into contact with ancient Greek history and experience all the cordiality and hospitality of local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cretan weather will surely appeal to everyone.  In the summer, there is practically no rain - they all pour out during the winter.  The climate is very mild, filled with sea air and warm sunshine.  And although rains are extremely rare here, humidity is normal.  In general, the weather in Crete is extremely pleasant and delightful.  Thanks to her, no one here wants to go home. </p><h2>  Fascinating journey in Crete </h2><p>  In Crete, it is difficult to sit in one place.  Therefore, when leaving here, guests should be prepared in advance for the fact that they will not be very often in the territory of their hotel.  After all, to be here and not see with your own eyes the traces of ancient eras, not visit the most beautiful museums, do not visit close to places near which events of ancient Greek myths took place, is a real crime. </p>

    <p>  The main magnet, which gathers all the guests of the island without exception, is the famous Knossos Palace, in which the terrible Minotaur once lived.  It is constantly carrying out restoration work, but it is clear along the already accessible tourists with very long and winding corridors that this place really looks like a real labyrinth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is a very inconspicuous cave in Crete, which is not very easy to reach.  It is located approximately in the center of the island, and every day there are numerous tourists.  And all because everyone wants to look at the place where, many thousands of years ago, the riding Greek god was born and grew up. </p><p>  The most beautiful monasteries, preserved to this day and functioning today, are also the hallmark of the island.  Each of them delights tourists with its architectural solutions, an interesting history and its sometimes unusual orders. </p><h2>  Where to stay for a vacation in Crete </h2><p>  Although the size of Crete is not very large, many different hotels are concentrated here, and there is a very developed infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  Most resorts are located on the north coast of the island.  After all, it is here that tourists will find delightful sandy beaches and warm sea currents, thanks to which you can open the swimming season here quite early.  In the east of the island there are beautiful plateaus and hills, here you can also relax near the quiet secluded bays. </p><p>  Less popular among tourists is the southern coast of Crete, washed by the Mediterranean Sea.  This part of the island has a more severe climate, the air is more humid.  There are more often storms at sea, so local cities do not particularly develop as resort ones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The whole island is divided into four administrative zones under the names Heraklion, Chania, Rethymnon and Lassithi.  Each of them has its own characteristics, so it is very interesting to visit all four districts and decide for yourself which one is most like. </p><p>  Finding a hotel here is not a problem.  There are a lot of them both on the coast itself and a little inland.  Among them there are luxurious and expensive options, as well as more modest options that the middle classes can afford.  Among the accommodation options for tourists in Crete are also popular villas that can be rented for a certain period.  They are located in various places of the island, have different capacities and are built in several architectural styles.  The cost of renting such a home also varies, so guests of the island always have plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  What attracts tourists to Rethymno </h2><p>  In the region called Rethymnon, where the Iberostar Creta Panorama &amp; Mare <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Greece, Crete) is located,</span> vacationers are waiting for beautiful long beaches, green hills and meadows, winding paths and rich infrastructure.  Here, on the slopes, as if toy settlements are located and ruins of ancient structures are found.  The clean sparkling sea beckons everyone who finds itself in these parts with its warm waters, while cozy taverns and restaurants are eagerly waiting for guests to treat them with local wines and delicious Greek dishes. </p>

    <p>  Airports where tourists fly to Crete are much further away.

    <p>  Vacationers find and cons at the Iberostar Creta Panorama &amp; Mare.  Reviews of some guests contain information that the decor in the rooms is a bit old and needs repair.  Also, things like bathrobes and slippers, which are standard for many hotels of this level, are lacking.  Some of our compatriots believe that this hotel is not very suitable for those who want to know the real Crete.  After all, the hotel is located away from the cities, and there are no classic Cretan taverns nearby, which are one of the main features of the island. </p><p>  In general, the Iberostar Creta Panorama &amp; Mare hotel has a large number of enthusiastic responses, and tourists come here with great pleasure. </p>
