This is a corner of the planet where all roads lead.  Tourists flock here to enjoy the sights of one of the most <span>ancient cities in the world.</span>  Crowds of pilgrims strive here to touch with their own hands, to see with their own eyes the origins of three world religions at once.  Even atheists want to take a look at the majestic buildings, against the walls of which there were turning points in the history of mankind.  People seeking inspiration come to the Israeli capital, who want to learn something new, to be treated by the luminaries of medicine.  Resting on one of the three seas that wash the country's coast, people still visit the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old city jerusalem" class="if" height="439" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1243645.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The old city of Jerusalem today covers an area of ​​slightly less than one square kilometer.  This is part of the Israeli capital, in which most of the attractions are concentrated.  The face of the historical heart of the city was formed from ancient times to the sixteenth century.  He is an example of a brilliant synthesis of cultures, traditions, worldviews that coexist peacefully under a blue sky. </p><p>  In <span>ancient times, the Israeli</span> capital, "City of Peace", as it is called, survived many disasters.  Wars, fires, destruction, separation, prosperity and active development alternated one after another.  But without fail he was recovering, like a Phoenix: sixteen destruction and seventeen restoration on his account.  And you can be sure that he will rise from the ruins for the eighteenth time, if such a misfortune happens again.  He passed from hand to hand until he returned to his original masters.  And now Jerusalem is an adornment of the Jewish state.  And each person can visit him to see his splendor and bow before him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jerusalem old city attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1243662.jpg" width="600"></div>

The old city, a photo of which can be found in our article, attracts Christians of different movements, Muslims and Jews.  It is on the territory of this Middle Eastern city that the main shrines of the three dominant religions of the world are located.  If you recall, then their sources are one and they are associated with the names of the prophets mentioned in the holy books.  The characters are the same - forefathers Abraham and Moses, whose footsteps can be walked in the ancient Jerusalem neighborhoods.  Of course, the Bible, the Torah, and the Qur'an pronounce their names differently, but the essence remains the same.  Legendary figures such as <span>King David</span> and Solomon, Herod, Jesus, Mohammed, Virgin Mary are associated with the city.  Temples, monasteries, cathedrals testify that Jerusalem is the most salted place on earth. </p><h2>  The main attractions of a perfect city </h2><p>  The old city of Jerusalem is probably the only settlement in the world with more than seven dozen names.  One of them - Chalem - means in Hebrew "perfect, complete."  And indeed, there is not a single flaw in it.  Erected mainly from a yellowish stone, in the sunshine it seems golden. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jerusalem gate of the old city" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1243656.jpg" width="600"></div>

The most famous include: </p><ul><li>  Dome of the Rock.  A mosque with a golden dome with a diameter of twenty meters is visible from any corner of the city and is its hallmark.  This is not an active shrine, this is the place from where, according to legend, the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.  It is a revered place among professing Islam. </li><li>  The Wailing Wall is the greatest shrine of the Jews.  This is all that remains of the Second <span>Temple, destroyed</span> by the Romans.  Rather, these are the remains of the fortress wall, built by order of Herod.  But to this day, believers come here to pray to Gd and ask him for mercy.  They say that a note with desire, embedded in the gap of the Wall, will surely bring happiness to the supplicant. </li><li>  <span>The Church of the Holy Sepulcher,</span> erected on the site of the crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ.  This place is the pilgrimage center of all Christians. </li><li>  Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third most important worship point for Muslims after Mecca and Medina.  Covered with a gray dome, it is considered the very “remote place” mentioned in the Qur'an. </li></ul><h2>  Bible Trails </h2><p>  Jerusalem is an old city.  Its sights can be explored endlessly, and described - more than one hour.  In addition to the above-mentioned shrines of millions of people on the planet, it is worth exploring other important places.  For example, it is worth walking along Via Doloros and repeating the cross of Jesus Christ to Calvary with all the stops.  It is located in the Muslim quarter of the city.  What else attracts travelers to Israel?  The old city of Jerusalem invites you to take a walk in the shadow of <span>the Garden of Gethsemane,</span> climb the sacred mountain of Zion, pray at the <span>grave of Our Lady</span> on Pancake Week, walk through the territory of the "Land of Blood", purchased for the same three dozen silver coins paid to Judas for betrayal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Other interesting places </h2><p>  It is also worth visiting the biblical zoo, which may have been sung in a song about the golden city.  How not to recall the city of David, where the history of the city, its grave began.  Here, every pebble is significant for humanity, each building is saturated with the spirit of greatness and the presence of the Lord.  You can not miss the legendary quarries of King Solomon.  The narrow entrance of the cave leads to a spacious quarry, which extends under the old quarters of Chalem.  The history of the city can be studied in the tower or the citadel of David, within the walls of which the museum is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jerusalem old city photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1243664.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jerusalem: the gates of the old city </h2><p>  Like any ancient city, it has a Chalem and a gate that served not only as an entrance and exit, but also as a barrier to the conquerors.  In the historical part of Jerusalem, there are eight gates with their own name. </p><ul><li>  The Schema, Column or Damascus gates are the most beautiful and rich.  They were erected for the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent.  Through them, the traveler will fall into the Muslim quarter, travelers from Shem and Damascus passed through them. </li><li>  <span>Jaffa Gate is</span> the busiest, because it is more convenient for them to start a tour of the City of the World.  It was from them that the road began to the main Mediterranean port - Jaffa. </li><li>  Through the Zion Gate, a tourist will enter the Jewish quarter.  Although they were built by the same Suleiman the Magnificent, they are also called the gates of King David (the grave of this monarch is nearby). </li><li>  The flower gate, the gate of the sleepwalkers or Herod is a gloomy building leading to the Muslim quarter and the ancient cemetery. </li><li>  Dung or Garbage gates previously served to garbage to a landfill.  Located in the Muslim quarter, they are the smallest.  Initially, they looked like an opening in the fortress wall, and later they were expanded to today's sizes. </li><li>  Gethsemane Gate is also called the Lions, Sheep, Stefanovs and the gates of the Virgin Mary.  They are turned towards Jericho and it was through them, according to legend, that Jesus entered the city before his execution.  Here begins Via Dolorosa, nearby is the tomb of the Virgin Mary. </li><li>  Hamid Gate was erected only at the end of the nineteenth century for the comfort of numerous pilgrims.  They lead to the Christian quarter of Jerusalem from the side of the modern city. </li><li>  The Golden Gate (Answer or Mercy) has been walled up for many years: in Judaism, the coming of the Messiah is expected from here, therefore the Sultan Suleiman the Great ordered to block his path in this way.  Arabs also deliberately set up a cemetery here, which is considered an unclean place by Jews.  According to legend, it was these gates that served as the entrance to Jerusalem for Jesus, when he rode on a donkey entered the city. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Neighborhoods of the Old City of Jerusalem </h2><p>  The modern historical part of Chalem is divided into four quarters.  The largest is Muslim.  It is inhabited by Arabs who sell everything in the world, and the main shrines of Islam are concentrated here, and also the Way of the Cross of Christ passes through it.  The Christian quarter dates back to the 4th century AD  On its territory there are numerous temples, monasteries, hostels.  The main shrine of the quarter is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. </p><p>  The smallest quarter is Armenian.  On its territory it is worth visiting the Cathedral of St. James - the center of the community in the country.  Residents of the quarter are mainly engaged in crafts and creative work, but tourists here are not very fond of.  The Jewish quarter of the Old City is the most visited.
