    <h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that the lake has several names.  One of them is Manzurek.  From the Altai dialect, "cuff" in translation means "fenced basin."  And the local population named the reservoir in their own way - Doingol, which literally means "princely lake". </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Manzherok - a lake that is located at a low altitude - only 420 km above sea level.  It arose as a result of the water erosion process of the Katun River.  Water is fresh, cloudy, greenish.  The reservoir has an oval shape, the coastline stretches for more than 1000 km.  The width of the lake varies: in the narrowest places it reaches 20 meters, and in the widest - 240 m. The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir is 38 hectares.  The lake is of shallow depth, the maximum value does not exceed 3 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountain altai base" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147074.jpg" width="500"></div>

Lake Manzherok is rich in minerals and trace elements, the composition of the water belongs to the chloride-carbonate type (because of this feature such specific taste and color).  However, water is suitable for drinking and bathing, and even has healing properties. </p><p>  The pond is slow flowing, its surface warms up in hot weather, but at a depth it always remains cold.  Transparency is low - only 60-150 cm. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  In the 90s, the lake was awarded the title of natural monument.  The rich flora and fauna near the reservoir contributed to this.  The surroundings of Manzherok are populated by rare species of birds, some of them are even listed in the Red Book.  There are many fish in its waters - crucian carp, perch, tench, as well as pike and carps.  Fishermen come to Lake Manzherok all year round.  Rest in these places will give real pleasure.  Recently, however, fishermen have been complaining about a decline in the fish population.  There is no exact explanation for this.  Perhaps due to the fact that the waters of the lake were updated several years ago, they were almost completely cleaned. </p><p>  More than 25 species of aquatic plants grow on the reservoir, among them a white water lily on the verge of destruction, as well as an endemic plant found only in this area - <span>chilim (water</span> chestnut), it is known for its medicinal properties.  In ancient times, people even made flour from this nut and baked bread, fleeing from hunger.  A water lily begins to bloom in mid-July, which contributes to an even greater flow of tourists: many want to see this miracle, because there are very few places where you can meet this plant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Altai Lake Manzherok" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147078.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, most of it is swampy and almost impassable terrain.  On the other bank (eastern and southeastern slopes) there are wide forests.  The vegetation there is diverse: fir, spruce, pine, birch.  Shrubs are represented by raspberries, currants, hawthorn, honeysuckle, viburnum and other plants.  And closer to the water - weeping willows, hops and birches. </p><h2>  Popular bases of the Altai Mountains </h2><p>  The beauty of this picturesque nature adds <span>Mount Sinyuha.</span>  In winter, all lovers of winter sports come here, you can go skiing here.  At the foot of the mountain several years ago, the Manzherok ski complex began to be built.  Along the Chuysky tract there are several tourist centers and resorts.  Guided tours are organized to the lake.  It is worth paying attention that the <span>bases of the Altai Mountains</span> meet tourists all year round.  Here in any season you can spend time interestingly, and most importantly - unforgettably. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Manzherok rest" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1147075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Birth of the popularity of Lake Manzherok </h2><p>  The lake gained its popularity back in the 60s of the last century.  This was facilitated by the holding of the Soviet Youth Friendship Festival.  Especially for this event, the song ‚ÄúManzherok‚Äù was written, performed by the popular singer E. Piekha.  At one time, this motive was a real hit that won the hearts of many people.  Thanks to this song, the lake became widely known throughout the world. </p><h2>  How to get to the pond? </h2><p>  Manzherok is a lake in Gorny Altai, and as you know, all roads to this area pass through the city of Biysk.  To get to these picturesque places, you need to leave Biysk on the Chuysky tract.  The distance will be 130 km.  Then - turn off the main road to the village of Ozernoye.  And then, reaching the village of Manzherok, drive it and follow the signs directly to the lake. </p>
