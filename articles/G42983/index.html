  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reforms of Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov. Board of Alexey Mikhailovich</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov is the second sovereign from the Romanov family and the son of the first king of the great dynasty.  He took the throne at sixteen.  During his reign, popular revolts took place in the country, the church split, reunification with Ukraine and other cardinal transformations.  Aleksei Mikhailovich carried out reforms taking into account the country's withdrawal from a difficult situation. </p><h2>  Quiet </h2><p>  Alexei Romanov had the nickname Quiet.  Many historians attribute this to the fact that the king had a meek disposition.  He knew how to listen to the interlocutor and never raised his voice at anyone. </p><p>  More "picky" experts have found another explanation.  They are repelled by the old postulate "peace and silence."  Aleksei Mikhailovich left a strong and strong state as his legacy, which the neighboring countries feared. </p><h2>  King with European Views </h2><p>  Alexey Romanov has always been different from the Rurik dynasty and his father.  He was raised by an uncle (as they were called then) Boris Morozov.  From childhood, Alexei Mikhailovich, he instilled European traditions.  For example, even an outfit for the young prince was ordered in Germany and England. </p><p>  Since childhood, the king was fond of reading foreign newspapers: German, English, French.  They were specially translated for him into Russian.  In order for the prince to keep abreast of the latest news, an uninterrupted postal line with Riga was established. </p><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich managed to make changes to the palace ceremony.  Of course, copying the European model.  He himself began to sign diplomatic documents.  This has never been done before. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Strengthening Autocracy </h2><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov introduced the most ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù reforms.  Both internal and external political decisions led to the prosperity of the state.  The second ruler of the Romanov clan ruled the country more than successfully. </p><p>  The 17th century was called the most rebellious.  A man with a "meek disposition" could hardly cope with such situations.  Alexei Mikhailovich ruled tightly. </p><p>  In state matters, he had to rely on someone's significant opinion, since at the age of sixteen it was difficult to lead an entire power.  He came across an unsuccessful adviser - the greedy Boris Morozov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiart.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov reform reform army reform Alexei Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116904.jpg"></div><p>  He concentrated almost all power in his hands.  He took exorbitant bribes and requisitions, setting against himself practically all the estates of Moscow.  It was Morozov who introduced the salt tax.  Instead of five cents, a pound of salt began to be sold in two hryvnias.  Therefore, in 1648, one of the largest uprisings broke out - the salt riot. </p><h2>  Riots and riots </h2><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich carried out reforms in the midst of constant popular uprisings.  Echoes of salt rebellion were traced even in the smallest villages of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alchetron.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internal reforms of alexey Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116912.jpg"></div><p>  In 1650, a new uprising broke out in Pskov and Novgorod.  Everyone bought bread in order to pay debts for the peasants who fled to Russia, who lived in the territories that had left Sweden for the Stolbovetsky world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The impending famine in Russia faded before the Cossack freemen, who grew into the Peasant War of 1670-1671. </p><h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  The internal reforms of Aleksei Mikhailovich were aimed at strengthening the power of the king, while taking into account the views and interests of the estates. </p><p>  In 1649, the king adopted one of the important legal documents: the Cathedral Code.  Thanks to this decision, it was possible to talk about family, civil, criminal rights, as well as the actual legal proceedings in the country. </p><p>  After a series of reforms, the status of the estates changed.  Russian merchants became more legally protected from arbitrariness of governors.  Also in the trading business, they were on a par with foreign traders. </p><p>  Each nobleman could individually or hereditarily own land. </p><p>  As a result of the adopted reforms, the autocracy has strengthened, and government has become more centralized. </p><h2>  Foreign policy </h2><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich carried out reforms and external.  One of the global issues: the accession of Ukraine.  Its left-bank part was led by Bogdan Khmelnitsky.  He has repeatedly proposed a union.  In the autumn of 1653, a final decision was made on the adoption of Ukraine as part of Russia.  It was this decision that caused the outcome of the war with the Commonwealth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="garynevillegasm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the church reform of alexey Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116925.jpg"></div><p>  The military campaign has worsened relations with Sweden.  This state did not approve of the policy of Tsar Alexei and prevented the strengthening of Russia.  Therefore, Sweden closed the access to the Baltic Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Relations with Sweden worsened, and in 1656 the Russian army immediately took large cities, including Riga.  However, in 1658, Russia lost ground due to the complicated situation on Ukrainian lands. </p><p>  A new war with Poland ended in 1667 by the Andrusovsky truce.  According to him, Chernigov and Smolensk lands and the left-bank part of Ukraine were transferred to Russia. </p><h2>  What reforms did Alexei Mikhailovich carry out? </h2><p>  The king carried out fundamental reforms both within his country and abroad.  We can definitely say that Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov was a wise politician who achieved his goal. </p><p>  The last king of Moscow Russia was able to return Smolensk, the Northern lands, Chernihiv, Starodub to Russia.  Alexey Mikhailovich annexed Ukraine, part of Siberia, having founded new cities: Nerchinsk, Selenginsk, Irkutsk, Okhotstk.  One of the successful cases - the passage was opened between Asia and America in 1648. </p><h2>  Monetary reform </h2><p>  In the circulation of the state were silver pennies, polushki and money.  There was no large face value in Russia then.  This greatly complicated the implementation of large transactions.  Because of this, trade has developed slowly.  Therefore, Alexei Mikhailovich decided to carry out economic reforms immediately. </p><p>  During the entire reign of the king there were wars.  Despite this, foreign policy was actively pursued.  The territories of modern Ukraine and Belarus joined Russia.  These countries had other coins in circulation - copper and silver, which were minted on a round mug.  And in Russia, money was used that was made on a flattened wire.  Later, the territory of the Commonwealth joined the Russian state. </p><p>  All these factors led to the need to mint new coins, close to European standards. </p><p>  Another important reason for the monetary reform is the lack of money in the treasury.  There was a war, and the country was captured by the plague epidemic of 1654-1655. </p><p>  In 1654, the king gave the order to mint rubles.  On one side there should have been an image of a two-headed eagle with a crown on its head, and the inscription ‚Äúruble‚Äù, ‚Äúsummer 7162‚Äù at the bottom.  On the other side is the horseman on horseback with the inscription ‚ÄúBy the grace of God the great sovereign, the tsar and the great prince Alexei Mikhailovich of all Great and Small Russia‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="si.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="customs reform of alexey Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116931.jpg"></div><p>  Gradually introduced new coins: fifty kopecks, half kopecks, hryvnia, altyn and pennies.  Altyn and the penny made from copper wire, on the first was the inscription "altyn", and on the second - "4 dengi." </p><p>  Moscow even created the New Moscow English Money Yard for minting new coins. </p><p>  The population at first was reluctant to use the new money.  Authorities imposed a restriction on the acceptance of coins.  Subsequently, copper money began to depreciate.  This led to the fact that the peasants refused to sell grain, and the merchants refused to sell goods for copper money.  So the Copper Riot appeared in 1662. </p><p>  As a result of the uprising, the reform was canceled, money yards began to close.  They began to redeem the copper penny at the rate of one hundred copper coins for one silver.  As a result, copper coins gradually went out of circulation. </p><p>  Modern historians argue that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmonetary reform was correct.  However, a lack of knowledge led to failure and rebellion.  Later, Peter I will carry out a similar more successful reform using other methods. </p><h2>  Military reform </h2><p>  The military reform of Alexei Mikhailovich was carried out from 1648 to 1654.  The best parts of the old system increased in the army.  Elite Moscow cavalry, gunners and archers appeared. </p><p>  The reform of the army of Alexei Mikhailovich implied the massive creation of regiments of the new system.  After the end of the Thirty Years' War, many unemployed soldiers appeared.  They came in handy in Russia. </p><p>  The first elective regiment of the soldier‚Äôs formation was formed under the leadership of Colonel Aggei Shepelev.  They included Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians. </p><p>  Soon they formed the Second Elective Regiment - the Palace.  He was led by Colonel Jacob Kolyubakin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.salvabrani.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="military reform of alexey Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116934.jpg"></div><p>  In the process of adopting military reform from 1648 to 1654, such parts of the army as gunners, Moscow archers, and the elite cavalry of the Sovereign regiment increased in number.  The regiments of the new system were created: soldiers, dragoons, hussars, reytars.  Foreign military men were separately invited to the service. </p><h2>  Customs tax reform </h2><p>  Customs reform of Alexei Mikhailovich was a necessity in Russia.  The tax system during his reign was streamlined. </p><p>  In 1655, a special body was created - the Accounts Chamber.  The specialists of this chamber controlled the fiscal activity of orders and the execution of the revenue part of the treasury. </p><p>  The main indirect taxes are trade duties.  They were charged for any movement or sale of goods.  The coffers were collected from public baths, from the manufacture and sale of beer, vodka, honey. </p><p>  Customs duty was replaced by a single ruble duty.  Its size was 5% of the value of the goods, with salt - 10%, with fish - a special duty. </p><p>  Foreigners had to pay 6% of the cost of goods in domestic customs. </p><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich carried out the reforms correctly.  The document "Cathedral Code" was adopted.  Thanks to these measures, trade began to develop, customs duties were improved, and privileges to foreigners in the matter of trade were canceled. </p><h2>  Church reform </h2><p>  About Alexei Mikhailovich, you can briefly say: the monarch, who was in charge of the improvement of the state.  Sometimes in a monolithic country with sole authority, wrong steps were taken, which led to disastrous consequences.  A striking example is Nikon's reforms.  It was they who led to the split of the church and the formation of the Old Believers.  This is one of the bloodiest pages in Russia. </p><p>  The reason for the church reform of Aleksei Mikhailovich is to reunite the patriarchal church of Muscovite Russia with the Byzantine church.  According to the decrees of the king, many cult rituals were changed, liturgical books and icons were corrected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.salvabrani.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="church reform economic reforms alexey Mikhailovich" class="if uuid-3116935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116935.jpg"></div><p>  The rejection of the peoples of the church innovations led to an uprising called the ‚ÄúSolovetsky sitting‚Äù.  It lasted eight years.  All rebels were severely punished. </p><h2>  King's family </h2><p>  In the politics of every sovereign of medieval Russia, the issue of inheritance plays an important role. </p><p>  Alexey Mikhailovich was married twice.  He is the father of 16 children.  His first wife Maria Miloslavskaya lived with him for 19 years.  In marriage, they had 13 children. </p><p>  The second wife Natalya Naryshkina gave the king three children.  Together they lived for five years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.intlawgrrls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what reforms did alexei Mikhailovich carry out" class="if uuid-3116937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58335/3116937.jpg"></div><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov carried out reforms both internal and external for the successful development of the Russian state.  Although many of his actions are still considered ambiguous. </p><h2>  The results of the reign of the king </h2><p>  Over the twenty years of the reign, the Russian Tsar did a lot.  During his reign, there were many uprisings, riots, wars.  Despite this, the policy of Aleksei Mikhailovich was aimed at strengthening Russia on the world stage.  Below are the landmark events that occurred during the reign of the king. </p><p>  Domestic policy: </p><ol><li>  The activities of Zemsky Cathedrals were discontinued </li><li>  The lawsuit of 1550 was replaced by the Council Code of 1649.  According to this document, peasants were forever assigned to their masters. </li><li>  Alexei Mikhailovich created the Secret Affairs Order.  This contributed to the fact that absolutism strengthened in the country. </li></ol><p>  Foreign policy: </p><ol><li>  Reunion with Ukraine, the return of Russian lands. </li><li>  The development of Siberia, the construction of new cities. </li><li>  Successful wars with the Commonwealth and Sweden.  As a result, the return of Smolensk and Russian lands. </li></ol>
