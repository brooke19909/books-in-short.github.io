After all, no one wants to spend time in an uncomfortable hotel with a low level of service, poor food and poor location.  Therefore, today, many travelers at the planning stage of a trip try to approach the issue of choosing a hotel to stay as seriously as possible.  At the same time, tourists get acquainted not only with the official description, but also study the reviews of people who have already happened to stay in one place or another.  After all, this allows you to identify not only the advantages that are often emphasized in the descriptions of hotels, but also to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possible disadvantages that you will have to face during your stay.  Such an approach allows, as a result, to make a more correct and rational decision, which subsequently allows you not to regret your choice. </p>

    <p>  To save your time and effort, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots who recently had a chance to stay at the Catamaran Resort 5 * hotel (Kemer, Turkey).  Immediately, we note that almost all tourists do not regret their decision to settle in this hotel.  On the contrary, according to them, the hotel is fully consistent with the declared category and cost.  But we learn about everything in detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Our compatriots were satisfied with the apartments available at the Catamaran Resort hotel.  However, some tourists advise those who like to sleep longer, if possible, ask them to be accommodated in rooms whose windows do not open to the mosque.  During the night, your sleep will not disturb anything. </p><p>  As for the rooms, in them you will not find any exquisite decoration and luxury.  However, there is everything you need.  Moreover, both furniture and appliances of good quality are quite modern.  Most of the guests of the Catamaran Resort (Kemer, Turkey), judging by their reviews, did not experience any breakdowns in the rooms.  However, a number of tourists claim that if something goes wrong, you should immediately contact the reception.  In this case, the breakdown will be fixed as soon as possible. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  On this point, the vast majority of guests had no complaints.  So, according to them, the maids did an excellent job with their duties.  They not only cleaned the room on a daily basis, but also updated a set of towels and bed linen several times a week.  The supplies of hygiene items in the bathroom were replenished as they were spent by the tenants of the apartments.  As many of our compatriots note, this attitude of maids to work was not a pity to encourage with a tip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="catamaran resort kemer photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1044874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  According to tourists, in most cases, you won‚Äôt be able to get the room keys upon arrival at the Catamaran Resort Hotel (Kemer), reviews of which we are considering.  So, as a rule, newly arrived travelers are forced to wait for the checkout time.  True, some guests claim that for an additional fee the reception administrators resolved this issue in favor of the guests and gave them room keys a few hours ahead of schedule.  However, the comments of our compatriots indicate that such a trick did not always work out.  Be that as it may, tourists who have just arrived at the hotel have no need to sit at the reception until two in the afternoon, waiting for check-in.  So, they can go to a restaurant for breakfast or lunch, take a swim in the pool, sunbathe in a sun lounger while sipping their favorite cocktail, or go straight to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="catamaran resort kemer turkey" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1044873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots who previously rested in other five-star hotels in Turkey, they were somewhat surprised by the fact that their own territory ‚ÄúCatamaran Resort‚Äù is very small.  However, according to them, this has its advantages.  After all, guests do not have to spend a lot of time to get from their room, for example, to the pool, restaurant or beach.  Moreover, the hotel area is very green, beautiful, clean and well maintained.  It is very nice to be here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Most travelers also liked the location of the Catamaran Resort (Kemer), a photo of which can be seen in this article.  So, according to tourists, this five-star hotel complex is located in a small, very nice resort village, on the one side of which the azure sea extends, and on the other, picturesque mountains rise.  In the vicinity of the hotel there are several shops, souvenir shops, travel agencies, car rental points and much more. </p><p>  At the same time, hotel guests always have the opportunity to go for additional entertainment (shopping, nightclubs, bars, etc.) to Kemer or even to Antalya.  You can get to Kemer either by bus (a stop is a hundred meters from the hotel entrance) or by taxi.  It will take literally a quarter of an hour on the road.  Antalya will have to go a little longer, however, there are more opportunities for entertainment there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Kemer Catamaran Resort Hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1044872.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Those who consider the Catamaran Resort as a possible place to spend a vacation, experienced travelers are advised to remember that this hotel, despite the presence of a five-star category, is a budget.  Therefore, you should not count on exquisite dishes and delicacies here.  For the rest, according to our compatriots, food in this hotel complex is able to satisfy anyone.  So, in the main restaurant every <span>day chefs</span> offer guests to taste a variety of perfectly prepared dishes of both Turkish and international cuisine.  Here you will find dishes of meat, fish, poultry, seafood, as well as various snacks, salads, fresh vegetables and fruits, several types of delicious pastries and desserts.  In addition, tourists living in the Catamaran Resort (Kemer) have the opportunity to eat at the √† la carte restaurants, where visitors do not put their own food from the buffet, but they are served by the waiter, bringing dishes ordered from the menu. </p><h2>  Beverages </h2><p>  Since Catamaran Resort operates in an all-inclusive mode, Turkish guests are provided with both soft and alcoholic drinks made in Turkey for free.  You can treat them both in the restaurant during breakfast, lunch or dinner, and in the pool bar or beach bar.  Professional bartenders work everywhere, who will not only serve you a finished drink, but also prepare a cocktail according to your order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="catamaran resort 5 kemer" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1044871.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since almost all tourists go to Turkey in the hope of an excellent beach holiday, this issue is one of the decisive factors when choosing a hotel in favor.  As for the hotel complex under consideration, for travelers a big plus is the fact that it is located on the shore and has its own beach.  So guests can reach the sea in just a couple of minutes.  The beach here, according to our compatriots, is small pebble.  When entering the water at the bottom there are pebbles.  Therefore, many tourists are advised to acquire special rubber shoes so as not to injure their legs.  This will be especially relevant if you are going on vacation with a child.  However, entering the sea is not necessary only from the coast.  So, you can go down into the water and on the stairs on the pier.  But in this case, you will immediately find yourself in the depths, which is very inconvenient if you plan to swim with a small child. </p><p>  As for the beach equipment, there is a sufficient number of comfortable sunbeds with mattresses and sun umbrellas for everyone.  As our compatriots note, hotel guests have no need to get up early in the morning and rush to the shore to occupy a deck chair.  After all, no matter what time of day you come to the beach, you will not have problems finding a free sun lounger. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the ‚ÄúCatamaran Resort Hotel‚Äù (Kemer, Turkey), according to our compatriots, has a small territory, you can have a good rest here.  So, many tourists enjoyed spending time at the hotel pool.  There is a section for children, as well as a couple of water slides.  In addition, during the day, a team of animators works by the pool, offering entertainment in the form of a game of water polo, volleyball, darts, aqua aerobics and gymnastics.  In the evenings, shows are available on site. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The hotel administration took care of the leisure of the youngest guests.  So, for them, a minibar works throughout the day, and in the evenings a children's disco is held.  In addition, if necessary, parents can leave their baby with a nanny.  This service is provided for a fee. </p>
