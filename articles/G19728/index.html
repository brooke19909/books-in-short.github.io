    <h2>  Baltic Coast (sanatorium): location </h2><p>  Of course, tourists are primarily interested in questions about where the <span>wellness center</span> is located <span>.</span>  It is located in the famous resort town - Zelenogorsk.  This is a picturesque place with incredibly beautiful nature, because the health resort was built near the Gulf of Finland, on the territory of the forest zone in the Karelian Isthmus. </p><p>  Of course, today the <span>sanatoriums of the Leningrad Region</span> are very popular <span>.</span>  The Baltic Coast is one of the most colorful and comfortable resorts.  And getting here is relatively easy, because the distance to St. Petersburg is 56 kilometers.  Trains run to Zelenogorsk, and one of the fixed-route taxis can get from the city to the sanatorium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief description of the health resort </h2><p>  Not everyone knows that the resort ‚ÄúBaltic Coast‚Äù first opened its doors to vacationers in 1980.

    <p>  Of course, today many people are looking for opportunities not only to relax and have a good time, but also to strengthen the body and get rid of certain diseases.  And this health resort is in demand.  Reviews about the resort "Baltic Coast" are mostly positive. </p><p>  First of all, guests note cozy and always cleaned rooms.  Naturally, the treatment here is at the highest level.  Perhaps the only negative is that with the full occupancy of the sanatorium, not everyone can get enough procedures.  Nevertheless, all tourists are satisfied with the level of service.  In the dining room they feed beautifully - even the dietary dishes here are delicious.  The attitude of the staff is also at the highest level - all employees are exceptionally polite and friendly.  And, of course, the entertainment program will simply not let you get bored. </p><h2>  The financial side of the issue </h2><p>  As for the prices, they can also please you.  Of course, the cost of the trip depends on many factors.  On average, a day in the health resort will cost 2000-3000 rubles.  The price includes good nutrition, as well as wellness treatments prescribed by a doctor.  But it should be noted that drug treatment, as well as some additional types of therapy, must be paid separately. </p>
