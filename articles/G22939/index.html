That is why the city began to be called Pecher.  The most ancient and most interesting buildings on the territory of the monastery are the Church of the Assumption and the Church of the Intercession. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you follow the history, the town seems to "sprout" around the ramparts of the oldest monastery. </p><p>  Pechora, like many other cities in the Pskov region, is the owner of a huge number of temples and monasteries.

    <p>  The city of Bottom of the <span>Pskov region is</span> famous for many historical events.  It is a district center.  This city is the owner of an ancient history. </p><p>  Almost every event in the history of Russia in any way related to the city of Dno.  So, for example, in the winter of 1917, the Bolsheviks seized the royal train at the station Dno.  It was at this station that Nicholas II left the throne. </p><p>  The good location of this city of the Pskov region contributed to the construction of railways.  The name ‚ÄúBottom‚Äù was assigned to the station.  Later, a railway village was built near the station, which subsequently received the status of a city and became known as the Bottom. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City Nevel </h2>

    <p>  Another interesting settlement is the city of Nevel in the Pskov region.  He is considered the keeper of many of the most extraordinary secrets.  The ancient Russian city of Nevel is located on the shores of Lake Nevel, on the border with Belarus.  In ancient chronicles, ‚Äúnevo‚Äù is a sea or a lake.  That is why the city began to bear this name. </p><p>  The history of Nevel in the 16th century is completely saturated with the spirit of war.  In this city there were constant confrontations of 2 great powers - the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the State of Moscow.  For 100 years in the city there were four wars.  At the same time, Nevel more than once passed from Russia to the Commonwealth.  He finally became a Russian city in 1772. </p><p>  The industrial component of the city of the Pskov region Nevel has always been poorly developed.  The main activity is trade and agricultural production. </p>

    <p>  Before the war in 1941, many nations peacefully coexisted in Nevel: Russians and Jews, Poles and Belarusians, Lithuanians and Germans.  Having occupied the city in 1941, the Germans began executions of civilians, mostly Jews.  In August 1941, the German command resettled all the inhabitants of Nevel to the Golubaya Dacha suburban park and began executing the executions of old people, women and children.  At first, the invaders forced all the men to dig a large hole - the grave.  Then they were shot. </p><p>  Little children were killed in front of their mothers, after which they shot at the entire female population.  The bodies of a huge number of people lay in one pit.  Some historians say that there is even evidence that many living people were thrown into it.  And some eyewitnesses later said that it was at this place that the earth moved for several days.  The total number of Jews killed was 2,000. </p><h2>  What else to see in Nevel? </h2><p>  Many historical and cultural places of the city demonstrate the events of that time.  That is why it is absolutely necessary to visit the Museum of History and feel that merciless time.  The Museum of the History of the City of the Pskov Region Nevel is one of the first attractions that you need to visit in this city.  In addition, attractions such as the Blue Cottage, the Museum-Estate of <span>Sofia Kovalevskaya</span> and the Grebnitsky estate are mandatory. </p>
