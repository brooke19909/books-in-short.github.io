Advantages and disadvantages of the studio</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Housing issues - a hot and relevant topic at all times.  You must admit that each of us dreams of his own family nest, where he wants to return after a hard working day.  I must admit that modern apartments with a variety of planning solutions help us to organize the space correctly, adjusting it to our desires and preferences.  It is unlikely that the older generation, accustomed to compacting and blocking everything, would have liked the option of free planning.  But time dictates its own, and today options are becoming more and more popular where zoning of the space and the presence of isolated rooms are simply not provided.  Studio or one-room apartment - which is better?  This is what will be discussed in the framework of this material.  For whom a spacious studio will be a win-win option, and who better to give preference to the old battered classics in the form of a one-room apartment? </p><h2>  Layout options </h2><p>  Where did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstudio apartments come from?  The architects faced a rather difficult task: to make housing more compact, affordable, while maintaining its functionality.  It was these square meters that residents of large cities and megalopolises were especially in need of, unable to acquire apartments with full two or three rooms.  But with the development of the construction industry, the studios have reached such a variety of options that the language does not dare to attribute them to economy-class housing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="enolivier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="studio or studio apartment which is better" class="if uuid-3158485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158485.jpg"></div><h2>  Classic </h2><p>  In the classical sense, the studio does not exceed 30 square meters in area.  The only isolated room in it remains a sanitary unit, most often combined, again due to space saving.  This layout combines the entrance hall, kitchen, living room and bedroom into a single space, and zoning is carried out with the help of furniture and decor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Open space </h2><p>  A modern studio apartment in size can correspond to a full-fledged kopeck piece and even a three-ruble note.  In this case, partitions from natural, lighter materials help to zone the space.  As soon as you need it, you can carry out a redevelopment, which in this case is an advantage.  More and more often in the market you can find studio apartments with a balcony - another isolated room where you can equip an office, a winter garden and a place for relaxation. </p><h2>  European look </h2><p>  The so-called semi-studios, which differ from one-room apartments only in the absence of a partition between the kitchen and the bedroom, are becoming increasingly popular.  If you wish, you can build a wall quickly and with minimal investment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wyliediaries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="one-room apartment in Moscow" class="if uuid-3158488" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158488.jpg"></div><p>  A one-room apartment in Moscow is a luxury, but why do many still choose studios, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich in most cases does not exceed 24-26 square meters?  The first fundamental difference lies in the quality of construction.  In the Soviet years, builders pursued one simple goal: the implementation of the plan.  And the projects of standard apartments themselves, presented in many cities of our country, certainly had nothing to do with comfort, convenience and functionality.  Remember these tiny kitchens, where members of the average family couldn‚Äôt sit at the dining table, dark hallways, which simply didn‚Äôt get sunlight, passage rooms ... All this was boring to the townspeople who appreciated comfort.  Another thing is spacious rooms without extra partitions and cluttered corners, allowing you to purchase any furniture and arrange it to your liking.  True, in the last decade, modern one-room apartments have changed, why it is becoming increasingly difficult for studios to compete with them.  And here the following important argument comes to the rescue - price. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cost per square meter </h2><p>  Studio or one-room apartment: which is cheaper?  Let's look at this issue.  At the stage of construction and subsequent finishing of the studio, even on a turnkey basis, the builder seriously saves on the materials and the work itself: it puts less brick and concrete mix.  Is it possible to conclude that the output per square meter is cheaper?  Upon a detailed examination, you will understand that the cost of each meter of area in multi-room apartments is still less, while the smaller the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment, the higher its cost.  In this case, the full cost of the studio will still be less.  You get exactly the useful space where you can use every centimeter.  This can largely explain their popularity.  The difference between a studio and a one-room apartment in the total amount can reach up to a million.  And given that often real estate is purchased on a mortgage, you will save a fabulous amount.  It is the studio that increasingly prefers young people, choosing it as their first own housing, not wanting to collect and save for a long time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="getinterior.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="studio or studio apartment which is cheaper" class="if uuid-3158505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158505.jpg"></div><h2>  Communal payments </h2><p>  Studio or one-room apartment: which is better?  Continuing to look for the answer to this question, it is important to mention the amount of monthly utility bills.  It is not enough to purchase real estate, it is necessary to ensure its maintenance.  Reduced studio maintenance costs are another advantage.  And all because the payments are based on the concepts of total and living space.  Extra squares that you might not even use are really affordable.  In the near future, even the maintenance of an additional 5-6 square meters may become an inadmissible luxury. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sousmonarbre.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modern studio apartment" class="if uuid-3158511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158511.jpg"></div><p>  The cadastral value of studios is also an order of magnitude lower than that of Odnushka; accordingly, the amount of annual tax deductions will also be more modest.  The transition to a higher interest rate on taxes, according to the promises of officials, will be smooth, but it is nevertheless inevitable, which you need to think about today. </p><h2>  Potential </h2><p>  Let's try to figure out what is more convenient: a studio or a one-room apartment.  What potential, from the point of view of investments, is each option endowed with?  In the city, small studios are not so popular.  The point is the rather high market value of such options: it is easier for a potential buyer to add a small amount and purchase an improved one-room apartment.  Increasingly, studios can be found in the suburbs, where prices are much lower than the capital, and interest from tenants is minimal.  Families with young children prefer the countryside, appreciating silence and tranquility, remoteness and solitude, probably having their own vehicles.  And they, in turn, simply can not accommodate in a small studio, preferring an apartment with isolated rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="melaninmedia.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="advantages and disadvantages of the studio" class="if uuid-3158508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158508.jpg"></div><p>  If in the near future you plan to get family and children yourself, you should also not invest in acquiring a studio - after a few years you will again have to get involved in shared construction of a more spacious option or a mortgage.  The advantages and disadvantages of studios must be objectively assessed before making a purchase.  If we talk about the shortcomings, then it is precisely the lack of prospects and dubious comfort that after a while from the moment of acquiring housing will become apparent.  Studio is a great option for boys and girls who have separated from their parents.  A young family of two will already feel all the inconveniences.  Each of us wants to at least sometimes be alone with ourselves, isolate ourselves from society - in the studio, you and your life will be in full view.  And if you clutter up its space with huge partitions, the whole concept of free planning simply loses its meaning. </p><h2>  The choice in favor of "odnushki" </h2><p>  So which is better: a studio or a one-room apartment?  So, experts say that if you are considering the purchase of real estate exclusively for yourself and at the same time it is the whole amount for the purchase of a full-fledged ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù, get it.  First of all, one-room apartments are still larger in area, albeit not too much.  In addition, their internal space is clearly divided into zones, which provides comfort to all family members.  And if necessary, turning ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù into a studio will be much easier than in the opposite case.  In addition, modern planning options allow you to use the kitchen as a place for cooking and receiving guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="perth.frasershospitality.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio or one-room apartment, which is more convenient" class="if uuid-3158492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158492.jpg"></div><p>  When buying property for a family of two people, of course, a studio apartment in Moscow or another city will become a more rational option.  Such apartments are still the most profitable in terms of investment.  These options are attractive to potential tenants.  Demand for them has been stable for several decades, and the monthly fee is much higher. </p><h2>  Choosing a studio </h2><p>  If you are limited in means, looking for an apartment for yourself, give preference to the studio.  That is why this option is so attractive for young people who are taking their first steps into adulthood.  You are left to your own devices, so nothing can disturb the course of your life.  And one person does not need too much free space.  Studios are increasingly preferred by people who spend a minimum of time at home, because it‚Äôs stupid to overpay for a space that you don‚Äôt fully use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.home-designing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="studio apartments with balcony" class="if uuid-3158513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3158513.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  The answer to the question, which is better: a studio or a one-room apartment, is ambiguous, it is rather individual.  It all depends on your personal preferences, lifestyle, habits finally.  During the selection, we advise you to build on the amount of the available amount, the comfort level of each potential option, as well as the amount of monthly payments.  Only a combination of these factors will help you personally answer this question and make the right choice.  And remember that real estate is a major purchase, the completion of which should be approached adultly and meaningfully.  This approach will save you from problems and disappointments in the future. </p>
