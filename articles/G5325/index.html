It was founded by Princess Vyazemskaya and Countess Levashova in 1902 as a holiday village.  Accordingly, before the revolution, the settlement was called the Count colony.  In <span>Soviet times</span> , a branch of the Central Scientific Research X-ray and Radiological Institute and the Research Institute of Oncology was opened here. </p><h2>  Early story </h2><p>  According to archaeological research, people in the vicinity of the Sand Village of St. Petersburg settled since time immemorial.  Initially, Finno-Ugric tribes lived here: Izhora, Chud, Vod.  Since the XIII century, the Slavs began to arrive, but there were no conflicts with the local population. </p><p>  Until the end of the Northern War, the territory was administratively subordinated to Sweden and was part of Ingermanland.  After the victory of Peter I over the Swedes, the colonization of the region by Russian immigrants began, intensified after the founding of St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hramserafima.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Seraphim of Sarov, Sand" class="if uuid-2531785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2531785.jpg"></div><h2>  Pre-revolutionary period </h2><p>  By the end of the XIX century, the Northern capital grew, the number of wealthy citizens increased.  Suburban housing for relaxation began to come into fashion.  The construction of the Finnish railway line contributed to the appearance of cottages at the site of the future village of Pesochny in St. Petersburg.  According to the census of 1896, 41 courtyards were located at the Black River (the name of this area). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1902, Countess Ekaterina Levashova and Princess Maria Vyazemskaya divided their land into plots and sold them for development.  So there was the Count colony (or just Count).  Count Alexander Stenbock-Fermor, who owned neighboring lands, did the same.  As a result, the satellite village of Dibuny was formed. </p><p>  The settlement was formed according to the adopted general plan.  The main streets were named after members of the family of landowners: </p><ul><li>  Mariinskaya (today's name is Central). </li><li>  Vyazemsky Avenue (Soviet). </li><li>  Levashovsky Prospect (Leningradskaya). </li><li>  Leonidovskaya (Krasnoflotskaya). </li><li>  Catherine (Newbuilding). </li><li>  Andreevskaya (October). </li><li>  Vladimirskaya (School). </li><li>  Olginskaya (Sadovaya). </li></ul><p>  In 1904 a church was built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": . , "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the village of Pesochny (St. Petersburg)" class="if uuid-2531795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2531795.jpg"></div><h2>  Soviet period </h2><p>  The current name of the village of Pesochny in St. Petersburg was obtained according to some data in 1925, according to other sources - in 1931.  In 1938 there was an association with the Dibuns.  During the Great Patriotic War, the settlement was located in the immediate vicinity of the front, parts of the Red Army were stationed here. </p><p>  In the 1950s, the construction of individual housing for workers of various departments and enterprises of Leningrad resumed in Pesochny.  In the 1960s, construction began on the buildings of the Oncology Research Institute.  The number of inhabitants varied depending on the season: approximately 15,000 in winter, and up to 30,000 in summer.  Today, the number of permanent residents is estimated at 9,000. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="oncocentre.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pesochny Village, St. Petersburg: how to get there" class="if uuid-2531816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2531816.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the village of Pesochny (St. Petersburg) by public transport </h2><p>  Since there are many important city and even federal facilities located in the settlement, as well as due to the high passenger traffic between the Northern capital and Pesochny, several bus routes are concentrated in this direction: No. 109, No. 315, No. 496. There is Bus Park No. 2. </p><p>  Are there any alternative ways?  The most efficient transport is minibuses.  Communication from the Ozerki metro was established using the K-259 commercial route, and K-496 and K-680 minibuses also run.  The second option is by rail.  Through Pesochnaya (Grafskaya) and Dibuny stations, commuter trains run in the direction of Zelenogorsk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg, Resort area, the village of Sand" class="if uuid-2531802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2531802.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the village of Pesochny in St. Petersburg by car </h2><p>  To get to the village by car from the city center, you need to move along the Western High-Speed ​​Diameter in the direction of the Primorsky District to the intersection with the A-118 Motorway.  At the roundabout, Gorskoye Shosse departs towards Pesochny, however, in the area of ​​the Mechanized Household Waste Processing Plant No. 2, it turns right.  At the intersection, you need to continue driving along the paved Parkovaya Street, which after 3 kilometers will lead to the center of the village.  The approximate distance from the center of St. Petersburg is about 30 km. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.1241605" data-lng="30.16060360000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/0/9/5/4095.png"></div><p>  If you move from the side of Vyborg, it is most advisable to go along the Vyborg highway to the city of Sertolovo.  Then, at the intersection with road 41K-74, turn right - again after 3 kilometers it will lead to the center of the village of Pesochny (St. Petersburg). </p>
