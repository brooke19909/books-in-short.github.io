Since this is usually an expensive item, it is not acquired for 1 year.  Therefore, before buying, it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the recommendations of manufacturers and buyers.  It will be useful to study the <span>rating of refrigerators</span> in terms of quality and reliability, in order to know which brand to give preference to and then not be afraid that after a couple of years the device will suddenly stop working. </p><h2>  Liebherr </h2><p>  The German company begins the rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability (the leader rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability is the leader rating).  This manufacturer leads the first position quite rightly.  The technique of this company is thoughtful and easy to use.  Any model has a low noise level, excellent insulation, wide functionality.  The devices are equipped with a double cooling system and separate compressors for the refrigerator and freezer compartments, which allows them to be defrosted separately, but not all at once. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the developers took care of the minimum level of energy consumption.  Due to the high technical characteristics, any model of this company will not soon become obsolete.  The company is confident in the quality of its products, therefore, it offers a long-term guarantee - for 3 years.  In fact, Liebherr refrigerators can last for decades, as the manufacturer uses materials of excellent quality: special impact-resistant plastic and tempered glass shelves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bosch </h2><p>  Another German company continues to rank refrigerators in quality and reliability.  Positive qualities: the devices work quietly, there are completely silent models, low power consumption, wide functionality and variety.  Bosch produces reliable household appliances that can work in almost any environment; there are a range of refrigerators for all climatic zones.  The Low Frost system protects food from airing and drying out.  The devices are able to maintain the set temperature regardless of external conditions, which guarantees excellent quality of freezing. </p>

    <p>  The company produces various models of <span>refrigerators: built-in,</span> portable, one- and two-chamber, etc. This will allow any customer to find a suitable option.  In addition, the price of equipment is quite affordable.  Bosch also guarantees equally good build quality, no matter where the plant is located.  A 2-year warranty adds confidence in the quality of the purchased goods. </p><h2>  Electrolux </h2><p>  Refrigerators of this company are located on the 3rd line.  They lost their positions a little, which is connected with the frequent calls to service centers.  However, when compared with other manufacturers, the number of complaints remains very low.  The main feature of Swedish technology is a very low level of energy consumption.  Only A + and A ++ class are present here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Refrigerators can be thawed without disconnecting from the outlet.  The equipment easily tolerates heat (up to +39 ¬∞ C), without increasing energy consumption.  The warranty for <span>Electrolux refrigerators</span> is 1 year. </p><h2>  Samsung </h2><p>  The rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability is inconceivable without this company.  This is not only a large set of functions, low noise and thoughtful design.  Samsung uses a system of dry freezing, which allows you to save all the beneficial properties of the products.  There is also a freshness area for fruits and vegetables in refrigerators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability which one to choose" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1207207.jpg" width="273"></div>  The control panel is easily locked, which eliminates accidental clicks.  Also, this precaution will protect the device from children's games.  The refrigerator well maintains the set temperature, it is uniform throughout the chamber.  The manufacturer also cares about low energy consumption.

    <h2>  Atlant </h2><p>  Refrigerators of this company close the rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability.  Well-known to all residents of the post-Soviet space, the brand enjoys well-deserved customer confidence.  This is due to the fact that it has long been known, and the fact that the manufacturer does not stop there and continues to improve its products.  The result is high-quality refrigerators that have a modern design. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of refrigerators by quality and reliability leader rating of refrigerators rating by quality and reliability leader rating" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1207216.jpg" width="228"></div>

    <p>  It is Atlant that tops the rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability from a domestic manufacturer.  Minsk equipment is unpretentious to operating conditions, has a two-compressor system and copes well with all tasks for freezing products.  <span>Refrigerators are cheap</span> to maintain and easy to repair.  In many homes and households, this particular household appliance is used, as it is reliable, affordable, and has been serving its owners for decades.  Another plus of this company is that high-quality materials and environmentally friendly refrigerants are used for production.  Confidence is also caused by the long warranty period - 3 years, as with the rating leader. </p><h2>  What other firms are trusted </h2><p>  Other companies can be added to the rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability.  Reviews of many of them are positive.  For example, BEKO and LG are rapidly gaining popularity.  The first due to the optimal price / quality ratio, and the second due to expanding functionality.  However, when buying, you need to pay attention to where the device was made.  Preference should be given to South Korean, rather than Chinese refrigerators.  Indesit, once a leader in the global market among budget models, has somewhat lost ground due to the deteriorated build quality and increased number of returns. </p>

    <p>  You can also pay attention to the less well-known Whirpool, Gorenje or Ariston in our country.  It is worth noting that for agricultural needs, Russians often acquire domestic equipment or manufactured in the post-Soviet space.  Very popular are Biryusa, Atlant and Nord. </p><p>  Of course, not all companies are included in the rating of refrigerators in terms of quality and reliability.  Which one to choose - everyone decides for himself.  Firms that do not even make it to today's list can easily end up in a year or two, moving less successful predecessors. </p>
