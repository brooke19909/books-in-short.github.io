For example, the famous resort of Anapa greets its guests with golden sand, and in Sochi, vacationers are waiting for magnificent beaches with hot pebbles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pebble beach near Anapa </h2><p>  Near Anapa, this popular destination for children, one can also easily find places where pebble beaches await tourists.  These include, first of all, a small village called Sukko.  This place is famous for the fact that the Smena All-Russian Children's Center is located here.  Other camps are also based in Sukko.  Many schoolchildren come here with their trainers to sports camps.  Here rest youth couples, families with children, and people of age. </p><p>  In Sukko, a pebble beach, not very large in length.  On both sides it is surrounded by picturesque mountains covered with abundant greenery.  A small river flows through the village, flowing into the sea almost at the foot of one of the coastal peaks.  Many people choose this place because of the abundance of juniper and cypress trees, which exude a unique aroma. </p><h2>  Cozy hotel in Sukko </h2><p>  Of course, for tourists coming to the Black Sea there are all kinds of guest houses and small hotels.  One of the successful places where you can sit perfectly for the whole time of your vacation is the Utrish Residence - a hotel that since 2013 has been welcoming to welcome many travelers from different parts of our country under its roof. </p>

    <p>  Based on reviews from the main advantages of the Utrish Residence hotel, you can distinguish proximity to the sea, comfortable rooms and a swimming pool.  The disadvantages of the hotel are also available.  The most important of them, to which the guests paid the most attention, is the soundproofing of the rooms.  A lot of people write that at times everything that happens in the corridor and even in the neighboring rooms is audible.  Also, some people who visited this hotel noted that the continental breakfast provided is very poor and not diverse. </p>
