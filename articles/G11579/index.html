Therefore, many job seekers and potential clients try to learn all about employers and service firms.  Only after this can a final decision be made on how suitable the corporation is for certain services.  Attention will be presented to the insurance company "Support".  What kind of feedback does she receive from her clients and employees?  How reliable is this firm?  What does she do at all?  To understand all this is actually not as difficult as it seems.  Especially if you don‚Äôt believe everything that is said on various otzovik sites.  Not all information in the opinions left is true.  So what is the first thing to pay attention to? </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  For example, what "Reliance" does.  It has already been said that this is nothing more than an insurance company.  It offers a standard package of services for insurance of the population and property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company support reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517270.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The company studied is distributed throughout Russia.  Offices are available in many locations.  It follows that this is not about scammers at all.  This fact pleases potential and real customers.  But what does the population really think about this organization?  How ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù is a good employer, as well as a service company?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Numerous reviews will help to understand all the questions asked. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Range of services </h2><p>  First, a little about how the organization looks from the side of clients.  Many people pay attention to the fact that "Support" offers a standard package of services to its visitors.  But she also has some special features. <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  Today, "Support" allows you to: </p><ul><li>  to issue hull and motor third party liability insurance; </li><li>  get life and property insurance when traveling; </li><li>  apply for a VHI policy; </li><li>  take advantage of mortgage insurance; </li><li>  to insure life; </li><li>  take out accident insurance. </li></ul><p>  It is insurance for travelers that is not found in all companies.  And therefore, the <span>insurance company</span> "Support" receives positive feedback from customers.  Especially from those who want to travel a lot and not worry about insurance.  But is everything really good?  What other features should the population pay attention to before contacting here? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company support real reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517269.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rating </h2><p>  For example, an important role is played by the rating of the organization among other similar companies.  Today, "Support" is a well-known, but far from the best <span>insurance organization.</span>  This should be remembered by every citizen. </p><p>  The thing is that the specified insurance company is not among the top 10 leaders of insurance organizations.  If you look at slightly outdated data, then in 2014, "Support" was at about 36th place in the <span>rating of insurance companies.</span>  The exact location of the organization is currently unknown.  It‚Äôs enough to know that ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù has low rating indicators in Russia.  Therefore, not everyone is ready to cooperate with this corporation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Trust </h2><p>  The insurance company "Opora" receives not the best customer reviews also for a relatively low level of reliability.  This indicator is extremely important for all firms.  It indicates how safe it is to contact an organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company support real reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517274.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At ‚ÄúPillar‚Äù the trust level was approximately at B + and B ++.  Accordingly, they are deciphered as "Low level of reliability" and "Acceptable reliability."  Not a good indicator for a modern organization. </p><p>  All this leads to the idea that the ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù has some serious problems and shortcomings.  Yes, and few customers quickly decide on further cooperation with the corporation.  After all, even insurance companies with a high level of reliability are skeptical. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  What else can be said about how customers relate to the corporation?  JSC (insurance company) "Support" reviews earns mixed reviews regarding the quality of service.  Some say that the company is attentive to each of its customers.  Workers are all responsive and attentive, they try to answer all asked questions.  Moreover, the answers are detailed and understandable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But some of the clients indicate that the "Reliance" is not the best way to deal with the population.  Workers disdainful of visitors, can be rude and naughty.  Some subordinates are not distinguished by their professionalism. </p><p>  So what to believe?  Insurance company "Support" real reviews are mixed.  Somewhere, really, workers are not the best.  And in some departments, on the contrary, the service is at its best.  It‚Äôs worth just to take into account that in general the organization tries to treat its visitors with good faith, but no one is immune from the human factor.  Negative experience here is also not excluded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company support reviews and ratings" class="if" height="254" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  CTP and CASCO </h2><p>  What do they say about car insurance in this organization?  Insurance company "Support" receives various reviews.  Some say that the CASCO and CTP policies really came in handy.  They help to get payments without any problems, repair the car.  Many situations are covered by insurance. </p><p>  Along with this, the overwhelming number of opinions indicates that the insurance policies from the "Support" are not accepted everywhere.  It‚Äôs problematic to get money on them; automobile means are being repaired for a relatively long time.  Therefore, OSAGO and CASCO are recommended by many not to issue. </p><h2>  From tourists </h2><p>  Insurance company "Support" reviews of tourists about travel insurance in general receives positive.  But such opinions are quite rare.  After all, the population, in principle, is skeptical of the corporation under study.  Many suppose that "Reliance" does not offer the best travel insurance. </p><p>  In fact, payments are made, but in smaller amounts than the client expects.  Some service hitches are also not excluded.  If you believe the numerous reviews, then rely on the "Reliance" is impossible.  More precisely, a person will act only at his own peril and risk. </p><h2>  Job offers </h2><p>  "Support" (insurance company) receives various reviews from employees.  It is worth paying attention to what promises when making a corporation.  This is an important point that allows you to judge the integrity of the organization. </p><p>  Initially, "Support" attracts the following promises: </p><ul><li>  official employment; </li><li>  flexible working hours; </li><li>  friendly team; </li><li>  social guarantees; </li><li>  career growth; </li><li>  decent pay; </li><li>  free tuition; </li><li>  personal development. </li></ul><p>  Which of these is true?  What promises are tricks?  Are all these benefits really offered to employees in full? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance company support customer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517272.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About employment </h2><p>  Insurance company "Support" receives positive reviews for the fact that this organization actually offers its subordinates official employment.  Jobs here are not welcome.  And there can be no talk of unofficial work. </p><p>  Although without registration you will have to work only during the training / internship period.  Its duration is about a week.  After this, it is necessary either to stop cooperation, or to formalize in accordance with the Labor legislation of the Russian Federation.  "Support" is a place where you can get work experience, which is so necessary for the population! </p><h2>  Work schedule </h2><p>  JSC insurance company "Support" reviews are not the best for the work schedule.  On the one hand, the company offers favorable working conditions, and also prescribes a work schedule in the employment contract.  But on the other, the established agreement is often violated. </p><p>  Employees note that even after the end of the working day, you have to remain for overtime work, which is not remunerated in any way.  It takes about 12-14 hours to work, which is not always easy.  However, a similar situation is seen in most employers. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  Insurance company "Support" receives a negative plan reviews for earnings.  The thing is that, according to numerous opinions, it is offered in reality low.  You can earn normal money, only it is extremely difficult to do.  Most workers do not succeed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="travel insurance company reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517275.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Salaries in the "Support" among subordinates are low.  But at the same time, the exact income depends on the number of services offered.  Accordingly, high profit prospects do exist.  Only now to bring them to life will not work. </p><p>  Low earnings - this is one of the reasons why the "Support" receives a lot of negativity from subordinates.  Indeed, upon employment, they initially promise a good income.  Quite often, many are ready to put up with a difficult work schedule, and with constant overtime work, but only if they pay normally for all this. </p><h2>  Collective </h2><p>  But for the work team, the insurance company "Support" reviews earns mostly positive.  Workers point out that the bulk of the staff are conscientious, responsive and friendly people.  They help beginners to get comfortable in a new workplace.  Always ready to help. </p><p>  Although sometimes with the work team is not lucky.  No one is safe from this situation.  But in general, there are no complaints in this area.  No competition or serious quarrels.  Only a friendly team that is ready to support. </p><h2>  Superiors </h2><p>  The authorities leave much to be desired.  Most of the employees indicate that the management of "Support" is not too conscientious about their subordinates.  An unfair and biased attitude is what employees emphasize. </p><p>  However, such claims are expressed against almost any employer.  This is a normal occurrence.  Part of the staff says that the leadership of "Support" simply requires discipline.  When getting a job here, you just need to remember that the bosses may not be completely conscientious in treating their subordinates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ao insurance company support reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1517271.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It is clear what the insurance company "Support" has reviews and ratings among customers and applicants.  This is not the best place for employment, as well as for applying for insurance services.  But a direct negative is not addressed to the corporation. </p><p>  The ‚Äúprop‚Äù actually has quite a few flaws.  You can come to terms with some of them.  Turning here, both the employee and the client act at their own peril and risk.  Testimonials indicate that someone has a positive experience with the organization, and someone has a negative experience. </p>
