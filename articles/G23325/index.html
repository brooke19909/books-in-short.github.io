The first is the official venue for the emperor of the Celestial Empire to receive ambassadors of other powers and audience seekers.  The Purple Palace of the Forbidden City is a complete officialism.  Its powerful walls and Tiananmen Square are much larger than the Moscow Kremlin.  To relax from political affairs and indulge in the contemplation of the harmony of nature, a summer palace was built.  Beijing with its smog, rumble and bustle remained twenty kilometers south.  Around only paradise bucolics.  And it‚Äôs hard to believe that all landscapes, with the incomparable lake inclusive, are man-made.  It would be wrong to say that the summer residence of the <span>Chinese emperor</span> is an analogue of Peterhof or Versailles.  It is very different from European palace and park complexes.  Than?  You will learn about this from our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beijing Summer Palace" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Residence History </h2><p>  <span>The Summer Palace</span> (Beijing) dates back to <span>the Qin Dynasty.</span>  Until this time, there were royal gardens and a small estate.  In the mid-eighteenth century, Emperor Qianlong ordered the creation of a luxurious residence for recreation in the northwest of the capital.  Construction began in 1750.  First of all, began to create Kunming Lake.  Now it occupies three fourths of the park.  The prototype for the artificial reservoir was Dianchi Lake.  All work was carried out in a hurry.  The construction was supposed to be completed by the sixtieth anniversary of the emperor‚Äôs mother.  Nevertheless, everything was done in good faith.  The land that was raised to create Kunming Lake was rammed into Longevity Hill.  At its top, Buddhist temples were erected.  Unlike European palace and park complexes, the summer residence of the Chinese emperor does not take up much space.  Basically it is a harmonious nature, which the royal family came to admire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beijing Imperial Summer Palace" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248945.jpg" width="600"></div>

Like wild barbarians, they plundered the suburban residence of the emperors of the Celestial Empire.  For some time the palace was in terrible desolation.  Since 1888, by intrigue and poisoning candidates for the throne, the regency of the two-year-old Emperor Cixi came to power.  Women played a small role in Chinese history.  But Cixi was a bright personality.  She spent all the money collected on the foundation of the Chinese fleet to restore the suburban residence from the ashes.  The park, which was previously called Yuanmingyuan (Gardens of Perfect Clarity), was renamed Yiheyuan - Place of Tranquil Old Age and Rest.  But in 1900, the European invaders again looted a wonderful residence.  The kind that we observe today, the palace and park complex acquired only in the first half of the twentieth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beijing Summer Palace how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248938.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What does the residence look like </h2><p>  It is conditionally divided into two parts: </p><ul><li>  summer imperial palace; </li><li>  Yiheyuan Park. </li></ul><p>  In Beijing you will find few places where historical and cultural attractions harmoniously combine with the beauty of nature.  The park covers a large area - about three hundred hectares.  Three quarters of it is the beautiful Kunming Lake.  From the north it is protected from cold winds by Longevity Hill - Wanshoushan.  All significant buildings are concentrated in the northern part of the park.  There is also the entrance to the summer residence of the Chinese emperors.  In total, there are about three thousand buildings.  The entire palace and park complex is included in the UNESCO List.  And some buildings took a worthy place in the pages of the Guinness Book.  This is the "longest painted corridor in the world."  It stretches along the coast for seven hundred twenty eight meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor's Summer Palace in Beijing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248939.jpg" width="600"></div>

And when the Chinese monarchy was overthrown, he completely fell into desolation.  But Kunming and Hou lakes played a significant role in Beijing's water supply.  They had to be kept clean.  In 1914, the park was opened for visitors.  Entrance fees were charged, and the accumulated funds began to restore the palaces and pavilions.  As a museum, the complex began to function since 1949.  Now Iheyuan Park and the former summer residence of the emperors are visited by about five million people every year.  Entrance fees are still being charged.  A ticket costs sixty yuan for an adult.  This museum is one of the top ten most famous attractions in Beijing.  It is worth coming here for the whole day.  But, in view of the large area, it is unlikely to be able to immediately inspect everything.  After all, there are three thousand diverse buildings.  We will list only the most significant ones that tourists should not miss. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emperor‚Äôs summer palace in Beijing how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248957.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Oriental palaces </h2><p>  The main (now the only) entrance to the residence is called Dungunmen.  Translated, this means "The Gates of the Oriental Palaces."  The entrance is protected by statues of magical animals, designed to provide the residents of the residence with longevity and prosperity.  Passing through the gate, we get to the shopping street of Suzhou.  Numerous servants had no right to leave the summer imperial palace in Beijing, so the eunuchs did business in reselling goods.  Having passed the street along the canal, we find ourselves in Jenshoudian.  The official apartments of the poisoner Cixi were called the Palace of Humanity and Longevity.  Wenchang tower is located a little further.  Emperor Guangxu, an older Cixi nephew, wrote poems on her roof.  One cannot but walk the longest painted Changlan corridor in the world.  It goes along the coast and starts from the west wing of the palace.  And from the east is the Deheyuan Theater ("Palace of Virtue and Harmony").  Here in the annex you can see the very first car in China, on which Cixi herself drove. </p><h2>  Kunming Lake and its attractions </h2><p>  We continue to inspect the summer palace in Beijing.  Yiheyuan Park with beautiful Kunming Lake occupies the lion's share of the complex.  The artificial pond is rather small.  In summer, Kunming Lake is especially beautiful because the water surface is covered with blooming lotuses.  The main decoration of this natural man-made attraction are the bridges and boats of Cixi.  The last marble barge was installed during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in 1755.  It was destroyed by Europeans in the middle of the XIX century, but Cixi ordered to restore the ship.  Innovations were added to the intricate decor: a marble wheel imitating a steamer.  On this ship, called the Rook of Purity and Calm, Cixi loved to dine.  From the bridges do not miss the Jade.  It was built during Qianlong of marble.  An arched passage allowed passing under the Royal Dragon Boat bridge.  Another attraction is Shizikunqiao.  This one hundred fifty meter bridge with 17 spans connects the coast with the island of Nanhu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imperial Summer Palace Yiheyuan Park in Beijing" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pavilions </h2><p>  The Emperor‚Äôs Summer Palace in Beijing was created not so much for living as for walking and unity with nature.  And in case the augusts become exhausted, light openwork pavilions were at their service.  Reviews of tourists assure that by their architectural beauties these arbors can compete with palaces.  Especially noteworthy is the pavilion of the ‚ÄúUniversal coverage of the Universe‚Äù.  It is located immediately after the descent from the arch bridge.  It offers a magnificent view with a 360-degree view.  If you have time, it is worth visiting other pavilions: Leshoutan (Joy and Longevity), Yulantan (Orchid), Baoyong (Precious Cloud), Longwangmyao (King of Dragons) and Hansyutan (Hall of Modesty). </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  The poetic names of the buildings indicate that the august persons who inhabited the summer imperial palace (Beijing, China) were not alien to spirituality.  Buddhist temples were erected on the mound on the orders of Qianlong.  The visiting card of the whole complex is by no means the official chambers of Cixi, but the beautiful Fosyange Tower.  This name is translated as "Temple of incense incense during the worship of Buddhas."  It is located at the very top of Longevity Hill (Wanshoushan).  And on the southern slope of this man-made mountain, a temple with the intricate name Da Baoen Yanshou Sy ‚Äî the Great Retribution for the grace of Longevity ‚Äî settled down.  Cixi once celebrated her birthdays here.  The thirty-meter-high pagoda of Yufent ("Jade Peak") stands out for its height.  Also, reviews are advised to visit the temples of the Radiance of Virtue (Dehondyan) and the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMind and Wisdom (Zhihoyhai). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beijing Summer Palace Yiheyuan Park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1248943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summer Palace (Beijing): how to get there </h2><p>  Do not be scared by the fact that <span>this residence</span> was suburban.  Beijing has grown to such an extent that an urban subway passes by the palace.  To get to the museum complex, you can get off at Beigongmen subway station or Xiyan.  Entrance to the territory is paid.  A full adult ticket (to the park and the palaces) costs sixty yuan.  Reviews of tourists are advised to come to the box office shortly before their opening, because there are always a lot of people (especially in the warm season).  The park and the residence are popular not only among tourists, but also among residents of Beijing.  Therefore, for excursions it is better to choose a weekday. </p><h2>  Reviews and travel tips </h2><p>  All travelers to the <span>capital of China</span> strongly recommend visiting the Summer Imperial Palace in Beijing.  How to get there - we have already explained.  In addition to the metro, numerous bus routes leave for the palace and park complex.  Moreover, they can drive up to other gates of the residence, and not just to the main ones.  To get to the "Gates of the Eastern Palaces", you should exit the subway at Xiyan Station.  Reviews warn: there is no cafe in the museum complex.  So you need to stock up with drinking water (especially in the summer heat) and lunch.  At the shopping street leading to the palace, you can buy souvenirs, as well as buy ice cream and soft drinks. </p>
